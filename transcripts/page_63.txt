I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor David Spiegel. Doctor Spiegel is the associate chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is also the director of the Stanford Center on Stress and Health.[0:00:27] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Spiegel is both a researcher and a clinician, meaning he runs a laboratory that studies the brain and the body and neural mechanisms of how the brain and body interact, and he sees patients as a psychiatrist at Stanford. His work is incredibly unique In that, it bridges mind and body, but it also has a particular focus on the clinical applications of hypnosis. As you'll learn today, hypnosis is a unique brain state in which neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience, may be heightened. And indeed, the use of clinical hypnosis by doctor Spiegel and colleagues Has been shown to improve symptoms of stress, chronic anxiety, chronic pain, and various other illnesses, including many psychiatric illnesses and even outcomes in Cancer. Today, we discuss hypnosis in the context of what's called self hypnosis to distinguish it from stage hypnosis.[0:01:20] Andrew Huberman: Many of you are probably familiar with stage hypnosis, which is really about a hypnotist getting a person to do things they would not otherwise do. In contrast, clinical hypnosis and the use of hypnosis for the treatment of various ailments of mind and body is vastly different. It involves getting people to change their brain state and to use that brain state as a portal to make adjustments in their brain and body and other aspects of their biology and psychology that benefit them. And it's been shown over and over again in studies by doctor Spiegel and colleagues that those changes can occur Extremely quickly. Now not everybody can be hypnotized as readily as the next.[0:01:58] Andrew Huberman: And so today, we also discuss a simple test developed by doctor Spiegel that can help you determine whether or not you have a high, medium, or low degree of what we call hypnotizability. Doctor Spiegel is truly an expert in this area. He has published over 480 journal articles, 170 book chapters on hypnosis, and on things like psychosocial oncology, which is the interaction of body in the treatment of cancer and cancer outcomes on stress physiology, trauma, and other aspects of psychotherapy. He's published Thirteen books. So he's truly the world expert in hypnosis and clinical applications of hypnosis for mind and body.[0:02:36] Andrew Huberman: I'm certain that in listening to today's episode, you're going to learn a Tremendous amount about how the brain and body interact, about various treatments for all sorts of common ailments of mind and body, And you are going to get access to tools, in particular, a tool that was developed by doctor Spiegel, which is the Reveri app, r e v e r I. The Reverie app is currently only available for Apple, but will soon also be available for Android. It does carry a nominal cost, But there is a 7 day free trial. If you'd like to try it, we're providing a link in the show notes. The Reverie app is special in that it is based on clinical studies and research done in the Spiegel lab at Stanford.[0:03:15] Andrew Huberman: So unlike a lot of hypnosis apps out there and resources for hypnosis, it was developed with clinical treatments in mind. Today, we also discussed the use of breathwork, and I'm very fortunate that my research lab at Stanford has been collaborating very closely with doctor Spiegel In testing and developing specific breathwork protocols to adjust mind and body for things like anxiety, improving mood, and improving sleep. Based on his incredible and unique expertise and the clarity with which doctor Spiegel communicates information, I anticipate that you will really enjoy today's episode they'll come away from it with a lot of actionable tools. Some of you might be curious what a clinical hypnosis session looks like. And for that reason, we had doctor Spiegel Hypnotize Me.[0:03:57] Andrew Huberman: A clip of that hypnosis session is going to be posted to the Huberman Lab Clips channel, which is available on YouTube. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about Science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Athletic Greens.[0:04:22] Andrew Huberman: Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational vitamin mineral probiotic needs. There is now ample evidence that probiotics can be very helpful for supporting what is called the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is an aspect of our Biology in which little gut microbiota live all along our digestive pathway and help support various aspects of our biology, including our immune system, Our metabolic system, our hormones or endocrine system, as well as what's called the gut brain axis, which is literally communication between the gut and the brain to support things like mood, motivation, and various other aspects of brain health.[0:05:12] Andrew Huberman: With Athletic Greens, I get The probiotics that I need to support a healthy gut microbiome and the vitamins and minerals tap off any deficiencies I might have based on lack of Certain foods and lack of certain nutrients in my diet. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you Five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin d three k two. There's a lot of evidence now that vitamin d three is critically important for various aspects of immediate and long term health. And while many people get enough vitamin d three, many people do not.[0:05:46] Andrew Huberman: So the year's supply of vitamin d three Ought to be very useful for many people, and k two has been shown to be important for calcium regulation, various aspects of metabolic health, and so forth. Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens and get that special offer, the 5 free travel packs and year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2, go to athletic greens.com/ Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics. Nootropic is a smart drug.[0:06:12] Andrew Huberman: And personally, I'm not a big fan of the concept of a smart drug, at least not the way that most people talk about smart drugs or nootropics for the following reason. Being smart involves various things. There is creativity. There's focus. There's task switching and so on.[0:06:28] Andrew Huberman: And each one of those involves different operations in the brain, different neural circuits, different neurochemicals have to be deployed In order for us to, for instance, be very focused or for us to be very creative or for us to be able to switch tasks easily, Thesis understands this, and for that reason, they've developed custom nootropics that are aimed at getting your brain and body into particular states for particular types of work or physical activity. In order to accomplish that, they created unique blends of high quality ingredients, And each of those blends is designed to get your brain and body into a particular mode such as focus, clarity, or motivation. I've been using Thesis Nootropix for over 6 months now, And I have to say it's been a total game changer and very unique from the experience of using sort of what I call catch all nootropics. So with these, it's really directed toward particular brain body states. I should also mention that they tailor those custom blends to you.[0:07:21] Andrew Huberman: So by taking a quiz on their site, they will tailor the blend to you and your specific needs and the things you don't want. So if you wanna try your own personalized nootropic starter kit, you Go online to take thesis.com/huberman. You'll take a 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month. And then based on the outcomes with those, they can update your formulations for you. That's takethesis.com/huberman and use the code Huberman at checkout to get 10% off your 1st box.[0:07:47] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that I believe are of the utmost quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about the design of ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses was created with performance in mind. There are a number of things about ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses that I particularly like. First of all, they're extremely lightweight.[0:08:08] Andrew Huberman: You basically forget that you're wearing them. Second of all, you can wear them for work, for going out to dinner, etcetera, they have great aesthetics, so you can wear them anywhere, but also for exercise. You can wear them when running or cycling. And even if you get sweaty, They're designed so that they don't slip off your face. Another terrific feature of ROKA Eyeglasses and Sunglasses is that they were designed with the biology of the visual system in mind.[0:08:29] Andrew Huberman: We all have the experience of being in a shaded area and then going to a bright area. It takes some time for your eyes to adjust or to adapt. Many sunglasses make it hard to see as you move from one environment the next. And therefore, you have to take on and off your sunglasses. With ROKA sunglasses, you don't have to do that.[0:08:44] Andrew Huberman: You don't even notice the transitions between those bright areas and those dimmer areas. So you can wear them anywhere, anytime. And, again, most of the time, you don't even realize that they're on your face. If you'd like to try ROKA Eyeglasses and Sunglasses, Go to roka.com. That's roka.com, and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order.[0:09:01] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's rokarokadot com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. And now for my discussion with doctor David Spiegel. David, thank you so much for being here.[0:09:11] Dr. David Spiegel: Andrew, my pleasure.[0:09:13] Andrew Huberman: Can you tell us what is hypnosis?[0:09:18] Dr. David Spiegel: Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention. It's something like looking through the telephoto lens of a camera in consciousness. What you see, you see with great detail, but devoid of context. If you've had the experience of getting so caught up in a good movie that you forget you're watching a movie and enter the imagined world, you're part of the movie, not part of the audience, You're experiencing it. You're not evaluating it.[0:09:41] Dr. David Spiegel: That's a hypnotic like experience that many people have in their everyday lives.[0:09:46] Andrew Huberman: So is any experience that really draws us in hypnotic in that sense? Or, Let me give a different, example. If I'm watching a sports game and I'm really wrapped up in the game, but I'm also in touch how it makes me feel in my body, kind of registering, you know, the excitement or the anticipation. Is that a state of hypnosis also? Because you mentioned there's kind of an, a narrowing of context Right.[0:10:14] Andrew Huberman: But a kinda losing of the self, or is it do I have that right?[0:10:18] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. It is true that you're to the extent that your somatic your body experience is a part of this this Sport event that you're engaged with, I'd say that is a self altering hypnotic experience. If your physical reactions are distracting you or, make you think about something else, that's when, it's it's less hypnotic like and more just one of a series of experiences.[0:10:44] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So I have to ask, how did you get into this business of hypnosis? Because, I think for most people, when they hear hypnosis or they think about Hypnosis, they think of stage hypnosis.[0:10:57] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:10:57] Andrew Huberman: I think of somebody with a pendant going back and forth or people up on a stage Behaving abnormally for the entertainment of others. Yeah. How did you get into hypnosis, as an interest, as a practice? And if you would, could you contrast the sort of hypnosis that you do in the clinical setting with the sort of hypnosis that a stage hypnotist does?[0:11:22] Dr. David Spiegel: Sure. Well, it is something of a genetic illness in my family. Both of my parents were psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, And they told me I was free to be any kind of psychiatrist I wanted to be, so here I am. My father, was Training to be a psychoanalyst in 1943, and, he ran into a Viennese refugee who Couldn't serve in the army, but who had studied hypnosis. And, actually, it would interest you doing your ophthalmological research.[0:11:58] Dr. David Spiegel: He had a, smallpox scar right in the middle of his forehead, and he did forensic examinations. And he noticed that some of the prisoners We'd focus on that spot on his forehead and then close their eyes and seem to go to sleep, but they were in some altered state. So he got interested in hypnosis. He used it forensically. His name was Gustav von Aschaffenburg.[0:12:21] Dr. David Spiegel: And, he offered to teach young psychiatrists how to use hypnosis when they went off in into the war. And so he trained my father, and he my father got off the analytic couch and asked you know, the the analyst mentioned it to him. That's how he found out about it. And my father said, did I say something wrong in analysis? Why is he talking to me?[0:12:42] Dr. David Spiegel: No. And, he found it very useful in helping soldiers who had Acute pain when they were wounded and helping people with convergent post traumatic stress disorders. And when he came back, he went back to his training, but, he still was sort of interested in it, and he he had his one of his supervisors was Frieder von Reichmann, who was a very famous psychoanalyst. And he he said that he had been told to stop doing hypnosis because it would ruin his reputation as an analyst. And she said to him, what are you so worried about your reputation for?[0:13:15] Dr. David Spiegel: You're gonna give a course at the institute in hypnosis, and I know you're gonna do it because I'm gonna take it. So he was teaching Frieder von Reichman Hypnosis. And he just kept doing it. And after a while, he discovered that he was getting better results with a few sessions of hypnosis than he was with Daily psychoanalysis with his patients, and so he switched his his practice. And so the dinner table conversations were pretty interesting.[0:13:39] Dr. David Spiegel: Occasionally, when he was making a movie of a patient, I would get to watch that. And so when I, went to medical school, I figured I'll take the course. It was Tom Hackett, who was the chair of psychiatry at Mass General, was teaching it. It was a very interesting course. And the day that converted me was, I was doing my rotation at Children's Hospital in Boston, and the nurse is telling me, Spiegel, your next patient is an asthmatic in room 437 or something.[0:14:07] Dr. David Spiegel: I'm just following the sound of the wheezes down the hall. I go in the room. There's this 16 year old girl, knuckles white, bolt upright in bed, struggling for breath. You can hear the wheezing. She twice had subcutaneous epinephrine.[0:14:18] Dr. David Spiegel: Didn't work. They were thinking about general anesthesia and starting her on steroids. And her mother's there, crying. And, I said, I don't know what else to do. So I said, you wanna learn a breathing exercise?[0:14:30] Dr. David Spiegel: And she nods. And, I got her hypnotized, and then I realized we hadn't gotten the asthma in the course yet. So I made up something very complex. I said, each breath you take will be a little deeper and a little easier. And within 5 minutes, she's lying back in bed.[0:14:44] Dr. David Spiegel: Her knuckles aren't white. She's not wheezing. Her mother stopped crying. The nurse ran out of the room, And the intern my intern comes to find me, and I figured he's gonna pat me on the back and say, nice job, Spiegel. He said the nurse has filed a complaint with with a nursing supervisor that you violated a Massachusetts law by hypnotizing a minor without parental consent.[0:15:03] Dr. David Spiegel: And I thought, you know, oh, that's nice. You know? I doubt there is a law like this. So the intern says you're gonna have to stop doing this with her. And I said, why?[0:15:13] Dr. David Spiegel: You said it's dangerous. I said, you're gonna give her general anesthesia and put her on steroids and talking to her is dangerous? You know? Said, well, you have to do it. And I said, I'll tell you what.[0:15:22] Dr. David Spiegel: Take me off the case if you want, but I'm not gonna tell a patient of mine anything I know is not true. So there was a battle over the weekend about what to do, and the the intern, the chief resident attending were all arguing about it. And on Monday, they came back with a radical idea. They said, let's ask the patient. I don't think that it ever been done at Children's Hospital before.[0:15:43] Dr. David Spiegel: And she said, oh, I like this. You know, she'd been hospitalized every month for 3 months since status asthmaticus. She did a one subsequent hospitalization, but after that, went on to study to be a respiratory therapist. And I thought that anything that can help a patient that much violate a nonexistent Massachusetts law, frustrate the nursing supervisor, had to be worth looking into. So I just kept doing it.[0:16:04] Dr. David Spiegel: I discovered that there were you know, all of my classmates in medical school had just read the new issue of the New England Journal and had some new medication to suggest. And I would you know, surgeons would say, look. If you can help this guy with his pain or his anxiety, anything above the neck, that's yours. Do it, Spiegel. So, you know, I was having fun and being able to learn how to help people in a way that just otherwise was not being done.[0:16:28] Dr. David Spiegel: And So it got me thinking about the fact that, you know, we're born with this brain, but we don't have a user's manual for it, and we don't use it nearly as well as we can. And that's something your research is all about 2. And and so I thought I wanna I wanna understand this better, and I wanna see what we can do. Stage hypnotists drive me nuts. You know, they they make fools out of people.[0:16:50] Dr. David Spiegel: There was 1, my my this is a case my father was involved. He got a call from he was at Columbia. He a call. Spiegel, you gotta come see this woman. She's in the ER, and she's, in some kind of weird upset state that, happened, and it turned out she'd been on the show with a stage hypnotist, who and what they do, by the way, is they they cycle around.[0:17:12] Dr. David Spiegel: You know, they have a the beginning of the show, they don't just grab somebody and say, we're doing this. They get a bunch of people up. They do what amounts to hypnotizability testing to see if peep and they they get the ones who are the most hypnotizable. So she was the one. And he said, there's now, a little bird in your hand, and you're gonna play with the bird.[0:17:32] Dr. David Spiegel: And she starts to cry and scream, and, he just gets her off the stage because it's very upsetting. And she's wandering around New York City in the middle of the night Dissociated and brought to Columbia, and that's where my father saw her. She was still in a kind of uncomfortable trance like state. And it turned out That she was the trophy wife of a very wealthy guy, and she felt like a bird in a gilded cage. And so to her, that image just Triggered all of this sense of dissatisfaction, discomfort, fear about her life, and he was able to get her reoriented and talk they were about what she was gonna do with their life.[0:18:09] Dr. David Spiegel: But I don't like stage hypnosis. You're making fools out of people, and you're using the fact and that's what scares people about Hypnosis. They think you're losing control. You're gaining control. Self hypnosis is a way of enhancing your control over your mind and your body.[0:18:24] Dr. David Spiegel: It can work very well. But because it gives you a kind of cognitive flexibility, you're able to shift sets very easily. To give up judging and evaluating the way you usually do and see something from a different point of view, that's a great therapeutic opportunity. But if misused, it could be a danger too, and that's what scares people about it. It's it is that very ability to suspend critical judgment and just have an experience and see what happens.[0:18:51] Dr. David Spiegel: That can be a great therapeutic opportunity, but if somebody's misusing it, it can be a way to harm people. And, you know, there are plenty of examples of people Having fantasies imposed on them that they come to think are realities. It's not unusual these days. So, it's it's an ability that If people learn to recognize and understand it, it can be a tremendous therapeutic tool.[0:19:14] Andrew Huberman: I've been stage hypnotized, And I've been clinically hypnotized many times through self hypnosis app. We'll talk about later, and And then I know we have plans for you to hypnotize me today. You've done it once before, and I'm very hypnotizable as we both know.[0:19:34] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:19:35] Andrew Huberman: We'll talk about how one can gauge their hypnotizability. Sure. But the stage hypnosis was interesting. This was in college. You know, they Brought someone out to the dormitory, and I I recall being one of the people that was selected Mhmm.[0:19:52] Andrew Huberman: And, and engaging in very bizarre behavior. Right? It wasn't thoroughly embarrassing, but it was pretty embarrassing. And then being sent off the stage, and as I was exiting, suddenly screaming something out because he had Planted a suggestion of some sort. And then I was told to look in my pocket, and there was a, like, a, I think, a torn up dollar bill.[0:20:14] Andrew Huberman: There were a bunch of things that I have vague recollection of, But it raises a set of questions that really boil down to you know, As a biologist, I always think that, you know, there's no there's no events in the brain. There are there are processes. And so hypnosis, we know, has an induction, Then one is hypnotized, I imagine, and then it sounds like this woman and this example of the the bird, and being in Being distraught in New York City is a failure to exit the hip hypnotic state. Do we know what sorts of brain areas are active During the induction, the let's call it the deep hypnosis, and then what's shutting off or changing as people exit hypnosis?[0:20:59] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. Yes. We do. We've studied that. We've been very interested in that.[0:21:02] Dr. David Spiegel: And so we, did a study where we selected highly and Non hypnotizable people, so we could do the comparison and then hypnotize them in the functional MRI scanner. And we found Three things characterize the entry into the hypnotic state. The first is turning down activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. So the DACC is in the central front middle part of the brain as you you well know, and it's it's part of what we call the salience network. It's a a conflict detector.[0:21:35] Dr. David Spiegel: So if you're, you know, engaged in work and you hear a loud noise that you think might be a gunshot, That's your anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey. Wait a minute. There's a potential danger over there. You better pay attention to it. So it's a It compares what you're doing with what else is going on and helps you decide what to do.[0:21:53] Dr. David Spiegel: And as you can imagine, turning down activity in that region make it less likely that you'll be distracted and pulled out of whatever you're in. And in another study, we found that highly hypnotizable people even without billing being hypnotized have more functional connectivity between the DACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, And the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, so which is part of the a key region in the executive control network. So when you're engaging in tasks, you're Enacting a plan, you're writing a paper, you're doing whatever you're doing. That's the the prefrontal cortex is doing that. And so if that is Coordinated.[0:22:31] Dr. David Spiegel: We found more functional, connectivity. So when one is up, the other's up. When one is down, the other's down. That coordination Implies that the brain is saying, okay. Go ahead.[0:22:42] Dr. David Spiegel: I know what you're doing. Carry out that plan, and don't worry about other possibilities. So 2 other things happen when people are hypnotized. 1 is that that DLPFC has higher functional connectivity with the insula. Another part of the salience network, it's a part of the mind body control system sensitive to what's happening in the body.[0:23:01] Dr. David Spiegel: It's part of the pain network as well, But it's also a region of the brain where you can control things in your body that you wouldn't think you could. For example, We did a study years ago where we took people, who were highly hypnotizable, hypnotized them and told them to we went on an imaginary culinary tour. So, we would they would eat their favorite foods, and we found that they increased their gastric acid secretion, like, by 87%. So their Stomach was acting as though it was about to get I mean, there was 1 woman. It was so vivid for her that halfway through, she said, let's stop.[0:23:36] Dr. David Spiegel: I'm full, You know, eating these amazing never eat haven't never eaten that.[0:23:40] Andrew Huberman: Actual no. Incredible.[0:23:42] Dr. David Spiegel: And then we got them to relax and think of anything but food or drink. And we got, like, a 40% decrease in gastric acid secretions. So they could and that was DLPFC through the insula Telling the stomach you're getting food or you're not getting food. And even we injected them with pentagastrine, which triggers gastric acid release. And even then in the hypnosis condition, they had a 19% reduction in gastric acid.[0:24:07] Dr. David Spiegel: So the brain has this amazing ability control what's going on in the body in ways that we don't think we have ability to control. That's just one example. So that's the DLPFC Insulin connection. The third thing that happens, and this relates to what you did on the stage, is you have inverse functional connectivity between the DLPFC And the posterior cingulate cortex. The posterior cingulate, is part of the default mode network.[0:24:34] Dr. David Spiegel: It's in the back of the brain, and it's it's an an area whose activity goes down, for example, in meditators. And in meditation, you're supposed to be selfless. Supposed to the self is an illusion. You're supposed to let it dissolve and just experience things. And when you're doing that, that posterior thing that is decreasing in activity.[0:24:52] Dr. David Spiegel: The inverse connection is I'm doing something, but I'm not thinking about what it means for me. I may not even remember much of it. If I do, I don't care that much about it, and so that is part of the dissociation that occurs with hypnosis. So it's how you put things outside of conscious awareness, and don't worry about what it means. It also adds to cognitive flexibility.[0:25:14] Dr. David Spiegel: You know, if you're thinking, Well, people like me don't usually do this. That may inhibit you from enacting a new form of psychotherapy, for example, that you've never done before. But if you're having this decreased activity in the part of your brain that reflects on what it means, you're more likely to be Cognitively flexible and willing to give it a try, and that's one of the therapeutic advantages of hypnosis as well.[0:25:38] Andrew Huberman: Fascinating. And it's really, I'm gonna put, and embarrass you here a little bit, in a positive sense. It's, your laboratory is really the the one that's pioneered brain imaging of hypnotic states, and, it it sounds like it. That's my understanding. Is that is that correct?[0:25:53] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. I mean, there are other people who've done excellent research too. Sure. But Pierre Rainville in Montreal and several other People, but we're one of the leading labs in in neuroimaging of hypnosis.[0:26:04] Andrew Huberman: I have to ask about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I get a lot of, questions about this, and I think a lot of people just struggle with holding attention nowadays because of, You know, interference with phones and devices, and and I of course, there is a lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD out there. But the way that you describe The, dorsal to interior cingulate and the salience network and this conflict detector of, you know, am I focusing on something or am I Splitting my attention. How distractible am I? Seems to relate to some extent to activity in the dorsal, interocimulate cortex.[0:26:40] Andrew Huberman: Do people with ADHD display disruptions in elements of these networks, and, has hypnosis ever been used to, or self hypnosis, I should be, to distinguish from stage hypnosis. Clinical and self hypnosis has been used To enhance people's ability to focus and hold attention, because that's such a built in component of the hypnotic state.[0:27:04] Dr. David Spiegel: It it's a great question. There are there's sort of 2 ways to think about it. In terms of enhancing focus, yes, it has been Very helpful, in teaching people to just prepare your mind to narrow in and focus on something. And when, you know, when you're really engaged in reading something or you're writing a I mean, I'll have that sometimes I'm thinking, oh god. I I have to do this for another hour.[0:27:25] Dr. David Spiegel: Other times, an hour will go by and I'll think, hey. Great. Because when you're In the it feels game like too. You know? You're just assembling the parts of the puzzle and putting them together.[0:27:35] Dr. David Spiegel: It's fun. You just get absorbed. That, for me, that's a hypnotic like When I'm having trouble, when I'm struggling, sometimes doing things like self hypnosis can help. I'm not an expert on ADHD. My impression is that you're right that these are people who are constantly distracted and and rather rigid.[0:27:53] Dr. David Spiegel: The other part of it they're easily distractable. They're very upset when they get distracted, and they're rather rigid in what they wanna attend to and what they can't, I think, as a way of controlling this Distractability, frankly. I my guess is that many people with ADHD would not be that hypnotizable, but I haven't I haven't studied it. So, it it it's possible that for some people with that disorder, training in self hypnosis might help, but we'd have to see how hypnotizable they were and take it from there.[0:28:22] Andrew Huberman: I wanna return to some of the underlying neural networks and the, clinical applications, but, What sorts of, things aside from the asthma, have you used Hypnosis successfully for or have others used clinical hypnosis, for and are there any particular areas of of psychiatric challenges or illnesses, I guess they're called, that are particularly amenable to hypnotic treatment. Yes.[0:28:56] Dr. David Spiegel: There are. Hypnosis is very good as a problem focused, treatment. It's really it's the oldest Western conception of a psychotherapy, and it can be used for specific problems in a way that's very helpful. We found it very helpful for stress reduction, for helping people deal. We're all dealing with stress these days, and it's helpful.[0:29:18] Dr. David Spiegel: That mind body connection is very helpful because, Part of the problem with stress is your perception. You mentioned it earlier in a sort of good sense. You're at a, you know, a football game or something, and You feel the physical reaction. That can be a reinforcing thing. Wow.[0:29:34] Dr. David Spiegel: This is exciting. Let's do it. It can also be very distracting. So You're worried about getting COVID or you're worried about, some other physical problem you have and you you notice it in your body. Your body tenses up.[0:29:48] Dr. David Spiegel: You start to sweat. The sympathetic nervous system goes. Your heart rate goes up. And when you notice that, you think, oh god. This is really bad.[0:29:56] Dr. David Spiegel: And then you feel worse. So it's like a snowball rolling downhill, and and then you feel worse and then your body gets worse. Hypnosis can be very helpful in Dissociating somatic reaction from psychological reaction. So we teach people to imagine their body floating somewhere and comfortable like a bath, a lake, a hot tub, or floating in space, and then picture the problem that they're that's stressing them On an imaginary screen with the rule that no matter what you see on the screen, you keep your body comfortable. So at this point, you can't you still can't control the stress, but you can control your physical reaction to it, and that starts you feeling more in control.[0:30:33] Dr. David Spiegel: At least there's 1 thing I can manage. And then you can use it to think through or visualize through One thing you might do about that stressor. So hypnosis is very helpful in controlling mind body interaction in relation to stress. It's very helpful for people to get to sleep. We're having a lot of fun with that.[0:30:50] Dr. David Spiegel: I I've I'm getting emails From people who said, you know, I haven't slept right in 15 years, and now for the first time, you know, I'm listening to your app, and I can sleep at night. You'll wake up more. But a matte picture, whatever you're thinking about or worrying about on that imaginary screen while your body is floating. So watch your own movie, But keep your body floating, and many people can use that to get back to sleep.[0:31:24] Andrew Huberman: I've been using the self hypnosis for sleep for a long time, And now the Reverie app, and I'll we'll talk about our relationship to the Reverie app and its uses. I find it incredibly useful for falling back asleep in the middle of the night. And it raises a a question, I've found, and I think I understand this correctly, that one can Do self hypnosis during the daytime, and then if there's an issue that comes up later like, so for instance, do self hypnosis for stress reduction Away from the stressful event to prepare 1 to deal with stress better[0:31:59] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:31:59] Andrew Huberman: Or do, hypnosis for improving the return to sleep. And that can be done when you actually wanna go to sleep, but it's it's a kind of a training up of these networks. Right?[0:32:09] Dr. David Spiegel: That's right.[0:32:10] Andrew Huberman: Is so is there evidence that these Brain networks actually form stronger, connections when people do self hypnosis over time.[0:32:20] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. Well, there's a rule in neurobiology, as you know, that neurons that fire together wire together.[0:32:25] Andrew Huberman: My friend, Carla Schatz.[0:32:26] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. Carla Schatz.[0:32:27] Andrew Huberman: Not Donald Hebb, by the way. I keep trying to there's a there's a There's a widespread myth in the world that, is unfortunately all over the Internet, which is that the word fire together, wire together was said by The psychologist Donald Hebb Donald Hebb did many important things, but it is the neurobiologist, Carlo Schatz[0:32:44] Dr. David Spiegel: That's exactly[0:32:45] Andrew Huberman: You're right. Yes. Is at Stanford, but was also at Berkeley and Harvard.[0:32:48] Dr. David Spiegel: So That's right.[0:32:48] Andrew Huberman: Decent schools. That but is at, Stanford, Yeah. Who said fire together, wire together, and so she deserves the Right. The credit for that statement. Yeah.[0:32:58] Andrew Huberman: So with repeated use of self hypnosis, One could imagine that these networks are getting stronger.[0:33:06] Dr. David Spiegel: I I would I would think so. We don't have evidence of that yet, but, you know, Long term potentiation provides a pathway, and you've described them on your program a number of times, that Allow for repeated activation of a network to actually build new connections that that work. And at the least, even from a learning and memory point of view, you know, our, You know, memory is all a network of associations. That's how we remember things. And, you know, the the example I'd like to give is you go back to your grade school And and you see these little tiny lockers and and, you know, the size is all wrong, and you suddenly have a flood of memories that you you know, were obviously stored there, but you just didn't think So context and association is what memory is about.[0:33:52] Dr. David Spiegel: If you start to acquire memories about a problem so one thing we use Hypnosis for is treating phobias, for example. And the problem with people who have phobias, like airplane phobias or, you know, crossing a bridge or being up high, Is that the more they avoid it, the more the only source of associations and memories is their fear. They don't have any good experiences with it because they avoid it. Know, it's like get back on the horse after you fall off kind of thing. And and with hypnosis, if you can start people able to manage their anxiety enough that they can have more of wider array of experiences, they start to have a network of associations That isn't so negative and may even be positive.[0:34:34] Andrew Huberman: So it's almost like a sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask. It's it's almost like a, exposure therapy done in the mind. Yeah. I mean, it's always in the mind. I mean, even exposure to it.[0:34:45] Andrew Huberman: If I have a snake phobia, which I I don't I I don't like snakes, but I don't think it qualifies as a full blown phobia. I have a healthy fear of snakes. Yeah. But if let's say I had a snake phobia, it the typical approach in, would be cognitive behavioral approaches, right, would be to show a picture of a snake or then a rubber snake, then a real snake. Eventually, the person is, you know, holding a boa constrictor or something like that.[0:35:10] Andrew Huberman: Right. With with that's all in the mind because it's all translated into nervous system signals. But with hypnosis, Sounds like you can give a a number of positive experiences without having to use any props, without having to bring any animals into Right. I drive someone across a bridge. Is that right?[0:35:26] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. I had a woman who was a very successful businesswoman, high level in a corporation. I had a terrible dog phobia. And, so I had her imagine that somebody brought in the dog to the room. And I said, what are you doing?[0:35:39] Dr. David Spiegel: And you could see her getting tense. And she said, well, I'm waiting to see what the dog does. And I said, if somebody who works for you comes into your office, would you freeze and wait to see what they did? And she said, of course not, and I tell him what to do. You know?[0:35:54] Dr. David Spiegel: And I said, well, so you're immobilizing yourself. The power isn't with the dog. It's with you. So imagine what you might do to engage the dog and and help control the situation. And she said thanks.[0:36:05] Dr. David Spiegel: And and This reminds me of one one of my favorite stories about hypnosis that my father was seeing a woman in who lived in midtown Manhattan and had a horrible dog phobia. You know? She'd drop Things she'd spill coffee, you know, if she saw a dog. She would time her trips to the store when she thought it was least likely that people would be walking dogs.[0:36:23] Andrew Huberman: Now that it be possible[0:36:24] Dr. David Spiegel: if everyone[0:36:25] Andrew Huberman: if it's like a it's like a fleet of French bulldogs Right. Taking over New York City.[0:36:30] Dr. David Spiegel: So, he taught her to think of dog as a friend, have a neighbor who had a dog, Bring the dog over, but hold the dog by the collar and make sure and gradually, she was able to stroke the dog and say dog friend and distinguish between wild and tame animals. Are animals. You should be afraid of this, isn't so she seemed to be doing better. He called back about 3 months later and asked for her And, I said, well, who's calling the sunset? And he said, doctor Spiegel.[0:36:58] Dr. David Spiegel: And the boy said, that's weird. And my father said, what's weird? He said, Spiegel's in heat. She she had bought a dog I love it. And named it spiel.[0:37:08] Dr. David Spiegel: Talk about transfer insulate.[0:37:10] Andrew Huberman: But but it really speaks to the power of this, And it it brings me back to this, issue. So what is different about What your father did in that case, with this, with this woman in terms of what happened in hypnosis that allowed her to go from being completely terrified of dogs to owning a dog and naming it after your father, which I find amusing. But that's different than just the 2 of them sitting down and talking about it. Right? You know, in therapy, their narrative is A huge component.[0:37:47] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:37:47] Andrew Huberman: And in hypnosis, narrative is a huge component.[0:37:49] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:37:50] Andrew Huberman: So it must be that the brain state is what is really different because, we'll talk about trauma in a in a few minutes, but, you know, I think people who have trauma or phobias certainly Could have a conversation about it. They some of them might freeze up. Some of them might lose their articulation and so forth. But what is different About that state that combines with narrative, you think, to allow these underlying neural networks to to engage or to change. Because I find this so fascinating because we're every attempt at at, dealing with stress or phobia in the clinical setting involves some discussion about what it is.[0:38:29] Andrew Huberman: Yes. But here, we're not talking about any medication being introduced, at least not in these particular circumstances. Right. So I I just I I realized it's kind of an obvious question. Like, it has to be some difference in brain activity, but I find that to be incredible.[0:38:44] Andrew Huberman: The the control variable there is The brain state. It's not what's spoken.[0:38:51] Dr. David Spiegel: You're raising a couple of very important issues, Andrew. I you know, we we talked earlier about with systematic desensitization where you, you know, sort of lay out a hierarchy of things and do it 1 at a time. I think of this as unsystematic desensitization because you're changing mental states. And if and I think there's more and more evidence That mental state change itself has therapeutic potential. We're seeing that with ketamine treating depression, a dissociogenic drug.[0:39:20] Dr. David Spiegel: We see it we know it every morning when we wake up, that problem. You know, you made the mistake of reading an SD email at 11 PM. You didn't know what to do. You wake up in the morning, you think, oh, that idiot. Yeah.[0:39:30] Dr. David Spiegel: Here's what I'm gonna do. You know? So just changing mental state itself has therapeutic potential. And I think we underestimate our ability to regulate and and change responses, to be cognitively, Emotionally and somatically flexible. And so we do things, you're right, that follow similar principles of facing a problem, seeing it from a different point of view.[0:39:53] Dr. David Spiegel: And you've done a really nice podcast on trauma and stress and how you have to expose yourself to it, not avoid it as we talked about before, And then find some way to reconnect to it, to substitute something that can make you feel good rather than bad, so that you activate other centers of the brain like Miesle Lendlyk reward system. And so I do that with hypnosis, and you can do it much faster. People don't think they can, but they can. If you're having right now that physical experience, I'm thinking about this, but I'm not feeling as bad As I used to, that can be a powerful thing, and you can do it with hypnosis. So I had a a woman came to see me who had Suffered an attempted rape.[0:40:36] Dr. David Spiegel: It was getting dark. She was coming back from the grocery store, and this guy grabs her and wants to get her up into her apartment. It's outside her apartment. And She starts fighting with him, and she winds up with a Basler skull fracture. He runs away.[0:40:51] Dr. David Spiegel: The cops come. Since she hadn't been raped, they left. They weren't interested, and she wanted to use hypnosis to get a better image of what this guy looked like, which is a painful, upsetting thing. So She was quite hypnotizable. I got her floating.[0:41:04] Dr. David Spiegel: I say you're safe and comfortable now. Nothing can happen that will harm your body. But on on the left side of the screen, I want you to picture This guy and his approaching and what's happening. And she said, I really the light was it was getting dark. I really can't see much of his facial features, But I do recognize something I hadn't allowed myself to remember.[0:41:23] Dr. David Spiegel: If he gets me upstairs, he doesn't just wanna rape me. He's gonna kill me. And so in some ways, what she was seeing was even worse. So, you know, you're thinking good, Spiegel. You made her even more frightened than she was before.[0:41:36] Dr. David Spiegel: But as you had pointed out in your PTSD stress lecture, you've got to confront the trauma to to restructure your understanding of it. So on the other side of the screen, I had her picture, what what are you doing to protect yourself? And everybody in a trauma situation engages in some strategy of self protection. You know? That's the Salience Network kicking in.[0:42:01] Dr. David Spiegel: And, she said, you know what? He's surprised that I'm fighting that hard. He didn't think I would. And so she realized, on the one hand, that it was even worse than she thought it was, but on the other hand, that she actually probably saved her life. And so it was a way of helping her experience of the trauma and make it more tolerable.[0:42:20] Dr. David Spiegel: So that helped with her. She didn't she she couldn't identify the guy, But it helped her restructure and understand her experience. And that's something that you can do in just talking straight out psychotherapy, But sometimes, you can do it a hell of a lot faster and more efficiently using hypnosis. And there is 1 randomized trial out of Israel It shows that adding hypnosis to PTSD treatment actually improves outcome. So, it it's it's a way of Accomplishing things that we understand in the broader psychotherapy world, but much more quickly and and sometimes effectively.[0:42:58] Andrew Huberman: You know, it sounds like going into somewhat into the state that one is trying to deal with, but then dissociating from that state is key. I could imagine, and, you know, I've been open about this on various podcasts. I've I've, done a lot of, an analysis over the years. So in but in I've experienced myself that in in those sessions, depending on how I show up to them, I might just get in kind of a laundry list of what happened as opposed to actually feeling anything around what happened.[0:43:25] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:43:26] Andrew Huberman: And I think people probably vary in the extent to which they can drop into feeling states, and it can depend on The day, it can be depend on how well, you slept the night before and so on.[0:43:36] Dr. David Spiegel: There's there's one thing I might add, Andrew, and that is, You know, there's a notion delayed Gordon Bauer. He we just had a memorial for Gordon, at Stanford. He died about a year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologists or one of the founders of cognitive psychology, at Stanford and a and a great pitcher. He almost he almost became a major league pitcher, but he decided to go to grad instead, and I'm I'm glad he did.[0:44:00] Dr. David Spiegel: But Gordon, helped establish the concept of state dependent memory that when you're in a certain mental state, You enhance your ability to remember things about it, and the sort of the bad example of that is the drunk who hides the bottle and can't remember where he put it until he gets drunk again. He's in that same Mental state. People go into dissociative states, when they're traumatized. So in a way, hypnosis is helping them Remember and deal with the memories better because they're more in the mental state that is more like what happened. And most rape victims will tell you, was floating above my body feeling sorry for the woman being assaulted below.[0:44:39] Dr. David Spiegel: People in traumatic episodes, they just Say, you know, I blank out. I don't know what's happening. I'm on autopilot, and that's a kind of self hypnotic state. So when you use hypnosis to help them deal with a traumatic memory, You're making the state they're in right there in your office with you more congruent to the state they were likely in when the trauma happened. And I think that is part of what helps facilitate treatment of trauma related disorders.[0:45:04] Andrew Huberman: I see. So that Makes me have to ask every question I have to ask because I really feel it as almost a compulsion. Then if dissociation during a traumatic episode is It's a part of the adaptive strategy[0:45:19] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:45:19] Andrew Huberman: But it creates certain issues. It creates problems. Right? Why would something like Ketamine, which creates a dissociative state, be useful for the treatment of trauma? This is what I'm I'm confused about these days because, our colleague, Karl Deisseroth, who's also been on this podcast and and and coworkers have figured out, okay.[0:45:40] Andrew Huberman: There's these layer 1 networks in court in the neocortex, and those are involved in the associate state, and so we're trying to gain some understanding of how ketamine works at a neuro level.[0:45:48] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[0:45:49] Andrew Huberman: It does seem, as if for certain populations, it's a can be a useful treatment. I don't know. I've never tried it. I don't know what the current status of that is, but it is legal. It is allowed, at least, in it's FDA approved, and it's in use.[0:46:03] Andrew Huberman: Why would dissociate states be useful if this If some element of dissociation is what, gave rise to the trauma trauma memory in the 1st place.[0:46:13] Dr. David Spiegel: Well, yeah. And Carl had a brilliant paper in Nature where he It was from from rats to humans in 1 paper, and he showed that there's this rhythmic discharge in the retrosplenial region That is associated that is triggered by ketamine and and the rats actually showed dissociative like behavior in that they would touch A hot pad that they ordinarily wouldn't and they didn't seem to have much pain in their paw. And he then had a a a male subject who Had, implanted electrodes. Human. A human subject.[0:46:44] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. Human subject. And and, the electrodes had picked up this rhythmic Activity. And when they did, he would report being in a dissociative state. And his description was, it's like being a pilot of an airplane, and then I felt myself walking out of the cockpit, and the plane was still flying.[0:47:01] Andrew Huberman: And It sounds terrifying to me. It sounds terrifying. I wanna be in my[0:47:06] Dr. David Spiegel: body most[0:47:06] Andrew Huberman: of the time, you know.[0:47:08] Dr. David Spiegel: That's right. But the the point is, in a way, the principle, Andrew, is like the principle you said that you need to reconfron A traumatic situation before you can modulate your associations to it. So you have to accept it, accept the arousal, Put some boundaries around it and then figure out how you can approach that problem or how you did approach that problem from a different point of view. So it does not surprise in fact, we've studied, people who dissociated during the Loma Prieta earthquake And the Oakland Berkeley firestorm.[0:47:40] Andrew Huberman: I remember both those well. Yeah. Earthquakes follow me, and then I moved south and then the Northridge.[0:47:44] Dr. David Spiegel: I'm gonna keep So there'll[0:47:45] Andrew Huberman: be one this afternoon.[0:47:48] Dr. David Spiegel: I'm starting to dissociate, Andrew. So, dissociation does compartmentalize experience. But that means from the point of view of treating trauma, it it's an it's an inhibition. You don't engage it. It's like it happened over there.[0:48:03] Dr. David Spiegel: And I think what happens is that people are sometimes too good at being able to separate themselves from the recollection. So it's in there somewhere. It doesn't It's out of sight, but it's not out of mind. It's having effects on you, but you can't deal with it. You can't reprocess it.[0:48:17] Dr. David Spiegel: So I do think one reason ketamine might work Is, that in fact, it allows you to keep to reapproach the dissociative experience in a way that you can then start to think about and do something about it and just the fact you can turn it on and off. And that's also where hip self hypnosis is so helpful. It's not something that just comes over you and happens to you. It's something you can make happen. You can control it.[0:48:42] Dr. David Spiegel: You can do something with it, so you feel less helpless and out of control. The essence of trauma is helplessness. It's not fear. It's not pain. It's helplessness.[0:48:50] Dr. David Spiegel: You become an object. You become just your body. You don't control what's going on, and we're not used You know, you and I have discussed this, this this breathing paper on anticipation of breathing, and it's not whether you breathe, inhale, or exhale or hold your breath. It's that if you think you can inhale and you can't, that is really upsetting, understandably. And so it's the the issue is control.[0:49:15] Dr. David Spiegel: And hypnosis, which has this terrible reputation of taking away control, is actually a superb way of enhancing your control over mind and body.[0:49:25] Andrew Huberman: I love that, and it it reminds me that naming is so important. You almost wonder if, self hypnosis and clinical hypnosis had been called something else that it would have, it separated out from stage hypnosis in a way that would make it, Less, you know, less scary, weird, complicated for people to embrace. But Yeah. You know, the part of the reason we're having this discussion is I I would I've had great experiences with hypnosis. I've seen the data.[0:49:53] Andrew Huberman: You know, we're talking about a lot of clinical examples. It's incredibly powerful, and it boils right down to neural brain states. Right. And, you know, I think in the years to come, it's going to become, more widespread. Along those lines, how quickly you've described some, examples of people getting relief very quickly.[0:50:15] Andrew Huberman: How permanent are those changes? Is there a need for follow-up? And related to that, I'm sure a number of people are listening to this and thinking, wonderful. I'd love to get hypnotized for any number of different things by Doctor Spiegel or somebody else expert in clinical hypnosis, but they might not have access to you or somebody, with similar training. So what is the power so how how quickly does it work?[0:50:40] Andrew Huberman: How long lasting are those changes? And then Is it necessary to work with a clinical hypnotist, and is it better to do that than self hypnosis and so on and so forth? Maybe you could just give us a a contour of the of the landscape of directed and and self directed treatment.[0:50:56] Dr. David Spiegel: Well, typically, Most people start by coming to see a clinician like me. It's better to see someone who's light has licensing and training in their professional discipline, Medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever it[0:51:11] Andrew Huberman: because there are a lot of hypnotists out there who are just hypnotists.[0:51:14] Dr. David Spiegel: Just hypnotists.[0:51:15] Andrew Huberman: So okay.[0:51:15] Dr. David Spiegel: And and the key issue is Somebody who can really assess what your problem is and make sure that you're not talking someone into reducing their chest pain rather than getting their Coronary artery problem.[0:51:26] Andrew Huberman: Right. Because they could have a real issue there.[0:51:27] Dr. David Spiegel: They could. Right.[0:51:28] Andrew Huberman: Hypnosis might Right. Adjust, but wouldn't deal with the deeper underlying issue.[0:51:33] Dr. David Spiegel: That's right. On the other hand and typically, when I use it with people, I often only see them once or twice or periodically, but not every week And certainly not every day if they have a pain problem. Hypnosis is very helpful for pain. And and so what I'm doing is Identifying how hypnotizable they are, I give them a standard brief test of their ability to experience hypnosis and then going through a self hypnosis exercise With them to deal with the problem, seeing how they respond to it, and then teaching them how to do it for themselves. And in the old days, I used the that part of the session so they could play back the hypnosis experience.[0:52:14] Dr. David Spiegel: Now we've developed, an app, Grivery, that that, can teach people and step them through Dealing with pain, stress, focus, in insomnia, and help people eat better and and stop smoking, and both we have, elements that take about 15 minutes and elements that just take 1 or 2 minutes that people can refresh and reinforce. So[0:52:39] Andrew Huberman: Two minute hypnosis.[0:52:40] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. Yes. And it it's 1 to 2 we're 1 to 2 minutes now. And we're finding that 2 thirds of the people find that even just the 1 minute refresher, helps them feel better. They're reporting they feel better.[0:52:52] Dr. David Spiegel: So the nice thing is you know right away whether it's likely to help you or not. And we found we've done studies looking at hypnosis for pain relief in acute medical procedures. We did a randomized trial that we published in The Lancet, Three conditions, people getting arterial cut downs to, chemoembolized tumors in the liver or visualize renal artery stenosis. Don't use general anesthesia for this. It's very uncomfortable, and people are anxious.[0:53:18] Dr. David Spiegel: And we had 3 conditions. 1 was standard care. They could push a button and get opioids, IV. Is during the surgery. During the surgery.[0:53:26] Dr. David Spiegel: The second is they could do that, plus they had a friendly nurse comforting them, So we controlled for pleasant attention and support. And the third was we taught them self hypnosis for pain control. So you're you're feel you can change the temperature. Your your body is cool, tingly, and numb. You're floating in ice water and feeling comfortable, Or go somewhere else.[0:53:47] Dr. David Spiegel: Leave your body here and go to a desert island and enjoy yourself. And we found that it it's about 2 and a half hour procedure That by the by an hour and a half, the hypnosis group had reduced their pain by 80% compared to the standard care group Using half the amount of opioids, they had fewer complications, and the procedure took 17 minutes less time on average to get done because not only was the patient more relaxed, so was the treatment staff. They could they weren't dealing with someone who's struggling and uncomfortable. We measured their anxiety, And same thing, the hypnosis group, I was worried they were all dead. They had no anxiety after an hour and a half.[0:54:26] Dr. David Spiegel: They were saying I'm fine. You know? And they were fine, and the and the standard care group Had 5 out of 10 anxiety scores at that point. So we published that in The Lancet, big randomized trial. If we had a drug that did that, Every hospital in the country would be using it now, you know, but there's no industry to push it.[0:54:46] Dr. David Spiegel: So that's part of what helped us decide that we needed to help people, You know, do this with with Reverie and teach them how to do it and provide interactive support for them to do it. And does it you know, the question, although, is does it work long term? Because what we can do acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So We did a randomized trial of women with metastatic breast cancer. They had advancing disease.[0:55:10] Dr. David Spiegel: We met with them in a support group once a week and taught them self hypnosis For for stress and anxiety and pain control at the end. And by the end of a year, the treatment group had half the pain the control group did on the same and very low amounts of So it lasts. And they would say, when I felt that pain in my chest and thought it was a metastasis, I just did the exercise. I exercise. I got myself in a warm bath, and I felt fine.[0:55:35] Dr. David Spiegel: So, it it works because it becomes a skill that people acquire, But they can tell right away whether it's likely to help them working with a clinician or now using the app or, other ways of helping them learn To use it as a skill. So the nice thing is you will know very quickly whether it's likely to help you or not. And if it is, you can learn to do it for yourself.[0:55:57] Andrew Huberman: That's great, and we will again, there'll be a link to Reverie in the caption. It's available for Apple and Android. And I think, even though there's a nominal cost there, I think that, you know, the as you mentioned, medications and other Approaches to dealing with these problems are quite expensive and and potential have all the potential for side effects and Things not that some of those aren't also useful.[0:56:22] Dr. David Spiegel: Could I before you get to that, just one thing. We we've worked very hard on the app. We have an Ios app for Apple. We decided to to table for a moment redoing the Android app. So it's not it was available, when we were working through the Alexa platform.[0:56:39] Dr. David Spiegel: It's not at the moment, but it will be soon. So I just don't want people to be disappointed if they're looking for it for Android. It's it's on our agenda, but We don't have it at the moment. Great.[0:56:49] Andrew Huberman: Thanks for that clarification. So, hopefully, in time for both. I get asked a lot about, Obsessive thoughts or intrusive thoughts. I also get asked a lot about OCD. Is there any evidence that Hypnosis or self hypnosis can be used for dealing with obsessive thoughts.[0:57:10] Dr. David Spiegel: Sometimes. There are some very obsessional people who just turn out not to be that hypnotizable for yeah. And it's not random. They, you know, they tend to be so over controlling a Thought they're all busy evaluating rather than experiencing.[0:57:22] Andrew Huberman: So I saw a few people like that. Sounds like sounds like an adaptive, mindset for a lot of professions in areas, and that we get trained up in that Yeah. During school, know, how to obsess over the exam, obsess over the Yeah. Our social interactions. I mean, it's part of becoming a functional human being, and yet You can take us down a a different[0:57:45] Dr. David Spiegel: We sometimes overdo it. I mean, I'll tell you one example from extreme situations, because That you you know, you're judging, evaluating. You're not letting yourself experience, including emotionally. I know somebody, who listens to the tapes from airplanes that They go down. So they get the black box, and they listen to it.[0:58:03] Dr. David Spiegel: And he said to me, you know That's his profession or he[0:58:05] Andrew Huberman: does this recreation? No.[0:58:06] Dr. David Spiegel: It's a no. It's his profession. That's what he did. And because they're trying to do accident prevention and how to handle things. And he said that, you worry about people panicking.[0:58:16] Dr. David Spiegel: Right? You No. And here, these guys know that, you know, they've got 30 seconds or some 45 seconds, and they're just going through their checklist. He said they're they don't panic enough. They're they're taught that this is what you do, and then there is reason there's good reason for it.[0:58:31] Dr. David Spiegel: But sometimes they overdo it. And, You know, it's it's painful to listen to this because you know what's gonna happen. So it's kind of a balance we have to hit. And some you know, we Sometimes we get too emotional and too absorbed, and you don't you're not with it enough to sort of see other possibilities. That can be a problem.[0:58:49] Dr. David Spiegel: But on the other hand, sometimes You're too rigid and controlled, and you don't let your emotions guide you to what you need to do to protect yourself or protect others. So, I would say in general that people with OCD are in the less on the less appetizable side of the spectrum. They're less likely to allow themselves to engage in any and, you know, the typical example is the checking with OCD, for example. They don't remember, You know, whether they, you know, locked the door or turned off the gas in the oven, they keep going back and they keep checking. So there, the evaluative component of the kind of overrides the experiential one.[0:59:26] Dr. David Spiegel: And, sometimes people can get some benefit, but but it they're not a group that I would select for being the most likely to respond to self hypnotic approaches.[0:59:37] Andrew Huberman: Are are superstitions similar?[0:59:40] Dr. David Spiegel: Superstitions, there I think that's more. There are people, who are very hypnotizable who Keep getting caught up in things like superstitions. And there, the imagination supplants the reality. And so I I think there, it's possible that they could be helped by learning to sort of See it, but put it in context. You know?[1:00:07] Dr. David Spiegel: See it from a from a different point of view.[1:00:09] Andrew Huberman: I developed a pretty vicious superstition when I was in college, and it was hard to break, actually. I always feel that, when I talk to clinicians, I have to reveal certain things about my own pathology, and so[1:00:19] Dr. David Spiegel: You'll get my bill later.[1:00:20] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. Yes. It's part of the reason I arranged. It's not I'm just kidding. But, yeah, I did.[1:00:25] Andrew Huberman: I I had a a habit of knocking on wood for things, and I noticed it started to I would I would, I would sneak knocking on wood every once in a while because I didn't want people to think I was doing too often, and I started to realize that It was becoming a little bit of a reflex. Mhmm. And then I saw this incredible video, from Ben Soloevsky's lab at Harvard. He studies motor patterns. He has these rats that press different sequences of of levers and turn dials in order to get a pellet of food.[1:00:54] Andrew Huberman: But that as they do that, they'll start to introduce these behaviors that have nothing to do with the actual lever pressing. Like, they'll start scratching their and Their hindquarters and things like that, and their hat and of or their head. Excuse me. They don't wear hats and flipping their ears, and this is just like a pitcher before throwing, a baseball That Oh, yeah. We do this.[1:01:12] Andrew Huberman: We we start to incorporate motor behaviors that are unrelated to the outcome, but we our mind somehow starts to think that it They're necessary for the outcome, and so then you incorporate it. So I decided to break it by simply forcing myself to not do it for about a week, and then it just seemed like a ridiculous thing to do.[1:01:29] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. Well, we we call it response prevention, and it works. Because you said what what you do is you set up a new context in your brain where you get the outcome you want Devoid of the the extraneous behavior.[1:01:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I knew it was it was nuts. Right? I knew it was illogical.[1:01:45] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:01:46] Andrew Huberman: But somehow, the these things take on meaning. Right. So we talked about stress reduction the the utility of hypnosis, for stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly. We don't know. But for, things like ADHD and OCD, it just will depend on hypnotizability.[1:02:04] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:02:04] Andrew Huberman: You You talked about this beautiful study on the, a metastatic, breast cancer, outcome or patients. Mhmm. Hypnotizability is clearly a key variable.[1:02:15] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes.[1:02:16] Andrew Huberman: So could you please tell us, what hypnotizability is, how it's evaluated, and what the Spiegle eye roll test is.[1:02:25] Dr. David Spiegel: Okay. Sure. So, hypnotizability is just a a capacity To have hypnotic experiences. And we have a test called the hypnotic conduction profile where we give a highly structured hypnotic experience. And, you know, the The old tradition in clinical hypnosis was that you try a bunch of different things, talking walking upstairs and downstairs and other images and Time what you say to the breathing of the subject and all that.[1:02:52] Dr. David Spiegel: And the more you change what you do as a clinician, the less you can make of variation in outcome. So and it could take a long time, you know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. And I just view that as a kind of complex, not very effective way of assessing the person's hypnotic capacity. We know that the peak period of of hypnotizability in the human life is the latency years in childhood. So every 8 year old is in a trance all the time.[1:03:18] Dr. David Spiegel: You know? You call them in for dinner. They don't hear you. They're doing their thing. And that's why childhood is such a wonderful experience.[1:03:24] Dr. David Spiegel: Work and play are all the same thing, You know? And we try to make them into little adults, which I think is a terrible mistake. They and everything is fun for them. They enjoy learning. They enjoy everything.[1:03:34] Andrew Huberman: So what age are Are they in this This is like[1:03:37] Dr. David Spiegel: 6 to 10, 6 to 11. They they're playful. They enjoy everything. Everything is sort of a game and fun, And we try to make it miserable for them, but they they've got it. And then when what Piaget called, you know, a more adult cognitive framework where we Learn abstract concepts.[1:03:56] Dr. David Spiegel: We learned that even if 1 bottle looks bigger than the other, they can have equal volume, and so we start imposing logic. We're growing our DLPFC at that point and imposing cognitive structure on experience. Some people start to lose that hypnotic ability. By the time you're in your early twenties, your hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. And there was a study done at at Stanford, Ernest Hilgard, Phil Zimbardo did this looking at, they they've tracked down Students who were in psych 1 had their hypnotizability measured and retested them blindly 25 years later.[1:04:35] Dr. David Spiegel: And the test retest correlation was, you wanna guess what it was?[1:04:40] Andrew Huberman: I'm guessing it's, I don't know, 0.6 something.[1:04:44] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. Very close. It was 0.7. IQ would be 0.6 on the 25 year interval. So it's more stable than IQ over a 25 year interval.[1:04:53] Dr. David Spiegel: So once you're at that point, That's where you are. What are the factors that that lead to that well? And and so what it means is that about a third of adults are just not hypnotizable, Two thirds are about 15% are extremely hematizable, and we can measure that and give it a number from 0 to 10. And that's very useful. Or if they're very hypnotizable, I just go for it.[1:05:25] Dr. David Spiegel: You know? I don't do a lot of explaining. People who are low to moderate hypnotizable Like explanations about what you're doing, but then they can still get the benefit. So it helps me guide my the nature of my treatment with these people. Now the the the eye roll is my father, used to use an eye fixation induction.[1:05:45] Dr. David Spiegel: He used to say, look up At the ceiling and and now close your eyes while you're looking at him. Oh, you're very yes. Your agreement.[1:05:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's right.[1:05:53] Dr. David Spiegel: So he noticed he had 2 patients Back to back. And one was a woman who I'd seen him work with who had hysterical seizures. She would just suddenly start shaking and it it was Real[1:06:05] Andrew Huberman: epileptic Seizures. No. Pseudoepeleptics. I see. So hysteria.[1:06:09] Dr. David Spiegel: Hysteria. And although some people have both, that is the for some people, Real epilepsy becomes a framework that gets elaborated on for when you're stressed, you have seizures. She just had Pseudoepilepsy, no EEG abnormalities, and she, it was really something to watch. Her husband had to move his workbench near the door so that if she started to have a seizure, he could run home and and try and help her with it. It was that bad.[1:06:34] Dr. David Spiegel: And he noticed that when she when She did he she did what you did. When she looked up when she would have one of her seizure events, all you see is sclera. You don't see iris anymore, And she would start to see so he he did a great thing with her. He taught her to have seizures. Everybody else was telling her to stop.[1:06:51] Dr. David Spiegel: He made her have 1, so he hypnotized her. Let's go back to the last time you had 1, and sure enough, she'd start to shake. And, gradually, he'd make them smaller and smaller. So she was learning she could control. She'd have access.[1:07:02] Dr. David Spiegel: It's like with PTSD. You know, you confront. You don't avoid it. You don't suppress it. You confront it and then figure out how to deal with it.[1:07:10] Dr. David Spiegel: The next patient he had was a rigid, obsessional businessman Who wanted to stop, you know, being so controlling and and and all this? Remind me, there was a New Yorker cartoon of a driver who comes to a yield and he yells never. You know, it's always been That's about right.[1:07:27] Andrew Huberman: You're a New Yorker.[1:07:28] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. I'm a New[1:07:28] Andrew Huberman: Yorker. Right?[1:07:30] Dr. David Spiegel: And so This guy, when he tried to look up, he couldn't keep his eyes up while he closed it. And so my, father started testing people, And it seemed that there is a rough correlation between the capacity to keep your eyes up while you close them and measured hypnotizability.[1:07:48] Andrew Huberman: So that people who are listening, What, might and and watching on video. So this big eye roll test involves looking up at the ceiling, so it's tilting the head That I'm tilting my chin back and looking up at the ceiling now, but I'm also directing my eyes upward, and my eyes are open. And then the the eye roll test involves then Closing the eyelids while the eyes are[1:08:09] Dr. David Spiegel: open are open.[1:08:10] Andrew Huberman: And whether or not the eyes roll back. And as you said, then you you see Sclera, the white part[1:08:15] Dr. David Spiegel: sclera, the white part.[1:08:16] Andrew Huberman: That means you're very hypnotizable or moderately hypnotizable. Right. Whereas if the eyes move down and you see iris, the colored part The eye as the eyes close, less hypnotizable. Right. And you can look this up online there.[1:08:28] Andrew Huberman: You just put Spiegel eye roll test, and, And you'll find it, and and we are also gonna do an actual, example of hypnosis, on video later. Right.[1:08:39] Dr. David Spiegel: So it's it it you're asking the brain to do something difficult to to keep the eyes up while closing the eyelids, and so that's Contradictory signals for the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerve nuclei that control eye movement. You said the 3rd, 4th, and 6th Yep. Cranial nerve nuclei. And and so they're they're you're suspending one activity while asking them to do another. And eye movements have a lot to do with levels of consciousness.[1:09:07] Dr. David Spiegel: You know? The periaqueductal gray surrounds these cranial nerve nuclei, And, when we, you know, we close our eyes when we sleep, we have rapid eye movement when we dream. Most drugs that affect level of consciousness can affect Eyes and eye movements, either the dilation or contraction of the pupils depending on whether it's a stimulant or an opioid.[1:09:27] Andrew Huberman: Stimulants make the pupils big.[1:09:29] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:09:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This like, cocaine, amphetamine[1:09:31] Dr. David Spiegel: Right. Exactly. That sort of And and opioids, you get constricted Pupils This[1:09:36] Andrew Huberman: is what parent you know, the parents looking at their kids coming in the door late at night. They're they're looking for Right. Substance abuse.[1:09:44] Dr. David Spiegel: That's right. Yeah. So so there's something about the eyes that has a lot to do with level of consciousness. I mean, obviously, you close your eyes when you go to sleep. You have rapid eye movement when you're dreaming, so it's not surprising.[1:09:55] Dr. David Spiegel: And there's there's an old zen practice called looking at the 3rd eye. And I think part of the reason that this happens is where you're looking up in inside. It's like there's a third eye between the other 2 in your forehead. And I think it's because we're visual creatures. You know?[1:10:12] Dr. David Spiegel: We're we're pretty pathetic from a physical point of view. You know? Many animals outrun us, you know, and or outsmell us or see eagles can read could read newsprint at a 100 yards, and we can't you know, it's so, The our major defensive sensory input is vision. And that's why, you know, animals predator animals Have eyes in the front of their head so that they have very good detailed division, vision of prey, whereas prey animals like deer have eyes on the side of their heads. So they don't see things that well, but they have a much bigger range of, potential to see threat.[1:10:52] Dr. David Spiegel: And we mainly use and, in fact, it's interesting. There have been social anthropologists who say, why do we gather where we do, you know, on on coastlines And, you know, at the edge of a forest or something, it's because you've got protection in the back. Something can't attack you from one side, And you have a big vision of what might threaten you, and we tend to, like, be attracted to those kinds of, physical situations.[1:11:16] Andrew Huberman: And we love vistas. We love this. This is a very calming. They take us into that panoramic vision. That's right.[1:11:21] Andrew Huberman: And then I didn't know this, but it turns out that most of the scenic spots At any location in national parks and or where people naturally aggregated, it wasn't, which makes sense. Sure. You know? But that those, signs and locations were built up around people's tendency and animals' tendencies[1:11:40] Dr. David Spiegel: Oh, really?[1:11:40] Andrew Huberman: To to aggregate their yeah. There's an interesting Book on the history of the national parks that that says that they didn't give a a a research study to support it, but there was no Google Maps, obviously.[1:11:50] Dr. David Spiegel: That's that's very interesting.[1:11:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Panorama and and visual boundaries are really interesting. I I think so the the eyes, as we both know, are 2 pieces of the central nervous system of the brain outside the Right. I used to say that dyes are outside the skull, and and a, a neuro ophthalmologist said, they wrote to me and, vehemently pointed out that they are outside the cranial vault. So, you know, They're outside the cranial vault, but they are 2 pieces of brain.[1:12:16] Andrew Huberman: They're out there. And so the you mentioned cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6. This isn't a neuroanatomy course, but, but maybe we could go a little deeper there. So there's you said there's contradictory activity. Looking up is controlled by, the one set of cranial nerves, and then the closing of the eyelids This is controlled by another cranial nerve.[1:12:35] Dr. David Spiegel: No. It's the same one. I think it's 6 that that, you you when you close your eyes, You activate, no. It's the face I guess it's the facial nerve. It's, 7.[1:12:49] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. Yeah. But you're Looking up, you're activating the muscles, that force your eyes to look up, And the the closing your eyelids normally relaxes those relaxes that upper movement because your eyes are closed and you don't need to do it. So you're breaking a a usual customary insider.[1:13:10] Andrew Huberman: The rubbery the Right. Hey. I can't even do it. See, it's like the Yeah.[1:13:14] Dr. David Spiegel: Rubbing[1:13:14] Andrew Huberman: your tummy and patting your head, it's[1:13:16] Dr. David Spiegel: it's a it's[1:13:16] Andrew Huberman: a bit there's a bit of a conflict there.[1:13:18] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:13:19] Andrew Huberman: But, clinically, it's been a good probe for you and and for your father. So was it Spiegel senior or[1:13:24] Dr. David Spiegel: Spiegel junior? That's Spiegel senior.[1:13:26] Andrew Huberman: That developed the Spiegel oral test.[1:13:27] Dr. David Spiegel: And, but the key issue is this, that, normally, when we close our eyes also, We're going to sleep. You know? You're you're not worried about what's going on in the world anymore. Here, you're maintaining resting alertness. So you're you're focusing, but you're turning inward.[1:13:42] Dr. David Spiegel: That's an unusual state. Normally, we don't we close our eyes periodically. We have to. But, when you close your eyes for some period of time, it's normally to go to sleep, and you're not worried about, you know, detecting risk or threat. So it's it's an interesting state because you're turning inward, basically.[1:14:01] Dr. David Spiegel: You're looking up, you're shutting your eyes, and you're allowing whatever happens outside you to happen and Focusing on what's going on inward. So it's a I think it's a signal to your brain to turn inward.[1:14:11] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. And meditation, of course, could be done with eyes open, but almost always is done with eyes closed.[1:14:18] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. That's right.[1:14:20] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. So you can very quickly determine whether or not someone is highly hypnotizable. Right. Not at all hypnotized. We said about 2 thirds of people can be hypnotized.[1:14:30] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:14:31] Andrew Huberman: Obviously, a 3rd cannot, and but within the 2 thirds that can, there's a range. And you said 15% of people fall into this Highly hypnotizable category that I seem to be a a member of. Yeah. And does repeated use of self hypnosis or clinical hypnosis Increase or change hypnotizability for those that can access it in the 1st place?[1:14:52] Dr. David Spiegel: I would say, in general, it may increase a little bit, but not a hell of a lot, and it's not worth The effort to increase your advertisability at that point, it's worth trying to deal with the problem you're dealing with so you can get better at using it at the level that you have. There was a study done in which they tried to train people to be more. And, you know, obviously, there are subjective and behavioral Components to the test, you can learn to do a little better on them. But what we found was when we reanalyzed this data That we could account for 3 times the final score based on the initial hypnotizability measurement rather than whether or not they had been trained to do better. So You can improve it a little, but it's not worth the trouble.[1:15:35] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Along the lines of eyes and eye movements, a lot of interest out there about EMDR, I move into sensitization reprocessing. Yeah. Shapiro herself was working not she wasn't at Stanford directly, but was the local To to Stanford Yeah. I think in Palo Alto.[1:15:51] Andrew Huberman: MRI. Yeah. So what are your thoughts on EMDR? Where is it useful? Where do you think it's less useful?[1:15:58] Andrew Huberman: Are there things that EMDR could be combined with to make it more useful? You know, the listeners of this podcast come to, I think, come to the podcast with a range of backgrounds and interests. To me, it makes sense, why EMDR, lateralized eye movements, might work given the newer data that it can suppress amygdala activity in some animals and animal models and, in humans as well, but it really hasn't been explored much neurally. I've heard things like it coordinates the two sides of the brain, which to me is It's just a throwaway. I I don't think there's any evidence that coordinating the two sides of the brain is better than not coordinating.[1:16:38] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't be speaking right now if the two sides of my brain were We're well correlated[1:16:42] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah.[1:16:42] Andrew Huberman: Because language is lateralized. So Right. I heard that it mimics rapid eye movements during sleep, but, actually, it doesn't. So Right. Right.[1:16:50] Andrew Huberman: But I have heard, people talk about their positive experiences with EMDR. What are your thoughts, man?[1:16:56] Dr. David Spiegel: EMDR? Yeah. You had a good comment on that one of your recent podcasts. And I I'll tell you. You know, one way I sort of think about it, from a bemused point of view Is the old you mentioned it earlier.[1:17:09] Dr. David Spiegel: The oldest sort of idea of a hypnotic induction was a dangling watch, right, you know, and the watch. And, in fact, there was enough concern about it that when automobiles were invented, there was a movement to prevent installing windshield wipers Because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized if they watch the windshield wipers go back and forth on a car. Now it turns out, fortunately, that you tend not to look at the windshield wipers. You keep looking through the windshield. And so we have windshield wipers today.[1:17:42] Dr. David Spiegel: But that movement is what exactly used to be a hypnotic conduction. I think there is a lot of hypnosis in in EMDR. And I think it's a combination of that with, you know, exposure based treatments where you use EMDR to think about it. You tend not to process the experience as much and just do the physical part of it, which I personally think is a drawback. And every study I've seen that was a dismantling study, it there's no question that people who go through MDR, many of them get better with trauma related problems, and the VA has a big program using it and so on.[1:18:17] Dr. David Spiegel: But every program that has dismantled Going through the treatment with having the lateral eye movement, has shown that it the lateral eye movement doesn't add anything to it. And toward the end of her career, Francine, was doing now contralateral touching or something. It wasn't eye movements anymore. It was other things. So I I tend to think that, EMDR is another form of exposure based therapy for trauma.[1:18:45] Dr. David Spiegel: But As as you've implied with the exception of this possible new data, it certainly doesn't have to do with rapid eye movement sleep. And I don't I don't think moving the eyes is The issue, I think it's a way of sitting down and confronting trauma, and I would rather that the trauma itself be processed a bit more than often happens in the EMDR. So a lot of people have gotten therapy. Some of them have been helped. Francine used to originally claim that just 1 session would desensitize people and do it, You know, overly simplistic approach to understanding brain physiology, and that part is wrong.[1:19:30] Dr. David Spiegel: And and, you know, the interesting thing, You know, you mentioned suppressing amygdala activity. It's very interesting that my late friend, Alan Hopson, who's a brilliant sleep researcher. You know how I Sleep researcher. Yeah. Yeah.[1:19:42] Andrew Huberman: Well, I don't know him, but I I read his book when I was in college about the chemistry of sleep[1:19:46] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:19:46] Andrew Huberman: And the, similarities between dream states and hallucinations.[1:19:51] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah.[1:19:52] Andrew Huberman: And, it's one of the reasons I got into this business.[1:19:54] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. Well, I worked with him in the MacArthur mind body network For many years, he's a brilliant guy, points out that we need to get into primarily a parasympathetic state to go to sleep, that we have to shut off Shut off the sympathetic nervous system, and and that's why a loud noise wakes you up and your heart rate goes up and all this. So he was brilliant at at Documenting what happens in the brain of sleep. He pointed out something also very interesting about dreams, which is that the stories in dreams even the images and dreams can change all over the place in crazy ways, but usually, the affect is constant. Said, usually, if it's a Frustration dream, whatever happens, you wind up frustrated.[1:20:34] Dr. David Spiegel: And if it's a, you know, enjoyment dream, you enjoy whatever is going on. So there's an Odd consistency and affect in the dreams that that you don't have, in other states. And the idea of, Lateral eye movement suppressing amygdala activity would kind of fit with that, that you don't allow intrusions of fear and anger and upset injury. There may it may be there all the time, but it may not be there when you think it should be. So why is it that you can be falling off a building and somehow not that scared?[1:21:03] Dr. David Spiegel: You know, you're just having this experience of flying in a dream. So I I think there may be something going on about regulating affect, but there are we have elaborate and better ways to regulate affect.[1:21:16] Andrew Huberman: Right? So EMDR might incorporate some elements of hypnosis by so the lateral eyes eye movements, perhaps by way of suppressing the amygdala, this fear associated center might Bring people into a more parasympathetic calm state. So it might be pseudo hypnosis and then an exposure therapy through the discussion about the issue.[1:21:34] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:21:34] Andrew Huberman: Okay. More research needed on EMDR out there and, obviously, something that's come up a lot in this discussion and in our, Discussions that I'm have the great fortune of talking to you every week is, and working together is this idea of Getting close to the phobia, getting close to the trauma, reexperiencing it as a portal to then adjusting the response to it and rewiring something so the troubling thing or the horrible thing is no longer as horrible to us. That but The the the repeating theme is we can't expect to get over something without getting really close to it, maybe even experiencing it somatically. Nowadays, we hear a lot about, you know, triggers and trigger warnings, and, certainly, one can understand why those are Why those exist? But it seems like there's a in the general population, there's this idea that we wanna move away from anything that upsets us, and yet Right.[1:22:37] Andrew Huberman: Think it's fair to say even though I haven't gathered the statistics that on the whole, that the, human beings are becoming more and more anxious and more and more stressed, Perhaps, because of, but certainly in parallel with the fact that we're trying to move away from troubling things troubling things. So I've heard you say before that it's in terms of therapeutic approaches, it's not just about the state you get into, but whether or not You brought yourself there voluntarily.[1:23:06] Dr. David Spiegel: That's exactly right.[1:23:07] Andrew Huberman: So the this element of of deliberate self exposure, deciding I'm going to confront the trauma. I'm going to confront the pain. I'm going to confront the insomnia. I'm going to confront the you know, and fill in the blank. And then Readjusting one's emotional response right up next to that troubling thing.[1:23:28] Andrew Huberman: That seems to be the the hallmark of of this treatment. And, If I'm thinking about it correctly, of pretty much all treatments for getting over stuff, if people don't have access to a really good clinician like yourself, So how should they carry these thoughts and these ideas? I mean, I think almost everybody of any reasonable age Has memories or things that upset them, but we learn to suppress them. What does one do? Obviously, the Reverie app has approaches to dealing with some of this, inside of the app.[1:24:02] Andrew Huberman: But how does one start to think about actually dealing with something like this and avoiding the hazards of just kinda reactivating a lot of painful experiences. Because a lot of being a functional human being is also Going to work each day, interacting with people, and not bringing one's trauma, you know, and dumping it out all on the table or or being able to Just function is so crucial. So how do you think about this as a clinician?[1:24:25] Dr. David Spiegel: Well, you know, I the image that comes to mind is the Greek myth of Pandora's Box, you know, that it opened and the Furies got out and you couldn't put them back in. And we have this kind of fantasy that once you get into these memories, They'll take you over, and you'll never get them back in the box. And I think that's wrong. You know, we we people who use hypnosis say that there are ways to Presentings to people that will be helpful in ways that won't. And one real mistake is to tell someone, don't think about purple elephants.[1:24:53] Dr. David Spiegel: You know? What are you thinking about? You know? It doesn't work. So you wanna find a way to feel in control of the access and to define what happened on your own terms.[1:25:04] Dr. David Spiegel: And so I'm not a big fan of trigger warnings. I think we're going crazy over, you know, this could be upsetting. That could be upsetting. Yeah. There are lots of things that are upsetting.[1:25:12] Dr. David Spiegel: You know? The average kid has watched 20,000 murders, and by the time he's 20 years old watching television and movies these days, So, you know, we see terrible things, and and it's not a matter of are you exposed to something that's upsetting, but do you handle it? What do you make of it? And are you feeling in control? It's not like, you know, what, what Putin is doing to his his rival in Russia, you know, Forcing him to watch propaganda movies 10 hours a day while he's in prison, it's a matter of thinking, about A problem in a way that leaves you feeling you understand it better.[1:25:49] Dr. David Spiegel: You're in more control. You can turn it off when you when you want. You can turn it on when you want. And so we have to, in life, deal with stressful things. There are studies Karen Parker at Stanford has done some wonderful, studies with primates about stress inoculation, that if you separate, a baby monkey from his mother for 2 hours a day and then reunite them And then you stress that baby monkey later, they actually handle stress better.[1:26:14] Dr. David Spiegel: There's less cortisol arousal in the face of the stress. Stress inoculation has been called. So Mere exposure to trauma or stress, it's a part of living anyway. We can't avoid it even if we'd like to. And, It's not pleasant.[1:26:29] Dr. David Spiegel: It's not great, but it's sometimes things you need to learn about life. And if you can find an algorithm for Facing it, putting it into perspective, dealing with it, you become a stronger person, not a weaker person. So this idea that college students are Such fragile flowers that if you talk about a sexual assault or something, you know, you're doing something terrible to them. It's just wrong. And and I think we need to Build our ability to recognize and manage stress, and you can't do that without doing it.[1:26:57] Dr. David Spiegel: You you can't learn or you can't ride a bicycle without taking the risk of falling off it. You know? And so I think that's the way I think of dealing with the stress.[1:27:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I really appreciate you saying that. I, was you and I were both at a a gathering, let's say, where, this issue was being discussed and around an issue of a of a publicized sexual trauma, and, you made an excellent case for why it this stuff can't be pushed under the rug. And that actually, in my observation, led to a lot of healing for the people that and the families of people that suffered from this. And, I do think, people are resilient.[1:27:34] Andrew Huberman: They, but we don't really teach how how to think about feelings. You know, we don't you know, we're told that we need to feel our feelings, but then again, we are also told that feelings don't hold all the information. And so I think that, as you mentioned, there's no Operating or user's manual for this nervous system thing, brings me to another issue, which is the mind body connection, something that we're Very interested in and, you've done extensive work on. You know, we all like to think that getting more in touch with our body would be a great thing. Learning to interocept, attention to our internal landscape would be a great thing, but as we often discuss, when we're feeling lousy, then Being really in touch with that lousy feeling may or may not be a good thing.[1:28:17] Andrew Huberman: Right? So how should we think about mind body? It I can see examples in hypnosis From your descriptions of hypnosis where, you want to unify the mind body connection, feel what you're thinking, Think what you're feeling, etcetera. But I could also, point to elements within the hypnotic process in which you are actively Trying to uncouple those.[1:28:40] Dr. David Spiegel: That's that's[1:28:41] Andrew Huberman: So it sounds to me like this whole mind body thing is a bit more like a a car. You you can't say that, 40 miles per hour is the optimal speed. It kinda depends on the the road you're on and the the turn you may or may not be taking. Right. How should we think about mind body In terms of, you know, navigating daily life, what what do you think is the adaptive way to to conceptualize the mind body?[1:29:06] Andrew Huberman: It's a big question.[1:29:07] Dr. David Spiegel: It is. It's it's, it's a very interesting one. I I guess I think, That it's a matter not of, you know, absolute control, but more control that that, we need to think of our brain as a tool And and our body signals as tools as well to help us understand, what's going on in the world, what we need, what matters, what's important, what isn't, but also something that can be managed, not simply, you know, absorbed. And so Hypnosis, I think, is a kind of limiting case where you can push it about as far as we can push it, in terms of regulating Pain. Pain is a, you know, is a good example of that.[1:29:50] Dr. David Spiegel: You know? Obviously, you need to pay attention. If you just broke your ankle, you better pay attention to it and get help, or you're having Crushing subexternal chest pain, you better do something about it. But our brain is sort of programmed to treat all pain signals as if they were novel pain signals, If it's a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to, I teach people to to to think of the pain and categorize it. See, is it does it does the pain mean That if you put weight on this, you're gonna reinjure your ankle, for example, or does it simply mean that your body is healing and the pain is a sign that, Gradually, things are getting back to normal.[1:30:27] Dr. David Spiegel: And and so you can modify the way you process pain based on what your brain tells you the pain means. And that's true for emotional pain as well and particularly where I think a strategy that really helps is if you think of, an interpersonal problem or a threat of something coming, as as a an opportunity To do something to ameliorate the situation. So it's not just it's happening to you, but something that you can influence and do something about. So it's Blending the receptive with the active response that I think can make a difference. So you try and process it in a way that Gives you a deeper understanding of what's happening.[1:31:09] Dr. David Spiegel: You face it, but you also say this is an opportunity for me to do something about it. And the minute you Realistically, and this doesn't mean imagine a way a heart attack. It means figure out how to rehabilitate From a heart attack or a broken leg or something like that in a way that you get as much control into the situation as you can.[1:31:32] Andrew Huberman: I love it. Grief. Grief is one of those states that is very hard to, remove oneself from. You know? And and a lot of people ask me, how do I deal with grief?[1:31:46] Andrew Huberman: And I'm not a clinician, so I'm deferring to you. On the one Actually, someone at Stanford recently, came to me and said, you know, my my mother passed away, and I had a sibling that passed away, and they were the only people that I had. And I'm also living alone, and I'm Challenged with a number of things, and, they looked like they were holding it together Mhmm. Very well, in fact, given what they were describing. And on the one hand, I I well, I certainly point out that I'm not a clinician, but I said on the one hand, you could imagine that it would be Necessary and useful to go into the grief state if you wanna transition through it.[1:32:20] Andrew Huberman: Right. On the other hand, there I've heard before that the cathartic model of just really diving into an emotion can also be Potentially hazardous if you don't have any anchors, to, grab onto. What what is the view of psychiatry or your view of grief and how to deal with grief. Because I think grief is is one of those all encompassing emotions for many people.[1:32:47] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. It it is, and it's a very important natural necessary stage of life. And the reason we have all these Greek rituals, you know, from Burials and memorials and headstones and sitting shiva and other things that people do, it's a way of Making it real that an incomprehensible loss has to be comprehended. You know? You have to realize that you're now gonna have to live life Without your loved one, your parent, your sibling, whoever, and we've all go gone through this at one time or another, I certainly have.[1:33:19] Dr. David Spiegel: And it's very hard to just come to terms with, but one principle is to sort of say it it's not it's never all or none. It's more or less. So, yes, it's all or none that you've lost a loved one. But I ask people as part of their grieving to say to themselves, and I do this in hypnosis sometimes 2, you've lost them, but what have they left you with? What what have they bequeathed to you even though they're gone?[1:33:47] Dr. David Spiegel: And I'll sometimes ask them to say, if your mother could be here right now, what would she say to you? How would she feel about your life now? What would she advise you to do? So in our support groups for women with advanced breast cancer, we we lost people, and I and I gotta tell you that we were warned by oncologists that we demoralized people that, I mean, there are wonderful oncologists, but there are some that were very afraid that that we would harm them in some way because they you know, The mortality rate is fairly high with metastatic breast cancer. They're gonna watch people die of the same disease, and you'll demoralize them.[1:34:22] Dr. David Spiegel: And I So we actually measured their emotion and the content of speech every 5 minutes throughout a bunch of groups to make sure that wasn't happening. What we found was That they talked about more serious issues, but the mood didn't actually get worse. And we found, in general, that expressing negative emotion On the long run, it helps people be less anxious and depressed over time. And we've shown this in randomized clinical trials, so it's not just my clinical impression. And and, what we what we try to get them to do is to face a loss, Live with the emotion that comes with it, but also see that the reason it hurts so much is how much that person gave you.[1:35:00] Dr. David Spiegel: So we would do a self hypnosis exercise at the end of the group and say, I want you to Get your body floating safe and comfortable. Now picture Mary and and, sit with the feeling of sadness that she's no longer with us, And we do that for a few minutes, and then we'd say, on the other side, picture one thing she left with you that you still have, that you carry on In your heart, her tradition of what she gave to you. And so just seeing it not as a complete loss, But as a real loss, a painful loss, but one that helps you to reflect on what you gained from her and knowing her, I think can be very helpful in the grieving process.[1:35:38] Andrew Huberman: That's very helpful, like, a way to conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children be safely hip hypnotized or do self hypnosis?[1:35:49] Dr. David Spiegel: They it it's sometimes harder for them to do self hypnosis. They need more structure To do it, you've gotta share your dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex with them a little bit. But, yes, absolutely, children can be very Hypnotizable. And, I I know pediatricians who use it wonderfully all the time. They get them to focus on something else.[1:36:10] Dr. David Spiegel: So they're gonna have to give them a shot or draw blood or something, and they'll say, I'm gonna press your happy button and presses their belly button, and they start to giggle the way kids do. And meanwhile, the nurse is drawing the blood, and they don't even notice it. Dentists, Good dentists can use it to help kids with fear and pain. So, yes, it can be very effective for children. We did a randomized trial.[1:36:33] Dr. David Spiegel: I have a Publication in pediatrics, my late sister who was a pediatrician, who and who always used to joke that, she was the only one in our family who was a real doctor. You know? I said, I got you. I got a paper in pediatrics.[1:36:47] Andrew Huberman: You know?[1:36:47] Dr. David Spiegel: And and the paper was children having to undergo avoiding cystourethrograms. So There the the anatomy of the kidney, if you'll forgive me, is sort of interesting in in in that the the ureter that goes into the bladder Normally, it goes into the bladder at an angle. And so that means that when the bladder contracts to expel urine, it automatically closes off the ureter Because it's sideways to the bladder. Some kids are born with it perpendicular, and then you'll get reflux into the kidney. And Some children outgrow it.[1:37:19] Dr. David Spiegel: Some need pretty complicated surgery to fix that. And so you you image them every year or so to see whether they're getting kidney damage or not. And it's a pretty miserable experience. You're a 9 year old girl. You have to go and lie on a hard cold table, have strangers pull your legs apart and stick a catheter into your, urethra and hold in the bladder and then expel urine.[1:37:41] Dr. David Spiegel: And so you get into these struggling fights, and, of course, the more they struggle, the more they constrict, and it makes it harder to do it. So, I was asked if we could test it. So we did a randomized trial at children's hospital. They either got training in self Hypnosis. I would meet with them and the mother the week before.[1:37:59] Dr. David Spiegel: We find out from the kids where they like to be, and I'd say, you're gonna play a trick on your doctors. Your body is there. You're somewhere else. Go visit your friend. Go to Disneyland.[1:38:07] Dr. David Spiegel: Do something else. And the mother would work on this with me at the head of the table. And we found that these children were much easier to image. 1 got so relaxed that so your guy would he said, normally, it takes us 10 minutes to get them to pee after they're doing this. She was so relaxed.[1:38:22] Dr. David Spiegel: She started peeing before I could even get the bedpan under her, and I had to clean up the table. You know? And they also 17 minutes shorter procedures, And that's a long 17 minutes for for a little kid. So it can be very effective with children. They're less anxious.[1:38:37] Dr. David Spiegel: They have less pain and, get through these difficult procedures very well.[1:38:42] Andrew Huberman: That's great. Has hypnosis ever been done in, for couples, like couples therapy? I'm thinking of pretty much every clinical setting here, both people have to be hypnotizable, of course.[1:38:52] Dr. David Spiegel: Mhmm.[1:38:52] Andrew Huberman: But Yeah. The reason I ask about this is next, I'm gonna ask about Psychedelics, and there's a lot of interest in coordinating states through the use of of drugs of different kinds. We actually do this when we treat depression. Right? You have a depressed person with a family members who are not depressed, and you say, well, let's make them all, not depressed.[1:39:12] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean but but in all and and I'm only half kidding there because that is kind of the underlying logic in some sense, but, are you aware of any, of any coordinated hypnosis.[1:39:23] Dr. David Spiegel: That's interesting. I I mean, I've done plenty of it in groups, not not with couples.[1:39:27] Andrew Huberman: You can hypnotize large groups[1:39:29] Dr. David Spiegel: at once?[1:39:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. Are we hypnotized right now?[1:39:31] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. You are. And I I hope you've been enjoying it. I but The the the metastatic breast cancer, it was a group of, like, 10 women who would meet once a week, and we would all go into hypnosis together.[1:39:44] Andrew Huberman: I didn't realize that you were hypnotizing them collectively. Yes.[1:39:47] Dr. David Spiegel: Yes. Right. Fascinating. And and that you know, if anything, I think it brings out the best in people's abilities because it's a shared social experience, and and they, you And[1:40:02] Andrew Huberman: And I don't wanna focus on psychedelics specifically. Maybe that's a topic for a future episode, but is there any basis for combining hypnosis with, drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode. So I realize that some patients of yours might be prescribed, antidepressant or a medication for For some, purpose, maybe same or different than the hypnosis is being directed toward. But is there any evidence that if people are, relax through the use of a, Propranolol or some you know, one of these many things in the psychiatrist kit that hypnosis can be more effective.[1:40:40] Dr. David Spiegel: Well, interestingly, one study that I haven't mentioned, is we did on people who were hypnotized. And we found, that there was a correlation between hypnotizability And GABA activity in the, anterior cingulate cortex, which fits with turning down activity. So to the extent that we can self medicate and GABA receptors basically are doing what Benzodiazepines do to the brain, that can happen when people are hypnotized.[1:41:13] Andrew Huberman: So you're saying inside of the hypnosis, you you have neural evidence that there's a kind of a, sedative effect of hypnosis at the chemical level.[1:41:22] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. Right. Right. The people who are more and it's related to the degree of their imitizability. Fascinating.[1:41:30] Dr. David Spiegel: In terms of there have been studies where they try to give people medications as well. And the interesting thing with Benzodiazepines, which activate inhibitory activity in the brain, If you're very anxious, it might improve your hypnotic response a bit. If you're just so anxious, in general, you can't do it. If you're not very anxious, it actually inhibits hypnotic activity because you get sort of sedated and just out of it and you can't focus your attention as well. So by and large, We don't use drugs as an adjuvant to hypnotic experience.[1:42:03] Dr. David Spiegel: Most of the time, you don't need to, and sometimes it can make it worse rather than better. Some there's some evidence that mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness a little reliably, but too much Well, again, scatter attention, and you'll have less control over it. So the the they might be adjuvants, but I frankly think, Hypnosis is more of a replacement than a need of supplementation. Your[1:42:29] Andrew Huberman: laboratory, my laboratory have, well, I've sort of snuck into your lab and then trying to, emerge the 2. It's been a lot of fun, and we've been learning a lot about, the power of respiration of breathing to shift brain states, not just during breathing protocols, but, at all Times, and we will do an entire episode about those protocols. I think we we after, those are published and and and so on. But Breathing itself is, you've described as a bridge between conscious and unconscious states.[1:43:01] Dr. David Spiegel: Right.[1:43:01] Andrew Huberman: And, so I have to ask how How important is the patient's breathing pattern? How closely are you monitoring their breathing pattern? How closely do you monitor your own breathing pattern as you're inducing hypnosis? Put simply, what is the role of respiration in shifting the brain's state during a hypnotic protocol.[1:43:23] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. That's very interesting. You had a great show with, Jack Yeah.[1:43:26] Andrew Huberman: Jack Feldman.[1:43:28] Dr. David Spiegel: And he he is. And and the the issue, I I watch it. I try the work that we're enjoying doing together shows that there are breathing patterns that may Increased sympathetic arousal, or may decrease. It may have been with you know, cyclic sighing seems to actually where you have more time spent Failing and inhaling seem and there's reason to believe that it induces parasympathetic activity because you're increasing pressure in the chest And, therefore, allowing the heart to slow down because blood is being returned to the atrium, more easily, I do use it. I ask people to take a deep breath as part of the induction and then slowly exhale.[1:44:15] Dr. David Spiegel: And partly as a result of our research together, I'm Sizing this low exhale more as part of an, some, to enhance the idea in the induction that this is a period of relaxation because I think they are inducing that and perhaps perceiving it as well. So there there's no you're absolutely right that Breathing is very interesting because it's right at the edge of conscious, and Jack talked about that too of conscious and unconscious control. That it will go on automatically, But we can control it, and so it's a kind of way for us to demonstrate to ourselves, Greater ways of of modulating our internal state. So you can either do it thinking about it the way we do with pain control and hypnosis, Or you can do it to some extent by taking charge of your breathing and doing things that will produce a change that you wanna see happen in your body. So I I like it because it's right at that margin where you can enhance.[1:45:13] Dr. David Spiegel: For me, I like that as a way of augmenting hypnosis more than medication. I think this is a a powerful way of doing that.[1:45:20] Andrew Huberman: Great. I'm really excited to see where all of this goes. Yes. Breathing, vision, Bodily states are clearly the yeah. And directed mental, focus Seem to be the the key elements of hypnosis.[1:45:34] Andrew Huberman: Am I missing any any other ingredients?[1:45:38] Dr. David Spiegel: Yeah. It's I think that's right. Breathing vision. Breathing vision, how you change your vision. And you don't you know, typically, you're in a physically relaxed state.[1:45:49] Dr. David Spiegel: But, frankly, there are people at the peak of performance, including physical, athletic performance or musical performance, When they're in hypnotic states too, you know, I've talked to classical pianists who say, I'm not think if I start thinking about what my fingers are doing now, I screw up. You know? I'm floating above the piano Thinking about the nate the tone that I want to feel exuding from the instrument. So that's a hypnotic like state too. And and many athletes in who are In peak performance are just flowing with it.[1:46:20] Dr. David Spiegel: They're they're not they're not thinking step by step, what am I doing? And that's when you're doing your best. Or, you know, when when we're working or, giving a talk and doing it well, We're in a hypnotic like state. So it it doesn't it it usually requires, but doesn't necessarily require physical comfort or Quietness. It can sometimes be intense activity.[1:46:46] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. Well, this has been an amazing discussion. I've learned so much as I always do from you. Where can people learn more about how they can get hypnotized? We mentioned Reveri.[1:46:59] Andrew Huberman: We will put a link to it. It's rev bri.com is the way to access that.[1:47:05] Dr. David Spiegel: Or it's the Reverie app from the App Store is the other way. Reverie.com is the website. You can get to it through that or Download the Reverie app from the App Store.[1:47:13] Andrew Huberman: Great. So currently on Apple, hopefully soon also on Android. But In the meantime, what what if people are interested in exploring clinical hypnosis working with you or or somebody Similar. Is there a centralized resource that people can go to to find, really well trained hypnotists?[1:47:34] Dr. David Spiegel: There are 2 good professional organizations, that will help you with that. 1 is the Society For Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, And I think that's s c e h dot u s is there. We will we'll[1:47:47] Andrew Huberman: look it up and provide a link.[1:47:48] Dr. David Spiegel: And the American Society For Clinical Hypnosis, and they both provide Referral services for professionals. You can look it up. I would just say, in general, look for someone who is licensed and trained In their primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry, and who has training and interest in using hypnosis, is is a way to do it.[1:48:11] Andrew Huberman: Great. And then 1 more question and then a a comment. The question is, will you be my psychiatrist?[1:48:18] Dr. David Spiegel: I'm honored. I'm honored.[1:48:20] Andrew Huberman: It's it's a tall task. I might be the the the most stubborn patient.[1:48:24] Dr. David Spiegel: I think the hardest work's already Done, Andrew. You're fine now.[1:48:27] Andrew Huberman: Appreciate that. Well, and the final thing is is a comment. First of all, Thank you so much for being here today, for sharing your knowledge. I hope we can do it again and again.[1:48:38] Dr. David Spiegel: I hope so.[1:48:39] Andrew Huberman: I love working with your laboratory and with you Because when you speak, I learn, and I learn, and, I know others do as well. Thank you. We will put resources to get to you, but, I also just wanna say thank you for doing the work that you do. Of course. It's an incredible thing that in this world where we Are discovering so much about how the body works, you know, the mind is still rather mysterious, and people are struggling with a lot of things, but, also, I think people are really excited about Applying tools like hypnosis to perform better, feel better mentally and physically, and so you've pointed us to a tremendous amount of resources and How these tools work and where they've already been demonstrated to work.[1:49:19] Andrew Huberman: So just thank you. I know this is your your life's com professional, commitment in life, and and we all benefit.[1:49:26] Dr. David Spiegel: So thank you. But it's been a real joy for me to be collaborating with you and for you to be using your precision and knowledge about Neuroanatomy, neurobiology to address problems that often people who are that disciplined in in the primary neurobiological end aren't as interested in as you are, and so it's really been a pleasure to try and, you know, bring together what we both know from these different perspectives to build something, that neither of us could do alone, and so it's been a real joy for me to do it.[1:49:56] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. I'm honored.[1:49:57] Dr. David Spiegel: Thank you.[1:49:57] Andrew Huberman: Thank you very much, David. You're welcome. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor David Spiegel.

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people drive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing sleep and focus and various other aspects of brain and body health and performance. One issue with supplements, however, is that many of the supplements out there simply do not contain what's listed on the bottle, and or the quality of the ingredients is not very high. That's why we partnered with Thorne Supplements. Thorne Supplements are used by all the major sports teams, and they partner with the Mayo Clinic.[1:51:38] Andrew Huberman: The reason they have so many high level partners is that Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality ingredients. They also are extremely precise In terms of what's listed on the bottle is always what's in the bottle. If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.
