I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Paul Conti. Doctor Conti is a psychiatrist who did his training at Stanford School of Medicine and then went on to be chief resident at Harvard Medical School. He now runs the Pacific Premier Group, which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists focusing on solving complex human problems, including trauma, addiction, Personality and psychiatric disorders.[0:00:36] Andrew Huberman: Today, we discuss trauma in detail and the therapeutic process in detail. For instance, we discuss what is trauma? How do you know if you have trauma? Doctor Conti shares with us, for instance, that not every experience that we think is traumatic is necessarily traumatic, And yet many people might have trauma without even realizing it. We also talk about the therapeutic process generally.[0:00:57] Andrew Huberman: For instance, how to pick a therapist, How to best approach and go through therapy, and how to evaluate whether or not therapy and your relationship to the therapist is working or not. We also talk about self therapies because we acknowledge that not everyone has access to or can afford therapy, and we talk about drug therapies. For instance, antidepressants, antipsychotics. We talk about alcohol, cannabis, ketamine, and the psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD, The and we talk about the clinical use of MDMA and what the future of that looks like. The reason for bringing doctor Conti onto this podcast because I see him as the person who has the greatest and most holistic view of therapy, trauma, drug therapies, Talk therapies and how self therapy and work with others can be integrated for both healing and growing from difficult circumstances.[0:01:47] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Conti is also the author of an exceptional book entitled Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic, How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It. That book describes trauma and its many features and many tools, some of which we discuss on the podcast today. So whether or not you have trauma or not, by the end of today's episode, you will have a much deeper understanding about what trauma is. In fact, I'm confident that you will gain insight into whether or not you have trauma or not, whether or not people close to you have trauma or not, and the various paths to recovering and indeed growing from trauma that we can all take. As you'll soon learn, doctor Conti is an exceptional communicator and has a unique window into the trauma and therapeutic process that I know that all of us can benefit from.[0:02:32] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Effort. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest Quality.[0:02:54] Andrew Huberman: The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA Eyeglasses and Sunglasses was designed with performance in mind. I spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that our visual system has to contend with a lot of different challenges. For instance, when you move from a shady area to a brightly lit area, Your eyes and your brain have to adjust in order for you to be able to see clearly. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with the biology of the visual system in mind, So you never notice those transitions. They're very seamless.[0:03:22] Andrew Huberman: You always see things with perfect clarity. The other terrific thing about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is they are Extremely lightweight. Most of the time, I can't even remember that I'm wearing them. I wear readers at night, and I wear sunglasses sometimes in the daytime when the it is very brighter. I'm driving and so on.[0:03:37] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, go to ROKA.com. That's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your 1st order.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.[0:04:01] Andrew Huberman: I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health Can only be measured and assessed with a quality blood test. And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests, we can also get insight into, for instance, our biological age and see how that compares to our chronological age. And, of course, despite what our birthday cake screams back at us, it is our biological age That really matters. If you're going to get blood tests or DNA tests, however, you need to be able to interpret the data, and that's really where InsideTracker stands apart. A lot of companies will give you a DNA test or a blood test.[0:04:39] Andrew Huberman: They'll send you values of hormones, metabolic markers, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with those InsideTracker is a very easy to use platform. So when you get the numbers back, you can click on any of the numbers that either are in range or out of range, too low, too high, etcetera. And it will direct you towards specific behavioral tools, so lifestyle factors, nutritional tools, supplement tools, etcetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are best for you, which is really an exceptional tool that makes all the blood tests and DNA tests really exceptionally powerful.

Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books condensed down to just 15 minutes each Of key takeaways that you can read or listen to to extract the most important knowledge from those books. I love reading physical books, literally Physical hard copies of books, and I like listening to audiobooks. However, I also like to revisit books that I've read or listened to. And sometimes, I just want to get the key points or the key takeaways from a book that I've never read or listened to.[0:05:49] Andrew Huberman: Blinkist is terrific for all of that. For instance, when researching our episodes on sleep, one of the books that I read and found very valuable Is Matt Walker, professor at UC Berkeley's book, Why We Sleep? I've read that book, but then I wanted to also make sure that I The key takeaways, Blinkist was essential for that. Other books that I've read before and that I own and enjoy, but I listen to the Blinkist version of from time to time are things like Tim Ferriss's 4 Hour Body or Tim Ferriss's 4 Hour Chef book, which is both of which are excellent, or Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan. And there are many other titles as well.[0:06:25] Andrew Huberman: Blinkist is also a great way to finally get through many of the books that you've been meaning to read, but haven't had time for.

And now for my discussion with doctor Paul Conti.[0:07:01] Andrew Huberman: Paul, thank you so much for being here today. Thank you so much for having me. I've been looking forward to this, and I've received a ton of questions about Trauma about therapy, about how to assess where one is in their own arc of Problems and addressing familial issues and relationship issues and so forth. We could just start off very basic and just get everyone oriented. Sure.[0:07:28] Andrew Huberman: How should we define trauma? We all have hard experiences. Some of them, we might ruminate on more than others. But what is trauma?[0:07:40] Dr. Paul Conti: To make the definition relevant, I think we have to look at trauma as Not anything negative that happens to us. Right? But something that overwhelms our coping skills and then leaves us different as we move Forward. So it changes the way that our brains function. Right?[0:07:57] Dr. Paul Conti: And then that change is evident in us as we move forward through life.[0:08:02] Andrew Huberman: So how do we know if we have trauma or not? I've heard before, everyone has trauma. For instance, I've heard that if We are a child or when we are a child and we request love from a parent or attention from a parent, if they dismiss us, that That's a microtrauma. Is that overstating or unfair to the real issue of trauma? Do we all have trauma?[0:08:28] Andrew Huberman: What are microtraumas? What are macrotraumas? Right.[0:08:31] Dr. Paul Conti: I think traumas that we might categorize as disappointments, right, or or Things that are are negative but not deeply impactful, I think, is is not is not a helpful definition. Right? I think the helpful definition is something that rises to the magnitude of really changing us and something that we can see both in how we behave. We can see it in mood, anxiety, behavior, sleep, Physical health. So we so we can identify it, and we can also see it in brain changes.[0:09:00] Dr. Paul Conti: So the the so fact that we become, say, more hypervigilant, right, more vigilant, and then we can See that different parts of the brain are more active. So so that definition that definition captures how trauma, If it rises to a certain level, like what we would say trauma that makes a post trauma syndrome, right, leaves us different, I think is the helpful definition of trauma because a clinical definition. Right? It's changes in us as people, and we can we can map those changes to identifiable shifts in our brain function.[0:09:35] Andrew Huberman: So how do we know if we've been changed by something? I mean, I can think back to childhood events where some kid on the playground or in the classroom said something I didn't like, something negative about me. I think most people can do that. We Have a great memory for the kid that said something awful or the parent or teacher that said something awful that really felt like it hurt us or at least stuck with us. So, clearly, one's brain my brain in this example has been changed by the that event such that I remember it.[0:10:07] Andrew Huberman: But how do we know if something has actually changed the way that we are? Because, of course, we don't know how we would be otherwise. Right. That's that's Difficult. Right?[0:10:18] Andrew Huberman: It it's doable, but it's difficult because the response so if the trauma rises to[0:10:23] Dr. Paul Conti: the level of changing our brains, and I don't just mean, like, we have a new memory. Right? So we could have memories of something that was negative. Right? And in that sense, it changes the brain because now there's something we can call to mind, But it doesn't change the functioning of the brain.[0:10:37] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? If the if trauma rises to the level of changing the functioning of our brains, then there is almost always a reflex of guilt and shame around the trauma that can lead us it often leads us to Bury it. Right? To avoid it. Right?[0:10:53] Dr. Paul Conti: To to feel that now there's something negative inside of me, and it it's feels shameful or it feels like no one else would accept it. Right? So so what happens is people tend to avoid looking at the change in them, Which is exactly the opposite of what needs to be done. Right? The idea of in a viral pandemic, right, we wanna stay away from one another and isolate.[0:11:16] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But but with the trauma Epidemic. We need we need to communicate with other people. We need to communicate and put words to what's going on inside of us. And and very often, A person knows.[0:11:28] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, I've done so much clinical work over about 20 years that that has focused on trauma. And A lot of the times, the person knows, right, but they're not admitting it to themselves because they're afraid of it. Right? They don't know what to do. But if you they start talking, then they'll they'll talk about the event or the situation.[0:11:48] Dr. Paul Conti: It could be something acute or it could be something chronic that really has been harmful to them. Right? And then they feel different afterwards. Like, oh, after that, I started thinking differently, feeling differently, But that doesn't always happen. Sometimes it's a process of exploration, you know, through dialogue, right, whether whether it's written or whether it's spoken Of of the person sort of exploring the changes inside of themselves, maybe changes to their self talk inside, changes to their thoughts about the world and whether they can navigate Safely and readily in it.[0:12:19] Dr. Paul Conti: And, you know, in Anchors as I talk about this, the example I'll use at times is the example of my own life where, you know, when I was Much younger, in my early twenties, my younger brother took his life by suicide. And, you know, the response of guilt and shame and And hiding all of it inside of me was was it it's just very dramatic, but but I wasn't acknowledging it. Right? Because I didn't know what to do about it. And I felt guilty, and I felt responsible, and I felt ashamed.[0:12:51] Dr. Paul Conti: So there was a an avoidance inside of me, and then I wasn't saying to myself, hey. Before this, like, you thought that you could be effective, and you could make your way in the world. And, know, if you were a good person and you worked hard, you could make a difference. Right? And then afterwards, I thought, I can't get anywhere.[0:13:07] Dr. Paul Conti: The the world's against me, and, You know, I I I felt like all my my options are all gone, and, you know, I was, like, 24 years old. Right? So so I didn't see that the change was in me, But I was taking care of myself poorly. Like, there was enough going on that was unhealthy that I couldn't avoid the realization that, like, hey. I'm different Now and in these ways that are automatic.[0:13:28] Dr. Paul Conti: You know, my reflex to, can I make my way in the world? Can I have a good life? Can I be happy? Well, my reflexes to that were all different, And they were coming through the lens of heightened anxiety, heightened vigilance, a sense of guilt, a sense of shame, and a sense of nonbelonging in the world, and and was ultimately good and helpful people around me, and my own realization, and, hey, things are not going well. Right?[0:13:52] Dr. Paul Conti: That led me to to then get some help and to be able to talk about it and realize, like, oh my gosh. Like, I need to face these things that are going on inside of me.[0:14:00] Andrew Huberman: From a psychoanalytic, psychological, and maybe even a neuroscience perspective, 2 questions. Why do you think that When we experience trauma, these things that we call guilt and shame surface. You know, everything you're telling me is that, In the end, that's not adaptive. Mhmm. Why would we be built that way?[0:14:25] Andrew Huberman: Right. So that's the first question. And then the second question is, you know, how should we conceptualize, you know, guilt and shame? You know, I think that we hear guilt. We hear shame.[0:14:38] Andrew Huberman: You know, how should we think about it? I mean, those emotions, must exist in us for some reason.[0:14:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:14:45] Andrew Huberman: But in this case, it seems like they They don't serve us well. So, maybe in that order or in reverse order, you know, what what is guilt really? What is shame really?[0:14:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:14:56] Andrew Huberman: And Why is it that we seem to be reflexively wired to feel guilty and feel ashamed when that's The exact opposite of what we need to do in the case of trauma.[0:15:06] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Right. No. I think these are great questions, and and I don't think anyone knows the answers for sure, But my read of all of that is that there's something adaptive that has happened in us through evolution that now becomes Maladaptive in in the way we live in the modern world. Right?[0:15:25] Dr. Paul Conti: So if you think of through most of human development, you know, people weren't living that Long. Right? And the idea was to survive and reproduce. So so traumatic things that happened to us, it would make sense for them to stay with us. Right?[0:15:38] Dr. Paul Conti: So, You know, if you ate a new food and got really, really sick, it's like you better remember that. Right? You know, if you see someone from The group of people, you know, a couple miles away. Right? And one of those people attacks you.[0:15:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It's like you better remember that. So So the traumatic things that are sort of emblazoned in our brain are built to last. Right? Things that are positive We'll generate some emotion inside of us, but things that are profoundly negative are much more likely to stay with us.[0:16:07] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think that that was Adaptive, right, when all of that was about survival. Right?[0:16:13] Andrew Huberman: And I[0:16:13] Dr. Paul Conti: think the same thing is true with with, say, shame. Right? So I I think here it makes sense to to to talk a little bit. Actually, I'm interested if your your thoughts about this, right, that that the limbic system. Right?[0:16:25] Dr. Paul Conti: So the the system often is called the emotion system. Right? In our in our brains has actually, of course, varying function. Right? And One aspect is affect.[0:16:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So affect is aroused in us, which which I think the the meaning then is it's created in us without our choice. Right. So if if we're walking down the road and someone jumps in front of us or pushes us, right, then there's a response of fear, anger. Right.[0:16:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Heart starts beating faster, you know, more blood to the muscles. You know, we we're getting ready to to fight, right, or or run. Right? And then we become aware of it. Right?[0:17:02] Dr. Paul Conti: So so the aroused affect in us is also about survival, and it has a very deep impact upon us. And Shame is an aroused affect, so so it it can be raised in us without our choice, and it's very powerful, Which if you think about that is an extremely strong deterrent. Right? So if you had you know, imagine a a a tribe or group of people, right, that are Sheltered together and, you know, someone eats half the food at night or something. Right?[0:17:32] Dr. Paul Conti: And, like, there's a very negative response. Right? And that person Feels shame because shame is so powerful to to control behavior. Right? So the way that trauma can change our brains And and stay with us in a way that says be more vigilant.[0:17:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Look at the world in a different way. Act more defensively. Right? And and how that links To shame and to guilt. So then guilt in in guilt becomes what gets called feeling, technically, where we relate the aroused affect to ourselves.[0:18:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So so shame, the aroused affect, and guilt, the next step, right, when we when the shame gets related to self, are such profound behavioral interventions and and deterrents, right, that you can see, I think, how evolutionarily Kind of all makes sense if we're fighting for survival, you know, and we're an elder statesman if we make it to 20. Right? This makes sense, but it doesn't make sense In a world where we live much longer, right, we navigate in all sorts of different ways, and there's so much coming at us that can be traumatizing. If you think about The news.[0:18:37] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I mean, how many times have I written a prescription for someone that says no more news. Right?[0:18:42] Andrew Huberman: Or You've actually written those prescriptions. Yeah.[0:18:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. So glance at the news. Like, look at the news for news. Anything going on I need to know? Right?[0:18:50] Dr. Paul Conti: But but what are people doing is They're looking at it, and they're clicking and they're clicking, and there's a there's a sense of being, like, enthralled in a very frightening way with the horrors That are in front of us. And and it it shows how, yes, trauma can come through acute things that happen to us. Trauma can come through chronic things, chronic denigration, whether it's based upon socioeconomic status, immigrant immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, the the these chronic traumas, right, of being Denigrated by the society around us are treated as less than can change the brain, but vicarious experiences can too. Right? And we know this is not Theoretical, we know that the changes in the brain can come from vicarious experiences too, which is why people who are glued to the news and then feeling like, oh my goodness.[0:19:43] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, What is happening, you know, the the mothers in the Ukraine who've, you know, lost babies in the war, like, there are things that are so terrifying that if we spend so much time with that, It has a similar effect. So our brains are built to change from trauma, but not in the way we Experience trauma and not in the way that we live life in terms of the nature of living life and the duration of life in the modern world where these traumas that happen to us are often so bad for us because they they change how our brain is functioning, and then our entire orient orientation to the world is different. And that could be for, You know, years years decades decades, it brings so much misery and suffering, and at times it brings Death. If you think about a 100,000 overdose deaths in this country in a year, a 100,000. Where is a is so much of that arising from?[0:20:38] Dr. Paul Conti: As a person who's treated addiction very intensively over many years, I think that well, I feel sure that the majority of addiction that I see and treat arises. Ultimately, the roots of it are in Trauma and aren't trying to soothe something that's stuck inside that the person isn't letting outside because of the guilt and shame, but it's running around in their head and is tormented by it. And And now there's a pull for for these drugs or sometimes medicines to soothe. So, you know, the the opiates that were given after a minor surgery, right, Or or like, okay. Yeah.[0:21:11] Dr. Paul Conti: They help the pain from the minor surgery, but what they're really helping is the pain inside. Right? But that very quickly turns into Addiction, danger, risk, and we see that over and over again and and and not and not in a theoretical way. Like, I see that in people who have been in my practice With addiction, the arising from trauma who have subsequently died. So it's sort of writ large in our existence in the modern world.[0:21:38] Andrew Huberman: Incredible to me that this is the way it works. What what I mean by that is This idea that I've heard about before, I think it was a Freudian concept of a repetition compulsion Yes. That, you know, this is this is what boggles my mind As I'm hearing this, something happens to us or we observe something traumatic. And instead of Acknowledging that and trying to distance from it, there seems to be a reflex of shame and guilt in many cases and stuffing it away, And then a repetition of behaviors to continue to try and just stuff it away. Yes.[0:22:16] Andrew Huberman: Like, you're trying to pack I don't know. Recently, I was packing a home and trying to get the, sleeping bag back into the bag. It's it's it seems like it's always gonna mushroom out the top. This kind of thing, it takes a lot of ongoing effort. And at the same time, that if this thing really exists, this repetition compulsion, people will return over and over again to the kinds of scenarios or at least kinds of emotional states that look just like the trauma or resemble it in some way.[0:22:42] Andrew Huberman: So the the question I have for you is, Is the repetition compulsion a real thing? And why would we be wired that way? My understanding of this concept of the repetition compulsion is that we all want to solve our traumas, and it allows us to put ourselves into micro or, again, macro versions of that over and over again. We get to run the experiment again and again in an attempt to solve it. Right.[0:23:09] Andrew Huberman: In the case of taking a drug that it's clear, certain drugs like opioids, it's clear how that would not allow us to deal with it. Right? It's just masking the the emotional state. But why is it, for instance, that somebody who experiences sexual trauma then places themselves into Circumstances of more sexual trauma, why is it that somebody who is in an abusive relationship goes on to have a 2nd and 3rd or 4th Verbally or physically abusive relationship. Yeah.[0:23:36] Andrew Huberman: I mean, on the face of it, you just go, that makes no sense, and yet we see this over and over and over again.[0:23:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. The the first thing I would say about the the validity of the repetition compulsion concept, right, is is a strong yes. Like, yes. We see that over and over. It's not necessarily in everyone, but boy, it is in a lot of people who have suffered Trauma, and and I think there's a very good reason on the face on the surface of it is, like, it makes no sense.[0:24:06] Dr. Paul Conti: But then if we Think, well, how does the how does our brains actually function? Right? We we're sort of trained, at least in Western society, I think, to think of ourselves as logical creatures. Right? That, like, oh, we're logical, and, ultimately, everything in us can just boil down to logic.[0:24:21] Dr. Paul Conti: And if we think about it enough, we're gonna we're gonna understand how to make the right decisions, Which is completely not true. Right? The the the limbic system, right, the emotion system, so to speak, inside of us always Trump's logic. Right? If you think about does it ever make sense to run into a burning building?[0:24:40] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, logic says no. Right? But if someone you love is in the burning building, do people run right in. Right? Because the limbic system says yes.[0:24:49] Dr. Paul Conti: So when logic and emotion come head to head, Emotion wins all the time. If emotion is powerful enough, it will always win. And so the limbic system is so important, And the limbic system does not care about the clock or the calendar. Right? And that's the answer, and I'll also sort of say why to to the Repetition compulsion.[0:25:10] Dr. Paul Conti: So the limbic system doesn't know, like, oh, it's now. It's today. It's May. It's 2022. It just doesn't care at all.[0:25:17] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So so how I would relate that to the repetition compulsion is is when people are repeating what they're trying to do is to make things right, Right? With the idea that if we can repeat the situation and make it right, it will fix everything, right, which makes perfect sense If if we think, well, where is that concept coming from? Right? It's coming from the emotional part of the brain that wants relief from suffering of the trauma And does not understand the clock or the calendar.[0:25:49] Dr. Paul Conti: So if I can solve something now, I will also solve something in the past. Right? Which is why I can't tell you how many times I've sat with someone, and say we're starting to do therapy. Right? And a person will Say, gosh.[0:26:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I I know. Look. Look. You just can't help me. Right?[0:26:06] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, you know, I mean, my last 7 relationships have been abusive. Right? And I'll say back something sometimes, like, well, look. If if you tell me that you've had 7 relationships that have been abusive in different ways, I'll agree with you. Like, I only say that because that's never what someone says.[0:26:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But I think what you're gonna tell me is you've kinda had the same relationship 7 times. It's not 7 things. It's 1. Right?[0:26:30] Dr. Paul Conti: And that's always I don't think one time yet. It is that has failed to be the case. And that's how so if you think about it, that's how we start to elucidate what's going on. So think of the light bulb that goes off. Like, I have not Had 7 different abusive relationships.[0:26:47] Dr. Paul Conti: I have had one that I have repeated 7 times, and now we start getting to what's really going on. And what needs to happen. That person needs to face what happened in that original abusive relationship, and it always comes down to the the same sort of concepts of of the person feeling terrified while the abuse was going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, they brought it on themselves. They deserve it. They don't deserve anything better.[0:27:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Because the brain is trying to make sense of it. Right? Or I I thought I could make that okay, but I couldn't. Right?[0:27:18] Dr. Paul Conti: And then there's more guilt and more shame. And if that's stuck inside of someone, like, that's bundled up inside of someone, you know, like a medical abscess inside a person, You know, a walled off infection inside the body, this is the same concept in the brain, then, of course, the limbic system is gonna wanna fix that. And And it fixes it by trying to, let's recreate that situation and make it right this time. And that's I mean, it's, I think, the one of the best examples of how The right approach of how, like, let's look at that. Let's talk about that.[0:27:48] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? What's really going on there? Wait. Who should feel guilty and ashamed? Is it the person who is abused or the person who is abusing?[0:27:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and we can get at what's going on inside the person, and that's what changes that. And then the 8th relationship can be entirely different than the first 7. Right? And I see that all the time.[0:28:04] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, this isn't esoteric or soft. Like, I see that play out clinically over and over again. And why do things get better? Because we go to the trauma, and we unlock it. It's not hidden inside where it can control things.[0:28:19] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? We bring it to the surface, and then we we can take away its power.[0:28:24] Andrew Huberman: I keep hearing in this Narrative that so much of our reflexive response to trauma, both emotional and in The repetition compulsion in terms of behaviors is about some very deep attempt to change the past. Yes. And in fact, in an offline conversation, I I recall, you saying something about this that, you know, The number of behaviors and thoughts and avoidance of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts that human beings put in to try and change the past is Right. Is Remarkable and eerie and maladaptive, it's it sounds like.[0:29:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:29:06] Andrew Huberman: And that really stuck with me because I think we all want to feel like we're in control of our future and how we feel in the moment. And to some extent, it it works For a brief while, you know, there's this thing that happened, and it just it it evokes some internal arousal, and then you have to know what to do with that arousal. And I think, for many people, including myself, there's this this fundamental question. Okay. The the thought about the thing, the event Mhmm.[0:29:35] Andrew Huberman: Where events, plural, evokes this arousal, this internal states that make some people feel sleepy and exhausted. Other people feel really anxious. Other people feel angry. I mean, the Arousal has all these different dimensions as you as, you know. And then there's this question about what to do with it.[0:29:52] Andrew Huberman: Yes. And and I'd love to hear a maybe even just a a top contour prescriptive of what do I what does one do? I'll even just put myself in it. What do I do? So I'm feeling upset about Something should I feel like my options are healthy catharsis.[0:30:08] Andrew Huberman: I could tell the story, feel it. I could, I can pack it down. Oh, we hear that it's bad to pack it down, but, of course, one has to be functional in life Mhmm. And deal with things, and we have responsibilities, At work and relational responsibilities, etcetera, we need to sleep at night. So catharsis healthy catharsis, Packing it down at the other extreme, telling the story.[0:30:34] Andrew Huberman: And yet, I think a lot of people are afraid to tell the story because it's in that telling, there's a, Perhaps a reemergence of the arousal. The arousal can become greater. I mean Yes. Is that what people mean when they say things are gonna get worse before they get better? I mean, So I guess the the simple version of this long winded question is it's clear we need to confront these things.[0:30:55] Andrew Huberman: We can't change the past by A reflexive response isn't gonna do that efficiently. And so how do we deal with arousal? How does one take what they feel inside about something shameful? What do you do with it in a moment? And does that have to be done in the presence of a skilled trained therapist?[0:31:13] Andrew Huberman: Or As I'm driving to work in the morning and something comes up, I can't deal with this right now, comes to mind. What do I do? Do I deal with it right then? I know this is a big multidimensional question, but I think it's the one that a lot of people grapple with. We wanna deal with things.[0:31:29] Andrew Huberman: How do we deal with that internal arousal?[0:31:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Yeah. We so often try and change the trauma of the past in order to control the future, and what what that Really adds up to is the trauma of the past dominates our present. Right? And it doesn't have to be that way.[0:31:49] Dr. Paul Conti: And remember, we're talking about Traumas that rise to the level of changing the brain. So as you're saying, that involves reexperience. It involves hypervigilance, increased arousal. It changes in mood states, changes in anxiety, changes in sleep, changes in behavior. So so these are all changes that, In a sense, push towards dominating our present.[0:32:10] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and then we're not really living in the present, right, as we're trying to control the future. We're not gonna do a great job of controlling our future if we're not really living in the present. Right? And the so the way to come at that, Again, in the moment, if we're saying, okay, in the moment, if I need to fall asleep, right, I might say, okay.[0:32:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Let me try and put that out of my mind. Let me try and thought redirect. So So there's short term strategies that can let us be functional in the context of these changes, but the answer is to Go look directly at that thing. Right? Look at that trauma.[0:32:44] Dr. Paul Conti: Explore that trauma. Ensure that can be done with a professional, and sometimes that's What makes sense? But not always. Right? Sometimes it can be done by talking to another person.[0:32:53] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Writing it down. Right? Look at what's going on inside of me that my mind is so stuck to this. Let's explore that because it's almost as if we're we're so afraid So often of looking at the trauma that has changed us, that we'll look anywhere but at that.[0:33:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So it's like it's hidden in a closet, and we'll shine the light everywhere else, but we're not gonna open that door. And that's where, you know, people will say the Same as I've heard over and over, and I myself have thought this at times. Like, oh, if I talk about that, I'm gonna start crying and never stop. Right?[0:33:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Or I'm gonna just fall apart. Right? Which is never what happens. No one ever starts crying and never stops. Right?[0:33:33] Dr. Paul Conti: What ends up happening is when the person puts words to it. Right. It could be in writing. It could be talking to a trusted other or with a therapist. Right?[0:33:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Things start to change. I mean, just the fact that you can Talk about it. You can put words to it, and other people don't recoil. Right? I mean, how many times has someone said something for the first time?[0:33:53] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and when they're telling me about the trauma, there there's such an anxious, like looking like as if I'm gonna be I'm gonna recoil from it. Right? Meaning, I'm going to recoil from them. Right?[0:34:05] Dr. Paul Conti: And then there's a sense of surprise if the person says, well, You know, I was abused by, you know, this coach when I was a kid. Right? Or and and there's not a okay. There's there's not a response of recoiling. You can see the change, and people will say a lot like, wow.[0:34:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I I'm I can't believe, like, you can, like, hear me say that and be okay with it. Right? I mean so you think about what's going on inside of them. Like, how what a sense of shame, a sense of, you know, this is something awful about me for people to recoil from, And it's just not true, but but there here's where trauma is. It's insidious.[0:34:43] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And it's pervasive. Right? Because If that convinces us to continually hide it away, then how do we explore it? Like, you know, that example Of of the person who says, okay.[0:34:56] Dr. Paul Conti: I was abused by a coach when I was a child. I mean, I'm thinking of a of a couple very real cases. Right? People that I've taken care of. And once they start talking about it, then they start talking about how, you know, they were just innocent kids.[0:35:10] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, they didn't know, and, like, they really wanted to be on Team where this coach was treating them as special, and and now they can look at themselves from the outside. Right? They can look at themselves like they would look at someone else. Right?[0:35:23] Dr. Paul Conti: You think it's so easy for us to see what's real and true if it's someone else? Right? If you ask someone, you know, what do you think of someone who's 10, 11 years old who's Abused and manipulated and abused by an adult. Oh my goodness. I feel compassion for that person.[0:35:38] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But if it's us, right, Then, oh, no. It's guilt and shame, and we have to hide it away. And when the person starts looking at it, they can sort of see it from the outside, And it starts to take the energy out of it. Right?[0:35:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Then, well, who should feel guilty about that? Who's done something wrong? And, like so now the conceptions come together, which is often a reflexive. That was my fault. Oh, I I did it.[0:36:00] Dr. Paul Conti: I I went back to it. I I I still stayed on the team. I went back next season. Right? I let it happen again.[0:36:06] Dr. Paul Conti: But all the guilt and shame inside the person gets juxtaposed to, like, what really happened there? And then they say, right. I was a terrified Child, right, didn't understand at all, and they can come to a place of compassion. And now we are working against the guilt and shame. And if the person cries about it, And it's great.[0:36:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I mean, crying is one of the best coping mechanisms we have. It doesn't hurt us, and it lets us grieve things. You know, we can't grieve If there's guilt and shame inside of us, it just blocks grief. Right?[0:36:36] Dr. Paul Conti: We have to we there has to be a clean slate in a sense in order to feel sadness, And then you see that it shifts from anxiety, anger, and frustration usually directed towards the self, guilt, and shame Towards, towards being able to process it and being able to bring to bear some compassion and being able to direct the negative emotions, so to speak, Where they're warranted, and my goodness, the changes that happen. I mean, it's not like it's people are miraculously cured. Right? But it's remarkable how just getting it out there and have, like, 1 hour of talking like that, like like what we're talking about now, Can can leave a person feeling immensely better.[0:37:17] Andrew Huberman: It seems to me in hearing this that there's this weird wiring that we have. Because what I'm hearing is when traumas happen to us or we observe them, what we need to do most is to confront those and the emotions around that directly.[0:37:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:37:32] Andrew Huberman: But instead, our system defaults to guilt, shame[0:37:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:37:35] Andrew Huberman: And trying to hide it. Yes. And this repetition compulsion of placing us back into Things similar to those traumas or even maybe even worse traumas[0:37:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:37:46] Andrew Huberman: In an attempt to resolve it. It's like the most maladaptive Yes. Wiring diagram I could possibly think of. Emotional and presumably physiological wiring diagram. Yes.[0:37:56] Andrew Huberman: And this notion of trying to change the past by doing things now when the exact opposite is what's going to be beneficial Also seems like Yes. Complete the whole system seems completely backwards, and I'm I'm chuckling as I said. It's not because I'm amused, it's because I'm just baffled once again at How our wiring can often not serve us well.[0:38:16] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. Mhmm.[0:38:18] Andrew Huberman: But it raises a what I think is an important and interesting question, which is, Earlier, you were talking about how, you know, people will seek out media that's really disturbing. They'll traumatize and retraumatize themselves on a daily basis. Mhmm. So that could be viewed as the repetition compulsion, where the person will have the same relationship with 7 different same abusive relationship with 7 different partners in sequence.[0:38:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:38:43] Andrew Huberman: Seems terrible, and yet as I say this, it also is becoming clear to me how this almost seems like a, a poor but desperate attempt to resolve it in some way. And so this the fork in the road, if I understand correctly, is to really get to the seed incident, really get to the thing that started it all as opposed to repeating it all.[0:39:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:39:10] Andrew Huberman: Does that have to be done in the presence of a therapist? Is is there a benefit to taking a walk and thinking about these things, Breaking down and crying if that's what's necessary or feeling angry if that's what comes up. The the reason I ask it this way is because I worry that I'll just speak to my my own experience. I worry that in reactivating or or touching into the emotions around something That that is itself a form of the repetition compulsion because you're feeling it all over again. It's just you're not seeking out something to evoke that feeling.[0:39:46] Andrew Huberman: So I realized this is a little bit of a circular argument, or or question, but I think it's one that I really struggle with in trying to parse all the The, what I the the outcome based therapies that I hear about and, And the the recommendations that people make, I mean, how should we conceptualize this? Something happens. Sounds like we need to deal with that thing directly. Do we need to do that with somebody else? Can we do that on our own?[0:40:13] Andrew Huberman: If we're we don't have resources and we have to do it on our own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone to work with us Right. How do we do that in a way that isn't retraumatizing ourself in a major way or in a minor way? It how do how do we know where we are in that landscape? Right. Again, those are[0:40:32] Dr. Paul Conti: I think it's great questions, and and I think it starts with real introspection. You know? When things are bouncing around in our minds, Often, it's very nonproductive. Right? It's the same thing over and over again, and that's not helpful for us.[0:40:46] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So there's an idea which sometimes gets Called an observing ego. Right? The the ability to stop and look at what's going on inside of ourselves. And so if we're just thinking about it And we're thinking in the same way we sort of, in a sense, always think about it, then all we're doing is reinforcing the trauma.[0:41:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But if we can distance enough to be like, it's I'm interested in what's going on inside of me. Right? Like, I think of a certain person who, you know, who really loves music. I mean, then at some point in our therapy work, I learned, like, she was taking long drives, but the the radio wasn't on.[0:41:21] Dr. Paul Conti: And I was like, well, what's going on? Right? And I asked, and was going on is she was running over and over again in her head like, I'm a loser. I'm a loser. Right?[0:41:29] Dr. Paul Conti: And she didn't want the music on Because the music would drown out what she felt she had to say to herself. Right? And it was that, like, wow. That's Interesting. Right?[0:41:40] Dr. Paul Conti: And then her ability to observe that and to think, why am I doing that when it comes into her mind? Like, what is that Trace to, when did I start doing that? Like I said, you know, I'm I'm saying it for a point of exaggeration. Like, nobody comes out of the womb, You know, programmed to think I'm a loser. Right?[0:41:57] Dr. Paul Conti: So we don't we don't think that when we're born. Right? So where does that come from? Then we can think in ways That allow us to have new thoughts, right, that that we weren't having. It's not just bouncing around in our minds.[0:42:09] Dr. Paul Conti: And if we speak or write, There are even more mechanisms that come online in our brains, right, that that are then sort of monitoring mechanisms. We think in a different way If we're using words, right, and we we are better able often to bring in that observing ego, like, what's going on inside of me? So So it can be very helpful to think. It can be helpful to talk to someone, to a trusted other, you know, friend, family, clergy, to write. I mean, these are things that can be done without expending any resources.[0:42:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and sometimes it can make Really, a big difference. Right? There's a wait. When did I start thinking that?[0:42:44] Dr. Paul Conti: And, like, interestingly, in this case, okay, we did it in therapy, but it became very clear what that was rooted to. Right? And then in the the therapy, which was still relatively young, but we'd done him several sessions, and we we weren't talking at all about what we needed to talk about. Right? But that's what got us to what we needed to talk about.[0:43:03] Dr. Paul Conti: And when did that start? And now we're in that same place of exploring that, and what was the reflex to it, and The sense of guilt and sense of shame, and it's where all of that came from. They just got boiled down to I'm a loser. Right? Which which this person Didn't even have in their mind, like, I didn't think about myself that way.[0:43:21] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And it's it's so interesting, right, that our memories don't in and of themselves Cells have meaning. It's like they're flat or, you know, or colorless. Right? And and they're colored in by the emotions that we attach to them.[0:43:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So so The idea that the that certain memories now before the trauma were changed, right, by the trauma. So so I told this story sometimes of a person who, Like, won an award when they were in high school that they thought was, oh my gosh. Like, it shows. Like, I can do it.[0:43:49] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I get out there that after trauma, They saw the award with a negative emotion attached to it. That was like, oh, it was given to me and I didn't deserve it, and almost it was mocking. Like, there's gonna be the Greatest achievement in my life, and I was 17 years. And to to have someone think like that's not how they felt about that at the time.[0:44:07] Dr. Paul Conti: It's the trauma that changed The the self talk, the internal state going forward, and you're talking about miraculous in a negative way also change that going backward. Right? And and when we can really look at, like, where did that come from? And we can start unraveling it. It changes.[0:44:26] Dr. Paul Conti: So in those Cases, you know, often it's helpful to have a a good therapist. It's not always necessary, and and it certainly it's not always possible. Right? So we we need other strategies, and some of those yeah. I write about some of those in the book of how how can we sort of get at trauma without those formalized mechanisms.[0:44:46] Dr. Paul Conti: And sometimes if the symptoms are significant enough, like, we really do need to talk to somebody professional who can who can help us get to the root of the trauma. And there's so many times that's the answer to what's going on with people. You know, people I've seen about 5 residential stays. I'm not exaggerating this For mental health reasons, for substance reasons, and no one's ever taken a trauma history. Right?[0:45:07] Dr. Paul Conti: You know, when you take a trauma history, so, well, that's obviously where this is all coming from. Right? Like, that's when the drug use started truly thereafter. The negative self talk and the negative feelings that led to the drug use, then you go after the trauma, And and you can change things, whereas trying to change things without looking, introspecting, talking about the trauma, I I think, of course, was futile.[0:45:30] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that people who can start to have negative fantasies? I mean, you mentioned this woman who would take these long drives to berate herself. I'm not familiar with that, but I'll I'll give a little bit of personal disclosure here. I've felt, several times in my life that I will start to, create a narrative about something that truly hasn't happened, about something terrible that somebody is going to do Yes. That's going to upset me.[0:45:57] Andrew Huberman: Yes. And for the longest time, I I would wonder why am I doing this? And and I have, a couple ideas about why. 1 is that I was attempting to just avoid thinking about other things. It's just, you know, anger is such a An attractive emotional force in in the it's an attractant.[0:46:14] Andrew Huberman: It's not attractive. We don't like it, and yet oftentimes, anger is a great way to replace feeling some Something else. Yes. Feeling sad or having to come up or to do work or to do something useful, so that it has this kind of, like, Gravitational force to it. That was one idea.[0:46:33] Andrew Huberman: The other idea was in imagining kind of worst outcomes, then, actually, that relationship were could actually seem a lot better in reality. Mhmm.[0:46:42] Dr. Paul Conti: It's[0:46:42] Andrew Huberman: almost like creating this negative contrast. Yes. It's like, oh, well, then it's not that bad. And and then the third possibility is I have no idea why, but it seemed like a reflex, and I spend some time thinking about it. I can't say I've resolved it completely.[0:46:55] Andrew Huberman: But why would somebody have a narrative a default narrative when driving or when walking of, I'm I'm just gonna spend some time and and think about how terrible this thing is gonna turn out or how someone's gonna upset me or harm me or how terrible I am. It it seems, again, like maladaptive thinking, maladaptive wiring, and yet I have to assume that it serves some purpose.[0:47:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think there are 3 factors there, and they're all bad. And I and I think you spoke to at least 2 of them. Right?[0:47:26] Dr. Paul Conti: They're They may, I think, speak so powerfully to how insidious trauma is and how these are real Brain changes inside of us. So so I would say the the 3 factors, punishment, avoidance, and control. Right. So so the trauma inside of us that that makes guilt and shame so often So often leads to a desire to punish oneself. Right?[0:47:53] Dr. Paul Conti: And the idea that, oh, that was my fault, or I deserved that. Well, what what do we do if Something is someone's fault, and someone now deserves punishment. Right? I mean, we we we punish them. Right?[0:48:02] Dr. Paul Conti: We send them to jail. We give them a fine. Right? We punish them. And so what What we do is punish ourselves.[0:48:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And we if we tell ourselves we're a loser or this awful thing is gonna happen, right, then part of what we're doing is saying to ourselves, see. Right? You deserve that. You're not gonna have anything better.[0:48:17] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It's a it's a negative. It's a very negative way that the brain Tries to to make us, in a sense, do better by hurting us more for the things that we couldn't and shouldn't have been able to weren't expected to be to control in the 1st place. Right? The second is distraction.[0:48:34] Dr. Paul Conti: As you said, anger, that kind of fantasy, can distract us from from, affect feeling and emotion That can be much more negative. You know? Anger, it can be more gratifying than than certainly than guilt or shame. Although guilt or and shame can serve a punishment purpose, But if anger is directed also towards ourselves, right, then it can serve punishment too. So punishment, avoidance, And the sense of control that if you think ahead to something awful that you're imagining is going to happen, well, maybe that will let you avoid it.[0:49:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Mean, you can see the brain here, in a sense, really confused. I mean, part of the brain wants to punish, part of the brain doesn't wanna think about it at all, And part of the brain wants to make it better. And and then how all of that resolves if we're not aware that, hey, this is in the context of our brains being deeply impacted Goodbye trauma. So what's going on here is all maladaptive.[0:49:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because these negative fantasies of the future, they may help us feel better about something in the present, But they don't help us make anything better. Right? They don't help us make anything better. So this is the kind of the sequela.[0:49:40] Dr. Paul Conti: This is where Trauma and all this reflexive stuff that happens after trauma ultimately lead us, and you can see how we get lost, how I've seen over and over again In my own life, in the lives of other people, how, man, we get stuck in those situations. That's why I see people sometimes this has been going on 30 years, 40 years. Right? And it's just been going on over and over and over again because there's no natural end to any of this, Right? Unless we we look at it in a different way that we have knowledge and information, like, woah.[0:50:15] Dr. Paul Conti: This isn't the way it has to be. Let me bring a novel perspective to this. It doesn't change on its own.[0:50:22] Andrew Huberman: I'm struck by your statement that these thoughts or Behaviors can make us feel better, but they don't actually make anything better. In that way, it this mode of imagining terrible outcomes Starts to immediately seem like taking opioids. It you know, you feel better in the moment, but it doesn't actually make anything better, and it[0:50:43] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[0:50:44] Andrew Huberman: Probably makes things worse.[0:50:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:50:45] Andrew Huberman: And and just as a question of, how how much worse and and and in what direction.[0:50:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:50:54] Andrew Huberman: And so I just I wanna just pause on that on that concept because I think that concept of makes us feel better, but doesn't make anything better. I think, It answers an earlier question about the this what seems to be a totally maladaptive wiring diagram. You know, we need confront a thing, but we don't wanna go into the repetition compulsion.[0:51:13] Dr. Paul Conti: So[0:51:14] Andrew Huberman: there's a there's a it's a it's a knife edge there to navigate through trauma.[0:51:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:51:20] Andrew Huberman: Working with a a very skilled clinician like yourself, I think, is the ideal circumstance for for people. And, Of course, there are people who can't access support from somebody for whatever reason. You've talked about, journaling.[0:51:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:51:35] Andrew Huberman: Yes. As a useful tool, could you maybe you highlight some of the other, things that people can do on their own? And then I'd also like to talk about What makes for a good therapist? What should people look for for those that are are seeking therapy, especially nowadays when a lot of therapy is being done remotely? But let's just start with the The, let's just call them, self generated or zero cost, sorts of things.[0:52:01] Andrew Huberman: Journaling being the first, and then what are some of the others? And and what kind of structure would you recommend someone put around journaling? Carry a journal around all day and jot things down as they come up, or down and spend an hour writing in complete sentences, for instance.[0:52:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. If I could, add something to what you just said before the question, right, that That we have these short term coping mechanisms in us. Right? And in a way, it makes sense. Right?[0:52:25] Dr. Paul Conti: If we find ourselves in just Terrible situations, you know, then a short term coping mechanism can get us through them. Right? So our our brains are built that way, and that's part of survival too. Right? And whether now in the modern world, whether it's it's food, it's drugs, it's sex, it's alcohol, right, or it's negative thoughts.[0:52:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? This is short term soothing. Even the negative thoughts and anger is short term soothing at the expense of long term change. Right? And that's where, you know, addictive pathways can come into play, and and that's where, again, our how we're built evolutionarily for survival Doesn't help us, you know, in the way humans have evolved.[0:53:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, we haven't lived this way throughout, you know, 99.9 something percent of human history. Right? So So we're not adapted to this. So I wanna just make a point of saying that about the short term soothing at the expense of any of long term change. You know?[0:53:22] Dr. Paul Conti: And then the the the question you had asked about, say, journaling or what can we do that's outside of, professional, I think the hallmark of it Has to be bringing new eyes to it. Right? Like, thinking about self with a curiosity instead of just a simple Automaticity or repetition. Right? Like, why am I thinking about this?[0:53:42] Dr. Paul Conti: When did this start? Why is this in me? Right? That it's that That whether it's words or whether we're writing, that's so important. So I think for journaling, it depends on the person.[0:53:54] Dr. Paul Conti: You know? I mean, we don't want somebody carrying around a journal all day if Then there's a compulsion. Do I need to write about everything that's going on in my mind? Right? Like, that might be good to okay.[0:54:02] Dr. Paul Conti: Write a little bit at night. Right? Or someone who might think, know, sometimes this really comes into my mind in a strong way, and it could be unpredictable. Right? I wanna have the the the journal with me.[0:54:11] Dr. Paul Conti: So, that thing is back in my mind now. You know, let me write about it. Right? Because then putting words to it and then being able to read those words. Right?[0:54:20] Dr. Paul Conti: And when people read, even do a little bit of journaling, and they read, Like, oh, I I thought again about how I'm a terrible person who can't have a good life because, because I was in such a bad Car accident or because that person attacked me or because when I was in school, I was bullied because I looked different than everyone else, right, or I acted different for everyone else. Wow. You know, to actually see that written out, it's you know, it's a little bit of that you know, it's a little bit of that like, when you're saying it to someone As if it were someone else. Right? Because now there's enough distance from it.[0:54:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I'm looking at the words I wrote. Right? That we get some distance, and we can start to integrate Some of the not just the compassion, but integrating compassion and logic, right, of like, okay. I feel a sense of compassion. Now wait.[0:55:07] Dr. Paul Conti: What does this mean? What really happened here? Right? And, gosh, I did start thinking differently after that. I started to that's where this came from.[0:55:15] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? That's why I'm saying this. It's those kind of revelations that we can have through, again, the written or spoken word, and I think, again, that involves a trusted other, You know, or writing. And I think that those are ways we can do this where we bring some de novo perspective To something that often has been bouncing around inside of us, and it's amazing to me that, you know, I can see such Intelligent, empathically attuned people who've had the same thing running over and over again in their mind for Years, and it just points out that our brains don't automatically say, hey. Wait a second.[0:55:53] Dr. Paul Conti: You know? I've been spinning wheels here for a long, long time. Like, was there another way to look at this? We need something from the outside, which can just be knowledge, right, which is why I think what we're doing here or the reason I wrote the book That I wrote was was, like, apprehending this, like, amazing surprise to me, right, which is, like, wow. Like, some huge percentage of Everything I'm treating is rooted in trauma and the opacity of trauma, right, which is why We don't see that, oh, the depression, the panic attacks, the life change, the addiction, the, you know, the maladaptive choices.[0:56:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, oh, this is all coming from trauma because It hides itself in that in that opacity. So we need a de novo perspective if we're doing it on our own, and we need that if we're doing it in therapy, Which might link, like, finding the right therapist, right, which is also part of your Yes. Question.[0:56:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I definitely wanna know about how to assess and find the right therapist before, We'd, cover that. However, something came up, in the course of your answer. I can Immediately relate to this idea that, you know, certain behaviors are are really maladaptive and are are, stuffing things down or avoiding the topic, is problematic, and bringing a curiosity and an introspection, almost a third personing of the, experience, that we've had in order to try and address it from a through a from a new truly from a new perspective. It occurred to me as as We were discussing this, however, that some people and and, yes, maybe I'm talking a little bit about my own experience.[0:57:29] Andrew Huberman: We we have a sense of our own identity and our and how people view us and our ability to be functional in the world in ways that we like. Effective at work or a good brother or a good Mhmm. Mother or father Human being in the world, we have relationships. And I think that one thing that I have heard, and maybe I've experienced is that Sometimes those, maladaptive thoughts or behaviors, the things that generate a kind of a a repetition of anger or of arousal or activation or sadness that we have some internal process where we we funnel that into a functionality in the world. So we, I'll give a more concrete example.[0:58:10] Andrew Huberman: So in thinking about things that have upset me in the past and then imagining, bad outcomes in the future. Uh-huh. There's a certain internal state of arousal that comes about. And for many years, I was able to use that, Not to feel angry, but rather to work an extra 3 hours a day Right. Or to, pack my schedule with, work and social engagement, so I could show up in a way that I, you know, hopefully, was a very good brother to my sister, for instance.[0:58:37] Andrew Huberman: So in a way, it was a, it was a transformation of something negative inside of me Yes. Into a functionality in the world that was actually very rewarding and beneficial.[0:58:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[0:58:47] Andrew Huberman: And yet, In in describing it, I can immediately see how it would be wonderful if I could source from something else.[0:58:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. And[0:58:54] Andrew Huberman: yet, I you can imagine, and and I can imagine how one would be, reluctant, maybe even terrified of giving up that source. It's a fuel. Yes. And I and I think in knowing some of the Traumas of other people and their reluctance to work through those. Obviously, I'm not a therapist.[0:59:12] Andrew Huberman: I I sense this over and over again that one's positive identity[0:59:17] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:59:17] Andrew Huberman: Can often be linked to something difficult in their past, and so people are reluctant to give up this fuel Yes. Because it it's, In that sense, it's functional.[0:59:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:59:28] Andrew Huberman: The only thing that allowed me to kind of start to address this and and why I'm still so curious about this, because I don't think I've Worked through this process completely. Again, a little more self disclosure there is that I was told that These words, just imagine how much better it would be if you could source from a different fuel. Mhmm. A fuel that felt better. Right.[0:59:52] Andrew Huberman: Maybe it was the on the it was on this this sentence. It was maybe you could actually be much more effective.[1:00:00] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[1:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you could be 10 times the better brother.[1:00:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[1:00:03] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you could, have 10 times more, insider work capacity, etcetera. So it's on that hint of a promise, that I at least I was inspired to start looking into these things and reading about trauma in your book and elsewhere and start to think about this. So, again, I I realize this is a long winded, question or somewhat complex idea, but I think or I hope that people will be able to resonate with this idea that sometimes we wanna stay attached to the The this short term soothing that the punishment distraction or control because it evokes this arousal, and then we can apply that arousal.[1:00:36] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. Yes. I think what you're describing maps, I think, clinically to what gets called sublimation. So there's something negative inside of us, But we sort of transfer that energy. We transfer that into something that is adaptive or that is positive.[1:00:50] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So the idea of anger. Right? When I think of that thing and it makes anger in me, I channel that into harder work. Right?[1:00:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Or I channel that into, like, I'm gonna go be nicer to my brother. Some right. Something like that, and And there's validity to that. Right? And and but being can become, like, self justifying if a person thinks, well, like, look at what this is doing for Right?[1:01:10] Dr. Paul Conti: I wouldn't work as hard without it. Right now, we start to become attached to the trauma, whereas I think what you had said It's absolutely true that just because we can sublimate some of the negative affect feeling emotion that comes from trauma into something productive, doesn't mean that that's best. Right? We know we can get to our destination by taking a very circuitous route. Right?[1:01:35] Dr. Paul Conti: We might waste an hour getting there, But we get there. That doesn't mean that that's best, and it also doesn't look at all the negative. Right? In this example, the wasted fuel, the wasted time. Right?[1:01:45] Dr. Paul Conti: We get somewhere, but we are not optimizing. And I have yet to see 1 person who who has addressed the trauma and become less functional. Right? It's always they're just as functional, but they're happier, right, or more functional. Because as you said, like, just because we may be able to sublimate, well, maybe what's going on will be 10 times better, right, if If we if we weren't sublimating because the sublimation limits us.[1:02:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It limits our perspective to only what we can see and do through the lens of the trauma, And that is never better than the alternative.[1:02:23] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that.[1:02:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. You're welcome.[1:02:25] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Let's discuss how one could or should go about finding a a really good therapist. Typically, this in my experience, this is done by word-of-mouth. You know, there's this person you might wanna work with them, and they're really great. What are some of the characteristics that one should look for, and, should we take into account whether or not we are a person who you know, for instance, I've heard this from from listeners, although I'm clear I'm definitely not talking about myself here in, cloaking something.[1:02:59] Andrew Huberman: Some people will say, you know, I wanna work with a somatic therapist because I've actually heard someone say, I think in feels. They you know, I feel stuff in my body, so I wanna with someone who can really acknowledge that, or someone else will say, you know, I wanna work with somebody who has this orientation or that orientation or Is, open to my particular lifestyle or isn't gonna tell me that I have to leave my relationship. You know? I feel like people already show up to the question of who to work with With all these, you know, things internally, some of which are voiced and some of which are aren't. So I'd love for you to talk about maybe some of the The core features of a really good therapist, and then how to how to look for a therapist, and also how to think about oneself in looking for a therapist because of these kind of predispositions.[1:03:43] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Right. Well, there's a lot of data about this over over the years that if you look at what are the top 10, important factors to find in a therapist, just repeat rapport 10 times. Right. I mean, that's the key, and if you think about that, it's pretty amazing, right, because therapeutic modalities can be so different.[1:04:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And I think what what that's telling us is, in a way, something very obvious. Right? Like, what does rapport mean? Like, you know, it's somebody's paying attention.[1:04:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It's Trust. It's a back and forth. It's it's like, yeah, even though I'm doing I'm doing something difficult, I'm doing it with someone who's really helping me, someone who's in it with me. Right?[1:04:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Someone who's really paying Tension wants me to be better. That's indispensable. I mean, it's just indispensable. And I write in the book if someone a therapist is not making eye contact, or this is the way they do it. Right?[1:04:32] Dr. Paul Conti: And, you know, you gotta fit into the box of the way they do it. That is not going to be helpful. And and then what I what I think about that is The different modalities, it doesn't actually tell us that, oh, the modality's irrelevant. I think that's not true. I think that good therapists are not pigeonholed by a certain modality.[1:04:52] Dr. Paul Conti: They they may, you know, come at the world largely through a psychodynamic course, CBT or a DBT lens. There's lots of different, you know, ways to do therapy. But when you really talk to those people, really good experienced therapists, It's all coming through the vehicle of the rapport, but they're practically shifting to what the person needs. You know, I I don't understand the the idea that, like, I just do this. Right?[1:05:17] Dr. Paul Conti: I don't do that. And when when people are pigeonholed that way, I don't think they help their patients very well. Right? We we have to be diverse enough to say, hey. I want all the arrows in the quiver.[1:05:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and even though there might be one that I favor and that's the lens I see things through, No. I can be versatile. I can shift. I can adapt to what this person needs.[1:05:36] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think if if you have that, you've you've gotta If you have that, you've got a winning combination.[1:05:42] Andrew Huberman: Great. So people should perhaps try a few therapists and maybe have a session or 2 or 3 to see if they The rapport feels like it's taking root. Is that do you have that right?[1:05:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. And I think that's why word-of-mouth is important. Right? If someone you trust tells you, hey. This is a good person, That says a lot.[1:05:57] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It already makes the pretest probability is quite high. But, yes, it's interesting to see when, like, people, have a therapist. Are they called or insurance? Are they assigned a therapist?[1:06:08] Dr. Paul Conti: This thought that, like, oh, that's the person I have to have now, and it's like, no. You should look at that like anyone. And you would be interviewing, right, for, you know, for a job. Right? But but you gotta bring again the right set of thoughts To that to to be helped, right, which is, like, I want someone who's has rapport with me.[1:06:25] Dr. Paul Conti: I don't want someone who's gonna make it easy. Right? Who's like, woah. It's gosh. It's kind of pleasant because then that means you're not talking about the difficult things.[1:06:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So if one brings, like, I know this isn't gonna be easy. I gotta talk about difficult things. Right. Even if one doesn't recognize oh, I gotta talk about the trauma in me.[1:06:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But to go to therapy thinking, no. It's I mean, sometimes it's enjoyable, but A lot of times, right, it's not. Right? It's hard work.[1:06:47] Dr. Paul Conti: It can be excruciating. We can cry doing it. But to say, right, that that's how I'm gonna be helped, and I want someone Who's gonna do that with me? You know, who who's really looking at what's going on inside of me? How do we help me?[1:06:59] Dr. Paul Conti: And I can feel sort of the robustness of That if one brings that approach and then looks at the therapist through that lens, you're you're very likely to then move on from someone who's not a good choice, right, And really stick with someone who is, even though that doesn't mean it's always, like, pleasant and enjoyable. I mean, it has to not be that sometimes. Right.[1:07:20] Andrew Huberman: Maybe we could drill a little deeper into the mechanics of therapy. I put out a few questions to audience, asking what they want to know about therapy, and It was amazing. I got hundreds, if not thousands of responses saying, how should I show up to therapy? So for instance, should People take a 5 minute, meditative drop in before, or should they just show up cold and[1:07:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[1:07:41] Andrew Huberman: Let it emerge? During therapy, is it a good idea to take notes or to not take notes? And then post therapy, how should clients, patients, As they're sometimes called 1 or the other, I never know which. How should they process that information? Should they take some designated time afterwards and, you know, in an ideal We'll take a 30 minute walk afterwards and think about the material, or should they set it aside and come back to it?[1:08:07] Andrew Huberman: Of course, there are constraints, work and family, etcetera. But, you know, we there's a lot of knowledge out there about how to best show up to a workout, warm up for 5, 10 minutes, then do this, etcetera, and then the cool down. I mean, Here, we're talking about hard psychological work aimed at bettering oneself. So, to my knowledge, I've I've not ever, Seeing this information anywhere, it'd be very useful to hear hear your thoughts on this. Yeah.[1:08:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Well, I'm not trying to duck the question, but but but I think it varies so much by person. So if you think about the the first part of your question, I think, was how to show up to therapy. Right? And I think the answer would be whatever lets you be fully present When you're in therapy now for some people, that's gonna be I I show up early.[1:08:49] Dr. Paul Conti: You know, I sit. I calm myself. I meditate a little bit. I mean, that's how then they're present. Right?[1:08:54] Dr. Paul Conti: For other people, you know, they just they would show up, walk into the room, they could stop another present. Right? Because whatever works for that person So that they're really there. Their thoughts, their energy is really in what's going on, and the same thing applies on the other end. You know, there are people who They're really well served by, you know, going for a walk if they can or sitting quietly after therapy, kind of putting that in order.[1:09:17] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Otherwise, they lose some of it. Right? Or Like some of the ahas, right, or the oh, that's an interesting thought, that they really need to put it in order. Maybe that involves taking some notes During therapy.[1:09:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? For other people, they need to do the exact opposite. They need to, like, leave, not think about that at all, and then they can reflect on it later and learn from it. So, know, we're so different. They are human beings.[1:09:37] Dr. Paul Conti: There's such a diversity in us that that there's no hard answer to that. It was like being present when it's happening, then being able to sort of consolidate and and retain What's been gained is most important, and I think we have to figure that out person by person. I mean, I try and do that in the work of, like, what what's serving this person best? And sometimes we know, sometimes it evolves and sometimes we talk about it, but it varies so much.[1:10:05] Andrew Huberman: If someone were thinking about embarking on Therapy or more therapy to to address trauma or just general issues of life, what is the frequency that you recommend? I could Imagine 2 extreme models. 1 is, okay. I'm gonna finally tackle this trauma. I'm going to do therapy 3 times a week, But for a shorter period of time, you know, 6 months, you know, over and out, versus this open ended model of once a week, Typically, for as long as it takes.[1:10:34] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Right. I think that also varies, and I work with people in varied ways from, oh, someone who's doing well, and, like, we meet for a half hour every 6 months, right, To doing week long hourly sessions, to spending 3 intense days with someone in a row. Right? So I I think As far as, like, kind of guiding principles, what I have found in my own life, because I I I Value my own therapy, tremendously.[1:11:05] Dr. Paul Conti: So I found in my own life and in my own clinical work that if it's less than once a week, Then it's hard for us to retain, really. You know, we we spend a lot of time kind of catching up. Okay. What's happened? Let's get back to the place we were at before.[1:11:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Which is why I think if we're really gonna get somewhere, we're not just trying to maintain something. Right? Then I think once a week for an hour is really kind of the minimum. Right?[1:11:30] Dr. Paul Conti: But more intensive work is like the more intense it is, it's it's it's not linear. Right? It's an exponential gain. Like, Financial gain. Like, we we do a lot of intensive work, right, where where someone will come and and do 30 clinical hours with us over the course of a week.[1:11:46] Dr. Paul Conti: So 5 or 6 different clinicians, 30 clinical hours, and, you know, we found that the benefits of doing that are Immense. It's like it's like a year's worth of therapy consolidated, and you think, well, 30 hours, let's say, you know, we go almost every week. Maybe that's 45 or 50 hours, But 30 hours with that kind of intensity, is worth, probably, 60 hours, you know, done in a different way, because then it it's it's in us in an active way. Right? It's in the therapist in an active way.[1:12:16] Dr. Paul Conti: It becomes very, very dynamic. So I think turning up the intensity, if there's something that we really need to process, absolutely makes sense, and I do that in my own life. There's something now that's like, woah. It's really something is really distressing me, and it's linking into prior trauma. And I can see what's going on in me.[1:12:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Now I start to have ruminative thoughts, you know, with negativity. I'm like, I gotta go more. Right? Because I gotta do that processing so I can get to the place that I am, which is not that it's not that the trauma has no impact on me. Right?[1:12:45] Dr. Paul Conti: It's that the impact is much less than it was before the therapy and that I most often more often than not, have an ability to see When it's now intruding into my thoughts and it's taking me away from, like, what I really think and believe or being able to draw logic and emotion together and make good decisions, Turning up the intensity then absolutely makes sense.[1:13:08] Andrew Huberman: This, very deep, intensive work of 30 hours in a week. What brings somebody to some the type of work, of that sort? Is it a suicide risk or a A severe addiction situation. I mean, how how does one gauge how much therapy they they ought to be, doing, and, should it always be on the therapist to decide that frequency? Mhmm.[1:13:33] Andrew Huberman: What, yeah, what what would bring someone to to a situation of Five therapists in 30 hours a week, in 1 week. Right. Right. It's it's usually a a[1:13:43] Dr. Paul Conti: person who It's really distressed by something. You know, whether that's it's it's so negatively impacting their life person comes to realization, I just can't take this anymore. Right? Or I'm I'm sick of this cyclical depression. I I gotta stop having panic attacks.[1:13:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I I need help. Right? But it's it's usually some, You know, crisis point with the idea of of crisis in the meaning of, okay, something comes to a head, and after it, things are gonna be different. Right? Not all crisis and things are gonna be negative afterwards, But a point where where then that that cognitive flexibility comes to the fore of, like, wait.[1:14:16] Dr. Paul Conti: I need to do something different. Right? So that that's often what brings us. Know, sometimes it's other people pointing it out or if somebody's had an intervention somewhere or, yes, that person's been hospitalized after a suicide attempt or They've gone back to to rehab again, for the 3rd or 4th time, and their life is really in danger. Sometimes it's that, and sometimes it's a person realizing, Yeah.[1:14:38] Dr. Paul Conti: I just wanna I wanna look at myself. I wanna understand myself better. You know, I know that what's going on in me isn't as good as it can be. Right? So so I think people can come to it for all sorts of different ways.[1:14:50] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think, yes, I think a lot of times it would be the therapist to say it. Like, More work you know, more intensive work or can make a a difference, but I think the person also needs to, you know, take Ownership, right, of their own therapy. And so if I don't feel hoped enough, well, I have to think about that, right, and and talk to the therapist about that because it may be maybe that therapist isn't a match. Right? Or maybe you talk to the therapist, and the therapist can change his or her approach.[1:15:15] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Or maybe you talk to the therapist and increase the frequency. Right? But the idea is to to be aware of it. Right?[1:15:22] Dr. Paul Conti: And if one's needs aren't being met, to acknowledge that. Right? Because people can get into a rhythm of therapy Where it's really not helping them. Right? But they either feel sort of nihilistic about it.[1:15:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, oh, I'm no better, and I'm going to therapy. Right? Or Sometimes there's a sense that while I'm in therapy, so I'm kinda checking that box of doing something for myself, but it's not really getting me anywhere. And then the part of the brain that's controlled by the guilt and shame and avoidance thinks that's a great idea. Right?[1:15:49] Dr. Paul Conti: So, again, this ability observe ourselves and, like, what's going on? Am I being helped in the way I and do I feel helped? Right? Am I, in some ways, even Even, like, happy that I'm not feeling help because I don't have to face this thing I don't wanna face. Right?[1:16:02] Dr. Paul Conti: Or am I too afraid to say I need more help? Right? Do we really need to look at ourselves? And this is where the insurance systems often are very difficult, because it's hard sometimes for a person to say, oh, I need more therapy, because that may not be possible. Right?[1:16:14] Dr. Paul Conti: So So there are sort of negative factors in the world around us, but, ultimately, I think the answer to the question comes down to Observing ourselves and taking ownership of, like, what's going on in us and how we're feeling, and and and feeling that that, Commitment to self or to self care to say, I need to go change this.[1:16:33] Andrew Huberman: And for those that, maybe don't have the means or insurance or access to do even, One day a week therapy, in the journaling model[1:16:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[1:16:43] Andrew Huberman: Could one perhaps take an entire day as, Awful as it might seem to do a lot of journaling and thinking and walking, you know, do a a self generated intensive. Do you think there's utility to that?[1:16:56] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, there could be, but, again, it depends by person because there there could also be something negative about that if it's, you know, someone who's Not at the point not ready for that. Right? I mean, we we don't come at you know, we don't come directly at the trauma immediately. At least most of the time, we don't do that. Right?[1:17:13] Dr. Paul Conti: And and we often don't explore it in-depth. Like, this idea that, oh, that person now has to go through every second of the trauma is actually not true. I mean, Sometimes it is, but that's that's not the common situation. Right? It's more often that person has to acknowledge, like, the example of, like, I was sexually abused.[1:17:31] Dr. Paul Conti: And if they Acknowledge that into and say, okay. Like, gosh. What has that done to me? That doesn't mean, well, let's parse out every moment of, like, how that was and the terror of that. Right.[1:17:41] Dr. Paul Conti: So that can lead people to a worse place. Right? So so I think the idea of biting off Small pieces, so to speak, where a person is writing, right, or is talking. But I think if one is writing, it is good to communicate with another, Right? Another trusted person.[1:17:59] Dr. Paul Conti: And if there's not someone in one's personal life, you know, they're clergy members. Even if one isn't affiliated with an organized religion, You could probably go places and get a clergy to wanna help you. Right? I mean, there are people out there who want to help other people. So who say, what if someone has no one?[1:18:14] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, Almost never do we have no one here. Right? Because we could probably go find someone, but we we we need to take that in pieces. So there's some risk to trying to do the intensive thing, you know, on one's own, and and that's why I would put in if if a person's having suicidal thoughts or even thoughts of death, of not wanting to be I I don't deserve to be alive. I mean, these are warning signs for really getting help.[1:18:37] Dr. Paul Conti: So there are some signs that say, hey. Don't try and do that on your own. Right? Go go try and find a resource, and it's you know, things that get to that level of severity of, and often a person knows that. I mean, am I in a place where I know I'm not healthy, and I'm I'm having, you know, kinda scary thoughts, then then we need that that's a person who really shouldn't be doing that on their own.[1:18:57] Dr. Paul Conti: Great.[1:18:57] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that. Yeah.[1:18:58] Dr. Paul Conti: You're welcome.[1:18:59] Andrew Huberman: So we've been talking a lot about talking. Mhmm. And, now I'd like to talk a little bit about chemistry. Yes. Drugs.[1:19:07] Andrew Huberman: Yes. So maybe first we could talk prescription drugs. I mean, you're a psychiatrist, so you're approved to and presumably do prescribe medication, where where appropriate. And this is a vast landscape, of course. We've got ADHD.[1:19:22] Andrew Huberman: And I should just tell you, I get more questions about ADHD and the drugs related to ADHD and dopamine than any other topic.[1:19:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[1:19:30] Andrew Huberman: Any other topic. So there's ADHD. There's OCD. There's Depression, there's antidepressants, and so forth. Is there some way that we can, you know, wrap our arms around all of that As a way of wading into this, this drug question, and just address, you know, how does one decide when medication is Useful because in the end, the dissection tool that the psychiatrist or his therapist has is language.[1:19:56] Andrew Huberman: And at some point, one has to make an assessment about Dopamine or serotonin or whether or not a given drug would help, and most therapies, I believe, don't involve, putting someone in a brain scanner. To my knowledge, there still is not a very good blood test to assess. Oh, is this person's dopamine low or high? Correct me if I'm wrong. And ultimately, that But and I know there are companies out there, so I'm not trying to undermine those companies.[1:20:20] Andrew Huberman: But if I happen to do that in the statement, if if you take a blood test and find that your serotonin metabolites are low, My understanding is it's possible that you are too low in serotonin in the brain, but that's a very indirect window into what's really going on. So how do how does That how do you think about prescription drugs in the context of treating, trauma and other and other conditions? And then maybe we'll drill into some of the more specific conditions.[1:20:46] Dr. Paul Conti: Sure. I mean, I would first comment that, right, there aren't tests for these things, and I think the test for Tabilies. I mean, things are so different. You know, by the time what we're talking about has been metabolized, you know, often to some very significant left the brain. Now it's in the peripheral blood that we really don't learn from that.[1:21:04] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think that we tend to overutilize Medicines in this country, because we have a health care system that that often that's so based on throughput that we wanna Polish the hood when there's a problem in the engine. Right? So we overutilize medicines often as an endpoint. Right? Oh, we're gonna make that person's depression better with an antidepressant.[1:21:25] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, I mean, maybe. Right? But most of the time, it's for the person's depression to really get better and stay better. They need to unravel what's driving the depression. Right.[1:21:35] Dr. Paul Conti: So the 1st step is I think there are 2 steps to it. Right? The 1st assessment step is, is there a diagnosis that That the vast majority of the time, if not, sometimes all the time, really warrants a medicine. So the bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD. Right?[1:21:55] Dr. Paul Conti: These are diagnoses that we we understand more about them and what's going on in the brain and how medicines can Treat or stabilize them, which doesn't mean the medicine is necessarily it's not a substitute for therapy. Right? But sometimes the medicine and therapy can go Hand in hands over OCD, for example, warrants therapy, but it almost not always, but it almost always warrants medicine too So that you can ease the systems that are making the rigidity and the repetition in the brain. So so the first kind of branch point can be, What is the diagnosis? What is the level of severity?[1:22:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And I think that that's very, very important. Where I think it's a little more maybe even interesting is using medicines to help the person engage in the therapy as productively as possible. And And here's where I think we're so limited by how we categorize medicines and this sort of pharmaceutical Insurance driven, medical system we have that I think throws us off in tremendous ways. So you think about how Medicines are categorized, so antidepressants.[1:23:05] Dr. Paul Conti: And the vast majority of people who are helped by antidepressants, they're not they don't have clinically severe depression. Right? Those medicines create more distress tolerance in us. And if you think about how helpful that can be, if you're gonna go now you're gonna do something difficult, or you're gonna bring That trauma or the stressors to the surface, and you're gonna process it, and you're gonna try and make life change, if we can make more distress tolerance in us, that can be so so much Better. Right?[1:23:32] Dr. Paul Conti: And think about the category of medicines that are called antipsychotics, which would really puts people off. Right? Mhmm. But but Most of the prescriptions for antipsychotics are not for psychosis. Right?[1:23:43] Dr. Paul Conti: And there are ways in which low dosing of some of those medicines can help intervene in negative pathways, right, in pathways that are about distress and, you know, sending out those tendrils of Neurons that are about hypervigilance and, avoidance, right, in our in our brain, and we can often get at that. And if you can improve someone's distress tolerance and you can Use medicines that that take away what clinically is rumination. Right? Not a not the standard meaning of that word, but the clinical meaning of it where There are distress centers in our brain that are overactive, and then we get stuck in these maladaptive negative pathways where we think about something over and over and over again With no real chance of solving it because that's not what's going on inside of us. So medicines can help with that, but we have to have some flexibility around their conception.[1:24:35] Dr. Paul Conti: And, you know, the modern medical system of a 15 minute visits, you know, to a psychiatrist that are that are weeks apart, I mean, I don't understand how how that goes well. Right? In the vast majority of times, I think it doesn't go well because it's not enough time To do the therapy, you can generate the understanding so then medicines get thrown at the person. This is how, you know, we use, I think, Approximately 5 times as much medicine, I think, across the board, they say, the Dutch population. Right?[1:25:03] Dr. Paul Conti: They think, why is 5 times more is a lot more medicine. Right? And, you know, they they have a health care system and a and a cultural system that, to the best of my understanding, is more rooted in taking responsibility for oneself. Right? So if a person comes in and cholesterol is high, right, the first order of business is, hey.[1:25:21] Dr. Paul Conti: You take better care of yourself. Like, this person really needs to lose some weight, exercise more. Right? They they're not just jumping to, like, let me give you a medicine and and, you know, and Shift shift you through the health care system and out the other side of the door. Right?[1:25:33] Dr. Paul Conti: And the same thing is true in mental health. You know? And I and I'm not trying to be critical to to the psychiatrists or the nurse practitioners or people who are practicing in that way, because oftentimes, there is no choice. Right? If they're working in a health care system That that the standard is is is, highly spaced or spaced apart 15 minute visits.[1:25:56] Dr. Paul Conti: What alternative is there, right, but to look at okay. I'm gonna use medicines because I don't have another tool to bring to bear. So I think the health care system and its focus on throughput and its short term talk about you know, we talk about short term response. Right? Short term soothing at the expense of long term health, And I think that is the metaphor for that applies to our health care system, right, where if if we if we are gonna try and treat a symptom a short term, we're gonna do it in a 15 minute visit.[1:26:25] Dr. Paul Conti: That we're gonna do it in a way that maybe it soothes the symptom, maybe it doesn't, but it does not get at The problem, we need to invest more resources to get at the problem, and I think that's where a sort of protest you know, if people, As a society, we say, look. We don't like the way our health care is going. Like, we need more focus on what the actual problems are That, yes, we would spend more money, you know, treating people and taking care of people because it's more human time, but, ultimately, Less suffering, less death, right, and, ultimately, more productivity. I think, as an economy, we would Save so much money if we spend money on the human aspects of mental health care because people would be more functional. They're spending less time in the hospital.[1:27:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? They they're they're more productive when they're working. There's less entry into the criminal criminal justice system. So so I think medicines get Overused in part for systemic reasons, in large part for systemic reasons, and also for some of these categorization reasons. Oh, that person meets Some technical criteria for depression.[1:27:29] Dr. Paul Conti: We gotta give them this medicine instead of really thinking, wait. What's going on in this person? And I see this over and over again. I see this one is on 7 medicines, And they're on 7 medicines to treat 7 different symptoms, and now they have side effects from all those 7 medicines. Maybe 2 of them are to treat the side effects from the other 5.[1:27:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And That's bad. Right? And if you really get at what's going on in them, now they're doing much better, and maybe they're on 2 medicines. Right?[1:27:55] Dr. Paul Conti: So I I don't know if that's an a helpful answer to that.[1:27:58] Andrew Huberman: It is. It's a very helpful answer. I I mean, I think, at least in the spheres that I run these days, I hear a lot of negative statements about antidepressants. I think, you know, I'm old enough to remember the book, Listening to Prozac, and[1:28:10] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah.[1:28:10] Andrew Huberman: I remember when Prozac and and its, And things like it first started showing up and the excitement, and then nowadays, I hear more about the problems with all these drugs. You know? And and maybe that's just because I have arms in the both the scientific, but also in the kind of wellness community where people think a lot about behavioral change. Fortunately, I think that's it that they do that. Of course, these drugs, as you mentioned, can have enormous utility as well.[1:28:35] Andrew Huberman: Yes. I'd like to just pick up on 1 theme, that I haven't heard a lot about Anywhere else, which is the short term versus the long term use of these drugs. Because I could imagine, you know, someone feeling like they're finally gonna tackle something that's Been inside them for a long time, either because they're really struggling or because they're just done with not working it through. Mhmm. And, and they decide to start a medication, that would give them higher levels of distress tolerance for a short while.[1:29:05] Andrew Huberman: Mean, is there anything to say that someone couldn't take up, properly prescribed medication for a week Or for, the 1st 3 months of the work, and then know that they can come off it. Because I think that the the black and white model of okay. You're either gonna start this drug and stay on Forever or be taking some drugs forever Right. Or you're not gonna take anything. I mean, that just seems to life doesn't Does life have to work that way?[1:29:30] Andrew Huberman: Right. Is there is there a short term use that can be effective?[1:29:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. In American medicine, We are so much better at starting medicines than we are at taking them away.[1:29:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And part of that, I think, is driven by the Such a strong presence of the pharmaceutical industry, and the pharmaceutical industry does a lot of very good things. Right? But, You know, there there's such thing as too much of a good thing. Right?[1:29:57] Dr. Paul Conti: And then as a society, when something seems positive, this, I think, also is human nature. We can overinvest in it. Right? So you think about when Prozac and those kinds of medicines came out, they were safer medicines. They're billed as antidepressants, and the thought was, well, they're gonna fix depression.[1:30:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And it's not how that works. Right? So if we look at them as tools, right, then we can deploy them Sometimes for the longer term, because sometimes that's necessary, but absolutely for the shorter term. I mean, absolutely.[1:30:28] Dr. Paul Conti: If we thought of Prozac and those kind of medicines, not as, oh, they're antidepressants. We thought, look. What they do is they they They seem to make there be more serotonin in certain circuits that are important for mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance. So those medicines can really help somebody if they're very severely depressed, and we wanna sort of get get them feeling better. They can also help someone if they could eat use more distress Tolerance in a discrete period of time.[1:30:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? When we think about them that way, we think about them as tools that we could apply for short term or long term. We don't See them as fixes. Right? And we don't see them as then substitutes for the human to human work that needs to be done.[1:31:13] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, I've, You know, BIN is so in my training at times in health care systems, and I've seen in many other circumstances, that look at medicines as answers and this idea that, Oh, that person is, and a lot of times, there'll be a number. Right? Right? The number is the diagnosis, and that number gets this medicine. And, like, I'm not Sure.[1:31:33] Dr. Paul Conti: We could be more misguided than that, and that's what leads to adding medicines. Adding medicines is not working. Of course, it's not working, know, because no one's really paying attention to what's going on, so add more medicines and then medicines for the medicines. And, I mean, we know this is true. We we we know this is true, But we haven't had the wherewithal as a society to say, like, with a lot of things in society, to say, hey.[1:31:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, this isn't okay. Right? I mean, we need more. Like, give these people who are trying to help us, they need more latitude to help us, or we need more human to human contact to get at what's really going on. And, yes, that's an investment of time and energy and money in the short term, and sometimes that's money from the systems.[1:32:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But if we do that, My goodness. Look at the look at the payoff of that.[1:32:18] Andrew Huberman: What is your thought about anxiety and ADHD As a separate phenomena in terms of medication, again, ADHD is the the Thing that seems to come up most in questions, I can't tell you the number of especially students, but also young working professionals and, even people who are, You know, outside those categories who are interested in or taking, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil, or Vyvanse because they seem to struggle focusing without it or and I don't know because I'm not one of those individuals, or because they seem to just like how well they can focus when they do take those compounds. And so my understanding is these compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission in the brain, also, adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain. So they're more or less stimulants. They look a lot like at least chemically, they look a lot like cocaine and amphetamine, although they're they're not quite cocaine and amphetamine. So should we be concerned about this?[1:33:22] Andrew Huberman: Is this a a a different sort of epidemic? Can these drugs be used to Train the brain to focus, and then people can withdraw from these drugs. I mean, I I think this is a huge topic and one that maybe warrants its own episode entirely. But As long as we're on the topic, what are your thoughts about medication for ADHD? Sure.[1:33:41] Andrew Huberman: Medication for ADHD Can be extremely effective,[1:33:44] Dr. Paul Conti: and the studies show show us that. Right? They show us that if there is ADD, Then medication for ADD is very, very helpful, and that's true in youths. It seems to be true if adults have adult ADHD or ADD. Like, we we kind of know that's true, but all attention deficit is not attention deficit disorder.[1:34:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And there we go to the Reflexive 15 minute visits, throw medicines at things. Right? Attention deficit can come from many, many places, and one of them is Anxiety. Right?[1:34:20] Dr. Paul Conti: There there's so many other reasons. Depression affects attention. Poor sleep affects attention. Poor diet can affect attention. Stress in life can affect attention.[1:34:29] Dr. Paul Conti: So and and certainly trauma and the thing the the problems that trauma spins off can affect attention. So, You know, this is really the the this is, really the truth that while teaching once about medicines and pharmacology, I I was frustrated about how the answer to everything was, like, what medicine do we use? What medicine do we use? As opposed to, like, this is just 1 piece of the puzzle. And I told an anecdote, which I think it was a clinical anecdote.[1:34:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, what do you think is going on? And I think that if I told that to, I don't know. Middle school students or something. They would probably say, you just told the story of a person with a rock in their shoe, which is what I the story that I was actually telling. Right?[1:35:10] Dr. Paul Conti: But Several people I was talking to, their physicians, right, who ADD. Right? It's like, no. Every time the person steps down, the rock hurts. Mhmm.[1:35:19] Dr. Paul Conti: And they're not able to maintain attention. Right? Like, that's what's going on, but we're so programmed to think about medicines And inappropriate use of ADD medicines. As you said, there's dopaminergic impact. There's epinephrine, norepinephrine impact.[1:35:34] Dr. Paul Conti: We're affecting what are called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors that, like, really need to be helped if there's real ADD. But if there isn't, that is not a good thing to do, Which is why it it is quite fascinating that when people have ADD, they tolerate generally stimulants very well Without the other problems that can come of stimulants and and, again, I don't know I I don't claim to know why that is, but we we see that phenomenon. But when people are being treated for ADD and they don't have ADD, which sometimes they know they don't have ADD, but the stimulants make them function better, so they go to somebody and get the stimulants, That's that's not a good thing to do. Right? Because because stimulants, when they're not needed over time, they do affect our physical function.[1:36:17] Dr. Paul Conti: They affect our judgment. Right? There are a lot of negative things that come from that. They can affect the vigilance inside of us. So so, Yes.[1:36:24] Dr. Paul Conti: It's a valid diagnosis, but it gets made when it's not present very often, which we see with a lot of diagnoses that you can throw medicine at. We see the thing with bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder is extremely important to utilize medicines effectively, but how many people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder who have They absolutely don't have bipolar disorder, but it's a it could be a catchall diagnosis because there's, in a sense, something to do for it in quotes. Right? And you can throw medicine at it.[1:36:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So, I mean, what do we expect? Right? If we have if we have a health care system where you get 15 minute visits with your psychiatrist, of course, we're gonna throw medicines at everything, And then the training paradigms are gonna look at it through that lens. And then very often again, I give the example of seeing somebody on 7 medicines.[1:37:11] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, the first thought I have is how many of those medicines are actually counterproductive? And a lot of the time it's not like, oh, every now and then, one is counterproductive. No. That's Case. That's the case a lot of the time.[1:37:24] Dr. Paul Conti: And, again, I come back to if we're not putting thought into it, what other result would we expect?[1:37:31] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that answer. I I'm very curious what constitutes negative effects of stimulants. So if somebody's taking Adderall or Ritalin in order to work longer hours or focus because they have attention deficit, but not necessarily ADHD. And, again, I'm not recommending anyone do this. I've just heard numbers that have come back, at least from surveys and discussions with colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere, other college campuses, that Upwards of 75% of college students use semi regularly these drugs off not by prescription, just to study and to learn.[1:38:05] Andrew Huberman: Yes. I can imagine sleep issues because people because these are stimulants. What sorts of other issues can they create for people? Problems that you can create.[1:38:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Mean, I I think a a touchstone maybe for that's running through our conversation, right, is prioritizing the short term benefit over Solving a long term problem, right, which we might say is a human tendency, and and we see it across the topics that we're discussing. So so Short term use of stimulants, sure, people are more alert. They can stay awake more. They can study more intensely and longer. Okay.[1:38:39] Dr. Paul Conti: There's some short term benefit of that over there. Even there, there can be problems. Right? There there but but we can we can say let let's just say, for sake of argument, that in the short term, there's something to be gained by doing that. Right?[1:38:49] Dr. Paul Conti: But, oh my goodness, there's so much that is there's so much risk to that. Right? And how many times have I seen someone who they're doing that, and they're just doing that to study? Right? And now they're addicted to the amphetamines, and their behavior changes, And they don't know it.[1:39:06] Dr. Paul Conti: Talk about shifting our brain towards a more defensive, you know, sort of suspicious Outward look, you know, view of the world that we see a lot of that. So we see judgment impairment. We see heightened levels of anxiety. We see more impulsivity in decision making, and and sometimes we it can get to the point of seeing frank psychosis. Now that's not common, but have I seen Young people who've done exactly what you're describing.[1:39:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? They're they're using, they're using Adderall or they're using Ritalin to study, and then I see them when they're coming into the hospital. They're screaming about how someone's trying to hurt them. Boy, then it's the worst case scenario, but it shows, like, that's where that can go, And how much is there between the, oh, I'm just using it to study, and that severe, you know, outcome that is actually quite negative For a person, it might change how they think about that friendship or that relationship. Right?[1:40:00] Dr. Paul Conti: A lot negative happens when we change our brains Without an ability to see, like, what is it actually doing to us? So which is part of my my whole theme about trauma. Right? It changes our brains, and we don't know it. Right?[1:40:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, the same can be the same is often true of amphetamines used inappropriately. It shifts our brain, And and we don't realize that we're a little bit more impulsive in our decision making, a little bit less trusting. These are significant negative things that If we don't know it, the person will just say, well, I'm, oh, I'm just using it to study. I'm using it to work more. That's not, you know, that's not without its high level of risk.[1:40:37] Andrew Huberman: What are your thoughts on cannabis? I've said it many times on this podcast before. I'll say again. I I feel fortunate that I've never really been attracted to alcohol or drugs of any kind, in in so much so that if all the alcohol and all the marijuana and all the cocaine amphetamine disappeared, I I wouldn't notice any change in my life. Right?[1:40:59] Andrew Huberman: And I feel lucky in that way because I know a lot of people feel, an attraction to these things is almost a gravitational force. From their 1st drink, they just feel I once heard it described in this I I think it was in Augustin Burrows' book, dry, where He was an alcoholic. He said that the 1st drink he had, it felt like this magic elixir that that meshed with the physiology of his Blood in the most seamless way. And as I was reading this, I thought, oh my goodness. First of all, that's the most foreign, experience for me in terms of alcohol.[1:41:29] Andrew Huberman: And second, gosh, that must be terrible, and and you can but at the same time, you could really understand why someone would be drawn to that. So Yes. Cannabis Nowadays is, legal or decriminalized in many areas of the US. A lot of people seem to use the argument, It's not it's better than drinking, or they only do it for sleep or anxiety management. I'm not looking to demonize or support the the the cannabis.[1:41:57] Andrew Huberman: So what are your thoughts about cannabis for anxiety management, Depression and maybe even for ADHD for that matter.[1:42:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Sure. If I could make it an alcohol comment. Right? The number of times I've seen alcohol, Like, having been a good idea for coping with something approaches 0. Right?[1:42:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, the alcohol for coping is just never Good. And there's an additional risk factor that there's certain genetic profiles where people respond Strongly to alcohol, like, as you're saying, it's not just, oh, there's a little bit of short term relief of distress, but there's this sort of euphoric response. And those genetics, We know we don't understand them completely. They seem to be in Northern European populations, more prevalent as you head west in Northern Europe. So we understand that where risk factors are demographically, but we can't pinpoint that for any 1 person.[1:42:48] Dr. Paul Conti: And there's a tremendous risk of that, when when a person responds so strongly to alcohol or habituates coping to alcohol, cannabis is a little bit of a different story. I mean, How I have seen that play out and, again, this isn't coming from any expertise around neuro either neuropharmacology of it. Like, how is this really working in the brain? It comes from an observation that what it seems to do is to narrow our attentional perspective. Right?[1:43:15] Dr. Paul Conti: So it's why people will say, well, they wanna, They wanna use cannabis before watching a movie with friends or something. Right? And and think, okay. I think why people are doing that is because A cognitive spectrum narrows, and then instead of worrying about that thing at work or that relationship issue, one can just be present, right, for For it gates out other attentional intrusions. Right?[1:43:36] Dr. Paul Conti: So in some ways, I mean, I've absolutely seen it Be helpful to people. I mean, it's been legalized in Oregon, which is where my I spend a lot of my time, and it's it's not where all of my practice is. But what what I have seen is it is, at times, helpful, save around sleep. Right? Because a person can gate out other intrusive thoughts, and they can just relax and go to sleep.[1:43:56] Dr. Paul Conti: But there can be another side of that too that at higher levels of distress, at higher levels of tension, what it can do is narrow the focus of Cognition to the thing that is negative. Right? So so the idea that, oh, like, oh, this is a treatment for, you know, depression, anxiety, trauma is not true. Right? Can it be helpful under certain circumstances?[1:44:19] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I think the answer to that is yeah. I mean, I know the answer to that is yes because I've seen it play out clinically that way, But it can also be harmful too. So there, again, like anything that has any power, power to influence our brains, We wanna be thoughtful and careful about it. I mean, do I think that it's safer than alcohol? Yes.[1:44:37] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, I mean, like, we we so clearly see that. Does that mean it was just uniformly safe? No. Right? So we wanna be respectful of anything that can change how our brain is Working, and I think that includes certainly includes alcohol, and I think it certainly includes cannabis too.[1:44:53] Andrew Huberman: I'd love to talk about psychedelics, for two reasons. 1, there seems to be a tremendous amount of interest in psychedelics as a therapeutic clinical tool. I know there's also recreational use, and I'll just preface all this by saying that, my stance is, We absolutely know for sure that these are controlled substances. They're illegal to possess, sell, or use in most of the country. There are a few areas where, they are decriminalized.[1:45:21] Andrew Huberman: Yes. And psychedelics is a broad category, of course, and we can touch on some of the different, different ones. But whereas 5 years or so 5 years ago or so, I was truly afraid to say the word psychedelics in any kind of public venue. There are laboratories at Stanford working on Ketamine, Psilocybin, MDMA, mostly in animal models. There's terrific work Going on at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Matthew Johnson's lab and others, looking at the clinical applications mainly of high dose psilocybin and LSD.[1:45:56] Andrew Huberman: There's the MAPS trials with MDMA. So nowadays, it's safe for an academic like me to say the word psychedelics, and I'm I'd love to approach this question of psychedelics from a Place of of true exploration and curiosity, but with the preface that, we're talking about this in a in a legal clinical setting. Yeah. And The legality is something that's now in process. Mhmm.[1:46:19] Andrew Huberman: I don't think it's completed, but that's my understanding. But there are trials. There are You can go to clinical trials .gov, and put in MDMA, and you'll see a bunch of clinical trials that are are happening in the recruiting subjects. So I think it's safe to have the conversation now, and, I'd love your thoughts about psychedelics. Maybe we could start with, Psilocybin and LSD as a as a broad category of drugs that, at least, my understanding is they touch on mainly the serotonin systems, some specific Receptor activation and modulation tend to change notions of space and time, adjust internal state.[1:46:57] Andrew Huberman: Maybe we would start there, and then maybe venture into some of the other ones. So what are your thoughts on these drugs for its therapeutic potential, also potential hazards, etcetera.[1:47:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. I think if we look at the true psychedelics, so psilocybin and LSD, because ketamine and MDMA, they're different categories of medicine. They're these So the novel tools to bring to bear, but if we start with psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, I think Why it is why they have gained so much momentum over the last several years is because the data Coming from the the labs and the academic centers, is so powerfully positive. And as someone who's I'm interested in anything that's potentially helpful. Right?[1:47:42] Dr. Paul Conti: And I wanna learn and understand that because a lot of things that are potentially helpful, know, you go and look at the data, and you see that that's not helpful, whether that's harmful. I think what we have seen with psychedelics is That they're so helpful. Right? And and the trials are bearing that out. And, of course, these are used in professional hands and with the right kind of guidance.[1:48:02] Dr. Paul Conti: They're Extremely powerful tools, but used in the right way by by someone who knows how to utilize them in the right set and setting can have an immense Positive impact, and that's why I think that that the thought is there across people, and more and more people feel comfortable saying it and talking about it. I Mean that we're in the state of Oregon now where where the the thought is we're moving towards legalization of psilocybin early in 2023, And it's part of the new data, right, and how it meshes with the older data, right, how it meshes with data from the sixties seventies that showed such a strong, powerful impact of these medicines. And I have a whole set of thoughts about what's happening there, and they're just they're conjectures. Right? But But my read of you know, as best I can try and understand the neuroscience and and the and the clinical applicability and the changes is You know, what happens is we see less communication, less chatter in the outer parts of the brain, right, the outer parts of the cortex.[1:49:04] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think that As human beings, we sort of glorify the parts of the brain that only we have. I mean, certainly, in my growing up, Right. I mean, what did I learn even if you think about, like, learning about the brain in high school? Right? I learned that, like, wow.[1:49:19] Dr. Paul Conti: We're we're great as humans because we have language, and other animals don't, and we can use tools. And, like, aren't we so great because we have this part of the brain that other animals don't, and it lets us Function. Right? Okay. There's some truth to that, right, that that that we can do things others can't do, but we We get lost often in the outer parts of the cortex, which I think are about survival.[1:49:46] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. So we come back to the things you and I talked about early on of, like, why are these trauma mechanisms in us? Right? So so much of what's going on in our brains is about survival, And I think living, so to speak, in the cortex, right, in the outer part of the brain is consistent with a focus on survival. So if you think that's where language is, that's where vision is, that's where executive function is, so planning and tact task execution, So so much of that is about making our way in the world around us, so we tend to glorify that and think, well, that's, In a sense, where our existence is.[1:50:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And I believe that is not true. Right? And, again, can I say that for sure? Of course not.[1:50:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But my read of 20 years of doing clinical work and thinking about all sorts of medicines and and thinking about the psychedelics with a in a lot of depth, I think that what they do is they take us out of the cortex. Right? Because that's where we run into these problems. That's where we bounce things over and over again that the Dress centers deep in our brain, in the brain stem, kind of ally with the outer parts of the cortex, and they say, right.[1:50:51] Dr. Paul Conti: We're in distress. We wanna stay alive. You know, often, a lot of us have had trauma that makes these changes in the brain, and then we're thinking all the time. Like, what would I do if if there were War. What would I do if there's civil war, if someone bombs us?[1:51:05] Dr. Paul Conti: What will I do if the if the economy collapses? Right? What will I do if somebody gets sick? We're we're thinking all this future projection that is all coming from a place of fear. Right?[1:51:15] Dr. Paul Conti: It's all coming from a desire to Think about things that control the future with this part of the brain that is so uniquely human. Right? And I think when we Take the neurotransmission out of those places. Right? And we set it in a part of the brain and say the insular cortex.[1:51:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? The parts of the brain that are sort of in the middle, right, which which I think I believe is where our humanness really is. So the psychedelics make there be less chatter, communication in these other parts of the brain, and then we become seated in the part of the brain Today, I believe, is most about our experience of true humanness, which is why when you read about, you know, people who have experiences that I've heard about, and people talk to me about this. Right? They they've they've utilized it.[1:52:00] Dr. Paul Conti: They talk with me. So whether it's someone telling me their story or it's coming from research data, Really, we feel a sense of compassion for ourselves. We relieve ourselves, release ourselves from guilt, and and it's like, why is this so helpful to people? And I think it's because it can do what we are trying to get at in good therapy, but it can really catalyze that By just putting a person in that part of the brain that can see it for what it is without all that chatter in the cortex about how you gotta think it's your fault, or you won't avoid it again, and and that makes the repetition compulsion. How do I think ahead to the next thing that might happen, and what else bad might happen?[1:52:44] Dr. Paul Conti: I We we don't get anywhere doing that. And I think where we get somewhere is when we seed ourselves deeper in the brain, which I think we do if if we're, like, doing really good therapy and we're, know, we're we're in the deep parts of the brain, but these these psychedelics, the medicinal value, I believe, is putting us in that part of the brain Where a person can really find truth, and that's why I think that that that it's come so far in these few years because I I I think that is very clinically Evident, and I think we're gonna see more and more the value of that and how what the psychedelics do can become, I believe, a heuristic for understanding, like, wait. How are our brains really functioning, and what are the parts that really matter to our experience of being Human. It's those parts of the brain, right, the deep parts of the brain, the insular cortex and the and the areas around it that say light up when a person has And, an experience of spiritual ecstasy or an experience of connection with another person. Right?[1:53:45] Dr. Paul Conti: We we kind of have these telltale markers that Something is going on there that's very important and very special, and I think we're more attracted to the outer parts of the brain and particles are easier to study. Right? I mean, as you know better than I do, we started studying the brain through lesion studies. Right? Because it's easy to or to see if a person got hurt in this part of the brain or had a stroke in that part of the brain, Changes.[1:54:06] Dr. Paul Conti: So we look at the cortex because, one, it's easier to study, and we tend to glorify it. And I think that has been misguided, and I think that we're learning how about how that's been misguided through the study of these, You know, novel modalities from Western perspectives would, of course, they've been used for a long, long time in other cultures, but novel from our perspective.[1:54:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm fascinated by this idea that the in these middle brain structures is is where our humanity lies. And and as you said, I also wonder whether or not Other animals experience life more from that orientation with less chatter. We we can only guess, but, you know, that the dog lover and and, being in the presence of animals that seem to just be present in what's happening in their immediate environment, not Too much anticipation. Ascension.[1:54:59] Dr. Paul Conti: What you're talking about is sentience is important, and extensions is extremely important. Right? And if we're gonna overvalue, say, language, Then I think we undervalue sentience. Right? Which is why I think we tend to undervalue animals.[1:55:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and their suffering, because, well, they're not saying anything about it. Right? And, You know, they're not writing about it. So, okay, it's easy to ignore, and and we think about, again, the hubris of that.[1:55:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? The oh, because we can think and talk and write. Like, we must be feeling more than than species that don't do that. I mean, I think I I I think that that is so true, and that we're gonna understand more about sentience and other species and how, You[1:55:35] Andrew Huberman: know, that's at the core of existence, and my hope would be that we value more humans And animals, right, through through the evolution of that understanding. The hallucinations that accompany, psychedelics like, LSD and psilocybin have such an attractive force to them as as a concept and and as an experience. And so I think most often when people hear hallucinogens, they think and psychedelics, they think about hallucinating. Right. Makes sense why they would.[1:56:08] Andrew Huberman: Right. But what's so interesting to me is nothing in your answer about psychedelics, psilocybin and LSD, He focused on hallucinations[1:56:17] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[1:56:17] Andrew Huberman: Per se. It was more about feeling states, accessing a feeling state or a relation to an event or to a person or to oneself. Maybe even I I caught hints of maybe even empathy for oneself Yes. For the first time.[1:56:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[1:56:29] Andrew Huberman: None of that had to do with seeing, seeing sounds or or, hearing colors and, you know, these kind of cliche statements about, hallucinations. So, I am aware of laboratories. 1 at University California Davis in particular, but a few others that are trying to generate chemical variants of of of psychedelics that lack the hallucinogenic properties[1:56:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[1:56:53] Andrew Huberman: But maintain these other properties as therapeutic tools. And as I say that, I realize that People in the psychedelic community, are probably thinking, oh, that's horrible. That's, the dismantling of of the the core thing. But The simple question is, do you think the hallucinations are valuable for anything?[1:57:10] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think we're really getting into the into the philosophical. Right? The ontological. Right? This is sort trying to understand being.[1:57:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And I don't claim to know the answer to that. I think that At times, it seems like the hallucinations have a metaphorical or a symbolic, way of being helpful. Right? Because people will come to understand things that that they hold dear and true After the experience, right, that that often, not always, come through the lens of of the hallucination.[1:57:46] Dr. Paul Conti: So are the hallucinations necessary? Are those hallucinations sometimes important, sometimes not? We think we don't understand that, and I think we wanna be Respectful of the of sort of mystery of that. But what I think is fascinating is when you think about, like, substance abuse and what that what that means is, Well, one aspect of that is that a person has experiences thoughts, conceptions of self, and the world with the substance that without the substance, they know are wrong. Right?[1:58:14] Dr. Paul Conti: People talk about, you know, liquid courage. Right? And, okay, I feel better about myself, and I feel courageous because I've had a couple of drinks. Now when I and I after that, I feel, like, normal about myself, and that that was false. Right?[1:58:25] Dr. Paul Conti: And and we see that. Like, that's part of what substance intoxication means. Right? But what we see with The psychedelic medicines is something that's incredibly different. Right?[1:58:35] Dr. Paul Conti: That people are having experiences that are so delinked From our normal experience of reality, and then when they come, in a sense, back online with with in a normal cognitive way, They realize like, wow. Now I'm applying all those mechanisms of trying to understand truth and to to that, and what what I see is that it's true, And, wow, it's true. Like, I mean, we hear that all the time, which tells me, hey. Something different is going on there. And, of course, these are Powerful tools so misused, like, very bad things can happen.[1:59:05] Dr. Paul Conti: But you think about the clinical utility, and what does it mean that so many people Change for the healthier or even change their lives after an experience because it so resonates. It's like, oh, now I understand something that's true, and it's not something bizarre. It's like I wasn't responsible for being raped that time or, you know, I I you know, I'm not less than even though my sexuality or my gender identity is different from Some silly binary concept. Right? Like, people kinda can't often get it, and they feel differently about themselves, and guilt and shame are impacted.[1:59:36] Dr. Paul Conti: So I think we're likely to see that they are Powerful anti trauma mechanisms, again, used clinically in the right hands, and and I think that we're also gonna see that they're a heuristic for understanding our brain That goes against what I see as some of the reflexive hubris of, well, the outer parts must be the best because that's what makes us human and other animals don't have it, and we're better because we're human. I mean, it makes no sense. You know?[2:00:01] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to talk about MDMA. Mhmm. And I'll preface this by saying I was a participant. Actually, technically, I'm still a participant in a clinical trial, so I have experience of doing it twice. The the trial involves 3 separate dosing of this.[2:00:18] Andrew Huberman: I was reluctant to do it outside of a clinical trial, mostly because I Was aware there can be some cardiac effects, and I like the idea there'd be a clinician on hand. And, I'll just say that I found the experiences to be, profound[2:00:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[2:00:33] Andrew Huberman: Beneficial, and very different from 1, 1 session to the next. The first one, felt, A whole collection of of ideas and relational things came up that felt very powerful and transformative, and I I do think that I learned there. I exported a number of things. My particular experience isn't relevant here, but the 2nd time, I expected it to be the same way. Mhmm.[2:00:58] Andrew Huberman: And it was very Mellow and relaxing and was was deeply tied to kind of, notions of acceptance. So there weren't all these revelations And, wow, new insights. It was very much about sort of grounding into Mhmm. A a kind of a calmer state. So I have the the personal experience of Of benefiting from these in ways I think still benefit me, and was very struck by the power of MDMA, and my Very crude understanding of the pharmacology and the state that is being under MDMA is that it encourages or increases dopaminergic transmission, But also, serotonergic transmission[2:01:37] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah.[2:01:37] Andrew Huberman: Which is, to my knowledge, a kind of a rare state for the brain to be in. That, typically, it's more of a seesaw Dopaminergic drive towards external goals or more serotonergic drive towards, you know, more placidity or comfort with what one already has. So with both those systems amplified, the only way I can describe it subjectively is that it everything sort of funneled back in, and it was almost like, a pursuit of inner landscape. Mhmm. And I can only imagine what it would be like in the context of of doing this With somebody else also taking MDMA, I have no idea what that's like.[2:02:13] Andrew Huberman: That's my report of the experience. I know that the experience can vary. What what are your thoughts about the the chemistry and the what what sorts of states Do you think MDMA is creating[2:02:25] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:02:26] Andrew Huberman: That can, explain why it's a useful therapeutic tool in some cases and and what sorts of cases those might be?[2:02:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Sure. Sure. I think but to clarify, I think part of what we're starting with is is, like, this is very different than the psychedelics, Right? Which are seeding our consciousness in these deep centers of the brain. Right?[2:02:44] Dr. Paul Conti: Whereas what MDMA is doing is sort of flooding with positive neurotransmitters, Right? In certain parts of the brain. And I think what that creates is a greater permissiveness inside to entertain or approach Different things. Right? So the so I think where we see it's tremendous.[2:03:03] Dr. Paul Conti: My read of the data is around potentially, and we're seeing in some of the trials, right, tremendous benefit for trauma. Right? And you think about what we were talking about earlier, how this reflexive guilt, Shame, hypervigilance, avoidance. Right? And when these systems are are flooded with these neurotransmitters, It's more permissive to to think about that, right, and to think about that without, again, all the chatter of that's your fault, or you're never gonna get anywhere because of that, or you know what that means.[2:03:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. They they could kinda go away, and then we can think about it in a way that isn't through the lens of fear. Right? And I think that's the power there is that there is permissive of Approaching something, contemplating something, you know, a different a a novelty. We talk about a de novo approach.[2:03:48] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think that's also why the experience can vary because you could also see how if you're not thinking about something, right, so there's not a clinical guidance Do it. You could you could be in a state where, like, I just feel good. Right? And I'm thinking about good things, and, like, that can feel good. Right?[2:04:06] Dr. Paul Conti: But it but that's not necessarily problem solving. Right? So the clinical guidance says, hey. Let's take that state and do something with it. Right?[2:04:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Let's now now that you're in this state, let's hey. Let's make hay. Well, the sun is shining. Right? You're in a state where we can look at things that are traumatic.[2:04:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? We can approach them from a de novo perspective, and I think it's part I think that explains why you had these different experiences from one to the other Because your brain is just in a state that's conducive to something. Right? But if there's not the the the mechanism to have that thing happen, like, conducive to something therapeutic, Then you might go there on your own, or you might just be in a state where you have a sense of well-being and and you sit with that.[2:04:46] Andrew Huberman: Which sort of seems like a waste to me. I mean, this is what I tell people when they ask about MDMA. I said I said, at least from my experience, that that the potential hazard there is that in that very high dopaminergic, serotonergic state, there were moments where I felt like I could get excited about any one specific concept That I might even just think about, for instance, you know, water and how nourishing it is, and really just go down the path of water and the world and all the water, and and you can, You know, you're in a, a state that is very prone to suggestion[2:05:19] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[2:05:19] Andrew Huberman: Internal suggestion, and so the guidance Turned out the guidance from the clinician turned out to be immensely valuable[2:05:25] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[2:05:25] Andrew Huberman: In allowing me to go into my own heads for bits of time, but then also to resurface and and share and changed in a way that to I'm trying to really get something out of it that was useful and that I could export. Because, of course, water is wonderful, but I'm not really interested in growing my Relationship to water. Yeah. And I really felt like in I could understand for the I never went to raves or anything. Growing up, I never did MDMA recreationally, But I I understood for the 1st time how people could get really attached to an environment and feel connected to things because I think with all that serotonin, you just feel connected to everything around you.[2:05:58] Andrew Huberman: Right. So I I think it's it's a slippery slope there, and and I don't know what the future of the clinical use of MDMA looks like. But I would hope that whoever's thinking about, I'm guiding these sessions. It's really thinking carefully also about evolving the practice to help people really move through in a sequential way so they can leave with something Valuable.[2:06:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. 100%. 100%. These are such powerful tools, and, again, if they're powerful tools, and we're using them without Respect for them. Right?[2:06:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Without clinical guidance, we incur risk. Right? I mean, you know, getting obsessed with water, well and it probably isn't gonna hurt you. Right? But if someone is out using it they're around other people, what one can feel positively about or become sort of in the short term battle can be very counterproductive.[2:06:46] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? There can be a lot of risk to that. So I think it it it it anchors back to these are very powerful Tools, we're coming to understand them much, much more, and we're coming to understand that they have immense potential to be helpful to us. But I Think and hope that that only also increases our respect for those modalities and What can come what negative can happen if we're if we're not respectful?[2:07:11] Andrew Huberman: This can be very interesting to see where all of this Goes in the next few years, not just in Oregon, but elsewhere. It's, one way or another, it's happening. It seems to have a momentum that is is not going to stop. So, Very exciting area, to be sure.[2:07:25] Dr. Paul Conti: I agree.[2:07:27] Andrew Huberman: I have a question about language. In your book, you talk about How we need to be careful about the use of language around trauma, and maybe problem solving and problem describing in general. You know, on at one extreme, you hear that, your brain and your body hear every word you say, and, you know, we have to be so careful with language. And that actually frightened me for a number of years because I would hear that, and I thought, gosh. If I just think that something is bad, now it's gonna hurt me worse, which itself is part of that whole, you know, packing down of of an issue.[2:08:00] Andrew Huberman: Very hard to avoid thoughts, without distraction. So that's one extreme. On the other hand, you know, I I can say, I can tell somebody I love them, with a tone of hatred. Mhmm. I can tell somebody I hate them with a tone of love.[2:08:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[2:08:19] Andrew Huberman: So How should we think about language in parsing trauma? And in your book, you talk about, you give some cautionary notes about, talking about depression, trauma, and PTSD in terms that that might diminish their real, severity in in some cases. And, and I was really struck by that. So maybe we just touch on, you know, how should we talk about these things in a way that, doesn't diminish them for ourselves or for other people? And, at the same time, honors the fact that there's a lot of trauma out there[2:08:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:08:51] Andrew Huberman: And, there's a lot of depression out there, and and we need to talk about it.[2:08:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. I think this a very complicated and, in many ways, convoluted topic. Like, I think it's it's wonderful that we have language, but, boy, language It leads us astray often too. When you think about how we how people define words, like what what someone says a word, what is it? Does a person know what that word means?[2:09:13] Dr. Paul Conti: What nuance are they taking from it? That we just have to be very careful what we're saying and what we're communicating. And I think this doesn't mean because, You know, there's a sort of phenomenon now where where people are trying to control language, I think, too much. Like, you can't say anything that someone else might find hurtful. You have to refer To people in ways they choose to be referred to, even if those are ways that others don't understand, or ways they themselves have decided, Or ways that might be psychologically or clinically unhelpful.[2:09:43] Dr. Paul Conti: So I think the over control of language is not Good. But I think the specificity of language of what are we trying to say, how are we defining it, or even the word trauma. Right? We're talking about trauma, so we wanna define what that means. Right?[2:09:56] Dr. Paul Conti: It doesn't just mean, like, oh, anything kinda negative. Right? Because then that dilutes it down to meaning nothing. Right? It also doesn't just mean, You know, injury in combat.[2:10:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, we have to talk about what that is. So I think anchoring it to something that rises to the magnitude of overwhelming our coping skills and changing us, Like, then, at least, I define it that way, and I can communicate that to you, and we can understand what we're talking about. Right? I think that another aspect of language, Well, again, we need this middle ground, and I don't think that it is okay for the over control of language to shut down expression, But we also have to acknowledge, you know, how we're so much less distanced from each other through social media.[2:10:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Think social media can do very, very good things, as hopefully we're doing now. Right? But it can also be used to harm people from a distance. Right? And how much hatefulness is there out there that I think comes from anger and frustration in people?[2:10:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Again, back to trauma, right, Where people just wanna be angry, and it's not really issues that they're talking about. But then there's a target of that anger, and and, You know, people feel beleaguered by that. And the the words that people use sometimes are so awful that someone reading that like, if you're in the demographic it's being targeted. Right? And you're reading that.[2:11:15] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, how does a person not feel not feel, be set upon, vulnerable? Right? And then I think that also fuels, you know, things like we just had. This is terrible shooting in Buffalo. Right?[2:11:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, just hate motivated. Right? And I think that because that kind of language becomes very real to people who may take it in. It fuels their hate, and then they do something to enact it, which, of course, creates greater feel and Fear and vulnerability. And I think there was some civility and decorum that was in our world not that long ago.[2:11:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I mean, you know, I'm in my early fifties. I'm not that old. Right? But I remember a time when when in political discourse, say, people were civil to one another.[2:11:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Now so much I mean, it's not all of it. Right? But there's an acceptance of things that are just bombastic. Right?[2:12:03] Dr. Paul Conti: It's like it's a circus sideshow sometimes of Of, you know, people being just angry and aggressive, and and it's not really linked to anything, although it's allegedly linked to something. But then other people's anger can Attached to it, and it's not about what it's about, but it's about aligning with the anger. And and I think that there is so much Damage that comes from that, and and I think, you know, should we have should it be okay that people Sometimes you're talking, communicating, using language in ways that would, like, get us suspended from middle school. Right? Ways I don't want my 8 year old to see.[2:12:39] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, is that really okay, or do we need to take a stand for, like, rational use of language? I don't want my use of language to be over controlled by someone who thinks they sort of understand better than the rest of us, how to communicate with us. Okay? I don't want that. What's stereotypically a sort of, idea of the left, say, right, at least in our society, but I also don't want language.[2:13:02] Dr. Paul Conti: You can be so angry And so aggressive that it is perpetuating or spreading vulnerability and that it facilitates Trauma. And and I think we could set standards as a society where we say, look. I don't I don't want anybody in power who's who's gonna behave that way. Right? I don't care if their whole agenda is, like, make Paul Conte's life better.[2:13:23] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm still not gonna vote for you, right, if you're behaving towards others in a way that's denigrating. You're behaving in a way that I feel essentially ashamed of. Right? And and I feel that a lot. Right?[2:13:33] Dr. Paul Conti: I see the politics you know, I see things play out. It's not always political. Of course, not always political, but I see things play out, and I think, oh my gosh. I feel embarrassed. Like, we we're we're somehow okay with this.[2:13:43] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, it doesn't matter which side of the political Spectrum it's coming to, and I think that's an indicator that what we're doing is really hurtful To us, people become more angry. They attach to the anger. People feel more beleaguered. There's more divisions between us, and it seems more and more like, well, we can only really Identify with people who are just like us, and, like, what does that really mean? I mean, the the divisions that it creates between us, and and that, you know, that promotes So many negative things.[2:14:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I mean, think about ways in which it promotes white supremacy. Right? It's just one example. Right?[2:14:17] Dr. Paul Conti: And we've seen that play out that this is really bad for us, And we've gotta look at that. I mean, if we don't look at that, I don't think as though something is going to happen. Like, something is happening. Right? It's happening now.[2:14:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I'm it really to my mind, it really seeps down into the soil of everything that we're talking about On all sides Yes. People are activated. People are are upset about one thing or the other.[2:14:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:14:45] Andrew Huberman: Right? No no one is immune from upset Regardless of political affiliation, and[2:14:50] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:14:51] Andrew Huberman: Everybody seems to be upset nowadays. And Right. As I was hearing you talk about this, I I feel a lot of resonance with what what you said, and I also am hoping you run for office. Thank you.[2:15:03] Dr. Paul Conti: So I don't think I have the gumption for that, But but thank you for that.[2:15:06] Andrew Huberman: No. That would be wonderful.[2:15:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Thank you.[2:15:09] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to talk about a concept of taking care of oneself. This comes up in the book. Yes. This is something we talk a lot about on this podcast. I mean, I think people have heard me blab endlessly, and I'll I'll probably go into the Grave telling people to get sunlight in their eyes when they can and to try and get proper sleep and to have a few tools for, reducing their anxiety in real time and and on and on and on.[2:15:33] Andrew Huberman: Right. You know, we hear about this concept of taking care of oneself, and and I think, At a surface level, it can sound a little bit light. You know? Oh, take care take care. Take good care.[2:15:45] Andrew Huberman: You know, we, But to me, it's a deep and powerful concept, and I was very, happy to see it in your book and also to learn a lot of of ideas about what that really looks like.[2:15:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[2:15:59] Andrew Huberman: Because whether or not somebody is in the early stages of considering whether or not they have Trauma or is in the deep stages of working that through or has made it through the tunnel some distance. Taking one care of oneself is an ongoing process. Yes. I'd love for you to just describe what taking care of oneself means to you as a clinician, and, Of course, the practices and things that you encourage people to do, but but how we should how should we think about taking care of oneself? Because on one extreme, you could imagine Massages or treats, vacations, and, chefs for hire that take care of everything for ourselves.[2:16:38] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And on the other extreme, you could Say, you know, leaning into life in a way that you're paying attention to small things while working very, very hard. So it's such a big concept, but how how do you think about taking care of oneself? How should I take care of of myself? How should people[2:16:55] Dr. Paul Conti: take care of themselves? Sure. I see here what I think is a very fascinating dichotomy. Right? That in some ways, like, think about how complex our brains are.[2:17:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? How complex our Psyche is our unconscious minds. Are there so much complexity there? But on the other hand, psychological concepts that are consistent with health are often very simple. Right?[2:17:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Which by which I don't mean light. Right? But but but simple, straightforward. Right? And and I think self care is absolutely Chefs or vacations or whatever a person has if the basics of self care aren't squared away, and it's not a light concept to say, like, look.[2:17:44] Dr. Paul Conti: Are you sleeping Enough. Right? Are you eating well? Are you getting natural light? Are you interacting with people who are good to interact with?[2:17:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Are you accepting Negative interactions in your life. Are you living in circumstances that make you feel okay or not? The the they're very, very basic premises, But so often, we're not looking at them at all. Right?[2:18:07] Dr. Paul Conti: We're not looking at them at all because we tend to skip over them, And we tend to skip over them either because, again, in some automatic way that sometimes is trauma driven, we're not gonna look at That, right, and often not taking care of ourselves can have the punishment, distraction. Right? There's so much that can come into that, Or our sense of power is is tied to not taking care of ourselves. I mean, I'll give you an example is I I tend to, for whatever reason, do reasonably well, with very poor self care. Right?[2:18:39] Dr. Paul Conti: And, like, that was very adaptive when I was into medical training. Right? And then, like, okay. I can I can eat a lot today? I cannot eat.[2:18:46] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I can sleep 2 hours. I can sleep 8. Right? I mean, overall, that's not good, And it hasn't been good for me as I've aged, but then I I I realized some but, look, I'm doing all these things that make myself healthier, but, like, what?[2:18:58] Dr. Paul Conti: I ignore that? Right? And why am I ignoring? That was a key question. Why am I ignoring it?[2:19:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Because somewhere inside of me is it was and still to some extent is This idea that my ability to be really functional, right, to generate success in the world around me is tied to my ability to do that. Right? That all but if I stop doing that, and now I'm like, I'm eating and sleeping regularly, then I'm gonna lose some edge. And so so and even I think about this all the time, but I I may realize, Hey. I'm also I'm not doing it inside.[2:19:26] Dr. Paul Conti: You know? And and I think it's really grounding to the basics, that really help Like, what are the basics of what I'm doing and not doing in my life? Diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure activities. I mean, Sunlight, I mean, I think immensely important and dramatically undervalued.[2:19:47] Andrew Huberman: I wanna thank you for that, and I I wanna thank you for today's discussion.

I mean, you obviously run an incredibly, A robust clinical practice that I'm aware that you're constantly trying to improve even though it's operating at the highest levels already.[2:20:08] Dr. Paul Conti: I appreciate that.[2:20:10] Andrew Huberman: I really the reason why you're here today is because I I've done a wide and deep search for people, in these areas, and There are so few who have the background in medical training and physiology, in the psychoanalytic and psychiatric realm, and also have, a grounding toward the future, you know, of what's coming, and who can encapsulate so many different Orientations and and bring them together into a coherent piece.
