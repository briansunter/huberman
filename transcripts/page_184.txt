Kronikle AI - Dr. Karen Parker: The Causes & Treatments for Autism - TranscriptDr. Karen Parker: The Causes & Treatments for Autism - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is doctor Karen Parker. Doctor Karen Parker directs the social neurosciences research program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The goal of her laboratory's research is to understand the biological basis of social functioning at every stage of the lifespan.[0:00:31] Andrew Huberman: So this includes the bonds that form between infant and parent or parents, As well as the bonds that occur between children as they grow up, which of course form the template for social functioning when we become adults. Doctor Parker's research is heavily focused on autism, and indeed on all forms of autism spectrum disorders. Today, we discuss autism. We talk about The prominent theories and current understanding of the biological basis for autism, as well as what still remains mysterious and unresolved about the causes of autism. You may have heard that the incidence or perhaps just the diagnosis of autism has dramatically increased in the last 10 to 15 years.[0:01:08] Andrew Huberman: And today, we discuss why it is, in fact, That the incidence, not just the diagnosis, but the incidence of autism has so dramatically increased. And perhaps most excitingly, Doctor Parker shares with us brand new research findings from her laboratory that point to a new understanding of what causes autism as well as a novel treatment for autism. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:01:46] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with Cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees.[0:02:15] Andrew Huberman: One of the best ways to make sure that those Temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And that's what 8 Sleep allows you to do. It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for almost 3 years now, And it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep, so much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my 8 Sleep, I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my 8 Sleep mattress cover. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman To get a $150 off their Pod 3 mattress cover, 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia.[0:03:07] Andrew Huberman: Again, That's 8 sleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has Everything you need and nothing you don't. That means 0 sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium. And that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body, but especially your nerve cells, your neurons, Relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.[0:03:33] Andrew Huberman: So when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system, your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved. I drink 1 packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning, As well as while I exercise, and if I sweat a lot during that exercise, I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise. Element comes in a variety of different flavors, all of which I find really tasty. I like the citrus. I like the watermelon.[0:04:01] Andrew Huberman: I like the raspberry. Frankly, I can't pick just 1. It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint, which I find tastes best if they are put into water, dissolved, and then heated up. I tend to do that in the winter months because, Of course, you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months, but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry. If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element, spelled l m n t.com/huberman to try a free sample pack.[0:04:29] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drink element .com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress. AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee, but is in fact a much better way to make coffee. I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago, and I've been using one ever since. Aeropress was developed by Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford.[0:04:51] Andrew Huberman: And I knew of Alan because he had also built the so called Aerobie Frisbee, I believe at one time, perhaps still now, held the Guinness Book of World Records for furthest thrown object. And I used to see Alan, believe it or not, At parks around Palo Alto, testing out different Aerobie Frisbee. So he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products. Now I love coffee. I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day, usually about 90 to a 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning, although not always.[0:05:23] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes if I'm going to exercise, I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning, but I love, love, love coffee. And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee. I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress that allows the same beans To be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee, even the traditional French press. The AeroPress is extremely easy to use, and it's extremely compact. In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel, and I use it on the road in hotels, even planes, I'll just ask for some hot water, and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.[0:06:01] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try AeroPress, you can go to aeropress.com/huberman. That's aer0pres.com/huberman to get 20% off any AeroPress coffee maker. AeroPress ships anywhere in the USA, Canada, and over 60 other countries around the world. Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman get 20% off. And now for my discussion with doctor Karen Parker.[0:06:25] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Karen Parker, welcome.[0:06:28] Dr. Karen Parker: Thank you. It's great to be here.[0:06:29] Andrew Huberman: This is going to be perhaps one of the longer conversations that we've been able to have over the years, in part because whenever I see you on campus, we're Head in our respective directions, but I'm very excited because the topic of autism is one that is on a lot of people's minds. And I think The first question that always comes up, it seems, is whether or not the frequency of autism is indeed increasing or whether or not the field of medicine is getting better at detecting what was Always there over time. Do we have any clear answers to that?[0:07:05] Dr. Karen Parker: Well, I think it's a multifactorial answer. So we're getting better at detecting autism. Right? So In the past, we were diagnosing kids at 9 or 10 years of age. Right?[0:07:15] Dr. Karen Parker: And now clinicians are able to reliably diagnose kids, at two to 3 years of age. Right? So there's more people. There are pediatricians have autism screeners in house. So when you bring in your baby And over the 1st couple years of life, you're filling out screeners that are looking for autism symptoms.[0:07:35] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So so there's just a lot more awareness around autism, but the rates have increased to now 1 in 36 US children have a diagnosis of autism, which is over 2 years ago, it was 1 in 44. So[0:07:49] Andrew Huberman: 1 in 36. Wow. I feel like it was just yesterday when it was 1 in 80. But is 1 in 36, the average across boys and girls, does it skew differently if you look at just Male births versus female births?[0:08:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. That's a great question. So autism is male biased in prevalence, so you have and, again, the Studies vary. I mean, it's it's worth noting that autism is a highly clinically heterogeneous disorder, which means that If you've met 1 kid with autism, you've met 1 kid with autism. Right?[0:08:22] Dr. Karen Parker: So so we have to bear that in mind as we have this conversation. But, you know, different studies show that about For every 1 girl, there's 3 to 4 boys that are impacted by autism. So there's, you know, differences in the prevalence rate, And, also, there's different monitoring sites. So the way in the US that these data are generated is the CDC has 11 monitoring sites across the country. And so they they follow, children, and then that's where we, that's where the prevalence rates come from, and they release new prevalence rates every, you know, few years.[0:08:57] Andrew Huberman: So if physicians are able to detect autism early, say, in a 2 year old or a 3 year old, To imagine that they're working off of tests that don't rely heavily on language, because even though it can get, you know, some verbose 2 3 year olds, Most 23 year olds don't have a very extensive vocabulary, and I'm guessing that they're also relying on things like visual gaze, among other things. We've already made clear that this is, not a discussion to allow people to diagnose themselves or others. But, with that said, what are some of the diagnostic tools that people use? You know? Is it language?[0:09:40] Andrew Huberman: Is it vision? Does it present as, you know, abnormal auditory processing? Maybe you could give us a Sampling.[0:09:49] Dr. Karen Parker: So autism is, a behavioral diagnosis. Right? So unlike other areas of medicine where you might be able to take a blood test or there's Other sort of tools, it's all a behavioral diagnosis by, an expert, so usually, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. And they look for 2 core features. So the so this is based on the DSM, 5, and there are the 2 core features are pervasive Social interaction challenges and the presence of restricted repetitive behavior, but there are a lot of people with who have anxiety.[0:10:24] Dr. Karen Parker: There are a lot of people with sensory challenges. There are a lot of people with seizure disorders, sleep disorders. So, again, it's Each person with autism has this sort of unique collection of traits, and, you know, that's how they get diagnosed.[0:10:41] Andrew Huberman: And we're going to talk a lot today about interventions, but how early are some of the behavioral interventions? And I should just say Any interventions introduced nowadays. So if someone brings their child to the pediatrician and they take one of these tests and that a child is Themed as having autism, will the will the 1 year old or the, you know, 2 year old immediately go into behavioral interventions?[0:11:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Well so usually you need to have the diagnosis of autism, and then there are behavioral interventions or a variety of different ones, that are used. There are some studies where, Because autism's highly heritable, you can have 1 child with autism, and then you if you have subsequent children, you're at an increased risk of having children with autism, and these are called baby sibling studies. So what you're doing is enriching the population of infants that you follow prospectively, who are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis. And there are studies where some of those children are enrolled in behavioral studies even when they're, quote, unquote, at risk.[0:11:46] Andrew Huberman: I've heard before that, you know, parents in which 1 or typically both Parents are, say, of the engineering, math y, physics, quote, unquote, hard science type are, more likely to have autistic children. Is that true? I mean, did that bear out in the data? You know, if you look at profession or or, You know, undergraduate major, does any of that correlate with the probability of having an autistic child?[0:12:16] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Well, what I can say is that there's been some studies. So what we know is that autistic traits are continuously distributed across the general population. And there was a study, and there's a couple different instruments that are used To be able to measure these autistic traits. So there's something called the social responsiveness scale, and then that's a US based instrument, and there's an autism quotient That's a similar measure that was, designed in England.[0:12:43] Dr. Karen Parker: And what what we know from work with the AQ is that individuals that are in Intense STEM fields like engineering, physics, and math have a greater burden of autistic trades even if they don't have an autism diagnosis.[0:12:57] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So that leads me to wonder whether or not this whole business of a spectrum Yeah. Is actually multiple Spectri spectrums. Is it spectrums or spectry? What someone will put it in the in the comments on YouTube.[0:13:12] Andrew Huberman: We know that for sure. Please let me know. I would like to know. What is the plural of spectrum? Spectrums.[0:13:18] Andrew Huberman: You know, because when we hear the word spectrum, we think, okay. There's a Spectrum of severity. Right? And in fact, I have some experience with, severe autism, not in my family, but where I went to undergraduate university, UC Santa Barbara down the way from that school was the Devereaux School, which was a school which, it's been there for a long time that, parents would send their kids if they were, quote, unquote, severely autistic. It was actually where, Dustin Hoffman went to, Study for his role in Rain Man.[0:13:50] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. And[0:13:50] Andrew Huberman: the, the kids who were really delightful, they used to come into town every once in a while to the coffee shop where I'd study, And they would also continue on from there to Kmart, which is why the Dustin Hoffman character would say, gotta go to Kmart. Gotta go to he would do that repetition. Right? And that Kmart was down the road from our, You know, our college housing and the Devereaux school, those kids were literally in a, away from home facility full time. And I spoke to some of the parents at one point, and they were at that facility, meaning the parents had sent them their children away to live there Yeah.[0:14:22] Andrew Huberman: Full time. Of course, they get visits, and they get visits home, because they were, I suppose we could say, at the far end of some spectrum that made it, At least to the parents' idea, impossible for them to be at home. Okay. Now at the other end of the Spectrum, if one is just simply thinking in terms of severity. I know people who have self identified as autistic.[0:14:45] Dr. Karen Parker: That's how[0:14:46] Andrew Huberman: they've referred to it, so I feel comfortable, saying that they've said I am autistic, and they seem pretty high functioning, meaning they Have driver's licenses, drive cars, are in healthy relationships, and manage life apparently well. They have some traits that, yes, I would agree are a little bit different. Right? So that's where we get into neurodivergence.[0:15:09] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[0:15:09] Andrew Huberman: But I guess the point is, You know, should we think about autism as on a spectrum or given the fact that there are these, kind of collections of different traits, Could there be a spectrum of severity, also a spectrum of, you know, more stereotype behaviors, another spectrum that intersects with that that has to do with, you know, obsession with a particular topic. You know, you could imagine that there are, you know, 50 or 60 different spectra or Spectrums, I still don't know which one to say. And that when we talk about the spectrum, we're really talking about something that's in multiple dimensions and not just one line that goes from Severe to mild. Yeah. Does that make sense?[0:15:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. I mean, I think this is where understanding the biological basis of behavior would then allow us to be able to say, you know, like, here's these different dimensions. Right? But not understanding Biology, you're left with, okay. We're are we lumpers or splitters?[0:16:03] Dr. Karen Parker: Like, how do we think about this? Because autism is highly heritable, so there's about 40 to 80% of autism is, is genetic. Right? So they these vary wildly. Right?[0:16:16] Dr. Karen Parker: But the but the common thinking is that the majority, about 50% of autism is, is associated with common genetic variants. And so the way that we've always thought about this is that there is this you know, autism is largely an inherited Polygenic condition. And but what I mean by that is that you have a lot of common variants that are additive. And so if you think about This collection of common genetic variants that underlie the spectrum. Right?[0:16:47] Dr. Karen Parker: So if you have less of a dosing Of some of these common variants, you might see somebody who's a lot more who's higher functioning, like you said. And if you end up with one of these single gene highly penetrant, disorders you might see severe intellectual disability and sort of lower functioning on the other end of the spectrum. But I think that there is a lot that we don't know. And what you're bringing up, I think, underlines, you know, sort of an issue with autumn autism, which is common for many brain disorders, which is like, If you don't understand the underlying biological basis, it also gets very difficult to diagnose and treat. Right?[0:17:25] Dr. Karen Parker: And that's where we are with a lot of different, you know, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.[0:17:31] Andrew Huberman: To date, has there been any specific neural network that we can point to and say, ah, that's the neural network that seems to be different in people who are on the autism spectrum. I saw a study published recently that seemed to point to the idea that the genes that are altered in autism, at least include a large number of genes that are altered or the proteins that are the consequence of those genes are altered and exist at the synapse at the connections between neurons. And I'm asking it that way because, you know, some years ago, I was at a talk on autism at Stanford, and someone raised their hand and says, do we even know that autism is a brain issue? Right? Couldn't couldn't it be an issue of, you know, the immune system or the cardiovascular system, which At the time, it seemed like, okay.[0:18:18] Andrew Huberman: Gosh. Of course. It's but wait. Then you stop and you think, that's a really good question.[0:18:22] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[0:18:22] Andrew Huberman: How do we know it's a it's a challenge of the brain?[0:18:25] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. I think that's a great question. Right? And there may be people talk about autisms. Right?[0:18:30] Dr. Karen Parker: And so when you think about where the major player is, You know, we're at the infancy of thinking about this. Right? And so maybe for some people, it's more of a brain based disorder. Maybe for some people, it's, You know, the connection with the gut and the brain. Right?[0:18:47] Dr. Karen Parker: I think what's also really tricky. Right? So one thing that you have to ask is what are the barriers to progress in understanding Right. And so the way I think about this is that let let's just take for a moment that this is a brain disorder. How do you study it in people?[0:19:03] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So, you know, it's very difficult to get access to either cerebral spinal fluid, which is a fluid that bathes the brain, brain tissue biopsies. It's very hard to get people, especially children, that are really impacted into a brain scanner. Right. Because they can't sit still.[0:19:21] Dr. Karen Parker: They may have sensory issues. They don't wanna go into a scanner. Right? So a lot of the tools that neuroscientists or or psychiatrists have To think about looking at the brain are, limited. Right?[0:19:34] Dr. Karen Parker: And then and then the other part is How do you model? So the other way may we might think about getting access or or thinking about model systems. What we need to do is think about the control animals, And we need to make sure that the species that we're modeling them in has, features of control humans, if you will. So we need to have complex Cognitive abilities. We need to have complex social skills.[0:19:59] Dr. Karen Parker: We need to have an organism that has vision as its primary sensory modality. Right? Potentially sleep consolidating. So we need to think about all of those. And and the the tricky part, I think, until fairly recently was that we were doing all of this work in mouse models.[0:20:15] Dr. Karen Parker: And, you know, the control mice just fundamentally lack many of the characteristics that are needed to model, You know, autism with fidelity. Right? And and I think that's, you know, when we look at drug development pipelines, about 50 and of preclinical failures. So that would be something that's tested in an animal that works and then fails in a human clinical drug trial. 50% of those failures can be attributed to poorly selected animal models.[0:20:44] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I think part of where we we will be getting traction is Picking you know, developing sophisticated models as a sort of point of entry into being able to understand some of these things that are really difficult to study in people.[0:20:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's such a key point. And, for those that, have not heard of preclinical models, preclinical models are nonhuman models. So it could be mouse, could be nonhuman primate, Could be flies or worms for that matter, but, we're going to talk a lot about, nonhuman primate preclinical models, and the work that you've been doing And, of course, also the work that you've been doing in humans, the other animal. Yeah.[0:21:20] Andrew Huberman: The other primate. The other primate. Right. Exactly. I love to Remind people that we're primates, old world primates.[0:21:28] Andrew Huberman: So thank you for doing that. So you've been talking about the genetic on autism, and, of course, genes in the environment interact.[0:21:34] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[0:21:34] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's never nature or nurture. It's always an interaction, and that Isn't just about the epigenome. It's also just about the fact that nature impacts the genome and our genome impacts the way that we interact with the environment, etcetera. So what is the role of the environment in autism, both the frequency and the presentation of autism.[0:21:51] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So, I mean, there are, again, lots of different epidemiological studies. So, advanced parental age, prematurity, severe prematurity as a risk factor for autism, Maternal illness during pregnancy. So there's there's a bunch of different things that have been associated with an increased risk for autism.[0:22:14] Andrew Huberman: In terms of environmental influences and how they can intersect with biology, one of the things that I was really struck by in the early 2000 That, at least by my read of the literature, hasn't really gone anywhere was this idea that was proposed by Pashko Rakesh who used to run the neurobiology department, at Yale, expert in brain neuroanatomy and nonhuman primates and in humans, embryology, really a luminary of our field, And he had a series of papers exploring how the migration of neurons during early development, you know, as you and I both know, but most people out there probably know because we haven't covered this in the podcast. It's not typical dinner table conversation. You know, when you when an embryo when a human embryo is developing, the The neurons are born at one location, and they migrate out some distance to their final, resting place where then they grow out their connections and connect with one another. And that process of neuro neuronal migration is oh, so critical for the eventual wiring of the brain. And Rakesh had this idea That perhaps, and I really wanna emphasize perhaps, that the more frequent incidence of autism might be correlated with The increase in early prenatal ultrasound, and he had these papers published in a number of really high profile journals, including Academy and science and elsewhere showing that in a mouse model, if you do ultrasound, with each successive ultrasound, you got more migration errors.[0:23:40] Andrew Huberman: Right? So there's to me was a, you know, an interesting example of of the environment, frequency of ultrasound and cell migration Having some sort of interaction, but it seemed like it never went anywhere. It never got tact to, okay, you should keep in mind the number of ultrasounds that you're getting for your child, and, of course, Ultrasounds are critical for for pregnant women to get, because they can stave off a number of developmental issues, and they're super important. But, You know, we've heard about ultrasound, you know, within the scientific literature, and then occasionally we'll hear other theories about, okay, it's having 2 parents who are both engineers, and then we'll hear, Oh, you know, it's, you know, toxicity in the food environment. We've heard, you know, hypotheses about vaccines or the the adjuvants that the vaccines are contained in.[0:24:24] Andrew Huberman: You know? In that large cloud of theories, has anything really, emerged from them? It's like, okay. There really seems to be at least 1 major risk factor, environmental risk factor, because I feel like all those theories might come up, Get some popular press, bunch of papers are published. Sometimes those papers are retracted, like in the case of the vaccines.[0:24:46] Andrew Huberman: Right. And then the theory kinda dies.[0:24:50] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:24:51] Andrew Huberman: So is there any specific environmental influence on autism that we can say, Yes. There really seems to be something there.[0:24:59] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. I I mean, it's a it's a really spectacularly good question. I think the tricky part about it is that Every single person that comes into a trial has a different genetic background. Right? And so until we can have these a priori stratified trials where you could then you know, as a good scientist, you would only manipulate maybe 1, 2 variables at a time.[0:25:20] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? But when you're doing these large epidemiological studies because you can't it's very difficult to do experimental studies, right, especially with developing children. I think that's an incredibly difficult study to do. Right? So there's been an interest in this field of There's these neurogenetic syndromes that have high penetrance for autism, which basically means that you could have a disorder, or, you know, another genetic condition, let's say.[0:25:48] Dr. Karen Parker: It doesn't have to be a single gene, but that a lot of those kids tend to also get an autism diagnosis. And so there has been work in, like so for instance, Fragile X is a good example where because autism is so diverse in terms of clinical presentation That let's say you have a medication that could work for a handful of kids in the trial. You may not be statistically powered to see it. Right? So So, you know, the way I think about the autism world is there's so little we don't know.[0:26:16] Dr. Karen Parker: So think about being in a dark room And you have a flashlight, and you only see where you shine the light. Right? And so if you think about a very heterogeneous genetically heterogeneous study. It's gonna be very difficult to tease out these pieces because an environmental risk factor, might be a driver For 1 kid, but not another. Right?[0:26:38] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I think what we need to do is to have these genetically defined subgroups of individuals and then be able to test The g by gene by environment interactions or in this genetically defined group of individuals, can we test this certain medication to see if it's beneficial for this subgroup of children.[0:26:58] Andrew Huberman: Got it. So you you mentioned Fragile X, which, we know, presents with autism like Symptoms in some cases. And then I think of another disease like, Timothy syndrome. Uh-huh. A mutation in an l type calcium channel, which, for those of you who don't know what these cell type calcium channels are, they're they're not just important for the function of neurons in the brain.[0:27:18] Andrew Huberman: They're really important for the function of neurons and other Other tissues, including heart tissue. Right? So kids with Timothy syndrome have cardiac issues Yeah. And they have autism. So, you know, I think it's important for us to kind of explore this a bit because in most people's minds, you know, kids with autism have autism, and occasionally they'll have other issues, You know, gut issues or heart issues or, musculoskeletal issues, but we often think that that's the consequence of the autism, but oftentimes they They have multiple things going on Right.[0:27:51] Andrew Huberman: And the autism actually could be secondary or independent of the other thing that's going on. So This is what leads me back to the this idea of of a spectrum. Mhmm. You know? Is, you know, is it possible that what we call autism is actually, Like, 50 different disorders or 50 different conditions depending on what one wants to call them.[0:28:10] Andrew Huberman: I mean, What is autism really? I mean, is it it's what does it really center around? Like and I I think here maybe it's useful to go like, do we go to the diagnostic criteria? Like, how do we decide if a child has autism if they also have a bunch of other things[0:28:26] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[0:28:26] Andrew Huberman: That that are challenging them?[0:28:27] Dr. Karen Parker: I mean, I I think that that's the $64,000 question. Right? And and And, again, in other areas of medicine so if you think about let's think about cancer biology. Right? Like, decades ago, Somebody would come in with cancer, and you would hit them with radiation chemotherapy, and that was the best that we could do.[0:28:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? But with the invention of a lot of molecular tools, You can remove a a tumor, and you can do molecular profiling and even, you know, have personalized medications made right to attack that tumor. And so, You know, what's really tricky when you have a behavioral diagnosis that's not biologically defined, You you see a lot of heterogeneity, so it's incredibly difficult, I think, to answer this question because we don't know how many kinds of autism there are. Right? Like, there will be people who say, if you have a disorder like fragile X or Prader Willi syndrome or Timothy syndrome or or a variety of these other conditions, there will people people's I I've heard clinicians say, well, that's not really autism.[0:29:30] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? That's A piece of fragile x. Right? But if it's a behavioral diagnosis and they meet be behavioral criteria, It becomes this weird circular argument. Right?[0:29:40] Dr. Karen Parker: So, like, until we really understand what autism is, I I I think that It's going to be very tricky to start, you know, sub defining different aspects of the condition.[0:29:55] Andrew Huberman: As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course, our physical health, but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning, our memory, our ability to learn new things, and to focus. And we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality, unprocessed, or minimally processed sources, as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically all the cellular functions in our body, including the gut microbiome. Now I, like most everybody, try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods. Ideally, mostly from minimally processed or nonprocessed foods. However, one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and probiotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.[0:30:42] Andrew Huberman: That's why way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG one. And so I'm delighted that AG one is sponsoring the Huberman Lab Podcast. The reason I started taking AG one and the reason I still drink AG one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to try AG one, you can go to drink agone.com/huberman to claim a special offer.[0:31:16] Andrew Huberman: They're giving away 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2. Again, that's drink a gone.com/huberman to Claim that special offer. Well, this is probably a good time for us to think about the work that you've done in terms of trying to tack The biology of social communication, both and behavior Yeah. Like those things interact, not just language, but also behavior to autism in humans using nonhuman primate models, and then, of course, to also discuss some of the work that you've been doing in humans. And we can't have that discussion without first having a discussion about 2 neuropeptides that I think most people have heard of at least one of them, And I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about, but you're going to clarify that for us, which are oxytocin and vasopressin.[0:32:09] Andrew Huberman: So before we dive into the, the important work that you've been doing on vasopressin in particular, but also oxytocin and autism, What are oxytocin and vasopressin really?[0:32:22] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay. So they're these small little peptide. They're 9 amino acids long, so very tiny. They only differ by 2 amino acids, and they're these ancient peptides that are 100 of millions of years old. And in almost any species studied, whether it's the current version, you might have vasatocin or other mesotocin, which are, sort of precursor forms in other species, but they're highly nearly conserved, and they're involved in social behavior, in pretty much any it could be egg laying.[0:32:53] Dr. Karen Parker: It could be, you know, but the reproduction and social behavior across The phylogenetic taxes.[0:32:59] Andrew Huberman: So house cats make vasopressin and oxytocin. Humans obviously make vasopressin and oxytocin and pretty much every other species that has to interact with and connect with other members of its species.[0:33:11] Dr. Karen Parker: Especially mammals. Right? So oxytocin and are pervasive in mammalian species.[0:33:16] Andrew Huberman: Do the different species tend to make oxytocin and vasopressin in Similar brain areas and tissues?[0:33:26] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes. But not completely overlapping, but I I think the thing that the the beautiful mystery about these And the infuriating piece of them is that because they're so structurally similar, they can have similar effects, And they there's 4 receptors that they bind to. So if you think about a hormone or a neurotransmitter, so oxytocin, vasopressin, if you think about them like a key And a receptor like a lock, and you have to put them together to open a door, open behavior, they can bind to these 4 receptors. So it can be Very difficult to disentangle which one is acting and at which receptor and where in the brain.[0:34:04] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so oxytocin and vasopressin are chemically similar?[0:34:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes.[0:34:08] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[0:34:09] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes.[0:34:09] Andrew Huberman: And, where would you say lies their greatest, Output divergence, which is just nerd speak for it. Is there an example of something that oxytocin does that vasopressin doesn't and vice Versa?[0:34:20] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Okay. So what's really fascinating is these 2 neurotransmitters or hormones were discovered for their peripheral effects, which basically means not in their brain, but somewhere in their body. And so oxytocin's involved in, uterine contractions and milk letdown and so was during patient. So people sort of always thought of it as the female hormone.[0:34:42] Dr. Karen Parker: And then vasopressin has, at least in the in the peripheral system, Has been involved in, urine regulate like, urinary output regulation, blood pressure. And so we only knew about their Their physiological roles as sort of classic hormones for decades. And what was interesting is these, Like naming conventions are fascinating medicine. Right? So you could name a virus after where it was first found.[0:35:12] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? Or it could be named after somebody who discovered the disease like Alzheimer's, for instance, is a good example. And what was interesting, Oxytocin was only named once. Vasopressin was named twice. So it's either called arginine vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone.[0:35:27] Dr. Karen Parker: And so it had 2 different names. And so as you can imagine, sometimes genes are named twice. And so somebody in cancer is studying 1 gene and Somebody in autism is studying another, and they're not even communicating because they don't even realize that they've at least historically, now we have all kinds of Gene annotation site, so it's less likely to happen now. But but what was fascinating is they were these hormones were named oxytocin is Greek for quick birth. So for decades, people only appreciated their physiological roles.[0:35:55] Dr. Karen Parker: But but there are neuroanatomists saying, hey. So these are both made They're made in a lot of different places, but the the the action sort of happens in the hypothalamus where they're made. And there were anatomists that said, wait. These of project back into the brain, what are these doing in the brain? And one of my favorite historical stories was, I had a mentor, A colleague like an you know, who I didn't train with, but he was, a real source of wisdom to me for many years.[0:36:22] Dr. Karen Parker: And his name's Court Peterson, and he told me this wonderful story about this Duke zoologist named Peter Clotford. And, Peter was studying ungulates, so sheep and goats, and he wrote a story, a paper In 1971 called mother love, what turns it on? And, you know, one thing about science is I love going back and seeing where do the pearls Wisdom come from. And so he wrote this and said, you know, oxytocin is orchestrating all these events of motherhood, And there are sheep and goats in particular that have offspring that are precocious, meaning they're basically born ready. You know, within an hour, they can run with herd unlike our species, which is altricial, meaning we have very helpless infants.[0:37:04] Dr. Karen Parker: And mom needs to bond really quickly with that A baby, if it's going to be running around and you only you know, from an evolutionary perspective, you wanna be investing in the baby that's yours, not somebody else's. Right? And, he hypothesized that it was oxytocin that was being coreleased into the brain and during milk letdown That was what turned mother love on, and that was really the beginning of this whole field of thinking. And so that opened up thinking about oxytocin In rodent maternal care and a variety of other instances.[0:37:38] Andrew Huberman: Can I just briefly interrupt you? Because I find this so interesting, and I know it's interesting to Everyone listening as well because, you know yes, and thank you for, making it clear that oxytocin has many different roles, but this role of mother love and bonding to infant, has me needing to ask whether or not the idea was that Oxytocin is released in the mother when she interacts with her own baby, and that leads me to the question, is oxytocin also released in the baby, in reaction to to the mother? And how long is that effect lasting? Because in order to have a pervasive bond with that baby and not just some other baby, And, of course, we still have visual cues, and, you know, we know our baby versus another baby in most instances. There are rare exceptions, or perhaps not so rare exceptions.[0:38:26] Andrew Huberman: But leaving those aside, You know, the mechanism that would allow for mother infant bonding and infant mother bonding By way of oxytocin, presumably is something that is literally changing their brains[0:38:40] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:38:40] Andrew Huberman: Saying it's you are the are the Center of my life.[0:38:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:38:44] Andrew Huberman: Right? And the baby, of course, is saying, well, you are my life because you are the source of life. Right? And and certainly for the early part, early part of life, and then nowadays, it seems that that that can extend well into the, the teens and twenties for some people. But, You know, how how is oxytocin working?[0:39:00] Andrew Huberman: Is it is it working over the course of minutes, hours? Is there some specificity of this baby and this mom Yeah. That links them in some more pervasive way. I mean, how is oxytocin doing this magic of bonding?[0:39:13] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. I mean, it's it's very species specific. Right? So I think that and you need to think about, like, the evolutionary history of the species. Right?[0:39:22] Dr. Karen Parker: So if you think about Sheep or goats, the early studies that were done are you, the passage through the vaginal canal was what you know, so you debated oxytocin receptors that way. But if you gave an oxytocin antagonist, meaning you would give into the brain something that blocked The oxytocin receptor. So if the oxytocin is being released into the blank brain, but you have a pharmacological agent blocking its ability to bind to its receptors, These sheep and goats wouldn't, bond to their baby for instance.[0:39:53] Andrew Huberman: So literally the passage of the baby out of the vaginal canal triggers the the oxytocin pathway, the release of oxytocin.[0:40:01] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. As in l lactation does so.[0:40:03] Andrew Huberman: Is so beautiful because if you had to pick 1 event[0:40:05] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:40:05] Andrew Huberman: To trigger the release of oxytocin, if oxytocin's role is to create bonding Yeah. With offspring, that will be the event because that's a tough one to mistake.[0:40:13] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[0:40:14] Andrew Huberman: Right?[0:40:14] Dr. Karen Parker: But but what I will say because I think you will you know, to avoid you getting attacked on Twitter or wherever you might get attacked.[0:40:20] Andrew Huberman: Get attacked anyway. If not for if not for this discussion, then another one, but tougher than I am.[0:40:26] Dr. Karen Parker: So, but it's really species specific. Right? So if you think about our species and a lot of primate species, we live in these Extended family groups, and that's how we evolved. And so unlike a goat or a sheep that might live in a herd where there's a lot of nonrelatives, We lived in a community of relatives. Right?[0:40:45] Dr. Karen Parker: And so we and we do all kinds of care of extended relatives. And so you wouldn't necessarily expect in a primate species where you have this long rearing history where help from the family and and by parental care where where sort of everybody is sort of, like, it takes a village to raise the baby, we readily adopt in our in primate societies. Right? And so, You know, like, I had a c I mean, I'll tell you something personal. I had a c section, and, had I had a lot of Partum complications, and so lactation didn't work out that well for me.[0:41:21] Dr. Karen Parker: One of my friends would say, I had massive, DVTs and pulmonary emboli. And so I almost died after my son was born the 1st time, and so I didn't have a vaginal delivery. I[0:41:32] Andrew Huberman: couldn't DVTs, Deep vein thrombosis.[0:41:35] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. And it was sort of like welcome to motherhood, and I was in the ICU and, had to get a filter put in, an inferior vena cava filtered to, stop me from dying because, like, I had scattershot clots all over my lungs. And so I didn't really you know, I didn't I I didn't do a vaginal delivery. I had a c section, and I wasn't really able to lactate. And, man, I love that baby.[0:41:58] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So, you know, I can give you know, what I will say is, it's really different in primates, and we don't really understand how bonding occurs. But what I will say is that Bonding between a mother, you really need to think about the evolutionary selective pressure. So I was an evolutionary biologist before I found neuroscience. Right?[0:42:16] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I really everything I do, I think about from an evolutionary perspective. So but it it is, many people go into the oxytocin vasopressin field because they have a lot of questions about Social interactions. Right? Like, I think if you think about us as being social is actually one of the one of the Core characteristics of our species. Right?[0:42:40] Dr. Karen Parker: So social interactions are rewarding from infancy. They keep us alive as you mentioned. Right? And so I think it's not an accident that the way we think about disorder in our species is many disorders are disorders because of lack of social connectedness. Right?[0:42:57] Dr. Karen Parker: So it could be something like autism where, you know, there's these pervasive social interaction impairments. It could be something like drug abuse where, You know, you you a risk factor for drug abuse is feeling, you know, socially disconnected and alone. Right? Social, isolation or loss of a loved one is a very strong predictor of the onset of a stress related depressive anxiety disorder.[0:43:24] Andrew Huberman: In terms of when and how oxytocin is released, you mentioned, mother infant bonding. I think you said, yes, that the infant is also releasing oxytocin, we think. So it's it's bidirectional.[0:43:40] Dr. Karen Parker: We think. I think most of the work has been done in mom would be and and, again, this has not been really Done well in primates. Right? So we're extrapolating this information from species that have different evolutionary histories than us. Right.[0:43:55] Dr. Karen Parker: So it's goats, sheeps, prairie voles, mice, rats.[0:44:01] Andrew Huberman: So what do we know about the role of oxytocin in humans? Do it I mean, we know it's there.[0:44:05] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:44:06] Andrew Huberman: We presume based on the animal models that it's involved in mother infant bonding, and presumably romantic partner bonding. At least you hear that a lot. It was unfortunately nicknamed the love hormone. Yes. And the reason it's unfortunate it was is that while that might cue attention to oxytocin and I'm, you know, a big fan of people paying attention to biological phenomena, it, it discards the other and many roles of of oxytocin.[0:44:33] Andrew Huberman: But, yeah, what can we say about oxytocin in humans if if anything? Like, do we know that it does I mean, is it we're just so we're assuming based on the animal models that it does something. I mean, this is very different than, like, dopamine where there's tons of animal model data, but we know But there are brain imaging where we know where dopamine is expressed, and do we even know where oxytocin receptors are expressed in the human brain? Presumably, that information is is out there.[0:44:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Recently, but, again, there's a lot of specificity. And I think if you're thinking about disorders, you would then have to study those specific subpopulations. Right? And and you need you know, a lot of this work has been done, so you have to think about how do we study it. Right?[0:45:10] Dr. Karen Parker: So the best way to study it would be to have radio tracers where you could then which we do have for dopamine and and other compounds where you would then go and see where after somebody's performed a task. Do we see, you know, activation, right, or uptake? There are some imaging studies. They're usually done giving intranasal oxytocin, and then you basically ask questions about, okay. We give you oxytocin intranasally, which presumably enters the brain.[0:45:37] Dr. Karen Parker: There's we could talk about reasons why we think that, and then we have you perform on some task. Right? And so, you know, there's evidence if you give oxytocin, it diminishes the amygdala's response, to fearful stimuli. Right? So that it might have this sort of prosocial effect, and and it was actually data like that that caused people to start thinking, initially about oxytocin.[0:46:00] Andrew Huberman: And those are data in humans. That's right. It reminds me that there was this brief moment where oxytocin wasn't just being discussed as the love Hormone is it was being discussed as the trust hormone. Correct. Right?[0:46:11] Andrew Huberman: Also, far too simple, heuristic. But but, again, I think it's cool that the, You know, that the the press picks up on these things and at least tells people about what's being discovered.[0:46:21] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:46:22] Andrew Huberman: And we just always have to be careful to not, have it lead to the assumption that that's the only role of a given of a given hormone. So, it can reduce apparently, it can reduce the Output of the amygdala in some way, this brain area associated with, threat detection. And so you could imagine how that would bias the person toward being more prosocial. Right. Have there been studies exploring the role of oxytocin in making autistic Children more prosocial, and behind that question, I suppose, is the assumption you can verify or or not that autistic children are less Pro social than other children.[0:47:03] Andrew Huberman: Is that true, or is it that, you know, autistic kids are just maybe more pro phrase it, and, they have close friends And they seem to really like those specific friends a lot. Like, they seem very happy when they show up at the door and, like, all all the hallmarks of, you know, healthy social mind, But, it is true that they are uncomfortable in in groups and where there's a lot of noise, a busy birthday party is overwhelming for them. But see them playing with 1 or 2 friends and, like, You could see all that and assume, okay. This is kind of an introverted kid. Right.[0:47:42] Andrew Huberman: Actually, it kinda reminds me of me. You know? I mean, I don't have a problem with crowds, But I I much prefer to be with a small group of friends or one close friend. Yeah.[0:47:49] Dr. Karen Parker: So I hear you. I'm not way too.[0:47:51] Andrew Huberman: Right. So, you know, How do we think about this?[0:47:55] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay. Well, I would say the social features of autism are interesting. Right? And so you might have There were there was an attempt a long time ago, like 1979. There's a woman named Lorna Wing who tried to subtype the Social features of autism.[0:48:11] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so there could be people, that are socially avoidant and really just don't wanna have social interactions. There could be kids that are, active but odd, which means that they have an interest in being social, but maybe they don't Read social cues right, and they interact in ways that other kids don't understand or make could as bullying. Right?[0:48:35] Andrew Huberman: And Sounds like junior high school.[0:48:36] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And and that's often why, you know, some autistic kids do better with adults. Right?[0:48:42] Dr. Karen Parker: Because adults know how to sort of channel, discussions with somebody who might be a little socially awkward. Right? But there's different phenotypes. I mean, people having a disinterest in social interactions could be that they're highly socially anxious. Right, that making eye contact makes them anxious.[0:49:00] Dr. Karen Parker: You Again, that's another caveat. There have been some studies administering oxytocin send to individuals with autism. And, again, these are these single dose studies. So the 1st studies that were were done were looking at Single dose oxytocin in males because some of the and we can talk a little bit about why oxytocin versus vasopressin, which vasopressin actually would have been my choice, based on the animal literature, and we can talk about that. But based the oxytocin was given to males, partly because it wouldn't the idea would be that the off Target effects in the peripheral nervous system, I e, milk, letdown, uterine contractions are not gonna happen in males.[0:49:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so that it was deemed that they might be safer subjects. Males are often Also, the the go to for research studies as you may have talked about on on your podcast before too.[0:50:06] Andrew Huberman: Something that fortunately is changing. Yes. Absolutely. Mandate by the, by the NIH. Correct.[0:50:12] Andrew Huberman: I I had to just kind of, smile slash, you know, raise my eyebrows a little bit at the idea that, You know, the the assumption that oxytocin administered to males, yes, one can see why it wouldn't cause milk like down or uterine contractions. Right. But, but, of course, there could be other peripheral effects of oxytocin in males. But they had to pick they had to pick 1, so they went with males. Okay.[0:50:33] Andrew Huberman: So, and there is this higher incidence of autism in males. So Right. It's not a terrible place to start. You just would hope that they would also do the the experiment on females. Right.[0:50:41] Andrew Huberman: But so they're doing this by nasal spray.[0:50:43] Dr. Karen Parker: So intranasal One dose. Correct. And for reasons that I don't understand, it's 24 international units. And I think maybe somebody did the 1st study using it, and, you know, this is how science happens. Right?[0:50:54] Dr. Karen Parker: And it worked, and so then everyone uses that protocol. And so then there's been a lot of studies looking at, you know, there's 1 reading the mind and the eyes. So can you look at Pictures of somebody's eyes and then ask what is the emotion that they're feeling. Right?[0:51:08] Andrew Huberman: After receiving[0:51:09] Dr. Karen Parker: this intranasal. Or placebo. Where is your eye gaze going in a picture? Right? So one of one of the theories is that people with autism may, At least a subset of them lack social motivation.[0:51:21] Dr. Karen Parker: So maybe they're not looking in the places like eyes where you receive a lot of social cues that are relevant to social communication. And so some of these early studies showed that a single dose of oxytocin in people that were, had High functioning autism, so they were verbal. Like you said, they could come in for studies, and that it looked like it had some potential effectiveness. And so there became A really strong interest in the field to think about oxytocin potentially as a therapy for autism.[0:51:51] Andrew Huberman: And is oxytocin available over the counter? Does it require I I mean, you see sites that are selling it, but that doesn't mean anything these days. Right.[0:51:59] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[0:52:00] Andrew Huberman: There's gray market. There's all sorts of stuff going on. But I know people that have used oxytocin. There's actually a a market for and by the way, folks, I'm not suggesting this, but when the other day told me that they've been regularly taking, oxytocin, ketamine nasal inhalations, as part of their work with their licensed therapist on, kind of like PTSD type stuff relating to let's just call it relational trauma.[0:52:29] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay.[0:52:29] Andrew Huberman: So that's happening. Yeah. But let's just think about oxytocin alone for the moment. Are parents of of autistic kids able to, like, buy oxytocin nasal spray?[0:52:41] Dr. Karen Parker: No. So so It would need to be written like, the prescription would be need to be written by a, by a physician. Mhmm. And it's not on the market. Right.[0:52:51] Dr. Karen Parker: So there's one thing we should say is there's only 2 drugs that are approved by the FDA to treat autism, and they're both antipsychotics, which they, They treat associated features like irritability, and they have off target effects like weight gain and and and you know? So we don't have any medications That are currently approved in the US or anywhere else for that matter, to treat the core features of autism.[0:53:16] Andrew Huberman: Interesting and, unfortunate. Yeah. And hopefully, that will change in the not too distant future. Do we know that children with autism people with autism, because I'm gonna just sort of Assume that, autism is stable over the lifespan. Like, if a child is diagnosed with autism, are they going to be an adolescent an adult with autism?[0:53:37] Dr. Karen Parker: So I would say that in a lot of cases, autism has lifelong impact, but there are people who outgrow their diagnosis. You know, there are people who respond well to behavioral therapy. I mean, obviously, it's not the cure all for everybody. There's lots of people go through intensive behavioral therapy and probably see minimal benefit. But, I mean, it's certainly something that occurs in childhood for the diagnosis occurs in childhood, And it you know, for most people will then be present across the lifespan.[0:54:08] Dr. Karen Parker: So we could say people with autism because each Studies sometimes will have adults. Sometimes you'll have teenagers. Sometimes you'll have kids.[0:54:15] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, etcetera, but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to Attrition, behavioral modifications, supplements, etcetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you.[0:55:05] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman. Is it known whether or not people with autism, assuming they meet the criteria for being autistic that at that moment, have lower natural circulating or active levels of oxytocin. Because, you know, it's one thing for a nasal spray to, oxytocin to improve social functioning. It's another, to know that it that the effect is addressing An underlying biological deficit.[0:55:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. That's it's such a great question. Okay. So we should unpack that because there's been a lot of work in this area. So the first question is where are we measuring the oxytocin?[0:55:52] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So we mentioned oxytocin has all kinds of effects in the body as well as the brain. And it's released into the blood, But it's also released directly into the brain. And there's variable evidence about if you measure it in blood, is it a readout of the brain or not? Right?[0:56:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Or should you be looking at something like spinal fluid that's maybe a a better biochemical proxy of the brain? Most studies. So what I will say is there were there's been mole a handful of small studies where there has been Some you know, there's been some benefit, maybe no benefit, small effects. We did a study that was a small study at Stanford, And it was based on, mouse genetic data, and I'll I'll sort of walk you through what we did. The pool mouse models of these neurogenetic syndromes where, people have social impairment.[0:56:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? We can quibble quibble about whether that's autism or not, but that they have social impairment. And so that there are this, fragile x mouse. There's a Prader Willi Syndrome mouse, which is the MAGL 2 gene that, gets manipulated, and then there's a CATNAP 2 mouse. And in all of those instances, When you genetically modify those mice, you see a reduction of oxytocin in the hypothalamus.[0:57:08] Dr. Karen Parker: And what's interesting is that, in those instances where you see this genetic modification, you do see lower blood levels in these genetically defined models. What's really cool is you can give oxytocin across development in those models. And at least in the CATNAB two mouse, You can restore oxytocin neuron number 2 equivalent of control animals suggesting that oxytocin is doing something In these oxytocin deficient animals. Right? So these are not an oxytocin gene manipulation, but these are these syndromes where you see as manipulating genes for these syndromes that oxytocin gets knocked down.[0:57:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so our thinking when we went into our clinical trial was what if, It's blood oxytocin levels that there are going to be a subset of individuals that just make less oxytocin Humans. Humans and that maybe those are the individuals who could who stand to benefit the most from treatment. And so we were the 1st group, To ask, you know, across this range of individuals who showed up, and we did in in all the trials that we'll talk about today. These are done with my colleague Antonio Harden at Stanford who's a child psychiatrist.[0:58:25] Dr. Karen Parker: Team is blind and that the, or unaware, I should say. They're unaware of treatment, and then the families and the children are unaware. And then the randomized, meaning there was an equal chance you could get either drug or placebo, and they're and they're controlled. Right? Okay.[0:58:40] Dr. Karen Parker: So We asked if we know what your pretreatment pretreatment blood oxytocin level is, who's gonna benefit from treatment? And we found a couple really interesting things. One Was that the lower your baseline, so your pretreatment blood oxytocin level, you showed much greater benefit from the oxytocin intervention. These are shown[0:58:59] Andrew Huberman: one Intervention 1 nasal spray.[0:59:01] Dr. Karen Parker: 4 weeks. Sorry. I should have clarified. This is 4 weeks of treatment being, administered oxytocin twice a day.[0:59:08] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:59:09] Dr. Karen Parker: And, and and so we saw effectiveness there.[0:59:12] Andrew Huberman: May I sorry to interrupt so much, but just, males male and female subjects?[0:59:16] Dr. Karen Parker: We did. But, again, you know, because the Autism is male biased in prevalence. Even if you make this heroic effort to over recruit, try to get more girls in, in in the study, we usually try to aim for the prevalence rate because it's difficult to get girls just because there's fewer of them.[0:59:31] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Okay. But, boys and girls were included. They're taking oxytocin over the period of of several 4 weeks. And if they started off with lower baseline levels of oxytocin, You observed a benefit of the oxytocin treatment[0:59:45] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes.[0:59:45] Andrew Huberman: In those individuals. What about the individuals who had normal to High levels.[0:59:49] Dr. Karen Parker: See much benefit. Right? And so that was a a cue to me to think that there may be a subset of individuals That, you know, for whatever reason, they have lower oxytocin, and they may stand to benefit more from treatment. And none of the Prior studies had looked at blood oxytocin levels, and so what we had thought was that, well, maybe if Everybody had measured baseline blood oxytocin levels. Maybe some of these you know, maybe there would have been more, positive outcomes.[1:00:17] Dr. Karen Parker: So But there's a there's a lot of controversy in this field about whether oxytocin is a treatment for autism. Right? So after we completed that trial, There was a large multisite, what's called a phase three oxytocin treatment trial that was done at, I think 5 sites, and they gave oxytocin for an extended period of time, and they showed no benefit. And and Were[1:00:44] Andrew Huberman: they looking to see who started off with low levels of oxytocin at pretreatment?[1:00:49] Dr. Karen Parker: So what was interesting about that study, and there were a lot of issues with it, was that, oxytocin is something where You have to if you look at it, it degrades. It's like that's kind of what I joke about. Right? So you need to take it. We take when we go in, we have, like, these Really intense protocols.[1:01:09] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So you go in, and we have vacutainer tubes that are cold, and we put them on ice. And then the phlebotomist takes the blood from the child. Then we[1:01:17] Andrew Huberman: a lot of technical gymnastics. Yeah.[1:01:19] Dr. Karen Parker: And then we make sure we spin it in a centrifuge cold, and then we pipette it onto dry ice. So, like, so we have very minimal loss of the signal. And so if you don't adhere to those rigid protocols, which is very difficult to do across multiple sites, it can be very difficult to get an accurate read of oxytocin. And so I think for me, it's still an open question. They didn't see the blood oxytocin predicted response, in that study.[1:01:48] Dr. Karen Parker: The data weren't provided in the paper. It was just said that they didn't. But it's still an open question. And so that, you know, maybe that is the way. So if you give it acutely like in those early studies we talked about, That maybe oxytocin, you know, diminishes fear.[1:02:22] Dr. Karen Parker: We know that oxytocin decreases, the stress axis, the hypothalamic pituitary, adrenal axis, and then it can, diminish anxiety in animal models. So we that's well established. And in a former life, I was a stress researcher, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. But but it's sort of the sad thing is is that once you have a negative trial, it, there isn't a lot of interest in funding, the work going forward. Right?[1:02:47] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I think it's still really an open question about if there is a subset of individuals that could benefit from oxytocin replacement therapy. Right? And it's and and until there's money to do that work, we may not ever know the answer.[1:03:03] Andrew Huberman: Well, it will be important for that work to be done eventually. Hopefully, the field will return to it despite whatever trends might be happening now. I think it's important to know for the parents of autistic children, whether or not there were any negative effects of oxytocin administration, in particular in the children that did not benefit from oxytocin treatment. The rationale is the following. Well, course, these things require a prescription.[1:03:31] Andrew Huberman: If a parent has a child with autism, especially if they're young enough that the behavioral interventions could possibly stand a good chance of inducing neuroplasticity, rewiring of the neural circuits that underlie social connection. Well, then there's this, time limited window in which, you know, those parents presumably are willing to try most anything provided it's Safe. Right. So let's assume and I'm making up these numbers now because I haven't seen this study, but according to what you told me, that, let's say, a third of The autistic boys and girls that come in have, low baseline levels of oxytocin. They're the ones that are going to benefit this oxytocin intervention, the other 2 thirds don't.[1:04:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, given the difficulties of measuring based on levels of oxytocin, most people don't have access to those kind of resources. If it's safe to give oxytocin no matter what, well, then if I were that parent, I'd be knocking on my physician's door saying, hey. Give me an Acetosin spray because my kid might fall into that 1 third category if and only if it turns out that oxytocin is safe to give. But if there's a risk profile that doesn't justify that kind of shotgun approach, well, then I wouldn't do that. Yeah.[1:04:38] Andrew Huberman: So, is oxytocin spray safe? And if so, why doesn't every physician who has a patient with autism give them oxytocin nasal spray?[1:04:48] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. I it's a great question, and I I know that you know, I'm a parent of 3 children, and I know this sense of, like, you would do anything to help your child. Right? And so I I think the tricky part is that it was one thing I will say is that all of the studies, and there's been many of them, have shown that oxytocin is, is relatively safe in a pediatric population. Right?[1:05:10] Dr. Karen Parker: The tricky part is I don't know there's Physicians that, you know, really pay attention to clinical trials. And if they don't see a benefit, they may not be willing to write the prescription. Right? So until we could Identify a group of children that could benefit. You know, we need to create the opportunity for physicians to recognize that this Potentially still be a treatment.[1:05:32] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? But that work you know? But I I think the tricky part in what I will say is and we can maybe talk a bit about Vasopressin, which, You know, my feeling is that if I was placing bets and and having to choose between these 2, my my money would be on vasopressin.[1:05:46] Andrew Huberman: We are definitely going to Yeah. Talk about vasopressin in detail. I mean, the reason I I mentioned that hypothetical scenario is Just the sense of urgency and in some cases, desperation that parents feel.[1:05:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:05:57] Andrew Huberman: And, you know, time's ticking. And if oxytocin's safe, then, You know? I guess I'll put in my vote that, you know, parents should at least talk to their physician, maybe even hand them the study, to consider. But I can also understand the perspective of a pediatrician who says, well, listen. It was a small number of kids that benefited.[1:06:14] Andrew Huberman: You're welcome to try it, But I don't you know, it doesn't seem like the results are that impressive, but, yeah, this gets to a bunch of larger issues about, you know, Medical care and and randomized controlled trials and the desperation of parents and kids to treat neurodevelopmental challenges Right. I I just want to ask because it feels relevant in a in a real way. You know, if ultimately the goal of Improving symptom profiles in autistic kids is about improving social cognition and social behavior, and that process involves rewiring of brain circuits, neuroplasticity. Is there any reason to think that Other approaches to inducing neuroplasticity would be beneficial even if they're not in the biological pathways that are disrupted in autism. I think for instance about the now extensive use of SSRIs Mhmm.[1:07:09] Andrew Huberman: For the treatment of depression. Some cases it works. In some cases it doesn't. Side effect profiles are a serious concern Yeah. As, discussed on this podcast before, but Ultimately, we know that depression is not a serotonin deficiency.[1:07:23] Andrew Huberman: In most cases, SSRIs are atypical antidepressants like Reprion, Wellbutrin, and things of that sort, when they work, they probably work because of their ability to induce neuro or assist neuroplasticity.[1:07:35] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:07:36] Andrew Huberman: Right? Also the trials on Psilocybin are not really about Psilocybin. They're about neuroplasticity. At least the trials for depression. Right?[1:07:45] Andrew Huberman: There may be other uses of psilocybin that relate more directly to the effects of psilocybin. But, ultimately, you know, what we're talking about here Is it the attempt to rewire the brain in a specific way, whether or not it's assisted by oxytocin or some other mechanism? So the question is are there trials happening where people are exploring, say, psilocybin, MDMA, which, by the way, we know, increases Oxytocin I was gonna say serotonin. Dramatically Yes. As well as, things like atypical antidepressants In kids that have autism, not because we think that those, autistic kids are deficient in any of the neurochemicals that drugs would target, but that these drugs can help rewire the brain, and ultimately, that's what these kids need.[1:08:29] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. I I it's a really great point. And I there might be subsets of kids. Right? There might be kids where there would be a medication that would target other pathways, but that Potently releases oxytocin.[1:08:41] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? That but there might be kids that have an oxytocin deficiency. Right? But I think that that circles back To your point at the beginning or our point is that autism is a very heterogeneous condition and being able To know before you begin a trial. Right?[1:08:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Like, who am I gonna put into it, and what is my primary come, like, one measure that I think is gonna move the needle. Right? Like, it kinda requires a crystal ball. So there's a lot of guesswork that goes into this. But I would very much like to see I I will say one other thing that, there I have a colleague named Adam Gustalla who's at the University of Sydney, And he published a paper a year or 2 ago now suggesting that oxytocin be may be most effective in kids at younger ages.[1:09:26] Dr. Karen Parker: And I I don't quote me somewhere between 2 and or, you know, 2 and 5 or 3 and 6[1:09:31] Andrew Huberman: or something. The paper and put it in the show show notes.[1:09:33] Dr. Karen Parker: But, you know, so it could be your point about neuroplasticity, that oxytocin may be maximally beneficial in younger ages. Right? And if you're if these Studies are these hodgepages across ages and across sort of different social phenotypes. Finding that Signal is really important. Right?[1:09:54] Dr. Karen Parker: And and maybe age is a driver or or maybe, you know, low blood oxytocin regardless of What age you are or maybe in Adam's case, if you recruit really young children, you're likely to see a benefit just Has the the brain is wiring up, and it's more plastic at, you know, younger ages.[1:10:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's also a vote, in my opinion, for early examination of kids. Right? Like, parents really need to get autism screening, and perhaps maybe the the most important thing is to make autism screening as available and as inexpensive as possible for everyone because of the importance of Early intervention, even if it's purely behavioral intervention, but certainly if it's behavioral and drug intervention.[1:10:38] Dr. Karen Parker: But the clinic wait times are really long. Right? So you have to have a Specialist who's capable to diagnose autism. And so you could have a clinic where, you know, you're showing troublesome features and a parent wants to get their kid into a clinic, and you could have a 12 month or or 18 month wait time. Right?[1:10:55] Dr. Karen Parker: And so there are a lot of people that are thinking about, are there are there laboratory based tests that we can develop maybe either for detection or clinical referral? Right? So could we come up with a A biomarker panel, for instance, where we might be able to say, wow. Here's some here's a panel where we think this Child is at reasonable risk for developing autism. Can we make sure they're prioritized for getting a diagnosis, right so we can get them an an early intervention.[1:11:26] Dr. Karen Parker: But right now, we don't we don't have that. Right? So having some sort of laboratory based test, whether it could be biological, Or if we could do something with eye gaze. And there's a lot of companies working on these things now to say, This may not you know, there and and also, obviously, again, autism is always controversial in this field. Right?[1:11:46] Dr. Karen Parker: There's so many different stakeholders. A lot of clinicians will say, well, I don't I don't want a 32nd video clip replacing expert clinical opinion. There's good reasons for them to feel that way. But I think if there was a way to prioritize people that are in this line, you know, we could get diagnoses faster.[1:12:04] Andrew Huberman: Well, you wouldn't want false positives, but I would think that a 30 second video clip provided it's of something useful. It's gonna be more valuable than nothing Yeah. Given the time sensitivity. What are some of the barriers to, getting this behavioral testing to be not just more prominent, but pervasive? Like, it seems to me that well, I recall in school, they gave us the hearing test.[1:12:26] Andrew Huberman: We all marched on the bus. We get the beep test and, you know, You know, for hearing, challenges, we get vision tests. You get the Babinski reflex Test them, not the moment you come out of the womb, but pretty pretty soon after. I mean, why isn't this stuff, happening, for autism, For every kid.[1:12:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. It's not scalable. Right? So you these interviews with parents and the tests that you do can take hours. Right?[1:12:53] Dr. Karen Parker: And and any given clinician, even if they're working really long hours, there just aren't that many people that are have the Stensive training needed to make these expert diagnoses. Right? And so I think that there's, you know, clinicians that are doing the absolute best they can, but they can only see a certain number of of people a week. Right? And so[1:13:13] Andrew Huberman: have to be a physician? Sorry to interrupt. Does it or could it could, you know, could a well trained technician do this?[1:13:19] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Well, I mean, I I think, technically, it's a DSM diagnosis. Right? So it's usually somebody with a clinical degree. So it would be a clinical psychologist.[1:13:28] Dr. Karen Parker: It could be a behavioral Pediatrician. It could be, you know, a child psychiatrist or a child neurologist, but, I mean, again, that requires years years of training. And with if we look in areas where people have fewer accesses to access to resource, I mean, particularly in impoverished areas, The mean age of an autism diagnosis is years later than in wealthy areas where, you know, there's many different medical specialists with parents, You know, that aren't working 3 jobs and, you know, can sit waiting around, you know, and and really lobby and and really advocate for their kids. Right? Because, You know, if they don't show up for work that day, they're not gonna get fired from their job.[1:14:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so I think that, you know, if there's some sort of solution that allows There to be a more democratic approach to saying we need a really quick way, like you said, to be able to identify at risk Children, especially if it's a a blood test or something like that, you know, it could be incredibly impactful.[1:14:29] Andrew Huberman: Are there human trials exploring MDMA, methylene dioxide, methamphetamine also referred to as ecstasy, and or psilocybin for, treatment of autism?[1:14:42] Dr. Karen Parker: So I was aware that MAPS had an MDMA Trial in autism, I don't know what's happened with that.[1:14:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Perhaps it's still ongoing. I'll check the map Sight. I'm in communication with them from time to time. I mean, the the the reason for asking it, of course, you know, but maybe in case, let some of the listeners, Don't is the MDMA causes these massive increases in serotonin.[1:15:05] Andrew Huberman: That seems to be the major source of the MDMA effect, so to speak, Based on the our work of our colleague, Rob Malanka and, in at least 1 human study comparing, MDMA to very high dose oxytocin treatment Kind of ruled out the oxytocin spike that's induced by MDMA as the as the source or the only source, but, of course, these chemicals can synergize. I mean but Based on its chemical profile, oxytocin release, massive serotonin release, dopamine release, and a propensity to enhance neuroplasticity. I mean, assuming all the safety protocols were were there, seems like not the perfect drug, but not a bad choice, if, of course, it's inducing the kind of plasticity that someone with autism would be seeking. Right.[1:15:52] Dr. Karen Parker: I mean, I think the tricky part, especially in children, right, is there's gonna be a reluctance to potentially give them psychedelics. Right? And so, You know, is there a way to modify, you know, the chemical compound to, you know, be something that Parents might be more willing to give to their children. Right?[1:16:11] Andrew Huberman: Right. And I totally agree with that. I guess to play devil's advocate, not against you, but, well, I'll just state it very directly, and then I'll I'll take the heat as necessary. I mean, I've done 2 episodes about the, the drugs that, you know, millions tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of parents are already giving their kids For ADHD, which are, include amphetamines, including dioxin, methamphetamine is actually a prescription drug for a very small subset of kids with ADHD, but Things like Adderall, Vyvanse, even methylphenidate, Ritalin. I mean, these are amphetamines.[1:16:46] Andrew Huberman: They induce dopamine release and norepinephrine release. And, again, I'm not suggesting people, give their kids MDMA, to try and ameliorate symptoms of autism, but something chemically similar to it ought to be developed or at least blurred in a human trial in my in my opinion. Well, time will tell. I'll reach out to the MAPS group and see see what's happening. Let's talk about vasopressin[1:17:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes.[1:17:07] Andrew Huberman: Because there's a lot to discuss there. So you told us this is a molecule that chemically is very similar to oxytocin. Is it manufactured in the human brain and body?[1:17:16] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes.[1:17:17] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Do we know a subset of the sites that it's known to be produced and where some of its actions are. Mhmm. And you mentioned the kidney and the antidiuretic hormone Right. Roles, but Within the brain, like, what brain areas have neurons that make vasopressin?[1:17:32] Andrew Huberman: Well, so Or have the receptors for[1:17:34] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. I mean, the receptors are all over are all over the brain. And, again, it varies depending on the species and, you know, the way the receptors are measured are in postmortem tissue, right, which can be very difficult to get good samples. Right? And so we need to have that caveat going in.[1:17:52] Dr. Karen Parker: But, yeah, I mean, it's it's made in the hypothalamus, and it's released all over the brain, and there is vasopressin receptors all over the brain. Right? And, What's really interesting about vasopressin I always sort of joke that oxytocin, you know, always saw its day in the sun, if you will, and the vasopressin was sort of The stepchild that was, like, left, you know, sort of behind. And and the reason why I find this fascinating is, again, like, I think back to my, You know, my my roots as a, you know, evolutionary biologist, behavioral neuroscientist. And what was interesting is that there were studies in the early To mid 1990 showing that vasopressin was critical for male social behavior.[1:18:36] Dr. Karen Parker: And so, There was work you know, there was a variety of people, and I I think Rob Malenka mentioned this on his on on the podcast he did about you know, there's a a group of people like Sue Harder, Larry Young, Tom Insull, some of these early people, and they gave vasopressin to male prairie voles, and vasopressin was what induced, pair bonding, with a a female mate and also paternal care.[1:19:03] Andrew Huberman: And and as I recall, Those experiments were done in the context of looking at, polygamy versus monogamy[1:19:10] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[1:19:10] Andrew Huberman: Of these prairie voles.[1:19:12] Dr. Karen Parker: Prairie voles versus, Like, a different species, so same, genus, but a different species. So it might be a montane vole or, you know, Highly related, but these other species so prairie voles are monogamous. The males life? Well, I mean, that was the[1:19:28] Andrew Huberman: part percent divorce right.[1:19:29] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. That was I don't think it's that[1:19:31] Andrew Huberman: bad, but I think the part than we are as[1:19:33] Dr. Karen Parker: a species. True. Yeah. We should look to them for pointers.[1:19:36] Andrew Huberman: And all the divorce folks are saying, wait. Why'd you say better? Have some divorce friends that have said divorce is like the greatest thing. So we always say, like, doing better, doing worse. Right?[1:19:44] Andrew Huberman: Anyway, that's a whole other podcast, and certainly not the Youberman Lab Podcast, but or maybe it is, but, or will be. But, yeah, my understanding is that you have certain voles that mate with almost exclusively with 1 other vole for their entire lifespan. And then you have other voles located elsewhere, that in those colonies, they mate with lots of different well, so the males and females have lots of different partners, raise young with lots of different partners, mating with lots of different partners, and that if you give vasopressin, then you can make the I always wanna call them polyamorous, but I don't know if they love each other. I'm gonna answer for more and assume that they love each other. The polygamous moles, not polyamorous, but polygamous moles then become monogamous.[1:20:31] Dr. Karen Parker: Well, I yeah. I would say that is probably not the take home message. So the take home message would be they Had let's say that there was, like, the good voles, right, which are the prairie voles, and they were the ones that form these monogamous pair bonds. Dad participates in paternal care with mom. They co raise babies together, and then dad chases off intruders.[1:20:50] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And then there's the more asocial voles, and so these are Like the montane voles, and, it will will stay it's a complicated story, but there's these montane voles where, males and females live separately. Females, like, maybe live on the male's territory. The male mates with a few different females. Absolutely doesn't provide any care at all.[1:21:12] Dr. Karen Parker: Mom raises babies by herself. Right? So that's these are really the[1:21:15] Andrew Huberman: 2 shots. 19 fifties versus 20 twenties.[1:21:17] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes. Yes.[1:21:19] Andrew Huberman: To be just to broadly stereotype.[1:21:21] Dr. Karen Parker: To broadly stereotype. And if you give okay. So for prairie voles, They're sort of primed to form bonds and to be the males to be good daddies, if you will. And all you have to do is give them a single injection of vasopressin And you know? Or you can give an antagonist.[1:21:38] Dr. Karen Parker: And, usually, the way they form the bond is through mating. Right? So they You put them with a female. They mate. They cohabit for a bit.[1:21:46] Dr. Karen Parker: There's been all kinds of parametric studies. I I can't remember how many hours it takes to form a parabond, but then you can do these things called partner preference tests. And then you can say, here's the guy that you mated with. Here's this guy you don't know, and you can do it for males, you can do it for females, and they pick their partner. They choose to go hang out with their partner.[1:22:03] Dr. Karen Parker: The montane voles, you know, either after mating somebody may either be equal or maybe they'll even go spend time with the new individual. So the cleanest story was that prairie voles are monogamous, montane voles are not monogamous. But in the prairie voles, you could give vasopressin instead of mated cohabitation, and you could turn on, Like, you know, a bond with somebody after only living with them for a very short period of time. Right? Or you could induce paternal behavior.[1:22:33] Dr. Karen Parker: And I was working with a vol species in grad school. I think the most interesting scientific experience that I've ever had. Right? And you and I both know this. Right?[1:22:41] Dr. Karen Parker: When you're young, you're actually the person doing the work. Right? As you become, you know, the head of your lab, you're mostly writing grants and giving talks. Right? And then you get to hear about Super cool things that everybody in your lab is doing.[1:22:53] Dr. Karen Parker: Right?[1:22:54] Andrew Huberman: Eventually, the the members of your laboratory kick you out of the lab. Exactly. They literally say, Like, get out of here. You're leaving things in the wrong place. Whereas, initially, you're telling them, hey.[1:23:03] Andrew Huberman: That's in the wrong place within a year or 2. For me, think it took about 4 or 5 years.[1:23:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[1:23:08] Andrew Huberman: But by about year 6[1:23:09] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:23:10] Andrew Huberman: I was demoted to my office Yeah. Write grants and write papers.[1:23:15] Dr. Karen Parker: Told that one time I was back there, and I tried to wait, and I was, like, so excited what they were working on. And they basically just said, go write grants and bring in more money. Right? That was kind of their attitude. Like, we get to be the ones who get to do the cool stuff.[1:23:25] Dr. Karen Parker: So back when I got to actually do the science, I remember I had this species where and I and, again, I told you I came at this from an evolutionary perspective. So these were called meadow voles, And I found them very interesting. So when I showed up in my thesis adviser's lab, she's I said, I really wanna study oxytocin and Preston, and I really wanna study voles. And I know you have a vol species. And she said, well, I don't have prairie voles.[1:23:49] Dr. Karen Parker: I have these meadow voles, and I'm studying them because they're so sensitive to light, And they changed their behavior based on light. And as she said, well, you can do what you want, but our grants basically have to have a circadian component. She said, you gotta work that in, but then we kinda struck this deal. So I was hanging out in the animal rooms, and I thought it was really fascinating. So she had animals that were either on Short day lengths are long day lengths, so the mimicking some some, summer and winter.[1:24:16] Dr. Karen Parker: And I was noticing that on winter day lengths, the the males were hanging out with the females. And when the female had a litter, he was, like, participating. And I was like, woah. These are not supposed to be monogamous animals. And so I went into the field research, And they were doing all these radio telemetry studies.[1:24:33] Dr. Karen Parker: And so, like, if you[1:24:34] Andrew Huberman: We should probably explain what those are. Putting a little transmitter, under the skin, it's painless for the animal, but that allows the researcher to, monitor the behavior of the animal[1:24:43] Dr. Karen Parker: In the fields.[1:24:44] Andrew Huberman: Remotely without having to, you know, and put them in cages and stuff. So And[1:24:48] Dr. Karen Parker: so this is, like, under field conditions. And voles are everybody's favorite snacks, so they have, like, a very limited lifespan in the wild. I mean, like, On the order of months. And and so, like, if you have a short lifespan, like, you should just keep reproducing. Right?[1:25:02] Dr. Karen Parker: And so what was interesting is At the end of the summer days, as you're going into winter, territories collapse and males are found with females. And they co raise babies that make sense if it's you're gonna have a litter and mom needs to get up to go eat, you need somebody to sit there and warm those babies or they're gonna die because they're gonna freeze to death. Right? So I started saying like, wow. I think these metavoles are good dads.[1:25:24] Dr. Karen Parker: Like, I'm noticing this. And so I told my thesis adviser, I wanna study How oxytocin and vasopressin can maybe this is involved in tracking these evolution or mating strategies. And so, again, like, the coolest experience I ever had was on these males that were housed under short day length, so they were like winter males. I was able to put Vasopressin directly into their brains, and and it was like turning on a light switch. And they ran around the cage, Picked up all these babies, put them in a nest, and huddled over them.[1:25:57] Dr. Karen Parker: And if you put a placebo into their brain, nothing happened. And so to me, I always file that away in, you know, in the back of my mind of like, wow. Vasopressin is this really interesting Hormone, and maybe someday, I will I did a postdoc on something else, but it was always, you know, back in the back of my mind of I really wanna return to this.[1:26:21] Andrew Huberman: It's so incredible that a 8 amino acid long peptide could basically turn these, relatively negligent Fathers into very attentive fathers.[1:26:31] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes. Yeah. It was fascinating.[1:26:33] Andrew Huberman: Right. The I mean, it just speaks to the power of The peptide, vasopressin, also speaks to the power of brain circuitry. It also speaks to the idea that brain circuitry is often sitting latent in the background, you know, ready to be Devated that it's not just about neuroplasticity and building up a new circuit that some forms of neuroplasticity are about unveiling what's Yeah. What's already there[1:26:56] Dr. Karen Parker: Absolutely.[1:26:56] Andrew Huberman: And that peptides can act like switches[1:26:58] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:26:59] Andrew Huberman: Which, you know, kinda makes sense on the one hand, but, I've never heard of a result as dramatic as that. So I'm presuming you're gonna tell us that That then led you to go back to vasopressin and explore its ability to induce good parenting and negligent fathers.[1:27:17] Dr. Karen Parker: No. Haven't studied that yet. No. Well so I think that, you know, my mom always says chance favors the prepared mind. And so I was Doing my postdoc at Stanford, and I got recruited to stay on the faculty.[1:27:30] Dr. Karen Parker: And I, you know, had been doing work in stress vulnerability and stress resilience, And I really and I love doing that work, but I still felt this tug of you know, I had spent all this time in a psychiatry department where I was surrounded by clinicians, And I realized that a lot of the stuff that I was doing had clinical relevance. Right? And so sometimes you sort of meet the moment. Right? And so right as I was Transitioning to to have my own lab in my department, there was a bunch of stuff going on.[1:28:01] Dr. Karen Parker: So there were a lot of very dedicated parents Who were lobbying for funding for autism research because it was horrifically underfunded. Really? Horrifically underfunded. Wow.[1:28:11] Andrew Huberman: I mean, at rates of 1 in 36 years.[1:28:13] Dr. Karen Parker: At the Time. Right?[1:28:14] Andrew Huberman: So it[1:28:14] Dr. Karen Parker: was it was 1 in a 150 or whatever it was back then. But there were all these parents, and and I I mean, again, they're heroes in my eyes that they advocated so much for their loved ones. And so there was you know, they started forming parent grassroots organizations that have culminated. They all started joining together, which is now autism speaks. And then there was a man named Jim Simons who runs, one of the most successful hedge funds in the world, and he decided, Wow.[1:28:39] Dr. Karen Parker: I'm in a you know, there's let let's put money into autism. Right? And so there's he[1:28:43] Andrew Huberman: have a personal link to autism?[1:28:45] Dr. Karen Parker: I you'd have to ask him.[1:28:46] Andrew Huberman: Because oftentimes, Not always, but oftentimes when you hear about wealthy donors[1:28:52] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:28:53] Andrew Huberman: Devoting a lot of money to one area of science, there's there's a familial thing there. Yeah. You know, a member of their family or a close friend has this challenge, and they they really wanna see that challenge.[1:29:03] Dr. Karen Parker: Absolutely. I mean, a A lot of money I've gotten for my lab from philanthropists, and what I will say is the most impactful work I've ever done is through philanthropy. Right? They're crazy ideas that no funding agency ever touches. Right?[1:29:16] Dr. Karen Parker: But yeah. So they put they both put, a lot. Know, there there was a lot of emphasis. And so because the Simons Foundation started issuing requests for applications, there was a group at Stanford that formed, and it was, a clinician with a basic scientist, and my chair at the time said, well, you know, almost nothing is known about the biological basis of autism. Why don't you go I'm gonna introduce you to the the the head of child psychiatry.[1:29:41] Dr. Karen Parker: You should go talk to this group. And so as I was preparing my slides And realizing that, you know, social interaction impairments were a core feature of autism, I thought, wow. You know, these neuropeptides may really be, You know, a part of this puzzle. And so that's actually really how I got pulled into, autism research was was through that, and it was I I was you know, everybody at the time was very interested in oxytocin. And, you know, I remember thinking so we actually did probably the most definitive blood oxytocin, study because there was this idea, again, like, this marketing campaign of, like, the oxytocin deficit hypothesis of autism.[1:30:23] Dr. Karen Parker: And, you know, given how clinically heterogeneous autism was, we got money actually from the Simons Foundation, and we did the 1st study with Maybe 200 kids. And what we were able to show was that blood oxytocin was not a marker of right? So it wasn't like there was a bimodal distribution, meaning 2 completely non overlapping levels of oxytocin in people with autism, people without autism. So the lower your blood oxytocin levels, actually, regardless of who you were, you could be a child with autism, you could be an unaffected with autism or you could be a unrelated control child, and it was the lower your blood oxytocin levels, the greater your sort of social difficulties. And the slopes, you know, were different.[1:31:07] Dr. Karen Parker: They started at different points because the behaviors were obviously different, But that's what got us thinking about our clinical trial, which is that blood oxytocin level is not going to be this great differentiator between People with and without autism. Right? But we might be able to find a subgroup who could benefit from treatment.[1:31:25] Andrew Huberman: But what I like so much about your approach, The way you described it is that it it sets aside. We don't we don't wanna say discards, but it sets aside this thing that we call autism[1:31:36] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:31:37] Andrew Huberman: Which is already hard to define and diagnose, and there's all these different spectrums and you're trying to and just says, okay. Children with autism have challenges in social cognition, social behavior, social bonding. Yeah. So do adults with autism for that matter. Let's just focus on that Yeah.[1:31:54] Andrew Huberman: And not worry so much about whether or not somebody is diagnosed as autistic or not And just focus on what are some of the potential neuropeptide deficits or overexpression of neuropeptides that may in some way relate to those social challenges.[1:32:09] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:32:11] Andrew Huberman: And then one can circle back to the question about autism in collecting those data, But it it also points to this idea that, like, when we when we go after a disease like Alzheimer's, we can often miss the possibility that Alzheimer's while it has, You know, deficits in cognition and memory could also be a bunch of other things like a metabolic disorder of the body, and so maybe you go after a particular symptomology Yep. And trying to attack that, and you might actually potentially treat or cure multiple diseases. It's a very different approach, And I I hope, people are catching on to the the subtlety, but also the the the potential impact of that. Because if I heard correctly, you said there are people who are not autistic who have social functioning deficits, And they too have less circulating oxytocin.[1:33:02] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So I would say we haven't Studied people where we brought them in and characterized it. Right? So these are typically developing kids, but what we did is in the abilities that are typical call of a controlled child, we still saw that gradient. Right?[1:33:18] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I think it just sort of begs the question about, You know, what is oxytocin's role in human sociality? Right? I mean, I think there's just so much that we don't understand About both of these molecules, in terms of their disease liability, if they're low or their healing potential, if we are, You know, able to use them as modulators, of other therapies. Mhmm.[1:33:45] Andrew Huberman: So how did you Move from oxytocin to vasopressin. You mentioned that everyone was all excited about oxytocin. Still the one that we hear the most about. Yeah. Although after this podcast episode and when I start blabbing about vasopressin to everybody, you know, maybe that'll change, but it's I think it's gonna take a lot more than that.[1:34:05] Andrew Huberman: But, maybe it's because the name isn't as there's something about oxytocin that, like, kinda sounds like the love looks like the love hormone, but, like, vasopressin should be renamed.[1:34:15] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. Well, it's not[1:34:16] Andrew Huberman: be called something else. Like, not antidiuretic hormone, not vasopressin. I mean, you're gonna tell us how critically important it is, perhaps even more important than oxytocin for autism and social functioning. So I don't know. By the end of this podcast, we'll we'll come up with a new name.[1:34:31] Dr. Karen Parker: I I it's needed. Right?[1:34:32] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'll I'll put it out there. Okay. So how did you get to vasopressin?[1:34:38] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay. So it was interesting with oxytocin because we didn't you know? And, again, I was skeptical that we would see these big group differences, but, you know, it was a little bit of like, okay. You know, what everyone's saying, this is not gonna be the big solution. Right?[1:34:53] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I actually came at it from the work that we did in monkeys. And so I think I mentioned previously at the beginning of the podcast has that there were a lot of limitations that I saw. And then sometimes if you come into a field, you know, when you're You're a little bit of an outsider. Right? Like, I'm not a clinician.[1:35:12] Dr. Karen Parker: I don't see autism patients, but I also I have this really strong interest in social behavior and the biology of it. And so I I was thinking about what are what are things that we need to do to better address the challenges in autism. So one of them was, why are we looking in blood? Right? Like, if you look at neurological conditions, There has been a lot of progress made by doing biomarker discovery in cerebral spinal fluid.[1:35:40] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So, like, the the biological substrates or or Clues of markers of, say, various forms of dementia or, or MS We're for first found in spinal fluid, right, because it's the it's the fluid that bathes the brain in the spinal column. And so if you're looking for The biochemistry of an illness, that's the closest fluid that you can get to the brain. Right? So[1:36:03] Andrew Huberman: Blood draw just won't do it.[1:36:04] Dr. Karen Parker: Maybe. Right? So that was part of my thinking. But then there was the issue of the animal models. Right?[1:36:09] Dr. Karen Parker: So there was drug after drug after drug that was tested in mice, and they failed in human clinical trials. And so It made me start thinking, could we develop a primate model, of naturally occurring social impairments? Right? So can we because in autism, these social impairments are, if you will, naturally occurring. Right?[1:36:30] Dr. Karen Parker: And so, you know, this is these spontaneously Current children. And so it made me wonder, could we identify monkeys in a large colony that have social impairments? In and after talking to to clinicians who's who treat these children, can I spend a lot of I'm validating a monkey model where there will be monkeys that have features that look like they have direct relevance to core autism symptoms? And so what I did was there's a, primate center, the California National Primate Research Center. And so what we did is so I think I mentioned earlier that there's these Surveys that can be used to look at autistic traits in the general human population.[1:37:15] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so we refined one of these, and we did what we call back translate. So, basically, it's an instrument that's used for humans, and then what we did is modified it to be able to To use this rating scale in rhesus macaques, which are an old world monkey, and I know you're familiar with them. And, And I was interested in looking at old world monkeys because they're some of the closest relatives to human that are used in biomedical research. And And, as I mentioned previously, these autistic traits are continuously distributed across the general human population And that this genetic, say let's call it genetic liability, which is a fancy way of just saying that we think that There's a there's a genetic risk that underlies this continuum of behavioral traits.[1:38:04] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So if we think that that's true in humans and one of our closest relatives. And we think that some of these genes create proteins that then are what sets up the developing brain to develop in the way that autistic brains develop. So let's just assume that that's the premise. That's what we went in with.[1:38:21] Dr. Karen Parker: Can we find rhesus macaques that are just living in at large outdoor colonies and identify animals that might be good, models for autism. And the answer is yes. We could do this all kinds of different ways. One is we could just take people and, Score monkey behaviors outside their cages while they're interacting with their peers. We can use rating scales.[1:38:43] Dr. Karen Parker: And, again, the rating scale we use, like, is called the social responsiveness scale. So this is called the macaque social responsiveness scale revised. It's a mouthful. But what it allows us to do is measure autistic like traits in monkeys, And we can also bring monkeys in for experimental tests to see where their eyes look or how do they perform, how do they respond to videos of other monkeys, You know, if they're making affiliate of overtures, do they, do, like, you know you know, McGaugh's goal ball, which is a a positive response. Well, they do that.[1:39:14] Dr. Karen Parker: Right?[1:39:15] Andrew Huberman: I I, I'm going to apologize for interrupting you again, but I just had to tell people this because, I spend time up at the UC Davis primate center as a graduate student. And and by the way, what we're referring to here are noninvasive observational studies, at least thus far. These are monkeys living in large, exclosures. Not enclosures, large exclosures, forming colonies and social relationships. And, you know, I think anyone that sees monkeys at the zoo, and we all learned that monkeys And they don't if you want a monkey to like you, you learn this working with macaques.[1:39:51] Andrew Huberman: First of all, they don't the affiliative call is a. They do this really nice, and the little ones,[1:39:57] Dr. Karen Parker: You do that very well. I spent a[1:39:59] Andrew Huberman: lot of time with these monkeys, and the little ones, they do this thing where they go I used to I used to nurse the little ones every once in a while. They go, And they're just you know, it just, like, makes your heart melt. I think there must have been an oxytocin dump at that moment. That's probably happening right now. But if you want the monkeys to like you, you have to give an affiliative facial Jester, which is not a smile.[1:40:17] Andrew Huberman: That's actually an aggressive gesture. So as Karen, doctor Parker just showed you, it's lip smacking[1:40:22] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:40:22] Andrew Huberman: Which is[1:40:23] Dr. Karen Parker: Yep.[1:40:24] Andrew Huberman: So if you see a monkey at the zoo and you want it to pay attention to you, you're gonna have to lip smack. And if it doesn't, Either you're not doing it right or it just doesn't like you.[1:40:32] Dr. Karen Parker: Exactly. Right. Great.[1:40:33] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Thanks. Now we'll go back to the, the study of, or the establishment of this really key experiment.[1:40:39] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So then what we did is we identified these these animals, and we spent a lot of time. So one one of the things that I do as One of my areas of expertise is validating animal models. So a lot of like I mentioned, like, a lot of reason why Experiments fail as people will take an animal off the shelf and say, oh, I'm gonna do this. Right?[1:41:00] Dr. Karen Parker: But if you're, you know, if you're studying a disorder that's characterized by Visual issues, is it is it the best thing to do in a nocturnal species that has olfaction as its primary sensory modality, or is[1:41:12] Andrew Huberman: it frame to[1:41:13] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. Or is it better you know? And, again, I will say all models have value. There's all you know, there's reasons you just have to you know, you basically have to Stand by what you're modeling. And so I think one of my the biggest issues I have with this sort of mouse phenotyping mafia is that, you know, there's this group of tests that they use, they use it in every single disorder.[1:41:33] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And then if there's a positive hit, it's like, oh, this is like you know, this test is really for Parkinson's today, but it's for depression tomorrow. Right? And so So my goal was to to devise very specific tests that would allow us to evaluate, you know, core features of autism in this model. And the answer is we found Right.[1:41:50] Dr. Karen Parker: So if you look at monkeys that spend a lot of time alone, they have a much greater burden of autistic like traits measuring on this rating scale. They have diminished social motivation, so other monkeys will come up and interact with them, but they don't engage in, social overtures Them that much themselves. They do less grooming, less of, affiliative, behaviors. They in some of the work that we're doing, they don't lip smack back, and we can talk a little bit about that. We did a pharmacological probe, and we can talk a bit about what vasopressin does to that, which is kind of exciting.[1:42:23] Dr. Karen Parker: And so we spend a lot of time validating This behavioral phenotype, right, to say that we really feel like there were are core aspects of it that are allowing us to model autism. Right? And I have a paper, which if you wanna put it in, it's all about creating this monkey model and and And the power of of doing it and where it it took us clinically.[1:42:44] Andrew Huberman: We'll provide a link to that in the show note captions. I also just wanna, throw up my vote for The the fact that you did this work because, again, I I don't disparage mouse model work, but we've just seen over and over again that the incredibly small fraction of mouse models that lead to, valid therapeutics in humans. And that there's just a lot of differences between primate brains and rodent brains, and we have A very elaborate, you know, frontal cortex, a bunch of other circuitry that mice, if they have the that, they probably use it for other things, And it's just very hard to come to draw conclusions from those models, and and they're they're great for probing, functions that are, let's just call them more autonomic type functions, and for doing some of the initial investigations. But, you know, I think while I don't wanna see every research lab switch over to primates, you know, I think one has to be really thoughtful about the kinds of experiments one does With primates at all[1:43:41] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:43:42] Andrew Huberman: This sort of, behavioral assessment and and the identification of a of a primate model for autism seems like a a very good use of[1:43:51] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:43:51] Andrew Huberman: Of, of human resources.[1:43:54] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. Yeah. Well and the other thing I will say is that there were medications that were patients that were only tested in rodents that when they were when they were tested in people had really negative Consequences. I can give you 2 examples. So 1 is Thalidomide, which was a morning sickness medication that was given to women, that were pregnant, and the safety testing and tox with toxicity testing was done only in mice.[1:44:16] Dr. Karen Parker: I didn't[1:44:16] Andrew Huberman: know that.[1:44:17] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes. And that's why it went on the market. It went on the market in Europe, and there were all these Children born with profound limb limb abnormalities, when they went back and tested the drug in, Marmosets, neither rhesus monkeys or cynomolgus monkeys. An old world monkey, they had the limb abnormalities. And so All[1:44:36] Andrew Huberman: they had to do and, again, you know, I I, as an animal lover, treat the the, you know, the life of a single monkey or or a single mouse for that matter. An individual monkey, excuse me, or individual mouse for that matter As, you know, as critical I am a speciesist. I do think there's a difference between their life and our lives when it comes to, you know, what study one does, but, but just the idea that these severe developmental defects in humans could have been avoided by doing an experiment perhaps even on one[1:45:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:45:07] Andrew Huberman: Marmoset.[1:45:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:45:08] Andrew Huberman: And, again, I feel for the life of discomfort of that Marmoset, but, the idea that that could have saved so many human lives It's just striking.[1:45:17] Dr. Karen Parker: Well and there was also that street drug, MPTP Oh, yeah. That was a synthetic heroin, right, that causes, like, overnight Parkinsonianism, right, when, like, think the dopamine cells were just ablated. Right? But when you went and looked in mice, MPTP didn't have those effects. It was only in primates and other or humans and other primates.[1:45:36] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So and I agree with you. I am an animal lover. I I think that we have to be very careful whenever we do any animal experiments. Right?[1:45:44] Dr. Karen Parker: And so you really need to have a good justification, I think, for any science that's done. I will say that up front. And, you know, we have this, you know, new generation of stem cell and organoid work, which I think is going to, you know, allow us to make all kinds of disease progress. Right? So[1:46:00] Andrew Huberman: Without having to study, whole animal models.[1:46:02] Dr. Karen Parker: Or in in complementary. Right? But, I mean, I think, again, I think We need to pick the model based on the question we're asking. Right? And so if you wanna have a medication that's safe and well tolerated, You know, when people, were effective and you wanna move the needle on complex social cognition, you wanna be testing it in a species that also has complex social cognition.[1:46:26] Andrew Huberman: Look. The Netflix show, Chimp Empire Yeah. If people haven't seen it, they should watch it. When you watch it, you realize they're very much like us. Yeah.[1:46:33] Andrew Huberman: And Dare I say, we're very much like them.[1:46:36] Dr. Karen Parker: Oh, yeah.[1:46:36] Andrew Huberman: It's, far and away different than watching a bunch of mice. Yes.[1:46:40] Dr. Karen Parker: And I'm[1:46:40] Andrew Huberman: not being disparaging of mice. I'm assuming they have The mice also have complex social cognition. Vols also have complex social cognition, but it's of the mouse vole type, and we don't know really even what to look for. Right? But with primates, there's, you know, affiliative gaze.[1:46:54] Andrew Huberman: There's, you know, affiliative grooming. There's, ostracization of Individuals in the troop. I mean, there's a there's a, you know, banding it, taking care of other babies. There's all sorts of interesting dynamics that map so clearly on the human behavior Yeah. And vice versa.[1:47:10] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:47:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So you established this colony up at Davis, but the regional primate center[1:47:16] Dr. Karen Parker: Mhmm.[1:47:16] Andrew Huberman: That and where you identified some monkeys that we don't know if they have autism, but you could see that they were less socially affiliative.[1:47:25] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. And I would never say they have autism. Like, I will say that up front. You know, they have features that resemble Human autism and that allow us to model this. Right?[1:47:35] Dr. Karen Parker: So so we started studying those animals, and what we wanted to do was do Some biomarker discovery. So what we wanted to ask was, are there any molecules that allow us to differentiate these, what We'll call them naturally low social or low social monkeys from socially competent high social monkeys. And so we measured a bunch of different, readouts of neurotransmitter systems that were either involved in mammalian social behavior had been implicated in idiopathic, meaning autism that doesn't have a genetic cause or these neurogenetic syndromes that we've been talking about, where there's pathways that are really associated with them. And so if we measured a bunch of these systems With 93% accuracy without even knowing what the monkey who the monkey was if they were low or high social, we could just put them in the low social or high social bucket.[1:48:24] Andrew Huberman: And was this by blood draw or cerebrospinal[1:48:26] Dr. Karen Parker: blood? Was by it was everything. We did blood. We did CSF, and we put all these measures into the hopper. We did a discriminate statistical analysis, which was Like a machine learning algorithm where we just said, here's all this information.[1:48:38] Dr. Karen Parker: Help me classify if this individual is high or low social.[1:48:41] Andrew Huberman: For, Cerebral spinal fluid is collected by spinal tap.[1:48:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Correct?[1:48:45] Andrew Huberman: In my understanding, I've never had 1, but that spinal tap is, of course, more invasive than a blood draw, but it still is, done as an outpatient thing in humans. Like, you can go in, get a needle inserted into the lower spine by by an expert.[1:49:00] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:49:01] Andrew Huberman: They're gonna draw cerebral spinal fluid. I mean, not that much more invasive and time consuming than getting a A needle into your vein for a blood draw. Right? I mean, it's it's we think of it as it's technically a little bit more challenging. Yeah.[1:49:19] Andrew Huberman: But there's CSF draws in humans all the time.[1:49:21] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[1:49:22] Andrew Huberman: So in theory, this could map to a human study.[1:49:24] Dr. Karen Parker: And it did, which we'll talk[1:49:26] Andrew Huberman: Very cool.[1:49:26] Dr. Karen Parker: So we went out and we did this. I have a spectacular statistician who's we we spend a lot of time together. His name's Joe Garner, and, And he is a statistical genius. And so he developed this, and and we do all of our work together or, you know, I would say 95% of it. We just love working together.[1:49:42] Dr. Karen Parker: And he developed a statistical winning winnowing strategy to identify what were the key drivers. And what was fascinating is in this 1st monkey cohort, It was the cerebral spinal fluid levels of vasopressin that were really what was driving this classification. Right? So if we just Knew your levels of your of vasopressin in spinal fluid, but not in blood interestingly. We could pretty closely perfect to perfect classify you as high or low social.[1:50:09] Dr. Karen Parker: And so then we replicated that again in another monkey cohort because, obviously, as a scientist, you always wanna replicate your work. And then if it was really a biomarker, meaning it's a molecule in the body that gives us, an indication of something. And in this case, it's an indication of Your social functioning. We were able to look at, monkeys, and we saw that the vasopressin was consistent across measurement time. So there was a wide variety of vasopressin levels, but within an individual monkey, it was pretty much the same.[1:50:39] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So that's what you wanna see with the biomarker. And then we showed that the vasopressin levels were closely, linked to, spent grooming, Time spent in grooming. And as we mentioned or I think we mentioned earlier, grooming is in many monkey species a critical behavior that solidifies social bonds and maintains them. And so the individuals with the lowest CSF vasopressin levels had, spent the less time the least amount of time in in grooming.[1:51:06] Andrew Huberman: Grooming other monkeys.[1:51:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Other monkeys.[1:51:08] Andrew Huberman: Right. Yeah. This allopathic grooming is a very interesting behavior and, from watching chimp empire. I can tell you that, new relationships are established[1:51:17] Dr. Karen Parker: in[1:51:17] Andrew Huberman: many ways by, monkeys, these chimps, chimpanzees sort of offering their back for grooming. And if another, chimp, elects to, yes, groom that, chimp, then it establishes some form of trust. Yeah. And it and it All seems to have to do with proximity. Like, how close are you gonna let me get to you, vice versa?[1:51:35] Andrew Huberman: In humans, you know, we talk about personal space and Right. Because there's a whole set of things related to Scent in this whole allopathic grooming thing, and then if they, you know, if a if a chimp misbehaves on a on an outing, then they Aren't groomed by others, and they can actually get parasitic infections, and it can be very costly. It's very interesting, you know, To just think of allopathic grooming as a as a not a, kind of a primitive of language, but a whole language into itself.[1:52:04] Dr. Karen Parker: Absolutely. Yeah. And and also just critical for the species. So that was really interesting to me that we were seeing these hints that vasopressin Could be, you know, really important. But, of course, you know, somebody will say and I will say upfront, monkeys don't have autism.[1:52:19] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So then the question becomes, Does this have what's called translational value? So, you know, can I see this observation in animal model, And will it provide fundamental insights into humans? Right? And so I wanted to get cerebral spinal fluid from people, to test this hypothesis because we had, in parallel, done a study looking at blood vasopressin levels in people within without autism, and we didn't see a group difference there unlike this really profound difference that we saw when we looked at spinal fluid in the monkeys.[1:52:50] Dr. Karen Parker: And, again, I think I mentioned the blood vasopressin levels We're indistinguishable if you were high or low social monkey. So there was something about looking more approximate to the brain that was giving us more information than, say, the blood alone. And so I said I wanted to get spinal fluid. And like you said, people do this all the time. How would we, but we're you know, it's not gonna be a first pass, especially when we don't really have any evidence in people to go in for what we would call a research lumbar puncture.[1:53:17] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so I had to get really creative about How do I get spinal fluid from children? And what we did was we piggybacked onto a clinical indication for, a spinal fluid draw. So and and we did this. So I tried to get funding for this.[1:53:33] Dr. Karen Parker: This is like you know, again, I I mean, I think this is important for people to know how science is done. Right? And so I wrote all these grant applications. Nobody would fund it. They said that this is really interesting.[1:53:43] Dr. Karen Parker: It's too high risk. You won't be able to pull it off. And, you know, I don't usually back down from a challenge. Like, if I think something's a good idea and I wanna do it, I'm gonna find a way to do it. If some if it's impossible, that's one thing.[1:53:54] Dr. Karen Parker: But if it's Hard to do. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. You just have to figure out how to do it. And so I always try to see bridges where other people see barriers. Right?[1:54:03] Dr. Karen Parker: And so it's like, well, how can I spinal fluid? And so I went around talking to all my friends who were on and Stanford's really wonderful because it's such a small school. Right? And so You're on all these different committees with all these different people. And so[1:54:16] Andrew Huberman: Lot of committees.[1:54:17] Dr. Karen Parker: Lots of committees.[1:54:17] Andrew Huberman: I can attest. Lot of committees.[1:54:19] Dr. Karen Parker: But it's really cool because you're on them with people from all different Oh, yeah.[1:54:21] Andrew Huberman: I know people in departments that I wouldn't otherwise know.[1:54:24] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:54:25] Andrew Huberman: And you get very, you get to know these people well[1:54:28] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:54:28] Andrew Huberman: In these many committees.[1:54:30] Dr. Karen Parker: And where we live, it's a small community. Right? So, like, I the[1:54:32] Andrew Huberman: experiment, Karen. Maybe there's a I I always wonder whether or not there's a larger experiment, Right? Not on monkeys, not on the the patients or the cloned up, but, like, we're maybe we're the experiment.[1:54:41] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:54:42] Andrew Huberman: Right? And they're looking at how we interact on committees. Anyway, please continue.[1:54:46] Dr. Karen Parker: So I started going up to people that I knew and said, hey. If you're taking spinal fluid, can I get a little bit of extra? Right? And, of course, we got, You know, IRB approval, meaning we had ethics approval and all this. And, or you could get the remnants sample and, obviously, again, get consent from the families.[1:55:02] Dr. Karen Parker: So we could either get a little bit extra when it was being drawn for a research indication. So so they were getting a spinal tap no matter what, and then we were just either we're getting a little bit extra or we were gonna getting the remnant that they were gonna throw out. Right? So usually take more than you need because you don't wanna have to do another spinal Right? And so we were able to go around, and I hustled around and got all these people involved to help me.[1:55:25] Dr. Karen Parker: We put, hot pink Stickers on the lumbar puncture trays so that in the emergency room, so if somebody was doing a spinal tap, they would call us so we knew about it, and we could get, You know, samples, again, under people's consent. So we got all these people involved, and we finally got samples from children with autism and children without autism. And then we also made sure that whatever they were being worked up for was negative. Right? So we got The the sort of healthiest people we could given that everybody was coming in for a medical reason to have a lumbar puncture.[1:55:59] Dr. Karen Parker: And in this in this first study, we had 7 children with autism, 7 children without autism, and we could nearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14 individuals by just knowing their CSF level alone, which is pretty remarkable given that there isn't a biological indicator that we a robust biological indicator that we know.[1:56:21] Andrew Huberman: So, basically, in this relatively small cohort[1:56:24] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[1:56:24] Andrew Huberman: Having low vasopressin is a biomarker of autism. Correct.[1:56:28] Dr. Karen Parker: And and, again and what I will say is in our monkey studies and in our human studies, CSF oxytocin level became our control. Right. So in our monkeys, there were no difference in CSF oxytocin by group. And then in this first study, there were no differences in CSF levels. A sample size of 14 is intriguing, but given autism so clinically heterogeneous, we wanna replicate And so I knew that there was, a professor at the NIH named, Sue Sweetow who was collecting, cerebral spinal fluid In as part of a research study because she was interested in immune parameters and folate deficiency.[1:57:09] Dr. Karen Parker: So she had children that were medically healthy, and they were getting you know, just like at NIH, get these huge workups. Right? So they were very well characterized participants. So we were able to look at and, again, we also this is the 1st time we were able to look at girls. So we had a small sample of girls, And we had boys, and we basically just asked the question, can we replicate this?[1:57:29] Dr. Karen Parker: And I was very interested in, will will oxytocin be what's different in the girls? Right? So maybe there will be some sex specificity here, and it will see low CSF vasopressin in the males and low CSF oxytocin in girls. That was not the case. What we found was that if in the individuals with autism, regardless of their, biological sex, that they all had lower CSF vasopressin levels than the individuals without autism.[1:57:56] Dr. Karen Parker: And because they were so well characterized, We were also able to show on a gold standard research diagnostic assessment of autism. So it's a an assessment That's used, to in a research situation to validate an autism diagnosis by an expert clinical opinion That the lower your vasopressin levels in spinal fluid, the greater your, social symptoms severity, or your clinical symptoms severity. And then we ask, it's like, well, vasopressin's involved in social behavior, but it's not really that involved in restricted repetitive behaviors, and that was actually the case. So It was the CSF vasopressin tracked the social symptom severity, not the repetitive symptom severity suggesting that there might be other biological measures that could be Included as a way to, you know, have a more powerful way to differentiate people with and without autism. And so then I was really so so that was really exciting to replicate that.[1:58:54] Dr. Karen Parker: And then I had a colleague named, John Constantino who, is now at Emory, but he used to be at WashU. And I knew that John I had been at a meeting in I think it was 2010, and I found out that he had what I will call liquid gold. So he had this, minus 80, sea freezer, that was, had a bunch of, neonatal infant CSF samples that he had From human. From human infants. And he had collected them.[1:59:20] Dr. Karen Parker: And, again, this was under at the cold approvals, and it was basically they these infants came in For something that needed to be worked up, that was very rare. But if they had it, they would you know, they they could die, so they needed to get a medical treatment for it. But the the vast majority of these children ended up being healthy. So it was a pretty healthy sample, if you will. Right?[1:59:41] Dr. Karen Parker: And so I knew he had all these samples, and I said to him, wouldn't it be really interesting if we teamed up and we look at this, CSF vasopressin finding in children before the period when behavioral symptoms first manifest. Right? And so[1:59:56] Andrew Huberman: Sorry again to Sorry. I can apologize every time. No. No. I just I but I think it's important because this was a question that, I was thinking about earlier, and I imagine many other people were too.[2:00:05] Andrew Huberman: You know, you find these monkeys that have social, interaction deficits. You find, kids that have social interaction deficits, and you see that There's low vasopressin in both groups. This extends to male and female children. Yeah. But then, of course, the question becomes, well, maybe they have low vasopressin because of So many years or even months of social interaction deficits Right.[2:00:27] Andrew Huberman: Right, that the the direction of causality isn't clear. And so Yeah. When you said liquid gold, you know, Referring to the, CSF from these infants, taken prior to any opportunity for social interaction beyond just, You know, whatever interaction they had with their their mother up until the point the the CSF draw was taken, this really gets at the issue of causality.[2:00:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So it's a quasi perspective, You know, because it was banked, and then a lot of time went by. Right? And so what we realized we could do was and this was a heroic undertaking on John's part. So these were, this was these samples were collected back on paper medical records.[2:01:03] Dr. Karen Parker: So he had to trace 2,000 paper med[2:01:05] Andrew Huberman: What's that?[2:01:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So he had to trace 2,000, I think paper medical records to an electronic medical record, and then what we did is we he looked to see who went on to develop autism and who didn't. Right?[2:01:19] Dr. Karen Parker: So then what we had was spinal fluid samples that have sort of been waiting in the freezer, if you will, and then we could ask, You know, do individuals who later receive an autism diagnosis many months or even years later already have low vasopressin levels as infants? And the reason why this was a compelling question to ask is there's evidence to suggest that behavioral therapies are more effective the younger the child is. Right? And if you think about it, if if behavioral characteristics of autism emerge across development, you know, what if and this was my this is sort of my we haven't We haven't substantiated this yet, but this is, like, sort of my big question. What if all these autism susceptibility genes, some gonna interact and converge upon a few common pathways in the brain.[2:02:05] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so for years, people have talked about this excitatory inhibitory balance theory of autism. But what if vasopressin is one of those pathways because it's so critically involved in social functioning? And so what I was interested in and so let let's just Say for a moment. You know, your genes are set at birth.[2:02:22] Dr. Karen Parker: What if the vasopressin is already low in the brains of these infants? And so it puts them on this very different trajectory where you had this cumulative effect of there may be a little bit less socially interested, and maybe they're not making the eye contact. And if there was a way to intervene really early even potentially with a vasopressin replacement therapy that you might be able to Put them on a different developmental trajectory. So that was my big what if question. And what was really remarkable was so I had been John, hey.[2:02:53] Dr. Karen Parker: Can I have your spinal fluid samples? And and he finally agreed after he saw a couple of those papers. Understandably, he wanted to make sure that we already had shown something in people and animals that were sort of, if you will, symptomatic with social impairment. And what we found was, yes, this was the case. So it was a small sample.[2:03:09] Dr. Karen Parker: It needs to be replicated, But individual so infants that went on to have an autism diagnosis later in life already had low CSF vasopressin levels. Oxytocin levels did not differ between infants that received a subsequent autism diagnosis and those that didn't. So suggesting that we have a biomarker that, you know, might really be a good readout for, you know, clinical referral or risk management monitoring.[2:03:36] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. So you're telling us that levels of vasopressin correlate with social cognition deficits. Got that right? I think that warrants a brief discussion about cerebral spinal fluid. I teach neuroanatomy to medical students, so, Forgive me for for having asked this, but, you know, I think of cerebral spinal fluid as the stuff that exists in the ventricles and down the central canal of the spinal cord and Provides essential nutrients and, for neurons and other cell types in the brain, but it's also a reservoir for chemicals coming from the brain Mhmm.[2:04:14] Andrew Huberman: Which is why the spinal tap is useful. Right. But in the context of a Cerebral spinal tap and you're measuring CSF and you're seeing, okay, lower levels of vasopressin in these individuals with these Challenges with social deficits, does that mean that they're making less vasopressin? Does it mean I mean, it could've gone the other way too. Like, they're dumping too much vasopressin into CSF, and it's not able to function in the brain.[2:04:42] Andrew Huberman: Like, you know, what do we know about CSF, and what does it mean?[2:04:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. Well, I mean, it's a great question. So I I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. Right? So I think of the CSF as as sort of like the kitchen sink of the brain.[2:04:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And what we need is real and so, I mean, my working hypothesis, and we'll talk a little bit about pharmacology, is that there's a deficiency in, in vasopressin production in individuals with autism, but there's a lot of elegant experiments that need to be done to be able to answer this question. So we have Funding currently to look in, postmortem human brain tissue, to look at, in both blood, CSF, and hypothalamic tissue where vasopressin is made to look at inner relationships, right, which is very difficult to do, But also to see if there's a fewer number of vasopressin producing cells and if vasopressin gene expression is diminished. Right? Because that would help us Begin to answer, is this a production issue?[2:05:46] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So if you think back to the prairie voles, they're sort of primed to be parental. Right? Or in in my case the meadow voles. Right?[2:05:55] Dr. Karen Parker: But you can do this in any vol species or at least the 2 that I'm thinking of. And you put vasopressin into the brain, And then all of a sudden, it it unlocks this behavior. Right? So is it possible that children with autism or at least a subset of them, all you have to do is replace vasopressin and that there might be a subset of these kids minimally that Could benefit from vasopressin replacement, if you will.[2:06:20] Andrew Huberman: Is there any evidence for excessive urination in kids with autism? Which If anyone's going, what? What why is he asking that? If you recall, vasopressin is also antidiuretic hormone. I suppose the other question is, Could you has anyone looked at levels of vasopressin in the urine of autistic kids versus non autistic kids?[2:06:41] Andrew Huberman: Because it's acting peripherally, and, you said blood draws don't reveal any differences in, in circulating blood. We know that urine is filtered blood.[2:06:50] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[2:06:50] Andrew Huberman: Fair enough, but, seems at least worth worth the look see.[2:06:54] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay. So I have this awesome medical student in my lab named Lauren Clark, And we with, 3 different physicians from different backgrounds, so, wrote a perspective piece that's currently under review, and it actually asked this question. Jen. So, you know, given all these weird medical naming conventions, it's possible that this information is Existing in information silos in different disciplines. Right?[2:07:18] Dr. Karen Parker: So it raises this idea of if you have low vasopressin so there's a if you Really don't have you're not making vasopressin. You have a disorder called central diabetes insipidus, right, which is characterized by excessive thirst, lots of urination, and and, you know, bedwetting potentially. And so what we wanted to do was ask, has this been missed? Right? So shouldn't there be a subset of kids with autism where we might be able to look at these other physiological features and say, yeah.[2:07:52] Dr. Karen Parker: This is the subset we wanna be giving vasopressin to. And so she wrote this where we did a little bit of a review. And the answer is there's some intriguing, studies that we reviewed in this paper where it looks like and and what's funny is when you read the discussion section, it'll be like, wow. There's all these kids with autism that are drinking lots of water, And we don't know why or, wow, there's a lot of bedwetting, but it's not tied to intellectual disability where you might see a lot of bedwetting or something. So all of these studies kind of raise this point of like, wow.[2:08:23] Dr. Karen Parker: This is really interesting. Study done on this and certainly not any study where people who come at it from brain science and then the who are like an endocrinologist, for instance, was which is where some of these people could show up, are are really connecting the dots. So I think that remains to be determined, but we are actually about to launch a study to investigate this. Right? I was meeting with Lauren yesterday about it.[2:08:51] Dr. Karen Parker: So, it's a really good question, and I hope to have information on it in the not too distant future.[2:08:57] Andrew Huberman: As I recall, alcohol is an antagonist of Vasopressin.[2:09:01] Dr. Karen Parker: So, Al, there's a lot of different drugs that could interact with vasopressin. And so one thing I'm interested in is are there any drugs that release is a side effect, and could some of them be mobilized to treat autism? We also know that, like, acupuncture can release vasopressin. There's been some studies done in rats on that. And so 1 question would just be, are there any alternative therapies where We can be releasing vasopressin naturally, or do we need to, you know, do a replacement study where we give, you know, intranasal vasopressin to children with autism.[2:09:35] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And, of course, I'm I'm not I wanna say I'm not advocating that people go out and do this on their own. Right? Like, I'm I I'm a big proponent of Randomized clinical trials where you assess safety, right, and efficacy. Yes.[2:09:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Science.[2:09:48] Andrew Huberman: Science and medicine. Right. But I appreciate you saying that yet. Some years ago, so this would be mid nineties, there was a small but very active Subculture that I was not a part of.[2:10:01] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay.[2:10:02] Andrew Huberman: I swear. That were combining GHB, gamma hydroxybutyrate, and vasopressin as, combination, quote, unquote, sex drugs. Really? Yes. Paul.[2:10:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I don't know what the rationale for including vasopressin was.[2:10:21] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[2:10:21] Andrew Huberman: In any case, whether or not that's by way of Enhancing social bonding or a direct effect on sexual arousal itself is still unclear. But in any event, since we're talking about vasopressin, Maybe you should tell us about the actual science of, vasopressin. Sorry. Maybe I should allow you to tell us about the actual scientific study of vasopressin. In other words, what happens if you give people vasopressin in a controlled environment?[2:10:45] Andrew Huberman: Right. Exactly. Sort of environment I'm talking about.[2:10:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:10:47] Andrew Huberman: What a controlled environment.[2:10:48] Dr. Karen Parker: Thing I will say because I have people contact all the time saying, where can I get vasopressin? And what I would say is vasopressin means, you know, you're having effects on blood pressure. You're having effects on really important[2:11:01] Andrew Huberman: Right. Vazode.[2:11:02] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. And vasculature. The dosing has To be appropriate, you know, you don't want people just going and trying this because there could be really severe adverse effects. Right? So that's why we've been Studying this in a in a controlled clinical trial.[2:11:15] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So, I teamed up with Antonio Harden, who's a child psychiatrist that, I've been working with for years, And we did the 1st sort of 1st in class vasopressin treatment trial in children with autism. So, again, this was Everyone was unaware of who was on vasopressin, whether it was the family or the clinician who was doing the evaluation, and then it was randomized, placebo controlled, and then we basically gave, vasopressin again twice a day for 4 weeks, to children. They're about 6 to 12 years of age. And then we had a primary outcome measure, which was the social responsiveness scale.[2:11:52] Dr. Karen Parker: We could get into discussions about what a primary outcome measure should be. You know, wouldn't it be great if there was a biological measure? But this is sort of what had been used in the past and something that the FDA approved us using. I was partly interested in using the SRS because we had used it in monkeys. Right?[2:12:10] Dr. Karen Parker: And we had shown, at least in monkeys, we've never looked at this in people because of, You know, the lack of available samples, but that in monkeys in this general population that we've looked at, there's a continuous distribution of these SRS Scores that relate to the CSF vasopressin levels. And so what was I wanted to know if we use the SRS as an outcome measure And we're administering vasopressin. Can we change, you know, the scoring on this instrument based on our animal data?[2:12:40] Andrew Huberman: So SRS is social social responsiveness scale. Correct. Without going into a lot of detail because we can always refer people to the paper. Yeah. And I think most people just wanna understand the top contour.[2:12:51] Andrew Huberman: The SRS presumably has to do with, how often the kid, interacts with another kid, how often they initiate that interaction versus on the receiving end, Things like affiliative play, how often they look at one another[2:13:05] Dr. Karen Parker: Yep.[2:13:05] Andrew Huberman: Versus averting gaze, these kinds of things.[2:13:08] Dr. Karen Parker: Yep. Then there's also, a a little bit about restricted repetitive behaviors. So even though it's called the social responsiveness scale, There is also an assessment of other features of autism in it, but you can sort of think about it as a quantitative way to assess features of interest in autism. And this was related to our biology in the monkeys, and so then we use this as this outcome measure, in our trial. And and, you know, as a As an experimentalist, I have this sort of trust but verify.[2:13:39] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? So you wanna you wanna see the same thing over and over and over again. Right? Like, scientists like repetition. And so We had parents fill out, their impressions of what the child's, behavior was, you know, before And after being on the medication, we also had a clinician make an evaluation, but we also had the kids perform laboratory based tests where they would see, like I mentioned, that the, reading the mind in the eyes test, or we would show them a picture of a a face and say, what emotion is this?[2:14:11] Dr. Karen Parker: And so we were able to have what's called, convergent validity. Right? So it's a fancy scientific term to say, do all these measures that we think should be related, are they related, and are we seeing the same thing? And, the answer was yes. So that when we gave children with, autism vasopressin versus Kids with autism or placebo, the kids who were treated with Vasopressin showed, increases in social abilities on parent report, clinician evaluation, And child performance on laboratory based tests.[2:14:42] Andrew Huberman: Wow. Was that in, was that immediate? Like, they they did the nasal spray, and they Immediately started, receiving and and initiating more social engagement, or was this a buildup over time? And what I'm getting at here is Whether or not this is the reflection of, short[2:14:59] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[2:14:59] Andrew Huberman: Or longer term neuroplasticity. Like, were there structural changes in the brain, or or or is this something that was more acute?[2:15:06] Dr. Karen Parker: We don't know the answer to that. So we basically looked at dosing with the idea that we would, you know and and again, I think we've mentioned this about, Limitations on like, there's so many things that a scientist would like to do, but you were always limited by a budget. Right? And so when we started this work again, it was like Philanthropic shoestring budgets. Right?[2:15:24] Dr. Karen Parker: And so you had to really be laser focused on what are the things that we can do on the budget at hand. So, unfortunately, we didn't do, Like EEG or brain imaging or other things that would be, I think, potentially very interesting to do because you might be able to see an early signature of response. Right? So maybe after the 1st dose, let's say, wow. Like, there's some interesting changes that are predictive of somebody who would be a responder to the medication, and we don't know that yet.[2:15:51] Dr. Karen Parker: But we do know after this 4 week period that we we saw, you know, these changes. And then then in a subset of kids, we actually saw diminished anxiety And also diminish restricted repetitive behaviors. So suggesting that the vasopressin effect may not only be on, social behavior.[2:16:10] Andrew Huberman: Have you ever just wanted to try or try vasopressin?[2:16:15] Dr. Karen Parker: You know, I haven't, but I[2:16:16] Andrew Huberman: You're in a psychiatry department after and I am not suggesting that members of the psychiatry department are constantly testing the drugs that they use on their patients with themselves, but but I've had several members of this department of which I'm a courtesy member Right. Member by courtesy. Any event, and we'll see if I'm still am after what I'm about to say, Doctor Carl Deisseroth, who's a clinician, our 1st guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast, also a phenomenal, neurobiology researcher, David Spiegel[2:16:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[2:16:45] Andrew Huberman: Rob Malenka, and others, that I've spoken to, you know, I think all of whom said, you know, that they felt as clinicians Rob's not a clinician, but at anymore. Right? But as a clinician, that they felt almost a responsibility to understand the effects and side effect profiles of the drugs that they were giving their patients, which I saw not as renegade or experimental, but rather as a very compassionate, like, Taking empathy. So I'm curious. Have you ever just snuck a little roll?[2:17:14] Andrew Huberman: No?[2:17:15] Dr. Karen Parker: No. I never have. But there is a long history in medicine of people trying out, they believe so much in their solution that they go and vaccinate their family with the new seen that they've created or they try the medication themselves. Right?[2:17:29] Andrew Huberman: So I don't MDMA was developed by Sasha Colgan in a laboratory in the East Bay, first by a pharmaceutical company in the early 1900, but then kinda disappeared. It did disappear, and then it was resurrected independently in the in the 19, I think, seventies and eighties. And then now it's one of the, sort of hot topic items for the treatment of PTSD. Still in late phase clinical trial, still illegal, but, self experimentation is Is it one of the central themes of psychiatry, frankly?[2:17:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. I mean, I guess, I you know, it's I prob I got in trouble in class for being too social. Right? So So I guess I've never[2:18:05] Andrew Huberman: They might send you over the other side.[2:18:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Who knows? But no.[2:18:08] Dr. Karen Parker: I I never no. And the thing is is that these oxytocin and vasopressin And, again, these are done, and this is this is something that I think we've hit on over and over again in the podcast is you need to know who's you're studying. Right? What's the species? Who's the individual?[2:18:23] Dr. Karen Parker: You know, most of these have been done in, you know, neuro I mean, a lot of the oxytocin and a little bit of the vasopressin work, Single dose work was mostly done in in what we'll call neurotypical people. Right? Just asking, can we move around social behavior by just giving the single Drug administration. Most people that are neurotypical didn't say that they could tell if they were on the drug or the placebo. Right?[2:18:47] Dr. Karen Parker: So Interesting. So I think the question really comes you know, drugs have different you know, they work differently based on the individual who's taking them. So If you have a neurotypical individual and you give them vasopressin, you know, maybe they'll self report that they don't see a difference. But if you had somebody Who isn't producing enough vasopressin, maybe, you know, they would self report after a period of time or maybe even after the 1st dose. Wow.[2:19:13] Dr. Karen Parker: I really see something different. Right.[2:19:15] Andrew Huberman: Right? Did any of the kids, report how they felt? They just said, like, wow. I I like playing with other kids more. Were they self aware in that way?[2:19:24] Andrew Huberman: And, also feel free to mention, if it feels right to you, any, let's let's consider 2 outlier cases. One spectacular result of that Yeah. You know, a kid that went from very socially isolated Mhmm.[2:19:37] Dr. Karen Parker: To, you[2:19:37] Andrew Huberman: know, maybe very gregarious.[2:19:38] Dr. Karen Parker: And Yeah.[2:19:39] Andrew Huberman: But let's also balance that with Another outlier, the the kid with low vasopressin, who took vasopressin, who for whom there was no significant shift. I'm presuming that within the dataset, you probably observe Something like each of those.[2:19:52] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. So, I mean, what I'll say is that, so, yeah, I mean, there were definitely kids who didn't on to the medication. I mean, one thing I think it's important to say, and, again, this was a small pilot trial. Right? We're in the process of replicating this in a much larger sample.[2:20:07] Dr. Karen Parker: So, you know, as a scientist, again, you wanna say, okay. This is really intriguing and interesting, and I've invested a lot in, you know, this monkey model and then doing all the CSF work in patients to suggest that there may be a there there here, but I wanna see it replicate. We did have an article, that Stanford Medicine, I can send you the link. They they were able to, I think, interview a family that had been in the trial. And so, obviously, there's Patient privacy and, you know, you have to they have to say it's okay to talk about it, but this is a family that was contacted.[2:20:40] Dr. Karen Parker: I think they were anonymous, but this is in this report. And they basically said the the dad said that his son was walking around the he was on vasopressin, And his son was walking around a grocery store, and he, like, was looking for him. And he turned around, and he said he was gobsmacked because his child was, You know, just talking to making chitchat with somebody, like, in an aisle, and he said he had never seen that happen before. And so, You know, we do have anecdotal reports like that, and I think, you know, the tricky part is, are we we didn't stratify anyone going into this trial. Right?[2:21:16] Dr. Karen Parker: And so the concern always is, did we get really lucky in the 1st trial and we somehow got the the, quote, unquote, right people that entered the trial that we're gonna be the ones who would respond to the medication, or is this a medication that has sort of broad use in this population and we You know, the 2nd trial will be,[2:21:37] Andrew Huberman: positive. You used nasal spray[2:21:39] Dr. Karen Parker: Uh-huh.[2:21:39] Andrew Huberman: To deliver the vasopressin, And, presumably, that gets into the blood circulation of the brain, and supplies neurons with vasopressin. But it's very nonspecific, And I'm not criticizing, but if you think about it, you're just putting a bunch of vasopressin into the brain. And if people wonder why this is, that it's because, basically, you have neurons of your central nervous system, are part of your olfactory system and, believe it or not, right behind your where your nose meets your forehead, the brain is right there. There's a little bit of bone, and then the brain is is is right there. So, one of the reasons you can In there, and it's easier than an ocular injection or something, that wouldn't be a good approach, and it's easier than peripheral injection injection into the vein.[2:22:22] Andrew Huberman: But at the same time, I have to presume that this I'm imagining this vasopressin just kind of, like, permeating through the brain, binding to whatever receptors happen to be there. You said the receptors are everywhere, And then this significant improvement in social cognition.[2:22:36] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:22:36] Andrew Huberman: So that raises all sorts of interesting questions about, like, what are what Relevant circuits are impacted. Right. Or is it some global incur could it be some global increase in kind of awareness of surroundings? Although some autistic kids are overwhelmed by their awareness of surroundings. So, yeah, what are some thoughts about how vasopressin might be working to exert this this really Impressive and frankly important effect.[2:23:02] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So, I mean, could it increase social motivation? Does it in you know, like so let's talk about, like, how sort of complexity of social, sensory processing. Is it that we're directing attention to social cues where there wouldn't have necessarily been as much attentiveness? Right?[2:23:18] Dr. Karen Parker: Are we increasing social motivation, which would suggest from some of the animal studies may actually be happening. Right? We don't know. And I think that's partly when you have other models or if you're able, you know, to do imaging studies. I mean, one thing that's been a a little bit of a holy grail in this field is that if we could get, tracers that are, basically like you know, a molecule that would allow us to inject it into somebody and then visualize the brain.[2:23:47] Dr. Karen Parker: Like, if I'm thinking about a pet trace or a radioligand where you could then ask questions about, you know, what's happening in the brain. Can we can we give vasopressin in the context of A, you know, functional brain imaging scan and ask, like, where is the vasopressin binding? What kind of circuits are involved? Like, that needs to be the next step of the work to know, like, where where our targets are. And you you can do something like functional proteomics, right, where if you know where Vasopressin receptors are you can overlay that with studies of functional brain imaging.[2:24:20] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And that would allow you to say these areas are dense in vasopressin receptors, and do we see similar responses in what we call bold signal on a on a on brain scan? So let's let's be more colloquial about this. Like, do certain areas of the brain light up, if you will, where we know vasopressin receptors are are densely distributed, in ways that we know are tied to social motivation or social salience or other things that we think could be moving the needle here, in the trial, how is this happening? And and I think, you know, one thing the reason why we did this work is and I think it speaks to what you said earlier is There is an urgency, on the part of parents to say, you know, my child's brain is developing.[2:25:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And and there's a sense of That the you know, by the sort of Western model has failed a lot of people. You know, they look to doctors and say, what are what are the solutions? And doctors will say, Well, we have a limited number of tools in the toolkit here. We just don't know.[2:25:21] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? And so, you know, one of the reasons why they did that big oxytocin study was that People were trying to get the oxytocin anyway, so it was like, let's just make sure that this is safe. Let's see if it's effective. And so some of our thinking was, You know, as soon as some of this work hits, you know, like, it get and some of the work has been covered by the media. And so, you know, our feeling was We can give this intranasally, and we can do it under safe monitoring ways.[2:25:52] Dr. Karen Parker: And so people are gonna think about doing these things anyway. Let's just make sure that this is safe, and let's test this in a rigorous way. So we don't know the mode of action, but then our feeling is is that, You know, at at least from the initial safety data, it looks pretty safe. And, you know, and so the idea would be and there's a long tradition in psychiatry Hi, Atria. We don't know the the mechanism of action, but if we have a medication that can be impactful and improve the lives of people with autism and we can Diminished suffering and people can more readily reach their full potential.[2:26:26] Dr. Karen Parker: You know, to me, it actually seems unethical not to move forward in a way that's sound.[2:26:33] Andrew Huberman: Amen to that. This seems like a good time to raise the topic of the microbiome and not as an unrelated topic. And and here's why. I've seen a fair number of studies in mouse models Arguing that in a mouse model of autism, which now, frankly, I have to kind of wonder about the the, power of that model. But, Anyway, the models are out there in the field.[2:27:17] Andrew Huberman: That fecal transplant into a host that does have social deficits and rescue some degree of social deficits. I don't know if this has actually been done in humans as well. And for those of you that are cringing, yes, they do fecal Transplants in humans for treatment of obesity and a bunch of other things. This isn't because scientists are obsessed with fecal matter. It's because, Fecal matter contains a lot of the microbiome elements, so the microbacteria of the of the gut.[2:27:49] Andrew Huberman: And the reason I'm raising this now is, you know, one possibility, and it's not mutually exclusive with a brain mechanism, is that the administration of vasopressin somehow rescued a vasopressin deficiency in the gut. So the questions are as follows. Is there any evidence that Vasopressin is manufactured in or impacted by the gut microbiome of humans. We'll just start with humans because I think most and, because that would that wouldn't be a smoking gun, but it'd be an interesting, detective story.[2:28:20] Dr. Karen Parker: Well okay. So the 1 piece of evidence that I will say that I find provocative and fascinating. One thing I wanna say is I I think there's really great work done in mice. I don't wanna be a mouse basher. So I wanna just, like, sorta go on the record that I'm not Bashing other models.[2:28:36] Dr. Karen Parker: If it's a conserved so I think about everything from an like, an evolutionary perspective. If a mouse shares A brain structure with a human, and it's highly conserved. You know, mouse work can be incredibly important and very impactful. Right?[2:28:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. My my lab did years of mouse work. Some primate work were necessary. Now I only work on humans. Yeah.[2:28:56] Andrew Huberman: But, Absolutely. It has it has its uses. Yeah. But clearly the primate model for social, deficits As it relates to autism, you you at least have me convinced that that one has a lot of power. Let's just say that.[2:29:10] Dr. Karen Parker: Exactly. Okay. But I'm gonna now say there is a really cool Mouse study that was done that I found and there's been, you know, lots of different studies. So there has been mice. So there's these, Like I said, these genetically modified mice that have genetic syndromes that are you know, where the individuals have social impairments.[2:29:29] Dr. Karen Parker: And some of these individuals, and again, here's a here's a problem with the field. Often, they will measure oxytocin, but not vasopressin. Right? So, like, they're not often both measured gather, which I always do now. But there's been some really interesting evidence that in these mouse models that And and, again, multiple studies, but, like, certainly low blood oxytocin levels in these mouse models.[2:29:54] Dr. Karen Parker: What and and with the sense that maybe they have Some sort of abnormal gut microbiome. And then what they've done is they've given a probiotic To these mice, normalize their social functioning, and that in there's an increase in oxytocin and in a recent study also vasopressin at the level of the hypothalamus. So by giving a probiotic, You I believe the oxytocin levels were increased in the blood. You saw more species typical social behavior, And this was all driven by this upregulation of oxytocin gene expression and also vasopressin in this very recent study. And what's interesting is there's this nerve called the vagus nerve, which is, it's I think, it it means the wandering nerve.[2:30:43] Andrew Huberman: It's for Vagabond.[2:30:45] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. Exactly. Right. And even it's in the gut, but it actually has a direct projection to the nuclei in the hypothalamus where oxytocin and vasopressin are made.[2:30:56] Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting.[2:30:56] Dr. Karen Parker: Yes. And so when you sever the vagus, You then in this one study, it's a neuron paper. I think it's, like, 2020. It's a super cool paper. And then what you do is you decrease the gene expression, And and you don't see the rescue of the oxytocin levels or the social behavior in this model.[2:31:15] Andrew Huberman: So so in other words, if I interpret correctly, and I'll go look up the paper and provide a link to it. They're they're by increasing the Diversity of gut microbiota because that's really what a probiotic does. So across the board increases the diversity of gut microbiota. No one Specific llysis, I always say, because they all seem to end in llysis. You know, multiple llysis.[2:31:39] Andrew Huberman: Here we go again. You upregulate gene expression and thereby action of oxytocin and vasopressin in the hypothalamus, But that's a neural mediated thing. It's not as if the microbiota travel to the brain. Something changes in the gut, which activates the vagal pathway from gut to the specific nucleus in the brain. And, we know that the vagal pathway is involved because it seems at least partially necessary.[2:32:05] Andrew Huberman: If you sever that, you give a vagotomy, then[2:32:07] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[2:32:07] Andrew Huberman: The, This effect is is blunted or eliminated. That's very interesting and and ties, the microbiome to oxytocin vasopressin production In a neural and somewhat causal way, and makes the data on fecal transplants make A lot of more sense. Because I was wondering, okay. So you take a you know, taking the microbiota from 1 animal, putting them into another animal, You're creating you're transferring the milieu of the gut, but it doesn't say anything about mechanism. Right.[2:32:41] Andrew Huberman: So this this is a really cool paper.[2:32:43] Dr. Karen Parker: Meeting. And there's also a study I've always wanted to do is you can get a vagal nerve Stimulator. They used to do them as implants. Right? But you can also get one that you sort of clip onto the ear.[2:32:53] Dr. Karen Parker: And I've always wanted to ask if we we Use this in, in autistic individuals, and, you know, could we increase like, can we alter social behavior? Right? And would that be something that we could actually measure in blood, especially if we're seeing this this change in these blood levels. Right? Are you[2:33:10] Andrew Huberman: doing that experiment?[2:33:11] Dr. Karen Parker: No. But I've always I've Okay. I've always We gotta get cool.[2:33:15] Andrew Huberman: We we we have to get you the funding to do that experiment. And and I know a a few times you've raised the issue of funding. It's not something we spend a lot of time on this, discussing on this podcast, but I think what should be abundantly clear to the listeners, throughout the course of this episode is, as you mentioned earlier, you're very Determined to get work done. You'll figure out a way. Right.[2:33:32] Andrew Huberman: But the way I describe, finances and and research is that it's absolutely necessary, but it's not sufficient. You, of course, have to have the right people and the right lab head directing the work, but no money, no no project. And it and it is disappointing To see that despite the federal budget for research being, you know, still reasonable, it's not what we would like it to be, It's still very hard for amazing world class labs like yours to say, hey. You know, listen. There's this a vagal thing, and clearly there's a rationale.[2:34:04] Andrew Huberman: It's not like you're pulling us out of out of nowhere Yeah. And, you wanna go to this study, but what we're really talking about is 3 to 5 years of writing before you could even initiate that study. Meanwhile, autistic kids are going from age 2 to 5 to 6. These are critical windows. So if ever there was a, there was a rationale for, you know, moving a lot of funding to, you know, I won't even call it high risk, but, You know, logically sound hypothesis testing for the treatment of autism, it's it's now.[2:34:33] Andrew Huberman: So I'm gonna I'm gonna get active on on this front. So I won't get into how, but, you know, when I get something in my, in my neural circuits for for talking, they tend to not shut down for a while.[2:34:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Well, there will be a community that is going to be immensely grateful.[2:34:48] Andrew Huberman: Well, it seems like, the parents of these kids and the kids themselves could greatly benefit. So, you mentioned that the first study on, vasopressin administration that saw these improvements in Social functioning. You said a small cohort. Yeah. How many how many kids was it ultimately that you could use data from?[2:35:03] Dr. Karen Parker: Okay. So we had I mean, you screen a lot. So I think our you know, because we had very rigid criteria. So we ended up with 17 kids that were on active drug and 13 that were on placebo.[2:35:15] Andrew Huberman: And then So not a tiny study?[2:35:16] Dr. Karen Parker: No. And the placebo shall the we we always have, like, a humanitarian open label extension arm, which allows for Anybody who is in placebo can get access to the drugs. So both Antonio and I feel very strongly about making sure that if we're doing a medication trial, everybody can benefit From it. Right? So[2:35:34] Andrew Huberman: Afterwards, if they say, okay. I was in the placebo group, but I really want the chance to try this thing Yes. They can. But then you also get more data.[2:35:40] Dr. Karen Parker: We get right. So I think when the families are now aware that their child is on vasopressin and the clinicians are aware, You know, you really want there's a huge placebo response rate. Right? And so and, I mean, it's not a placebo response right here, but but we really would want To make sure that our evaluation of the social behavior is done unaware to the medication, but you can get good safety data. Right?[2:36:06] Dr. Karen Parker: So So you can have those, you know, 13 children who were on placebo. We can then also make sure that their blood chemistry labs look good, that their electrocardiograms look good. Right? And so that also allows us to assess safety parameters in a greater number of children.[2:36:24] Andrew Huberman: In a fairly broad literature search, I was able to find, okay, microbiome. So fecal transplant Uh-huh. Is something that people are excited about. That's weird.[2:36:32] Dr. Karen Parker: And there are trials in people with autism ongoing.[2:36:35] Andrew Huberman: If you using fecal transplants. Okay. Oxytocin nasal spray, presumably still being investigated by some groups, or it's been abandoned?[2:36:44] Dr. Karen Parker: Well, I think it's mostly been abandoned because there's no funding priorities for it. Right? So So I know that maybe in Australia because of Adam's positive findings that I I don't know what his plans are, but maybe he's doing work there. There might be a little bit of work with behavioral therapy and oxytocin, but this is the problem. When there's 1 big trial that fails, The funding just completely dries up.[2:37:09] Dr. Karen Parker: So even if there's promise, I don't know a single funding agency that's gonna touch it.[2:37:14] Andrew Huberman: Got it. And then there's the vasopressin administration work that you're doing.[2:37:20] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:37:20] Andrew Huberman: I think it's worth contrasting that work with the Fairly large trial that was done by a major pharmaceutical company exploring the role of vasopressin for the treatment of autism. You could tell us What they did, because it's basically the opposite of what you did. Right. And you can tell us the outcome. Because I think that if anything, that study inadvertently provides support for the results that you observed, which is that administering, Let's say increasing vasopressin levels in the brain seems to, ameliorate some of the social deficits[2:37:56] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:37:56] Andrew Huberman: Of autism.[2:37:56] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. So, Roche had a compound called balavaptan, which was a vasopressin v one a receptor which basically means there's, I I think I mentioned there's these 4 neuropeptide receptors. And oxytocinvasopressin bind to each other's receptors, but the v one a receptor is the one that is, most implicated in social behavior. And so they had and this is the Kiki part about when medications are developed in in pharma versus in academics. Right?[2:38:28] Dr. Karen Parker: In academics, there's definitely this Parenty. We write grants. The abstracts are are publicly available. We register our trials. They do too.[2:38:36] Dr. Karen Parker: But a lot of the, shall we say, Early development is all put out in publications. Right? And then it's also peer reviewed, and there's, you know, an open trail of Why we're doing what we're doing, but in a pharmaceutical company, you know, they have the ability because also they have all the funding to be able to do all kinds of development that may never see the of day because of the proprietary basis of it. Right? And so, you know, when you go back to so it's not it's it's still is not clear to me why they took the approach of using an antagonist to the main vasopressin receptor in the brain.[2:39:13] Dr. Karen Parker: What's interesting is if you go back and you look at the animal literature, there are hamsters that if you give them they become aggressive. Right? And if you give male prairie voles vasopressin, they can become aggressive. But let's think about the context that they're doing this in. These hamsters that show aggression are asocial.[2:39:33] Dr. Karen Parker: They live by themselves. If you give them vasopressin and the only Social repertoire they have is to, you know, have sex with a female or to fight a male that they see. They have a very limited social Right? And when the prairie vole male is be is being given vasopressin, it's often in the context of, like, protecting his mate and his offspring, And so then it's actually species appropriate for him to attack a a maraudering male on his territory who's going to, you know, kill his babies. Right?[2:40:03] Dr. Karen Parker: And so So my thinking in reading the preclinical literature, the animal literature, was that, alright, that makes a lot of sense in the context of those species, But we've never seen any evidence in our trial. Aggression didn't change. We also have an aggression measure in this current in the current trial as well. But, you know, for me, The vast majority of evidence from the animal literature suggested that vasopressin was prosocial, and that, you know, especially given our our CSF findings, like, over and over across species, across studies, across ages, that we we should be giving vasopressin, especially given the correlations between vasopressin in CSF and symptom severity and autistic traits, You know, the former in people and the latter in the monkeys. And so they had some preliminary studies that I believe were Maybe single dose, one that they published, but then they had a trial where the primary outcome measure, the social responsiveness scale, was negative, And then they had, some secondary measures that maybe showed some promise, and then they were conducting another trial.[2:41:15] Dr. Karen Parker: And then they did a futility analysis, and I know they stopped the trial. And I don't think it was for safety reasons. But, again, you know, a lot of this isn't made public, right, because it's a pharmaceutical company. So, you know, we we will see because we are going to be completing our larger trial, you know, this year. And, you know, as they say, the proof is in the pudding, so we will See if, you know, we can replicate our initial pilot findings.[2:41:38] Andrew Huberman: Well, sounds like they got it backwards that blocking vasopressin pathways would just make things worse and that augmenting vasopressin makes things better. Although that last statement, needs to be supported by this More extensive Right. Nonpopulation.[2:41:53] Dr. Karen Parker: I think, you know, there's been a lot of speculation, and maybe there are people closer to the trial than me who might be able to speak to mechanism. But, You know, I would meet the Roche people at conferences, and they would come to my talks. And I would always ask them, like, what's the mechanism of action? Why are you antagonizing the system when we're giving, You know, a vasopressin agonist, if you will. And, you know, some people had said, well, maybe by blocking the vasopressin receptor, you know, there's a way to have oxytocin me be more bioavailable.[2:42:21] Andrew Huberman: It sounds like some gymnastics. Yeah.[2:42:23] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah. I totally agree. And so I've never had a I I've never received a compelling response from anybody about why they did their trial and then, You know the differences. I mean, when when this was ongoing and, you know, there was potentially room for both. Right?[2:42:41] Dr. Karen Parker: You know, maybe I thought that maybe there's from some optimal band of vasopressin signaling in the brain. Right? And so maybe there's some people where they have too much vasopressin and some who have too little. Right? And so this was a lot of maybes, but it it doesn't to me seem like that's the case, especially if our current trial has a positive readout.[2:43:00] Andrew Huberman: I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for your stance and, read of the landscape on the data about Vaccines and autism. I'm not talking about COVID vaccines here. I wanna be really clear about that. But there was a theory, running about, not just in the press, but in, the scientific literature for a while that, vaccines could Cause autism. Yeah.[2:43:26] Andrew Huberman: That was proposed. My understanding is that was debunked. That idea Still lives on the Internet, but what is the evidence? Or let let's say let's go through this sequentially. What was the idea?[2:43:43] Andrew Huberman: What was the evidence for that idea, and then what caused the demise of the the at least the scientific support that idea. Leaving open, of course, that new data may come.[2:43:54] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:43:54] Andrew Huberman: But let's talk about what is known now.[2:43:57] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. And I think what I will say is being evidence based is is sort of like something that all scientists should strive for. Right? And so so the the back Story on this is there was a guy named Andrew Wakefield who published a paper, and he basically said the preservatives in vaccines are Pausing autism.[2:44:16] Andrew Huberman: So not the specific vaccine, but the adjuvant, the stuff that's preserving was one of those. Keeping the the vaccines, bio Effective.[2:44:25] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. At least that was my understanding.[2:44:27] Andrew Huberman: Right? That's mine as well.[2:44:28] Dr. Karen Parker: And so and and then it Well,[2:44:30] Andrew Huberman: I wanna be clear because the Internet is a is a is a cruel and, diabolical place. My stance is that that was the hypothesis. I don't agree with that stance. Right. Okay.[2:44:41] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. And so or if we wanna just back up a little bit broader, there was this idea that something about vaccines were causing act onto, autism. But the study was debunked. He lost his medical license, and the paper was retracted. Right?[2:44:55] Andrew Huberman: Well, he lost his medical license on the basis of the fact the study was wrong or was there evidence the data. There were that's why I recall as well, that there was evidence of him literally making up the data.[2:45:06] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:45:07] Andrew Huberman: Right. So it wasn't a case of, like, sloppy technique. It was a case of[2:45:10] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:45:11] Andrew Huberman: Of intentional fraud.[2:45:12] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. That's my understanding again.[2:45:14] Andrew Huberman: What was the does anyone ever, Like, look into what his motivation for what what it was. Like, why someone would I mean, he threw away his whole career.[2:45:22] Dr. Karen Parker: Right. Yeah. I don't I don't know. But but I think the hard part about that is, understandably, people got very frightened, right, that we're doing something to our Children that could have, you know, unanticipated consequences. And, you know, when something like that happens, then we dump stating it.[2:45:43] Dr. Karen Parker: And so the the the good news is at this point, there have been multiple, multiple studies that haven't shown a correlation between, You know, vaccines and autism. I do believe the preservatives have been changed as a result, so that's something we should check, that, you know, that might be something where, You know, there's been a public health change on preservatives that are in vaccines.[2:46:04] Andrew Huberman: That's interesting in its own right. I mean, we don't wanna cause alarm, but that's That's interesting, you know, that that in this data fraud case, it might have cued people to the idea that certain things might have been, needing change even though it wasn't the specific issue that this, this fraudulent researcher was focused on.[2:46:23] Dr. Karen Parker: The change was made to make sure people would vaccinate their their children. Right? Like so this is something I see. That I think we should have lots of caveats here, like, you know, post the post the studies, Like, make sure that what we're saying is accurate. Right?[2:46:35] Andrew Huberman: Of course.[2:46:35] Dr. Karen Parker: But I but I think that my concern is that we've spent you know, so the good news is that, You know, the like, every single study that I'm aware of does not show a relationship between vaccination and autism. Right? And so I think that Most scientists and medical doctors that I know that are part of, like, the, you know, standard biomedical research community do not believe the vaccines autism, they vaccinate their own children. You know? They recommend vaccinations to other people's children, and and so I think that's where we are.[2:47:09] Dr. Karen Parker: You know Could[2:47:10] Andrew Huberman: I just ask a question? And I feel more than obligated to do this because I I don't you know, I think I have a pretty good finger on the pulse of the listenership of this podcast, but I think there's a range of of stances on this, where some people, have a lot of trust in the standard medical establishment. Others have less[2:47:29] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:47:29] Andrew Huberman: Trust in the standard medical establishment, and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't try and represent, all those sides. And, you know, one thing that I've heard, k, is that Over the last 20 or 30 years, there's been a dramatic increase in the number of vaccinations that kids get, and I don't know if that's true. But when we say vaccinations, We could be talking about, you know, measles, mumps, rubella[2:47:53] Dr. Karen Parker: Right.[2:47:54] Andrew Huberman: Polio. We could also be talking about measles, mumps, rubella, Polio, flu shots every year Right. Rabies vaccine, tetanus vaccine. H HPV. H p HPV, right, with one that wasn't Even available when I was in in college, you know, as, everyone in college who was was well aware, there wasn't an HPV vaccine.[2:48:12] Andrew Huberman: Didn't change people's behavior a whole lot, but, You know, there's there's a vaccine, there's multiple vaccines, and then there's, You know, all the vaccines.[2:48:24] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[2:48:24] Andrew Huberman: Right? And I think that one of the concerns that I hear about, is it the idea that, okay, there's some critical vaccines, but then which ones are Perhaps less critical, if any. And these are the kinds of discussions that are starting to surface Yeah. And that, you know, have Parents and potential parents, you know, rightfully thinking about this stuff, and and no one really knows where to get the information. But, like, I'm I I've Tried, and I can't find a pediatrician that says, hey.[2:48:52] Andrew Huberman: Listen. These, but not those. Or you can certainly find Board certified physicians that say men and certain board certified physicians that say none, you actually can find those. The none category tend to hide themselves a little bit more than others for obvious reasons, but it's hard to get a sense of, like, which which vaccines are critical and which ones aren't if you're a parent and you're not versed in this stuff. And so you could imagine that, like, people are you know, kids are taking many more vaccines and only some of those are critical, and maybe all of them Critical.[2:49:23] Dr. Karen Parker: Well, I think I guess the way I would maybe turn it on its head is that, you know, because of this This study that did, in some ways, so much harm. Right? Like, we spent[2:49:34] Andrew Huberman: field study.[2:49:35] Dr. Karen Parker: We spent I I I don't even wanna hazard a guess about how much money worldwide went into studying, you know, the scenes in autism based on a fraudulent data. Right? Like, that's to me a real tragedy.[2:49:49] Andrew Huberman: But at the time, they didn't know it was fraudulent.[2:49:51] Dr. Karen Parker: Right? Exactly.[2:49:51] Andrew Huberman: So so they went after this thinking it was True. Okay.[2:49:55] Dr. Karen Parker: But I think I think the thing the consequence of all this that I think is also extremely sad is that Everybody because everyone got so riled up and so fearful, there has been, Historically, until recently, many researchers who are like, oh, man. I don't wanna touch immunology and autism with a 10 foot pole. Right? And yeah.[2:50:18] Andrew Huberman: You know? And I I wouldn't consider myself fearless, but, like, my lab never had any reason to work on those[2:50:23] Dr. Karen Parker: Yeah.[2:50:24] Andrew Huberman: On those important problems. But I'll tell you, like, yeah, it seems like not a kettle of fish. It's a it's a ball of barbed wire with a bunch of, you know, napalm burning around it. And, you know, when you when you say one thing, Your your career is ending. You say the opposite thing.[2:50:37] Andrew Huberman: Your career is also ending. You know? It's it it's it's a it's a mess.[2:50:42] Dr. Karen Parker: But but I think this highlights that there are so many parents you know, again, and I think we need to listen to parents' stakeholders. Right? Like, you know, there's there needs to be a dialogue Whenever anybody's studying any illness, to to talk to the people who are involved. Right? And and I think that there are parents who will report, wow.[2:51:02] Dr. Karen Parker: Like, there are there is immune system dysregulation in my child. And but because of this historical issue with vaccines, It's only been very recently that I think people, scientists, medical doctors have said, okay. We're hearing a lot about this from parents. And are there a group of individuals who have, you know, immune issues that could be driving their autism? Right?[2:51:28] Dr. Karen Parker: We don't know, and everything should be evidence based. But I think that, like you said, with this cancel culture and all this fear, scientists sometimes will pick topics very judiciously based on, You know, like, hey. I just wanna be left in peace, and I'm trying to help this community. And if there is areas of the enterprise that you think are gonna cause all kinds of grief, then people are gonna be less reluctant to study them even if it's critically needed.[2:51:55] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's a a perfect Place to say thank you. I realize you're not addressing the vaccine autism issue directly, but you're So clearly going after the target, trying to figure out what are the biological mechanisms that are disrupted in autism and, by extension, other Deficits of social function in kids and adults. You've identified this incredible relationship between vasopressin, which should have more prominence, in my opinion, than oxytocin, its lesser cousin. Just kidding. Oxytocin lovers.[2:52:32] Andrew Huberman: But also have shown, you know, yes, in a small study, but you're now extending this to a larger cohort as you mentioned, a causal relationship when vasopressin is administered to these low vasopressin slash low social functioning kids, their symptoms improve. So I know I speak for many people when I say that, I truly appreciate your doggedness in in going after this problem, Especially on the complicated landscape of lack of funding for doing novel and truly high risk work, especially on the backdrop of the Socio political landscape around autism, it's a complicated thing even to discuss. You know, as I mentioned in the introduction, you know, we had to have some fluency around autism, so we sometimes said autistic. Sometimes we said people with autism you know, I mean, it's it's a it's a tough one, but in order to make progress, real progress in this area, We need people like you. We need you, and you're doing it to get in there and just go, okay.[2:53:31] Andrew Huberman: You know, let's get at the biological functions. Let's get at the novel treatments, And you're making amazing progress, so I'm so grateful that you're doing it and that you'll continue to do it and that you came here today, to teach us what you've been up to, I'm oh, so grateful, and I just wanna say thank you for that and that we absolutely have to get you back here, to give us an update on your progress really soon and and again and again and again.[2:53:56] Dr. Karen Parker: Thank you so much.
