I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Layne Norton. Doctor Norton is one of the foremost experts in protein metabolism, fat loss, and nutrition. He did his degrees in biochemistry and nutritional sciences and is considered one of the world experts in understanding how we extract energy from our food and how exercise and what we eat combine to impact things like body composition and overall health.[0:00:38] Andrew Huberman: Today, we discuss an enormous number of topics under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness, including, for instance, what is energy balance? That is, how do we actually extract energy from our food? We also discussed The somewhat controversial topic of artificial sweeteners, whether or not they are safe or not, and whether or not they are an effective tool for weight loss, in particular for people suffering from obesity and different types of diabetes. We also talk about gut health. That is the gut microbiome and how it's impacted by food and how it can actually impact some of the foods that we eat.[0:01:10] Andrew Huberman: We also discussed fasting or so called intermittent fasting or time restricted feeding, what it does and what it does not do in terms of How effective it is for weight loss and perhaps even for health and longevity. We also talk about protein and define very clearly how much protein each and all of us need Depending on our daily activities and life demands, we discuss the various types of diets that you've probably heard about, including ketogenic diets, Vegan diets, vegetarian diets, and pure carnivore diets, as well as more typical omnivore diets, and how to make sure that you get all of the essential amino acids that are critical for healthy weight maintenance, weight loss, or directed muscle gain. We also talk about supplements. In particular, The supplements for which there is an immense amount of science pointing to their safety and efficacy for fitness and for overall body composition. What I'm sure will become clear to you as you hear Layne talk about each and every one of these topics is that he has an incredible ability to both understand the mechanistic science, But also the real world applications of the various discoveries that are made in particular papers and in particular, in the randomized controlled trials.[0:02:18] Andrew Huberman: That is When a given scientific hypothesis has been raised, he's extremely good at understanding why it was raised, but also At evaluating whether or not it works in the real world, which is what I believe most everybody out there is concerned with. I think this is one of the things that really distinguishes from the other voices in the nutritional landscape. I assure you that by the end of today's discussion, you will have a much clearer understanding About what the science says about nutrition, about fitness, and about how different diets and fitness programs combine to achieve the results that you want. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.[0:03:06] Andrew Huberman: In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink With everything you need and nothing that you don't, that means it contains sodium, potassium, and magnesium, the so called electrolytes, but no sugar. As you may have heard me discuss before on this podcast, every cell in our body, and in particular cells within our brain, the so called neurons or nerve cells, Critically rely on the presence of electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium in order to function properly. I, myself, am a big believer in consuming electrolytes anytime I've been sweating a lot, so that could be after or during exercise or after doing the sauna.[0:03:45] Andrew Huberman: So by drinking electrolytes in the form of LMNT electrolyte mix, I'm able to replenish those electrolytes and maintain mental clarity and energy throughout the day. LMNT contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of a 1000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element spelled l m n t.com/huberman to get a free sample pack with your purchase. Again, That's drinklmnt.com/huberman to get the free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA.[0:04:19] Andrew Huberman: ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses We're designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see clearly, for instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back again, whether or not you're looking at something up close or off Into the distance. ROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and cycling, and indeed, they are very lightweight.[0:04:59] Andrew Huberman: Most of the time, I can't even remember that they're on my face. So lightweight. But the important thing to know about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that while they can be used during sports activities, They also have a terrific aesthetic, and they can be used just as well for wearing to work or out to dinner, etcetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to ROKA.com, and enter the code huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's ROKA, r o k a.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout.[0:05:29] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition program They analyze the data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. Now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. One of the major issues with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about levels of hormones, levels Lipids, levels of metabolic factors, but you don't know what to do about that information. With InsideTracker, they have a easy to use platform that allows you to assess those levels and then determine What sorts of behavioral changes, nutritional changes, maybe even supplementation changes you might wanna make in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you?[0:06:18] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. To find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, You can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, live momentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly Banding.[0:06:44] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with doctor Layne Norton. Layne, Doctor Norton, thank you so much for being here. This is a long time coming, and I have to say I'm really excited because I've seen you in the Social media sphere, I've also listened to a number of your other podcasts. And as a fellow PhD scientist, I feel a great kinship with you.[0:07:06] Andrew Huberman: I know you have Tremendous experience in in fitness and nutrition in a number of areas. We also got a lot of questions from our audience, and I'm really looking forward to talking with you today. Yeah.[0:07:17] Dr. Layne Norton: I'm excited too. I mean, this like you said, it's been something we've been talking about for a long time, so I was glad we're able to make it happen.[0:07:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Indeed. And, I think some of the audience has requested a debate or a battle, and I can tell you right now, it's not gonna happen. Actually, one of the things that, brought Lane and I together, in conversation online and then via text, etcetera, was the fact that I love to be corrected. And that's what happened.[0:07:44] Andrew Huberman: I may I did a post about artificial sweeteners, which we will talk about a little bit later in the episode, and Lane pointed out some areas of the study that I had missed, or maybe even misunderstood. And I revised my opinions, and I think it's wonderful. And other studies have come out since then, so, hopefully, our conversation will serve as a As a message of how, science and actionable science can, can be perceived and and and That it doesn't always have to be a battle, but, hey. If we get into it, we get into it. It won't get physical because we know you would win.[0:08:18] Andrew Huberman: So, in any case, I'd like to start, with something that's rather basic and yet, can be pretty complex, and that's this issue of energy balance and energy utilization. I think most people have heard of a calorie. Yeah. I I'm assuming that most people don't actually know what that is in terms of, how it works Go ahead. Yeah.[0:08:39] Andrew Huberman: What it represents. And so maybe you could just explain for people what happens when we eat food of any kind, And how is that actually converted into energy as a way of framing up the discussion around weight loss, weight maintenance, weight gain, and body composition?[0:08:57] Dr. Layne Norton: It's a great question, and like you said, this is one of those things where, you know, people use the term calories in, calories out, and they say, well, that's way too simplistic. And I'm like, If you look at what actually makes up calories in calories out, it's actually very complicated. Right? So let's deal with the, what you mentioned first, what is a calorie? Because I think a lot of people don't quite understand this.[0:09:21] Dr. Layne Norton: So a calorie just refers To a unit of energy, of heat specifically. And so what does that have to do with food? What does that have to do with, like, what we digest and eat? Really, what you're talking about is the potential chemical energy that is in the bonds of the macronutrients of food. Right?[0:09:41] Dr. Layne Norton: And by digesting, assimilating, and metabolizing those nutrients, we are able to create energy. And The end product of that mostly is ATP, Adenosine Triphosphate, which is your body's, energy currency. So to understand ATP, just try to think about if you're trying to power these various reactions in your body, and we're talking about tens of thousands of enzymes that require ATP. You know, it doesn't make sense that you would have to create a bunch of micro Explosions. Right?[0:10:19] Dr. Layne Norton: You want something that can transfer high energy phosphates to power these reactions to Actions to give up, essentially, its energy to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable. So a lot of metabolism is simply creating ATP, which The end of the line of that, I'm gonna get that kinda work backwards, is what's called oxidative respiration. So that happens in the mitochondria. Everybody's heard mitochondria powerhouse of the cell, and that is done, through Essentially, creating a hydrogen ion gradient across the mitochondria which powers the production of ATP by converting free phosphate Plus ADP to ATP. Now the way that hydrogen ion gradient is created is through, you know, creating Hydrogen ions can be donated through the Krebs cycle.[0:11:14] Dr. Layne Norton: Now the Krebs cycle is linked to glycolysis. So if we talk about carbohydrate metabolism, Carbohydrates, basically, other than fructose, get converted into glucose, which can go into glycolysis, and you can produce some ATPs through glycolysis. And then it boils down to pyruvate, then Acetyl CoA, which goes to the Krebs cycle, produces a lot more ATPs from that. If you talk about protein, protein's a little bit different Because protein, gets converted to amino acids, which can be used for muscle protein synthesis or protein synthesis in other tissues, but it also can be converted through gluconeogenesis to glucose, and there also are some ketogenic amino acids as well. And so you can Have a few different ways to get to the Krebs cycle, either being through, acetyl co a or through glucose going through the glycolysis to pyruvate.[0:12:11] Dr. Layne Norton: Then you have fatty acids, which, are able to create energy Through what's called beta oxidation, where, essentially, you're taking these fatty acids and you're lopping them off 2 carbons at a time to produce Acetyl CoA, which again can go into the Krebs cycle, Produce those hydrodions that can then power the production of ATP. So that's kind of, like, at the cellular level of how this stuff works. But Stepping back and taking it back out, like, what does that have to do with weight loss or weight gain? Right? Well, When you think about the balance of energy in versus energy out, sounds very simple.[0:12:48] Dr. Layne Norton: But let's look at what actually makes up energy in versus energy out. First of all, you've got to realize that the energy inside of the equation is more difficult to track than people think. Right? So one, food labels, which we like to think is being, you know, like, from upon high, can have up to a 20% error in them.[0:13:10] Andrew Huberman: Really? Oh, yeah. So a 100 calorie is something listed as a 100 calories per serving. It could what's actually in there could be 80 or a 120.[0:13:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. Exactly. Oh. So that's one aspect of it. The second aspect is there's what's called your energy, but then there's also metabolizable energy.[0:13:27] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So if you have, food stuff with, say, a lot of insoluble fiber, typically, insoluble fiber, it's not really digestible, and so you could have, you know, quite a bit of carbohydrate. You know? But if you can't extract The energy from it and typically, this is because insoluble fiber from, like, plant material. The carbohydrate or and even some of the protein is bound up in the, plant structure, which makes it inaccessible to digestive enzymes.[0:13:55] Dr. Layne Norton: So this is what, like, adds bulk to your school stool and whatnot. But, again, reduces the metabolizable energy in there, and there's some evidence that Based on people's individual gut microbiome that some people may actually be better at extracting energy out of fiber compared to other people. So just starting off right there, okay, there's there's quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things. Now one of the things people will say is, well, see, that's why you shouldn't worry about tracking calories because, you know, if the food labels can be 20% off. And what I'll say is, Okay.[0:14:32] Dr. Layne Norton: That's a that's I understand where you're coming from. But, typically, if it's off, it's gonna be consistently off. And if you're consistent with how you track it, Eventually, you'll be able to know kind of what you're taking in. And it's kinda that's kinda like saying, well, don't worry about Tracking, you know, if you're I I like to use financial, examples. You know, we know that to save money Or you have to earn more money than you spend.[0:14:58] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, you can't exactly know how much money you're earning at a time, you know, because there's inflation, and then there's, if you have investments, those can be, you know, different interest rates and whatnot. It's like, okay. But you're you know, if you have a budget, you have a a reasonable idea of what it's gonna be, know? And you make you make certain assumptions, but you can relatively guess.[0:15:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's a good example.[0:15:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. So now let's look at the energy outside of the equation, which is actually way more complicated. Percent. And that for most people is anywhere from 50 to 70% of your total daily energy expenditure. Now people use the term metabolic rate And energy expenditure kind of interchangeably, but they're not the same thing.[0:15:47] Dr. Layne Norton: So your total daily energy expenditure is the summation of all the energy you expend In a day.[0:15:53] Andrew Huberman: Walking upstairs, exercise if you do it. Fidgeting. Right. Yeah. Plus you're resting metabolic rate.[0:15:59] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. Resting metabolic rate is a big part of that, but it's not the only thing. So that's usually about 50 to 70%, and Sedentary people will be on the higher end of that, so it'll be a bigger proportion, whereas people who are more active, it'll be a little bit lower not because their metabolic rate is lower, but because they're expending a greater percentage of the calories from physical activity. Then you have something called the thermic effect of food, which is a relatively small percentage of your Total daily energy expenditure, it's about 5 to 10%, and very difficult to measure. And usually, what researchers do when they're Kind of looking at this stuff is they just kinda make an assumption about it.[0:16:35] Dr. Layne Norton: They use a constant. But that's about 5 to 10% of your daily energy expenditure, and that refers to The amount of energy it takes to extract the energy out of food. So think about your body kinda like a car. Right. You don't just have gas in your tank and it spontaneously starts up.[0:16:52] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? Like, you have to have a battery, so you put in energy so you can get the energy out of the the petrol that you have in your car. Similar with with food, you can't just eat food and then, you know, it just appears in your cells and you start doing stuff. It has to be systematically broken down and put into forms that can actually produce energy. And so you have to put some energy in To achieve that and a lot of times people will say something like, well, not all calories are created equal.[0:17:22] Dr. Layne Norton: That's not true because calories just a unit of measurement. Right? That would be like saying not all seconds on a clock are created equal. Yes. They are.[0:17:30] Dr. Layne Norton: All sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expenditure and appetite. So if we look at something like, Fat, for example. The t e f of fat is about 0 to 3%. Meaning, if you eat a 100 calories from fat, your net will be about 97 to a100.[0:17:47] Andrew Huberman: The process of breaking down that fat essentially subtracts some of the the calories away because you used it in creating energy[0:17:55] Dr. Layne Norton: Correct.[0:17:56] Andrew Huberman: By breaking those chemical bonds, you create ATP.[0:17:58] Dr. Layne Norton: Correct.[0:17:58] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:17:59] Dr. Layne Norton: Correct. So you have, like, for example, some enzymes that require ATP to run these processes. Now fat is actually the easiest to convert into energy. Then you have carbohydrate, which has a TF of, like, 5 to 10%. So you eat a 100 calories from carbohydrate.[0:18:12] Dr. Layne Norton: And obviously, like, fiber content makes a big difference on this. But if you eat a 100 calories, you'll net 90 to 95. Protein It's about a 20 to 30% TEF. So if you eat a 100 calories from protein, you're only netting 70 to 80. Now you're still net.[0:18:28] Dr. Layne Norton: Know, people say, well, you can't eat too much protein. Well, you know, people ask, well, can protein be stored as fat? The carbons from protein, it's unlikely it's gonna wind up in adipose tissue. But if you're eating a lot of protein overall as part of a lot of calories, it does it has to be oxidized, I said it can't provide a calorie cushion for other things to be stored in fat. But protein itself does provide, know, a net positive for calories, but less so than carbohydrate or fat and tend to be more satiating.[0:18:56] Dr. Layne Norton: So, again, when people talk about, you know, Are all the calories created equal? Yes. But all sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expenditure and appetite. So that's the TEF bucket and the BMR bucket. Then we go to physical activity, and physical activity is essentially 2 parts.[0:19:11] Dr. Layne Norton: There's exercise, which is kind of your purposeful movements, like you offer a walk, You do a training session. I mean, whatever. Any purposeful activity. And then you have what's called NEAT, which is non exercise activity thermogenesis, Which I think is actually really cool.[0:19:29] Andrew Huberman: It's fascinating.[0:19:30] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. It is. So it's I was actually hanging out with somebody last night, and I was noticing them. They they were fidgeting their feet and their their fingers. And I said, you know, have you always, like, been pretty lean?[0:19:42] Dr. Layne Norton: And they're like, yeah. I never really had a problem maintaining leanness. And when you look at the obese resistant phenotype, people think they have high BMR Or, you know, they exercise a lot, and really what it it seems to be is neat. They tend to if they overeat, They just spontaneously increase their physical activity. Now people get neat confused.[0:20:05] Dr. Layne Norton: I've heard people say, well, I'm gonna go out for a walk to get my neat up. That's not neat. Need is not something you can consciously modify. What you're doing there, if it's purposeful, it's exercise. So for example, if I when I'm talking, if I'm waving around my hands, if I'm tapping my feet, if I'm whatever, that's neat.[0:20:24] Dr. Layne Norton: But, you know, trying to, like, get yourself well, I'm just gonna tap my foot more. Well, now if I'm consciously having to do this, then my focus I mean, You you know how the brain works. Very hard to do you know, you don't really do 2 things at once. Right. You kinda switch quickly between tasks.[0:20:38] Andrew Huberman: Right? Can I quickly ask, was the person that you're referring to our friend, Ben Bruno?[0:20:44] Dr. Layne Norton: No. No. Because he is Fidgety Tootles.[0:20:46] Andrew Huberman: Amazing online fitness channel. He's a freakishly Strong individual. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And, I can't remember whether or not, Ben, you're a fidgeter or not, but, anyway, I'll have to go go check, and we'll measure your fidgeting.[0:20:59] Andrew Huberman: About, non exercise induced thermogenesis, NEAT. My understanding of the old papers on this, old being, I guess, back to the The mid nineties is that the calorie burn from NEAT is actually pretty significant. We're not talking about a 100 calories or 200 calories per day. We're talking about, in some cases, hundreds of 1,000 excuse me. Hundreds to maybe even close to a 1000 calories per day.[0:21:22] Andrew Huberman: Could you elaborate on that?[0:21:23] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So there was actually a really classic study, I think, from I wanna say it's from Levine in 1995. It was metabolic ward study. And, hopefully, I don't butcher the study because I'm trying to, you know, pull it out of my brain.[0:21:38] Andrew Huberman: I don't expect you to have PubMed in your head. Although I must say you have a A quite extensive, PubMed ID, grab bag in there. So I[0:21:47] Dr. Layne Norton: try to bring the receipts. Yeah. I try to bring the receipts.[0:21:49] Andrew Huberman: We can put, will put a link to the study in the show note captions so, people can peruse it if they like. Yeah.[0:21:55] Dr. Layne Norton: So I I believe they had people overeat, and I I think it was like a 1000 calories a day, and I think for 6 weeks. And, I mean, this is the metabolic ward, so they are this is very tightly controlled. It's as tight as you get. And what was interesting is, of course, on average, people gained weight and gained fat mass, but some people gained more than expected. And there was 1 person in particular who only gained, like, just over half a kilo.[0:22:21] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? They should have gained, like I think it was something like 3 to 4 kilos. It was was predicted. And what they found is this individual just spontaneously increased Their physical activity. Like, he didn't purposely do it.[0:22:34] Dr. Layne Norton: It it just happened. And, I mean, you know, anecdotally, I've seen people who are, again, you know, very lean, even eat a meal, sit down, and start sweating, you know, And be very fidgety. There was a a natural bodybuilder back in the day named Jim Cordova, and this guy was just very lean all the time, And he was exactly that phenotype. You know? He would walk up a flight of stairs, and all of a sudden, he's sweating.[0:23:01] Dr. Layne Norton: Sit down. Eat a meal. He's sweating. You know? He just He's a furnace.[0:23:04] Dr. Layne Norton: Just expending energy.[0:23:05] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:23:07] Dr. Layne Norton: And what's very interesting about NEAT is that seems to be the most modifiable. I mean, exercise is very modifiable because you can be intentional with that. But of, you know, BMR, TEF, and NEAT, NEAT seems to be far more modifiable. So even a body weight reduction of 10%, They've observed a decrease in NEAT of almost 500 calories a day for for a 10% reduction in body weight. Now you also do get a decline in BMR when you lose weight.[0:23:40] Dr. Layne Norton: 1, because you're just in a smaller body now, and so it takes less energy to, locomote. But also there's what's called metabolic adaptation, which is a further reduction in your BMR than from the loss of body mass, and that's on average usually around, like, 15%. But it does seem to be There's new evidence coming out on the metabolic adaptation from BMR, and it seems to be a little bit, kind of in the transition phases. So if you If you start a diet, within the 1st few weeks, you will have a reduction in BMR that then kind of just Thereafter, any further reduction is mostly from the amount of body mass you lose. And then if you, Like, for example, finish a diet and move your calories to maintenance, within a few weeks, BMR kind of starts to come back up.[0:24:35] Dr. Layne Norton: There is still a small reduction, But I used to be somebody who thought the BMR, you know, the metabolic adaptation was a big reason why People stopped losing weight or plateaued, and now I think it's much more to do with meat. Interesting.[0:24:49] Andrew Huberman: And you said that it can't be conscious Because of that, it will distract us from other activities. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at the this study, and I'll send it to you. Maybe it'd be fun to do a kind of an online journal club about this at some point soon. But there's a study out of University of Houston recently, having people do now this is a long period of time. 4 hours a day of basically a soleus Push up, which is basically a heel raise, kind of a seated calf raise with 1 foot not weighted.[0:25:14] Andrew Huberman: And then they looked at a bunch of things about glucose metabolism and Glucose clearance and insulin levels, and they didn't conclude that people burned a ton of calories, but what they concluded was that, blood sugar regulation improved Greatly. And I think, you know, there was a lot of excitement about this, at some level, but based on everything you're telling me, this it fits Perfectly with what's known about NEAT. So this sort of fell somewhere in between with, in between, excuse me, sort of deliberate exercise Yeah. And spontaneous movement. I guess they've tried to make that spontaneous movement a little bit more conscious.[0:25:49] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, what I'll tell people is if if you're worried about need, one thing you can do, Like these watches, for example, people like, oh, well, told me I burned this many calories. The they are not accurate for energy expenditure. I mean, it is like there was a meta analysis in 2018, I wanna say, between A 28 93% overestimation of energy expenditure by these watches.[0:26:15] Andrew Huberman: Fitness tracker. So for those of you listening, we're not gonna name the brand, but, Fitness trackers, so wrist worn fitness tracker.[0:26:21] Dr. Layne Norton: And this and this is across the board. Okay. So, like, depending on the brand, it could be, you know, more or less, but they all overestimated the amount of x The calories you burn from exercise. So this is actually a great example where people go, well, calories in, calories out doesn't work for me because I ate in a calorie deficit, and I didn't lose weight. And when I talk to them, usually, it's they went to an online calculator.[0:26:41] Dr. Layne Norton: It's 1 it's a few things. They went to an online calculator, Put in their information. It's spat it spat out some calories to eat, and they ate that and didn't lose weight. And it's like, well, what do you think is more likely? That you're defying the laws of, You know, conservation of energy or that you're you might have not gotten[0:26:57] Andrew Huberman: the right number for you. The rule the measurement tool was off.[0:27:00] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep. Yeah. The next thing is a lot of people weigh very sporadically, and I'll tell people, like, if you're gonna make an intentional weight loss a goal, And, again, this can be different for different people, but, typically, I tell people, weigh in first thing in the morning or I have to go to the bathroom, Do it every day and take the average of that for the week, and then compare that to the next week's average.[0:27:22] Andrew Huberman: Could I ask 1 quick sorry to interrupt, but one quick question about that. When you say go to the bathroom, not to get, too detailed, here for unnecessarily, but are you talking about urination and, emptying your bowels? Ideally. Because you get a big meal Night before.[0:27:36] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah.[0:27:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Got it. Yeah. So wake up, use the bathroom, in all all forms that Are you ready? And then and then get on the scale, take that measurement, average that across the week, and then maybe every Monday, you take that value[0:27:51] Dr. Layne Norton: and team progress. And the reason I I recommend doing that is if you're just kinda sporadically weighing in, as somebody who weighs themselves Pretty pretty regularly. I mean, my weight will fluctuate, you know, 5, 6 pounds and not seemingly changing much. You know? And that's just you know, those short term changes are fluid.[0:28:10] Dr. Layne Norton: So I'm I've had it before where week to week, my average didn't change. But Between the lowest weigh in from a previous week and the highest weigh in might have been, like, £8. Right? So if you're somebody Who just randomly is weighing in and you're eating in a calorie deficit and you just weigh in one day where you've just whatever reason holding some more fluid, Then you oh, see this isn't working. When in reality, your average might be dropping.[0:28:38] Dr. Layne Norton: So that's one of the reasons. And, actually, believe it or not, weight fluctuations are actually identified as a major reason why people get discouraged from weight loss, that it it kinda stops the buy in Mhmm. You know, when have a fluctuation up. So that's one of the reasons early one of the reasons early on that low carb diets tend to work really well is because people lose a lot of water weight really quickly, And they get that buy in. Right?[0:29:00] Dr. Layne Norton: So all of this is working.[0:29:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We can return to that in a little bit because I have theories as to how that, you know, when people eat less carbohydrate, they excrete more water, and they'll see you know, for the first time, they'll see some definition in their abs.[0:29:12] Dr. Layne Norton: And, oh[0:29:12] Andrew Huberman: my god. This diet's amazing. Yep. And the fluid loss does hold that promise. I think fluid loss can do some other things that might people liter make people literally feel lighter, although it can do we have some negative effects.[0:29:23] Andrew Huberman: I do have 1 quick question, and and, I do want we'll return to Neet in a moment. But when you say the caloric burn as a consequence of exercise Mhmm. I want to ask about The caloric burn during that exercise. So for instance, somebody's on the treadmill, and they'll see, okay. They burn, you know, 400 calories.[0:29:39] Andrew Huberman: Actually, I think this is a month where a number of prominent podcasters like, Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Joe Rogan, others. I think they call it sober October, but in addition to avoiding alcohol, they they're burning 500 calories per day during the exercise. They're they're measuring it. A lot of people do this. They think they take track of whether excuse me, take stock of how many calories they burned.[0:29:59] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that if that particular form of exercise is a muscle building form of exercise that at some point later, there might be an increase In muscle, if you did it everything right, do everything right, and then you will burn more energy as a consequence of adding that tissue. That's a long process as as you know, and we will discuss. But I have heard about this post exercise induced increase in oxidative metabolism. I'm probably not using the right, languaging here. Fuck.[0:30:27] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So if[0:30:27] Andrew Huberman: I were to go out, instance, in sprint, do some sprints. Run hard for a minute, jog for a minute, run hard for a minute, and do that 10 times over. The let's assume I burn 400 calories during that, exercise, bout. But my understanding is that In the hours that follow, my basal metabolic rate will have increased. Is that true, and is it significant enough to care about?[0:30:50] Dr. Layne Norton: So answer both those questions. Yes. There does seem to be a small increase, in metabolic rate, And, no, it does not appear to be enough to actually make a difference. So when they look at and, again, this is where, I tell people I think I have a good perspective on this because I my undergraduate degree was a biochemistry degree, so I was very into mechanisms. You know what I mean?[0:31:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Was like, oh, if we just do this and this, we'll get this. Right? And then I did nutrition as a graduate degree, and then my adviser was so great Because he you could do something over here, and he could tell you how it would affect vitamin d metabolism over here.[0:31:26] Andrew Huberman: This is Don Layman.[0:31:27] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. Don Layman. So he, you know, he would always kinda Say yeah. But what's the outcome gonna be? Right?[0:31:34] Dr. Layne Norton: So this is actually one of the things I changed my mind on was I used to be very much well, I think, you know, high intensity interval Interval training is probably better because you get this post exercise energy burn, which they do see in some of these studies. But in the kind of meta analyses and, Like more tightly controlled studies where they equate work between high intensity intervals and moderate or low intensity, cardio, so equating work, they don't see differences in the loss of body fat. And so to me, if I'm looking at that's the example of A mechanism which is okay. We're seeing this small increase in basal metabolic rate that should lead To increase loss of body fat. But again, remember, you're capturing a a snapshot in time.[0:32:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? But we don't see a difference in the loss of body fat. So what may be happening and again, I'm just speculating, but a way to explain it could be, you might have an increase and then you might actually have a decrease That tends to just kinda wash it out. Right?[0:32:33] Andrew Huberman: And I have to imagine some forms of exercise, this would be highly individual, but, will spike appetite more than others. So for instance, if I go out for a 45 minute jog or which I do, a 45 to 60 minute hiker jog Once a week, I just make it a point to do that or rock or something like that. Throw on a weight vest and hike. After that, I find I I'm very thirsty. I want to hydrate, but I'm not that hungry.[0:32:56] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And that's true of most all cardiovascular exercise for me. But After I weight train, about 60 to 90 minutes later, I wanna eat the refrigerator. And so, obviously, Calories in, calories out dictates that that will play an important role as to whether or not I gain or lose weight, etcetera. So is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise that People choose, needs to be taken in consideration of calories in, calories out, so how much is burned during the exercise, Also, how much that exercise tends to stimulate appetite.[0:33:30] Andrew Huberman: I don't know whether or not people explore this in in the rigorous studies.[0:33:33] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep.[0:33:34] Andrew Huberman: And Whether or not that form of exercise actually increases lean muscle mass or not. So, now we've taken exercise and Split it into a number of different dimensions, but this is what, you are so masterful at is really parsing how the different components work individually and together. So if if you would just, you know, expand on that. I I'd love to know what you're thinking.[0:33:55] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So this is actually really fascinating thing. So first thing, I wanna I wanna just go back to talking about, like, for example, Bert and Tom and and Joe, we're gonna do 500 calories a day on whatever. So those apparatuses don't measure those things effectively either, right, just like these watches. But well, the one thing I will say is if you are like, for example, if I do 2 hours of resistance training, typically, this will say I burned about a 1000 calories.[0:34:21] Dr. Layne Norton: Right.[0:34:21] Andrew Huberman: That's a lot of resistance training. Right. My were my weight workouts are, like, are warm up for 10 minutes and then 1 hour of work done.[0:34:28] Dr. Layne Norton: I I just I love to train. Okay. It's And you and[0:34:30] Andrew Huberman: you can My recovery quotient is pretty low. Mhmm. So I've been training for 30 plus years, and I found that if I do more than an hour of hard work In the gym, meaning resistance training. 75 minutes, maybe I'm okay, but past that, I have to take 2, maybe even 3 days off before I can train. My nervous system just doesn't tolerate it well.[0:34:52] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. So I I limit it to an hour.[0:34:54] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. You know? But And and part of that to remember is, like, I've kinda built up to that over a long period of time. Right? You know?[0:34:59] Dr. Layne Norton: So you couldn't just throw somebody in and start having them do 2 hours a day. It's not gonna go well for them.[0:35:04] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, Is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day Is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:35:31] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that All of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/ Huberman, and they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year supply A vitamin d three k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:36:18] Dr. Layne Norton: What I will say about the calorie trackers is so if I'm used to okay. Usually burn about a 1000 calories according to this, it's not accurate. But If I go in tomorrow and I do 1300, it may not be accurate. I don't know what the exact number is, but I can be relatively confident that it's more than the previous session. Right?[0:36:38] Dr. Layne Norton: And so in terms of comparison, it might be okay, like, you know, kinda within subject. And then the other thing I was kinda circling around on was, If you're worried about NEAT, tracking your steps can be helpful because people's step counts can spontaneously decrease when they're on a fat loss diet. They don't even realize it. So, and and that, again, not a complete measure of need, but what we've had some clients do, with our team bioin coaches is They'll say, okay. You're at 8,000 steps right now.[0:37:06] Dr. Layne Norton: We're not gonna add any purposeful cardio, but whatever You need to do to maintain that 8,000 steps. Do that. And sometimes they have to add, you know, 15, 20, 30 minutes of cardio Because their spontaneous activity that they're not even aware of goes down.[0:37:21] Andrew Huberman: That's a really excellent point. I I've I've heard, you know, the 10,000 steps per day Number was, we all heard that. And then I learned that 10,000 was just kinda thrown out as an arbitrary number. So we're like an 8 hour intermittent fasting thing. There's a story behind that.[0:37:36] Andrew Huberman: So I actually, spoke to Sachin, and it turns out that the graduate student in his lab that did that initial study, which was on mice, by the way, was limited to Being in lab for about 8 hours by their significant other, so the 8 hour feeding window is actually the consequence of this person's relationship. That is[0:37:53] Dr. Layne Norton: a that is a really great point that people don't realize when they a lot of people will try to copy, like, scientific studies. And I'll I'll tell people, like, listen. Scientific studies are so confined, you you need to be very careful with how broadly you apply what's in there. Right? Like, they're they're a very big hammer is kind of the way I look at it.[0:38:14] Dr. Layne Norton: Okay? They're not a scalpel. They're a big hammer. And I think a lot of times in terms of coaching, scientific studies will tell you what not to do rather than what to do. Right?[0:38:24] Dr. Layne Norton: But getting back to your question about, like, exercise appetite. So first off, I'm not really aware if there's, evidence showing, like, differential effects of different forms of exercise on appetite. It's possible. But, again, it also could be like a placebo effect. Right?[0:38:41] Dr. Layne Norton: Because we like, for example, you and I Grew up in an era where the muscle magazines, it was like, well, as soon as you finish your workout, you're gonna have your biggest meal of the day. Right? And, You know, when I say placebo effect, I think people have the wrong idea of what the placebo effect is. They think that's just a feeling. Placebo effect can actually change your physiology.[0:39:02] Dr. Layne Norton: People don't people don't realize this. There's research showing that a placebo or the power of suggestion is basically As powerful as some pharmaceuticals. And one of the the great examples I like to use is actually, there was a study we just covered in our research review on creatine Where they did, 4 groups, not supplement with creatine, told they weren't supplemented with creatine, Not supplemented, told they were supplemented. Supplemented, told they weren't. Supplemented, told they were.[0:39:32] Dr. Layne Norton: Basically, it just matters what they told them.[0:39:34] Andrew Huberman: Really? Oh, yeah. This is incredible. I have to get this study. Well, it so we can link to it.[0:39:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Colleague of mine at at Stanford, she's been on the podcast. I'd love to introduce you to you because I think you guys, we could, Really riff. First of all, she was a former d one athlete[0:39:47] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[0:39:47] Andrew Huberman: And then is a runs a lab at Stanford in psychology. This is, Leah Crum, And she's and grew up, in this you know, very athletic, obviously, and very, very smart. And her laboratory focuses on these belief slash placebo effects, Where if you tell people all the horrible things that stress do to you in terms of your memory and cognitive functioning, and then give them a memory test, they they perform well below baseline. If you tell them that stress sharpens them in the short term and that adrenaline is this powerful molecule that can, really tune up a number of memory systems, memory improves. And it it's remarkable Yeah.[0:40:22] Andrew Huberman: And it's consistent. And, and this and they've done this for any number of different things, including food allergies, for instance. You know, incredible results. In any case, I I'm I'm so glad you're bringing this up. I take creatine monohydrate, and have for years 5 grams a day.[0:40:38] Andrew Huberman: I don't[0:40:38] Dr. Layne Norton: That's great.[0:40:39] Andrew Huberman: And, and it's great, and I believe it's great. So so Is there a compound effect of believing it's great and it actually,[0:40:47] Dr. Layne Norton: being great? Not in this study, but so I think the thing to point out, people will misinterpret That as creatine doesn't work. And that's not what that says. What it says is your beliefs about what it does are probably just as powerful as what it does. Right?[0:41:02] Dr. Layne Norton: So, they actually did a study, and I don't have the citation, but it was, I think, within the last 10 years where they told people they were putting them on anabolic steroids. And wouldn't you know it, they had better gains. Even though they weren't actually on anabolic steroids, they had better gains than people that they didn't tell were anabolic steroids. And that's, like, Hard outcome, strength, lean body mass, you know, those sorts of things. So when people say, well, I wouldn't fall for the placebo effect.[0:41:26] Dr. Layne Norton: It's like, You don't have to fall for it if if you believe it to be true. The power of belief is very, Very powerful. And as a scientist, I wish sometimes I was ignorant so that I could subject myself to the placebo effect more often.[0:41:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Absolutely.[0:41:43] Dr. Layne Norton: So kinda getting back to that's just a possible explanation of maybe why, you know and I'm the same way. Like, I get done with a a workout or like a resistance training session. I'm like, I'm ready to Right. Now if you look at the literature overall on exercise and appetite, it's not always what you'd expect. Consistently, it seems to show that exercise actually has an appetite suppressant effect.[0:42:07] Dr. Layne Norton: So, people don't tend to compensate at least fully for the amount of movement they do. And there is some evidence that you've probably heard people say, well, exercise is a really poor weight loss tool. Right. Like it like, if you figure out how many calories you should be burning from it and you do that, you end up getting less weight loss than you Then you would predict.[0:42:30] Andrew Huberman: I have a family member who is perfectly happy to eat less, but doesn't loathe exercise Uh-huh. But dislikes exercise. Yeah. And they and they're of healthy weight. Mhmm.[0:42:40] Andrew Huberman: But I'm always encouraging them to exercise more, and so this is an ongoing battle in our in our sibling relationship.[0:42:46] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, one thing I would say is that exercise independent of anything that happens with your body weight, you will be healthier. So exercise is one of the only things that will actually Everybody out there looking for a hack to be healthier, exercise is the hack. Right?[0:43:09] Andrew Huberman: Point. And our, mutual friend, doctor Peter Attia, I think has gone on record several times now saying that of all the things that one could take, NMN, etcetera, metformin of of regardless of whether or not one takes those or doesn't take those that the positive effects on longevity by way of bar Biomarkers from regular exercise is you know, far outweighs all of those things combined. Not that those things Don't necessarily work. We're not going through them in detail now, but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do for our Health span and lifespan.[0:43:44] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. Absolutely. I I 100% agree. And when you're talking about weight loss, people miss the point of exercise, I think. Yeah.[0:43:52] Dr. Layne Norton: There's some more that came out from Herman Pontzer as well that basically showed, like, well, if you do a 100 calories from exercise, You have a, like, 28 calorie reduction in your basal metabolic rate in response to that. So it's kind of like this constrained energy expenditure model. Right? What I would say is, okay. Well, there's still a net of 72.[0:44:11] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So it's still it's still okay. And the other thing is, I think The effects of exercise on weight loss are actually more due to what it does to appetite. A number of years, kind of outliers because most people don't keep it off for years. Over 70% of them engage in regular exercise.[0:44:33] Dr. Layne Norton: Of people who do not keep weight loss, like, maintain weight loss, less than 30% exercise regularly. So now that's just a correlation that doesn't necessarily prove causation, But there are some pretty compelling studies showing that exercise increases your sensitivity to satiety signals. So, basically, you can have the same satiety signals, but you're more sensitive to them when you exercise. And there's actually a really classic Study, from the 19 fifties in Bengali workers where they looked at basically Four different quadrants of activity. So you had sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, heavily active, Basically, based on their their job choice.[0:45:16] Dr. Layne Norton: And they didn't have an intervention. They just wanted to track them and and see how much you know, how many calories did they actually eat. So it was like a j shaped curve. So the sedentary actually ate more food than the lightly active or moderately active. But from lightly active to heavily active, they almost perfectly compensated how many calories they should be eating.[0:45:39] Dr. Layne Norton: So to me, that suggests when you become active, you can actually rep regulate your appetite appropriately or much more appropriately than if you're sedentary.[0:45:48] Andrew Huberman: Do you think this has to do with changes in the brain, brain centers that respond to satiety signals from the periphery, And or do you think it has to do with, changes in blood sugar regulation? What I was taught, and I don't know if this is still considered true, is that, know, spikes in blood sugar will trigger a desire to eat more even though it's kind of exactly the opposite of what you need when you have a spike in blood sugar. And there's this kind of and we'll get into this when we talk about artificial sweeteners. This is the idea in mind. I think I adopted, perhaps falsely, that, you know, you eat something that's sweeter, that tastes really good, and and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more.[0:46:23] Andrew Huberman: And I could imagine how exercise, if it is increasing the satiety signals, could be working in a number of different ways.[0:46:32] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. I think it's a I think the effect is probably mostly at the brain level. You know, the the effects on blood sugar, The research out there is not very compelling for blood sugar driving, appetite. Now If you become hypoglycemic, yes. You'll you'll get hungry, but it's a different kind of hunger than, like, your normal like, I feel kinda empty, and my stomach's growling.[0:46:58] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, those are. They can go together, but usually, like, the hypoglycemia is like, I am hot. I feel like I'm gonna pass out. Like, you wanna eat something Not because your stomach's crawling, but because you know that you just need some fuel.[0:47:11] Andrew Huberman: It's like you're getting pulled under. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I've been there when I've, Done longer fasts, something I don't do anymore, and drink a lot of black coffee.[0:47:20] Dr. Layne Norton: There was[0:47:20] Andrew Huberman: probably an electrolyte effect there because coffee has you excrete sodium and other electrolytes, And then just feeling like I needed something, this whole thing, like, I need something, this kind of desperation. I I I never wanna be back here again. Hypoglycemia is very uncommon.[0:47:35] Dr. Layne Norton: Not fun. So, you know, again, when they and then when then when they look at, you know, actual randomized controlled trials Of implementing some exercise where they're, you know, pretty controlled environment, they typically see people if If anything, they eat less as opposed to eating more. Now some people again, that's you know, studies report averages. Right? And there's individual data points.[0:48:01] Dr. Layne Norton: So there are some people who at least anecdotally report that exercise makes them more hungry. That's completely valid. It's now it could be Their beliefs around it, it could be a number of different things, but it's important to understand that there is individual variability. And I think one of the things that I've Learn to appreciate more is not trying to separate psychology and physiology. We we do this a lot.[0:48:25] Dr. Layne Norton: And so, well, I wanna know the physiology. I don't care about the psychology of it. And now I'm kind of appreciating more psychology is physiology. Know, that, like, with most things now, we have kind of the biopsychosocial model, and I'll give you an example of this. A lot of people get really caught up with Appetite, and if we could just suppress people's appetite.[0:48:46] Dr. Layne Norton: That's part of it, but people don't just eat because they're hungry. Eat for a lot of different reasons. Social reasons, especially. So can you remember the last social event you ever went to that didn't have food? No.[0:48:59] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. If you look at dinner plates from the 1800, they're about this big. Now how big are dinner plates?[0:49:05] Andrew Huberman: The whole buffet. Right? Right. Yeah.[0:49:09] Dr. Layne Norton: If you there's, situational cues. Right? You're staying down to watch TV. Oh, grab some popcorn. Grab some, you know, snack, whatever.[0:49:16] Andrew Huberman: I even see this with it. You know, how 1 person will up their phone, and then everyone picks up their phone. I think there's a similar effect with food.[0:49:22] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. And and and same thing. Right? Like, how many times have We either done it ourselves or been, experienced people saying, oh, you should have something. You should have it.[0:49:33] Dr. Layne Norton: Or, like, you know, alcohol, especially. Right? Like, people, I was hanging out with somebody last night, and I had a beer, and they just had, you know, a water. And I'm like, I feel no Need to try and convince them to do that with me. You know what I mean?[0:49:49] Dr. Layne Norton: But as humans, you know, we're we're kinda herd animals. Like, We don't wanna be doing something out on isolation on our own. Now I'm I'm this is a very tenuous, I guess, belief of mine. But, you know, doing things alone in isolation, you know, during kind of, you know, ancestral times, That's gonna set off your alarm system, you know, because if you don't have other people, you can't protect yourself. Right?[0:50:17] Dr. Layne Norton: So typically, things were done together in groups, And I think that's a lot of the reason why we tend to be just tribal in nature about a lot of things. Right? So the whole point to that is, you know, On the list of reasons why people eat, I mean, I've gotten to the point where I think that hunger is actually not even the main reason people eat. You know, stress, lack of sleep? Boredom.[0:50:41] Dr. Layne Norton: Boredom? Yeah. Absolutely. So unless, you know, we can do something that addresses all those things, There's a there's a line from a review paper. This review paper came out in 2011 by a researcher named McLean, and it's the best review paper I've ever read.[0:50:58] Dr. Layne Norton: It was called, biology's response to dieting, the impetus for weight regain. And basically went through all the mechanisms of these adaptations that happen during fat loss diets And how biology's response is to try to drive you back to your your previous. And I'm gonna butcher the quote, but at the end of the study, he said, Basically, the body's systems are comprehensive, redundant, and well focused on restoring depleted energy reserves. And any attempt or any kind of strategy for weight loss that doesn't attempt to address a broad spectrum of these things is going to fail. I think really, like, trying to get outside the box and and think about these things, and especially when you read some of the literature.[0:51:57] Dr. Layne Norton: I I recently read a a systematic review of Successful weight loss maintainers, which I thought was really interesting. So they took people who had lost a significant amount of body weight and kept it off first for, I think, it was 3 years. And they basically ask them questions and try to identify commonalities. And there were some things that I expected, like cognitive restraint, self monitoring, you know, exercise. And then one of the things they said that I found really fascinating was pretty ubiquitous between people.[0:52:26] Dr. Layne Norton: They said, I had to develop a new identity. So are you familiar with Ethan Suplee? No. So Ethan is a actor. He's been in, like, Remember the Titans and, American History X.[0:52:39] Andrew Huberman: I certainly saw American History X.[0:52:41] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So he was he was very large. He was, like, £550, and now he's, like, 230 and jacked. Wait. He was 5 he was healthy.[0:52:49] Dr. Layne Norton: £550. Wow. And he has whenever he puts a post on his Instagram of him training, it'll say, I killed my clone today. And I asked him, like, is this what you're talking about? Like, creating a new identity.[0:53:06] Dr. Layne Norton: And he said, this is exactly what I'm talking about because I had to kill who I was. Because there was no way I was gonna be able to make long term changes if I just didn't become a new person because there's I mean, and addicts talk about this. Right? Like, people for who are alcoholics. They had to get new friends.[0:53:23] Dr. Layne Norton: They had to hang out at different places because their entire life had been set up around this lifestyle for alcohol. And I would actually argue that eating disorders or disordered eating patterns is much harder to break than other forms of addiction. And think about food addiction. Well, in some ways, Bulimia and anorexia are still addictions. You can't stop eating.[0:53:52] Dr. Layne Norton: If you're alcoholic, you can abstain from alcohol. If you become addicted to, say, cocaine, you can abstain from that. You can never abstain from food. And so now imagine telling a gambling addict. Well, you've gotta play this slot, you know, couple times a day, but no more.[0:54:09] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, that's that's really challenging. So, yeah. I just like, all this stuff, It's so important to be comprehensive with how we treat these things.[0:54:20] Andrew Huberman: These are incredibly important points. And to my knowledge, I don't think anyone has really described it, in a cohesive way, the way that you're doing here, so important for people to understand this. Because, obviously, as a neuroscientist, I think, you know, The nervous system is creating our thoughts. Our thoughts are and feelings are related to psychology, and therefore, of course, our physiology and our psychology are 1 in the same. Bidirectional.[0:54:42] Andrew Huberman: Now there's nowadays, there's a lot of interest in brain body, in particular, gut brain, access, and we we can talk about that. But I I really appreciate that you're spelling out how there are these different variables. Each one can account for a number of different things. Exercise clearly has a remarkably potent effect, Both during the exercise in terms of caloric, we're in overall health and biomarkers, and then, this is wonderful to learn that it can increase the sensitivity to, to satiety signals. I think, that makes at least in my mind, places it very high on the list of things that people should absolutely do, but that there are other factors too.[0:55:19] Andrew Huberman: And the identity piece is fascinating. It reminds me also your story reminds me also of David Goggins who is You know you know, he talks about his former very overweight self[0:55:29] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep.[0:55:29] Andrew Huberman: Almost as if it was a different person. Yep. And he uses language that I'm not gonna use here.[0:55:35] Dr. Layne Norton: But,[0:55:35] Andrew Huberman: you know, I've I know met David, know David a bit, and he's he's every bit as intense and driven as And a remarkable human being as he appears to be, online, he is that guy. But it does seem like he had to More or less kill off a a former version of himself and and continues to do that every day. And I think what your point about the this other fellow who did, does it, does it through a similar process? I the word today seems to really matter. It's not like you, defeat this former version of yourself, and then that that That person is buried and gone.[0:56:06] Andrew Huberman: You said, you know, I killed my clone today, and that's the way that David talks about it also. So this is a daily process, And I think, this is not just a small detail in tying together all these things. I think that what you are describing is is Fundamental because we can pull on each one of these variables and talk about each one of them. But at the end of the day, we're a cohesive whole as a as an individual. In, sorry.[0:56:30] Andrew Huberman: You were about[0:56:30] Dr. Layne Norton: to say That gets that gets actually one of my my favorite topics, which is, you know, why do we have such a hard time with Losing weight, but more so keeping it off because of obese people, 6 out of every 7 obese people will lose a significant amount of body weight in their life. So why do we still have an obesity problem? They don't keep it off. Why don't they keep it off? When you look at the research, Basically, what it suggests is because people think about, I'm going to do a diet, and I'm gonna lose this weight, and they do not give Any thought to what happens afterwards.[0:57:05] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? It's like think about if you have some kind of chronic disease or a diabetic. Right? You you can't just take insulin once, and that's it. Right?[0:57:13] Dr. Layne Norton: You gotta take it continuously. Otherwise, you're gonna have problems. If you do a diet and you lose, you know, 30 pounds, fantastic. But if you then just go back to all your old habits, you're gonna go back to where you were, if not more. You can't You can't create a new version of yourself while dragging your old habits and behaviors behind you.[0:57:40] Dr. Layne Norton: So what I'll tell people is because people say, well, I'm doing a carnivore diet or I'm doing this diet or that diet, and they'll say, that's fine. Do you see yourself doing that for the rest of your life? And if the answer is yes, if you if you really believe that that's gonna be sustainable for you and plenty of people, low carb, intermittent fasting, what whatever, they say, felt easy. You know, I could do this forever. Great.[0:58:04] Dr. Layne Norton: What if you're going to lose weight, you have to invoke some form of restriction. Whether it is a nutrient restriction, like low carb, low fat, a time restriction, intermittent fasting, any form of time restricted eating, or calorie restriction, tracking macros, whatever. So you you get you get to pick the form of restriction. So pick the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive to you as an individual, and also do not assume Then it will feel the same for everybody else because I made this mistake. Whereas, like, I I track things.[0:58:38] Dr. Layne Norton: And so I I allow myself to eat variety of foods. I allow myself to eat some fun foods, but I track everything, and I'm able to modify my body composition and be in good health doing that. Now Doesn't feel hard for me. Like, part of it's I've just been doing it for so long. But to other people, that's very stressful.[0:58:55] Dr. Layne Norton: They don't want they said, well, I'd rather just not eat for, you know, 16 hours. If that feels easy for them, do that because the one thing that there was a couple of meta analysis on, popular diets. And, basically, what they showed was they were all equally terrible for for long term weight loss. But when they stratified them by adherence, and none of them were better for adherence overall. But when they stratified people just according from lowest adherence to best adherence, It was a linear effect on weight loss.[0:59:25] Dr. Layne Norton: So really what it says is, what is the diet that's gonna be easiest for you to adhere to in the long term, And you should probably do that. And people again, this is where I step back and take the 10,000 foot view. Somebody will say, well, I'm gonna do Ketogenic because I wanna increase my fat oxidation, and I wanna do this, and they're talking about all these mechanisms and everything, and that's great. Can you do it for the rest of your life? Right?[0:59:52] Dr. Layne Norton: Is that is this gonna be something sustainable for you? And if the answer is no, You probably need to rethink what your approach is gonna be.[0:59:59] Andrew Huberman: It's incredibly important message. Basically, that. You know, if I did highlight you know, if there was a a version of highlight or boldface and underline in, in the podcast space, I I would highlight boldface and underline what you just said. And for those of you that heard it, listen to it twice and then go forward because it's absolutely key. I think it also a lot of the so called controversy that exists out there.[1:00:25] Andrew Huberman: I think, it also crosses over with the placebo effect. I almost want to say, Pick the the nutrition plan that you think you can, stick to for for a long period of time, ideally forever, And pick your placebo too because there's there is a lot of placebo woven into each and every one of these things, intermittent fasting, keto, probably even, vegan versus omnivore versus carnivore.[1:00:49] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, they even talk about, know, the diet honeymoon period. Right? Where, like, you go into a diet, and you're all fired up about it. Like, you're very adherent. And then what happens with every single diet Without exception in research studies is once you get past a few months, adherence just starts waiting.[1:01:04] Dr. Layne Norton: So it ain't going off.[1:01:05] Andrew Huberman: Here we are really talking about a form of relationship. You know? I'm not I'm not saying that to be tongue in cheek. Actually, we had a guest early on in the podcast, doctor Carl Dysarthe. He's a psychiatrist And, bioengineer at Stanford, tremendously successful Lasker Award winner, etcetera, and he talked about love as a sort of a an interesting aspect of our psychology where it's a story that you cocreate with somebody, but that you live into the future of that story.[1:01:33] Andrew Huberman: You know, when you pair up with somebody that we're just referring to romantic love[1:01:36] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[1:01:37] Andrew Huberman: That there's this sort of mutual agreement to create this This idea that you're going to live into. So it's not just about how you feel in the moment. It's also that you project into the future quite a lot. I'm seeing a lot of parallels with, a Highly functional and effective diet. And, and I love it.[1:01:53] Andrew Huberman: I'm not setting this parallel up artificially. I'm setting up because I think that, ultimately, it was, down to what you said earlier, which is that the brain and our decisions about what we are going to stick to are tremendously powerful.[1:02:05] Dr. Layne Norton: And I think One thing I will say is, like, keep in mind, when you look at the research data, the meta analysis on, say, time restricted eating versus non, When calories are equated, doesn't seem to be a difference in in weight loss, fat loss, and most biomarkers of health. Same thing for Low carb versus low fat. If you equate calories and protein, there there was a meta analysis done by Kevin Hall back in 2017 where they looked at the and, again, actual loss of body fat. And another important point was there was I think there was 22 studies in this, but all of them provided food to the participants. Right?[1:02:39] Dr. Layne Norton: That's important because that makes ensures that adherence can be much higher in those studies, whereas, like, various free living studies, sometimes you can see funky results.[1:02:47] Andrew Huberman: People are sneaking Food or or they're just not really[1:02:51] Dr. Layne Norton: It's very difficult.[1:02:52] Andrew Huberman: The way that the study would ideally have to be.[1:02:54] Dr. Layne Norton: Unless unless the person is getting, Like, what limits studies? Money, money, and money. Right? But the low carb versus low fat, Protein and calories are equated. Basically, no difference in fat loss.[1:03:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Now some people get upset about this, but it's like, what to me, that's like, this is great because you get to pick the tool you want. The one tool, it doesn't seem to be that much better than another, so pick the one that works for you. Right? Whatever lever you've gotta pull, you've got a bunch of different options.[1:03:32] Andrew Huberman: You Mentioned, picking something you can stick to for a period of time. Is there ever a case for someone saying, look. I like to eat Low carb or even keto for 6 months and then switch to a more standard omnivore, caloric maintenance Type diet and then switch back. Is there any downside to doing that for sake of health or or weight loss over time or weight maintenance over time? Because I realized not everyone is trying to lose weight.[1:03:57] Andrew Huberman: And I definitely wanna talk about, at some point, how to eat to maintain weight. Yeah. Because I think there are a significant, fraction of people out there who are trying to do that. But is there anything Is there any downside to being a dabbler, you know, keto for a few months and then, omnivore for a few months, etcetera?[1:04:14] Dr. Layne Norton: I think that's actually a a great thing, especially to, like, maybe find what you feel is easiest for you. Right? But in terms of, like, as a strategy, I mean, I guess, You know, some people, this might get into dopamine, but, like, oh, change and get something new and, like, you know, you feel a little bit more positive.[1:04:32] Andrew Huberman: Partner model.[1:04:32] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So I don't think it's how I would usually set things up initially for somebody.[1:04:38] Dr. Layne Norton: But if somebody said, hey. I just like to have some variety and and change it up. As long as they're still, like, you know, their behaviors and they're doing portion control or whatever it is, and they're able to sustain a calorie deficit or, you know, depending on whatever their goal is, I don't think there's really any downside to it. I I do think the one thing to keep in mind is when you look at, like, going between extremes, so, like, low fat to low carb or Or vice versa. There can be in that transition period a little bit of weirdness For lack of better term, like, for example, if you've been on a ketogenic diet and all of a sudden you move to, like, a higher carb diet, You'll be, like, basically, insulin resistant for just a short period of time.[1:05:22] Dr. Layne Norton: Now is that gonna cause any health problems? Probably not in the long term, especially if you're still calories. But just because your body has kind of, like, upregulated these systems dealing most with mostly with fat And glucose production rather than glucose metabolism. So now if you start taking glucose or carbohydrate back in, Like, for example, you get somebody in or a glucose tolerance test after they've been on keto, they do pretty terribly at it. But that doesn't last that long.[1:05:50] Andrew Huberman: About how long?[1:05:52] Dr. Layne Norton: Few weeks.[1:05:52] Andrew Huberman: I think that's important for people to know because I have a feeling during those 1st few weeks are the period of time when a lot of people go running back to what they were doing previously, which is not to say that they shouldn't, but, I've certainly done that. I I've tried, very low carbohydrate diet, and I would have assumed. Now I know I'm completely wrong, but I assumed that I was so carbohydrate starved for so long that my insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing, by the way, folks. Would have gone through the roof, and I would be able to just sponge up every bit of glucose that I would have ingested through carbohydrate. So I did indeed switch over, and I felt like I had pretty terrible brain fog.[1:06:29] Andrew Huberman: I even got some jitters, and I thought, wait. What is this? You know, my blood sugar was low before. Now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory. But based on what you just said, I'd upregulated the enzymes and systems in the body For fat metabolism on the keto diet and then switching over, there was a, basically, a ramping up of the of the the The molecules involved in, presumably in glycolysis.[1:06:53] Dr. Layne Norton: Transition period. I mean, think about, like, if you haven't weight trained before and you start weight training, you're gonna feel pretty terrible. Right? Like, you're gonna be sore and stiff and all that kinda stuff. But I will say you aren't necessarily wrong in what you said about being more insulin sensitive because it depends on how you measure insulin sensitivity.[1:07:09] Dr. Layne Norton: So if you measure with something like, you know, fasting blood glucose or fasting insulin or even HOMA IR, those tend to be Pretty good on low carb. But then if you do an oral glucose tolerance test, it tends to be pretty bad. And so it it depends on your specific measure. Right? So I I think that, you know, the idea that keto makes you, you know, glucose intolerant or insulin resistant, I think, again, it's just a transition period, and I'm not too worried about it.[1:07:40] Dr. Layne Norton: But there is something important to keep in mind. And one of the reasons, like, if somebody was to transition out of keto, Typically, if, like, I'm working with them or one of our coaches are working with them, we'll kind of instruct them to do it, like, slowly and kinda systematically over, like, a 4 to 8 week period. That way, hopefully, you know, they're not having that period of 2 weeks where they're like, oh, man. Why why do I feel so terrible?[1:08:01] Andrew Huberman: Very important point. I wanna go to the other end, literally and figuratively, and talk about gut health. Mhmm. Because Up until now and certainly[1:08:12] Dr. Layne Norton: see what you did with that plan.[1:08:13] Andrew Huberman: And certainly in the last, few minutes, we've been talking a lot about sort of top down processes, you know, the The brain, the psychology, placebo effects, but the very real aspects of those. Not that I can imagine 2,000 calories is a 1,000 calories and somehow change the law of bone dynamics. Can't do that. But we've been sort of top down in integrating a lot of different ideas into weight loss maintenance and and weight gain. But gut health, Least the the more popular studies on gut health have kind of blown a lot of things out of the water.[1:08:46] Andrew Huberman: For instance, this idea that you could take obese mice And literally give them fecal transplants from lean mice, and, yes, that sounds like what it sounds like. Fecal transplants definitely, inserted through the same end in which it comes out, and I point that out because a lot of people have asked me that they you know, it was kind of scary to me. I thought, yes. This is not about ingesting Feces, this is they they literally do a transplant of feeds from lean mice into obese mice, and the obese mice get lean. And, yes, this has been done in humans.[1:09:17] Andrew Huberman: Limited number of studies and observed, some pretty impressive effects on weight loss that I have to assume could Be related to placebo effect. They might have told these obese people, hey. Look. You're gonna get lean through this fecal transplant from lean people. But more likely, It had some effect on their core physiology.[1:09:36] Andrew Huberman: I don't know which aspects, although I can speculate which ones, And they became leaner. They lost weight. And that is, in some sense, miraculous when especially given the important role of psychology and exercise and satiety signals, because I'm going to assume that they controlled for a number of those other variables, although no study is perfect. What are your thoughts about gut health as it relates to metabolism, energy utilization, and balance.[1:10:02] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So the first thing I'll say is I'm not a gut gut health expert, but I Well, I feel relatively comfortable talking about it based on conversations I've had with people who are experts. One being, Suzanne Devkota, who's, are you familiar with her?[1:10:17] Andrew Huberman: I well, she's sort of a phenom in this area from what I understand.[1:10:20] Dr. Layne Norton: She was actually doing her master's I was doing my PhD in layman's lab so she was one of my lab mates. Terrific. And, you know, I I the other thing to say is Even gut health experts, and Suzanne will tell you this, they're like, you know, talk to me in 20 years. We we just know so little. I I think that's an overall thing that people don't understand is the scientific consensus moves very, very slow, and probably for good reason.[1:10:47] Dr. Layne Norton: Because if we just Flipped our scientific consensus based on 1 study. I mean, you it would be a mess. Right? So it's gonna take time before we really understand the implications of the gut and what it means. So When it comes to weight loss, there probably is a role in there.[1:11:10] Dr. Layne Norton: I mean, we've seen that there's something going on. Now whether that's is it something where a gut Back microbiome makeup that's more obese resistant. Perhaps it extracts less calories out of the food you eat. Right? Or perhaps it's elevating BMR.[1:11:31] Dr. Layne Norton: Although, I I think that that's probably somewhat unlikely.[1:11:34] Andrew Huberman: Do you think it could impact The way satiety signals are[1:11:37] Dr. Layne Norton: So that's I[1:11:38] Andrew Huberman: mean, back to the brain again is So[1:11:39] Dr. Layne Norton: that's we know that there's a link in the the gut brain axis. And so my suspicion is that it probably is working via appetite regulation. So that I mean, if we look at If we look at the most effective, obesity treatments out there, which is like semaglutide, I mean, you consistently see a, you know, 15%, you know, on average loss of body weight, which is massive, and people keep it off. That is a GLP one mimetic, which is a gut hormone, and it basically just is a very, very powerful appetite suppressant.[1:12:16] Andrew Huberman: Not well, I guess I'm interrupting, but hopefully with a purpose. Go ahead. There's this really interesting study, and it's in mice, admittedly, but, published in a neuroscience journal recently. The basically, the takeaway is that, like so many things in neuroscience, it the GLP one works in 2 parallel pathways. In the brain, it seems to impact Neurons in the hypothalamus that control satiety, so exactly what you're saying.[1:12:38] Andrew Huberman: And in the gut, it seems to create a, the Inactivation of the mechanosensors in the gut. Mhmm. So the perception is that the gut is full even or fuller, I should say not full because I think people who take, semaglutide don't feel bloated, unless I don't know. They might. But that one feels as if their gut is actually Fuller because these mechanosensors that send stretch are sending signals to the brain.[1:13:01] Andrew Huberman: Oh, like, I actually have some food. I'm not empty down there. Right. Anyway, I I I'm tickled by this result mostly because every time I hear about a a drug or a or a molecule having effect, we think it has an effect at one location. Mhmm.[1:13:13] Andrew Huberman: But it's kind of interesting that especially for something like, appetite regulation that it would be impacting body and brand in parallel. Anyway, forgive me. I'm That's okay. Tell I'm I'm, it's No. I think really excited about this, And and here, you are telling a neuroscientist, me, that a lot perhaps circles back to these brain mechanisms of satiety.[1:13:33] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep. I mean, I think that and especially looking at the research on leptin, you know, like, we used to think, okay. Metabolism is mostly, like, liver based, and then, you know, there's, there's, you know, metabolism, adipocyte, and skeletal muscle, But none of this stuff exists in isolation. There's so much crosstalk between these pathways, and that's you know, when we get into mechanisms, the one of the things I love mechanisms, but one of the things I tell people is keep in mind that when you're dealing with an outcome right? So, like, when I say outcome based, We're talking about physical outcomes like, weight loss, fat loss, changes in blood markers, whatever.[1:14:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Though that is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms. So, sure, sometimes you can affect a mechanistic pathway, and you get just kinda straight down the line outcome, but not always. You know, whenever you make a treatment or, you know, Kind of anything into the system, it's like throwing a pebble in a lake. Right? It creates ripples.[1:14:41] Dr. Layne Norton: And We don't always know what those are gonna be. Right? And that's why I mean, we've seen, you know, certain drugs. Well, it works on this pathway, and then they list off all the side effects, and you go, well, how would it create that many side effects? It's because nothing for the most part, they don't just work in one place.[1:14:59] Dr. Layne Norton: There's multitude of places it works. And and to your point about, semaglutide and the effects on, mechanosensors, It's probably why a lot of people report actually kinda like no low grade nausea, when when they're using some glutide, because of that. Because if you're you know, that feeling is usually not like a real comfortable feeling, but, I mean, it will get you to not eat. So I think there's absolutely likely a connection, but we haven't fully elucidated how that works. And when you think about How complicated the gut is.[1:15:34] Dr. Layne Norton: I think I heard something like there's more, you know, there's more cells in our microbiome by far than there are in our body. So we're actually more In terms of a cell per cell level, we're actually more bacteria than we are eukaryote. Right?[1:15:47] Andrew Huberman: There's, Justin Sonnenburg, who's one of the world experts on microbiome. He's in the lab Stares for mine at Stanford. And, he has this idea. It's just an idea that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are sells the question as who's the host and who's the passenger? You know, like, maybe we're we are just maybe they are exploiting us to take them around and interact Because they interact and grow on one another, and so this idea this freaks people out.[1:16:12] Andrew Huberman: Lex Friedman will love this, that maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles for the microbiome and not the other way around. Anyway, kind of a, a scary thought. Do you do anything specifically to support your gut microbiome? Are you a Mhmm. Probiotic guy fermented foods guy or a fiber guy.[1:16:30] Dr. Layne Norton: So, again, I'm gonna kinda go straight down the line from what I've heard from Suzanne, other experts. So if you want to improve gut health, One of the biggest levers the 3 biggest levers you can pull is not eating too many calories, Exercising. There's a there is a connection between exercise in the gut and fiber. So we it is Of the things we know, dietary fiber seems to positively impact the gut because it is a what's called a prebiotic. So your gut microbiota can take especially soluble fiber.[1:17:05] Dr. Layne Norton: Although there's actually some evidence, at least in mice, that they It might be able to use some insoluble fiber as well. I think Suzanne was doing a study looking at hemicellulose and actually seeing that some, like, specific forms of microbiota Flourish with hemicellulose suggesting that they may actually be getting some kind of fuel out of it, which is really interesting, begin in mice. So, you know, just Huge caveat. So your gut microbiome can produce these short chain fatty acids From, by fermenting, this this this soluble fiber, and there's quite a bit of evidence that these volatile fatty acids, Which can be then actually, reabsorbed into the liver that they have some positive effects. Like, for example, butyrate, when they've done butyrate supplementation, they've actually seen positive effects on insulin sensitivity.[1:17:56] Dr. Layne Norton: So what we seem to understand is that more diversity seems to be better. Fiber seems to be positive. Prebiotics seem to work much better than probiotics. Supplemented prebiotics. Yes.[1:18:12] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So the problem with most of the probiotics is They're typically not concentrated enough to actually colonize. And even if you do colonize, What happens is, like, let's say you colonize, some microbiota that you didn't really have much of. If you're not fueling it with the appropriate fiber, it's not gonna stay anyway because it's essentially gonna starve. So the research seems to really clearly suggest that eating enough fiber, which is, again, a prebiotic, That that is a better way to get, a healthier gut per se than probiotic.[1:18:51] Andrew Huberman: What fiber sources Do you use and I think I'm all I realize there's a huge array of choices out there, but people will want to have some ideas as to how they could perhaps mimic what you're doing.[1:19:00] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. And I would just say diversity. Right? So, you know, some there's there's various evidence from various different fiber sources. Fruits and vegetables, obviously, you know, grains, some whole grains, some cereals, and then various other sources.[1:19:19] Dr. Layne Norton: So This is one of the things where we don't really have a good idea if, you know, this one source of fiber is better than another source of fiber. We just know that fiber overall is pretty good. And one thing I'll tell people is, like, if you want a longevity hack I mean, fiber is kind of the longevity hack. If if You look at some of these cohort studies. There was actually a recent really large meta analysis of over a 1000000 subjects, And basically, what it showed was that for every 10 gram increase in fiber, there was a 10% reduction in the risk of mortality, And that extended specifically also to cardiovascular disease and cancer.[1:19:57] Dr. Layne Norton: So one of the things I'll tell people when they get, like, really Into, you know, whether it's intermittent fasting or, you know, with all these other things. So that's great. That's great. Are you eating, like, over 50, 60 grams of fiber a day?[1:20:07] Andrew Huberman: And I because conceptualize 50 to 60 grams. So if I were to eat, like, a a bowl like a let's just say a Quarter plate of broccoli.[1:20:17] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[1:20:17] Andrew Huberman: And the broccoli isn't stacked to the ceiling. The broccoli is just recently stacked on there. Approximately, how many grams of fiber is that if it's, like, like, 2 cups of broccoli? There's a lot. Yeah.[1:20:27] Dr. Layne Norton: So if you like, 200 grams of broccoli per se would probably be, like, Five, 6 grams of fiber.[1:20:32] Andrew Huberman: And I need to get how much per day?[1:20:33] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, ideally. I would say I would typically, what the recommended dose is is 15 grams per 1,000 calories intake. Because Okay. If you're eating, you know, low calories, it's it's difficult to get enough fiber in. But based on and, again, these are cohort studies.[1:20:49] Dr. Layne Norton: So But you can't do 20 year long randomized human controlled trials, unfortunately. That doesn't really appear to be a top end At least for the benefits of fiber. The it probably boils down to, like, how much you can tolerate without feeling uncomfortable. Right. Right?[1:21:03] Dr. Layne Norton: Because if you're eating, like, a ton of fiber, I mean, at at some point, It's not gonna be very comfortable.[1:21:08] Andrew Huberman: Exercise becomes uncomfortable or or hazardous. Yeah.[1:21:12] Dr. Layne Norton: And, actually, Kind of touching on that because I think it is important. You know, a lot of people have kind of in the carnivore community said, well, you don't need fiber. You poop just fine without it. And I always say, well, pooping is the last reason to have fiber. Like, yes, it does help.[1:21:29] Dr. Layne Norton: It does seem to make, elimination easier. You can, you know, do it more frequently, adds bulk to stool, but that's not why you should eat fiber. Why you should eat fiber is because of the effects of mortality. And, you know, some of the pushback will be, well, this is healthy user bias. And what I'll say is[1:21:46] Andrew Huberman: Meaning healthy people do this, and therefore, it's worth it.[1:21:48] Dr. Layne Norton: People eat more fiber and therefore Yeah. And, I mean, yeah, there's there's something to that. But if it was just healthy user bias, typically, you would see some disagreement between the studies, and and a great example of that is, like, red meat. So not every study shows red meat has an association with cancer and mortality. There's there's differences depending on the population used, depending on, like, what they define as high red meat, Low red meat, whether it's processed, unprocessed, but I have not found a study on fiber and cardiovascular disease and cancer and Mortality where it did not show improvements from higher fiber.[1:22:23] Dr. Layne Norton: So to me, that suggests that that that effect is real. And so, again, you know, as much fiber as you can get in comfortably, I would try to do it, because it seems to have some really powerful effects and is good for the gut microbiome. The other thing that may be a consideration for the microbiome is There's some evidence that saturated fat may not be great for the microbiome, that it, reduces the, the prevalence of some Some of the more positive strains of bacteria, and that appears to be, not so much from the saturated fat itself, but from the bile end products that combined with saturated fat seems to have a negative effect on some of these more healthier forms of gut microbiota. But, again, This is really difficult because we don't even know necessarily yet which species of gut microbiota are positive or negative, and that's, mean, this gets into some of these studies where they may call it dysbiosis. Sounds scary, but dysbiosis just means that the gut changed.[1:23:27] Dr. Layne Norton: It doesn't I mean, it doesn't tell you anything qualitative about whether the change was bad or good. And so these are just things I think we need to in mind, we talk about this stuff that this stuff is still very much in its infancy. But in terms of the big lever leavers, I mean, it pretty much fits with what we know about a healthy lifestyle. Exercise, don't eat too much, consume a good amount of fiber from diverse sources.[1:23:51] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. Fantastic because it fits with what I like to think of as kind of the center of mass of evidence. Right? And I I'm starting to get some window into what your process is around Selection of studies and no one study being holy, but when you look at, as you mentioned, all the studies on fiber having a A positive effect to some degree or another, it's pretty hard to refute that there isn't something really interesting there.[1:24:15] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. One thing I'll tell people is, like, You know, 1 study I mean, sometimes I'll change my opinion based on a single study when it's really well done and very powerful, But, usually, like, 1 study is just gonna move me just a little bit. Alright? Then maybe if another one comes out, move me a little bit more. Right?[1:24:31] Dr. Layne Norton: And then, like, very slowly, I'm gonna get some I mean, my my experience with, LDL cholesterol. This is something I changed my mind on a while back. When I was younger, like, circa 2005 getting into grad school, Kind of the prevailing thought was, well, it's not so much the LDL. It's the ratio of LDL to HDL. That's what matters.[1:24:52] Dr. Layne Norton: And probably about 5 years ago and I was I was pretty strong about that opinion. And then 5 years ago, looking at these Mendelian randomization studies, I kinda went, I can't hold this position anymore.[1:25:03] Andrew Huberman: What's your new what is your, revised position on LDL?[1:25:06] Dr. Layne Norton: So if you look at the research, HDL is important because it's a marker of metabolic health. If you have high HDL, it suggests that you are metabolically quite healthy. You very rarely will you have high HDL and, like, High CRP, which is inflammatory marker or dysregulated blood glucose, almost exclusively people who have high HDL will have good biomarkers of, metabolic health. But if you take drugs that raise HDL, it doesn't reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. In Mendel in Mendelian randomization studies, which Mendelian randomization basically uses natural randomization.[1:25:44] Dr. Layne Norton: So some people are, in the case of HDL, Naturally higher secretors or naturally lower secretors of HDL. And, you know, we talked about how you can't really do a 20 year human randomized controlled trial. And you're trying to examine something like heart disease, I mean, that is a lifetime exposure issue. It's very unlikely that you're gonna pick out differences between treatments in 2 years or even 5 years. I mean, you people don't develop typically don't develop heart disease until they're in their, you know, fifties, sixties, and seventies.[1:26:14] Dr. Layne Norton: What Mendelian Randomization allows is to say, okay. We have these people who naturally secrete more or less So we can stratify those and look at what is their risk. So if you look at people who are low secreters of HDL versus high secreters of HDL Withholding some of the other key variables consistent like LDL, you don't see an effect on heart disease really.[1:26:36] Andrew Huberman: Of LDL?[1:26:37] Dr. Layne Norton: Of HDL.[1:26:38] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Okay.[1:26:39] Dr. Layne Norton: But When you look at LDL and you look at the lifetime exposure to LDL, it is like a linear effect on heart disease. And we we know that it's it's actually not so much LDL, but it's more, apolipoprotein b. But that tends to track with LDL just in general. If you look at the mechanism I mean, we know that LDL can penetrate the endothelium, so there's the mechanism is present. If we look at the epidemiology, it supports that it's an independent risk factor.[1:27:09] Dr. Layne Norton: And then, again, these Mendelian randomization studies where we can kind of look at people's exposure over a lifetime, And then we see that linear kind of dose dependent effect. To me, that was convincing enough to change my mind on that particular topic. And then if you look at, like, some of the Framingham data, look at high if you, like, stratify, like, high HDL versus low HDL, Both groups looking at high LDL and low LDL. So if you have high HDL, low LDL, you will still be Lower risk factor than somebody who has high HDL and high LDL. Mhmm.[1:27:45] Dr. Layne Norton: Right?[1:27:46] Andrew Huberman: So the ratio does matter.[1:27:48] Dr. Layne Norton: The ratio does matter. Same thing with with inflammation. Risk than people who are low inflammation, high LDL. So, again, that was kind of sufficient for me to change my mind, but it took it was like not just 1 study came out. It was okay.[1:28:06] Dr. Layne Norton: Then there was another study, and then another study, and another study. And at a certain point, I go, okay. Well, now I either have to change my mind or I'm basically just gonna be cognitively dissonant and say, Nope. I don't believe all that. You know?[1:28:20] Dr. Layne Norton: And and so I think that's one of the things to keep in mind. People will say, oh, you or you're saying this is a bad study? Very rarely why something a bad study because data is just data, but the issue becomes how it is presented and how broadly It's applied in the mainstream media or by, you know, people on, you know, fitness influencers. And what I'll do is Try to step in and say, okay. Let's consider x, y, and z as well.[1:28:50] Dr. Layne Norton: And then it's not a bad study, but let's just be careful about how broadly we imply the The interpretation.[1:28:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well and I I think you're in a very unique and important position to be able to place things into their proper context because of this, For lack of a better word, holistic view of how the psychology placebo effects, also core core physiology, relate to one another and so on. In fact, I think that your training as a biochemist and then training as a new in nutrition with somebody who Don Layman, who Was pushing you to focus on outcomes. I think that's a beautiful, capture of the the continuum at which one can look at something. Because those of you who don't know out there, you know it, a lot of laboratory studies on mice and humans, for instance, in the realm of biochemistry or in vitro studies, you'll see a change In some molecule, it can be quite dramatic, and then the assumption is, oh, you just take you take the drug that will change that molecule in a particular direction, and then You'll get the effect you want at the at the whole organ organism level.[1:29:49] Andrew Huberman: The person will lose weight. The person will gain muscle. The animal will, not, have Alzheimer's, etcetera, but it just doesn't work that way because of the redundancy and this interplay.[1:29:59] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, a great example of that is so my research Was actually in rodents. All my all my studies on protein metabolism and and leucine in particular is what we were studying. Well, we know if you give leucine, it increases muscle protein synthesis. But we also know if you supplement with Leucine, people don't get more muscular.[1:30:17] Andrew Huberman: I was[1:30:17] Dr. Layne Norton: about to say, all[1:30:18] Andrew Huberman: you have to do is supplement with Leucine. Right.[1:30:20] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. Right. And so how is that possible where, you know, muscle building is not just protein synthesis. It's also the balance between synthesis and degradation. So, and degradation just happens to be very, very difficult to measure.[1:30:31] Dr. Layne Norton: But, a a great example and, again, one of the cool things about my PhD was actually changed the way I ate, which I think is interesting. So before, I had been like, I eat 8 meals a day, eat every 2 hours, try to keep meals a day. Yeah. When I got to grad school.[1:30:45] Andrew Huberman: That 30 grams of protein[1:30:46] Dr. Layne Norton: per meal. That amino drip going in was the idea. Right? Like, just have an IV hooked up of amino acids.[1:30:52] Andrew Huberman: Not really, folks.[1:30:53] Dr. Layne Norton: Not really. Yeah. But that that was kind of the concept. But The 1st study I did, we basically looked at okay. A lot of people had measured the amplitude of protein synthesis In response to Emil, we wanted to see how long does this last and where does it peak.[1:31:11] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? And so my thought was, Okay. Well, it'll probably track with plasma leucine. You you give for those that are not familiar, leucine is the amino acid that is Almost exclusively responsible for increasing muscle protein synthesis when you eat protein. So it's it's one of the branch amino acids.[1:31:31] Dr. Layne Norton: So We wanted to see, okay, how long does this effect last? So we we fed these animals, whey protein. And again, I thought, okay. Well, however long plasma leucine stays up, that will be how long, proteins that the cyst stays up. And so we got the proteins that the cyst data back, and it was peaked at 90 minutes or sorry.[1:31:50] Dr. Layne Norton: Picked from 45 to 90 minutes, And then it was back down to baseline by a 180 minutes. And so when I went to do the plasma leucine analysis, my shock Was at 3 hours, plasma leucine was still plateaued out. And I said, okay. Well, when I look at the initiation factors, That will show me something. So, for those not familiar, this is part of the mTOR signaling pathway.[1:32:15] Dr. Layne Norton: So one of the 2 of the targets of mTOR When it's stimulated, leucine stimulates mTOR. 2 of the targets of mTOR are a, protein compound called 4 e v p one, And then another one is called, ribosomal protein s six k. So I don't wanna get into the specifics about it because it's kinda beyond the scope. Basically, when these things are phosphorylated by mTOR, it increases, the rate of translation initiation, which translation initiation is basically the process of the ribosome hooking on to the mRNA and then starting protein synthesis. So I I was looking at the phosphorylation of 4 a b p one and r p s six.[1:32:58] Dr. Layne Norton: I was like, okay. Well, I'll probably see these things come down at at 3 hours. Still plateaued. And so then it was like, what is what's going on here? So I kept I actually kept rerunning the data and rerunning the data and rerunning the data, And I'll never forget.[1:33:11] Dr. Layne Norton: I went into layman's office, and this is, like, you know, 6 months after we've done this study because this analysis takes time. And, like, so where are we with this duration Study. I said, well, I I just gotta run the plasma data again because it's not right. And he's like, well, why is it not right? And I said, well, it just doesn't make any sense.[1:33:28] Dr. Layne Norton: You know? And I I kinda went through he's like, well, like, describe to me your technique. Like, how are you doing this? I described it. He said, well, what how's your standard error?[1:33:37] Dr. Layne Norton: I I told him what the numbers were. He said, it sounds like it's good data. He said, it sounds like You are trying to get the data to fit your conclusion, and you need to change your conclusion to fit the data. And that Statement. This is why we do PhDs.[1:33:53] Dr. Layne Norton: This is[1:33:53] Andrew Huberman: why yeah. You need an adviser.[1:33:55] Dr. Layne Norton: This is why I'm so skeptical of everything because I have had so many of my ideas Crushed by my own data. Right? So we actually ended up this this this kind of effect, this phenomenon is called, muscle protein synthetic refractory period. So, basically, like, once you trigger the system, Kinda runs for a defined period of time, and then it takes time to essentially, like, reset for lack of a better term. It's also been referred to as the muscle full effect.[1:34:25] Dr. Layne Norton: But so I looked at that and said, why am I eating every 2 hours then? You know? And there was even a study, out of Wolf's lab, Like, back in 99, I think, where they infused amino essential amino acids for 6 hours. Protein synthesis went up, peaked at 60 minutes, back down a 120 and never went back up again.[1:34:44] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I'm being naive, but I would have thought that If protein synthesis goes up and then comes back down, the eating more often would be exactly the thing you would want to do if your goal was to get Increased protein synthesis because you'd be pinging the system periodically.[1:35:00] Dr. Layne Norton: But the but the problem is the plasma with no acids are still elevated.[1:35:04] Andrew Huberman: So it's essentially like eating the whole way From the perspective of leucine.[1:35:07] Dr. Layne Norton: From the cells. Yeah. So that was one of those things where I said, you know what? I'm actually gonna eat less often because, like, if I'm eating in 3 hours later, I've still got, You know, capped out plasma amino acids, you know, and we looked at all kinds of stuff. Like, we looked at intracellular leucine just to make sure that, you know, that wasn't falling off.[1:35:24] Dr. Layne Norton: It wasn't. We looked at all the plasma essential amino acids because you might we were thinking, well, maybe protein synthesis is, you know, sucking some of these amino acids out of the plasma, they're dropping, and that's causing it to kinda short circuit the system. That wasn't the case. It just essentially, what The evidence suggest I think we're the only ones to show this so far. So I'm not ready to say that this is a real effect because I hold out the idea that data artifacts do exist, and you can't be totally sure.[1:35:53] Dr. Layne Norton: But we saw, an increase in AMP kinase kind of around this mark where, protein synthesis started falling off, and we also saw a decrease in intracellular ATP. And protein synthesis is an ATP dependent process. And so what we think might be happening is you're, you know, consuming protein And you're up you're increasing muscle protein synthesis. And then at a certain point, it's Has enough effect on your, you know, energy metabolism in your cells that it kind of short not short circuits it, but it kind of cuts it off. Right.[1:36:36] Dr. Layne Norton: So, again, we're the only ones to show that that I'm aware of. So and that was, again, in rats. So I I I I always talk about data. Like, there's data I'm willing to bet my my toe on, my foot on, my leg on, and my life on. I'd probably barely bet the end of my little toe on that one.[1:36:52] Dr. Layne Norton: I'm not quite sure, But it's interesting nonetheless. So Proportional weight here. Great example of okay. We're looking at this mechanism of mTOR signaling. And if we just looked at that, we'd say, oh, well, protein synthesis is gonna stay elevated for, you know, past 3 hours.[1:37:07] Dr. Layne Norton: But that's not what we saw. So yeah. I think it's again, that's why I really try to, you know, get people to say, well, that's mechanisms are important. It's And especially if you're seeing an outcome, it's important to identify mechanisms that may explain that. But let's step back from the mechanisms from trying to chase mechanisms, and let's look at, like, Chasing outcomes in terms of what we recommend to people.[1:37:29] Andrew Huberman: Excellent point. In terms of, chasing outcomes, a number of People I know are interested in weight loss or weight maintenance. And several times throughout today's conversation, we've come back to this issue of, satiety signals. Whether or not they're brain based, body based, or both, you know, not wanting to eat more is a great way to maintain or lose weight because you simply don't want to. I heard you mention earlier that protein and maybe specific types of protein or sources of protein may provide Better satiety signals than other macronutrients.[1:38:03] Andrew Huberman: Could you briefly talk about how macronutrients, including protein, But, also, carbohydrates and fats impact satiety. And from the standpoint of somebody who, for instance, Would like to, quote, unquote, lose a few pounds. Right? Probably would be happy to gain a little bit of lean body mass provided it was in a particular location on their body. That seems to be a A thing now directed hypertrophy, if you will, and how much they should focus on protein as a core component of creating this diet.[1:38:35] Andrew Huberman: You know? Assuming everything else has been done correctly, they're gonna hit the right number of calories relative to their, their output, meat, etcetera. How should we think about protein and cystitis signals? And are animal sources of protein indeed More bioavailable. That's a tricky word.[1:38:54] Andrew Huberman: It for sake of muscle building, but also for sake of somebody who just Would like to lose body fat. They don't wanna lose muscle, and they'd like to bring their weight down a few pounds.[1:39:02] Dr. Layne Norton: So a lot of things to or more. Yeah. A lot of things to unpack there. Of the macronutrients, protein is definitely the biggest lever that you can pull. Because even if you know, it doesn't take a ton of protein to get a lot of the muscle building benefits.[1:39:13] Dr. Layne Norton: I mean, I think The benefits really start to plateau out around 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight. There's some evidence that maybe even up to, like, two point 4 or 2.8 grams per kilo may give, like, a little bit more benefit. I think it probably looks something like an asymptote in terms of a curve where As you put more into the system, you always get a little bit more, but it just gets to the point where it's so infinitesimally small benefit that it's, For all intents and purposes, no benefit.[1:39:41] Andrew Huberman: But you mentioned 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Is that would you consider that a A threshold that most people should try and achieve daily.[1:39:49] Dr. Layne Norton: I I see very few downsides to hitting that. I mean, I know some people and this is gonna get into a separate conversation, but I know some people will say, well, I don't wanna stimulate mTOR because that's gonna make me die early. And I think one of the things to keep in mind Is if you look at there's kind of this thought process out there that if you're stimulating inventory, that protein is gonna make you die early. And first off, we have very little human outcome data to support that claim. And the second thing is if you look at any macronutrient isolation, I can make a mechanistic argument that it's gonna kill you.[1:40:21] Dr. Layne Norton: So fat, if you take in fat, it decreases flow mediated dilation. Flow mediated dilation is important for heart health In the short term, carbohydrates stimulate insulin. Insulin, you know, pro inflammatory and, you know, all these other things. And so I can make an argument for any single macronutrient to be negative for longevity. I want I really want people this is something that even scientists get wrong.[1:40:49] Dr. Layne Norton: They look at an acute response of something and assume that that is going to relate to long term outcomes and signaling. So let's just take exercise, for example. If I if you didn't know anything about exercise and I said to you, Andrew, I'm gonna do something that's gonna make you your heart rate go up, your blood pressure go up, your inflammatory markers go up, your reactive oxygen species increase. You're gonna say and it's gonna damage your muscles. You're gonna say, I'm not doing that.[1:41:19] Dr. Layne Norton: That sounds horrible. You know? But it does all those things in the short term. But what is the long term effect of exercise? You actually get healthier.[1:41:28] Dr. Layne Norton: All all those things improve. No. I'm not saying that, you know, protein is a a longevity hack or anything like that. But what I'm saying is I think some of the arguments out there based on Mechanistic. You know?[1:41:40] Dr. Layne Norton: This increases inventory. Therefore, we don't wanna do it. I think it is a much more complicated argument than than just that. So there's that. So protein is the biggest lever.[1:41:50] Dr. Layne Norton: I would shoot for 1.6, you know, grams per kilogram. If you can do more, great. Doesn't seem to be really downsides to it even, like, up to very high levels of protein. Jose Antonio did a study that was a year long randomized controlled trial. And again, it's just 1 year, but they were looking at all sorts of different biomarkers.[1:42:08] Dr. Layne Norton: And, basically, even up to, like, 4 grams per kilogram of protein, they couldn't really Find any negative health outcomes from it, other than people were just so satiated, they ended up eating less calories. So Protein is a big lever lever because one, it has a higher thermic effect to food, so you're getting a little bit more calorie burn per day even though it's Not a ton because TEF is a pretty small percentage of your overall energy expenditure, but still a benefit. You're getting the effects on lean body mass. It's gonna if you're in a diet, it's gonna help preserve lean body mass. If you're at maintenance, it's gonna help build a preserved lean body mass, and if you're in a surplus, it's gonna help build a preserved lean body mass.[1:42:46] Dr. Layne Norton: Then you get the effects on appetite. So now I wanna be careful because appetite effects tend to be very specific to individual foods. Right? So you can take a high protein food and make it Not very not very. So take, for example, like, a really tasty protein bar, which, you know, back when we were getting into this, there no such thing existed.[1:43:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Now you have protein bars that actually take pretty darn good. But if you eat one of them, I mean, Are you really satiated? I I don't really feel satiated[1:43:21] Andrew Huberman: for a protein bar. That's my pre meal snack.[1:43:23] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. Right. So Why? Because I mean, it's processed, refined, and, made to be very palatable. Okay?[1:43:32] Dr. Layne Norton: But take something like a 200 gram chicken breast. Very satiating. Right? And that's why when people say, well, carbohydrates aren't very satiating. Depends on the carbohydrate.[1:43:41] Dr. Layne Norton: I mean, When you look at the, like, the satiety index, a plain baked potato is about as satiating as it gets.[1:43:49] Andrew Huberman: If I eat a bowl of oatmeal[1:43:50] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[1:43:51] Andrew Huberman: I feel pretty good afterward.[1:43:53] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. For a while.[1:43:54] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, I I usually, I'll eat that along with some other things, but Yeah. I I I completely agree. The so you're saying that the the form that it comes in, maybe even how much chewing is required, how good it smells, that your psychological associations. Because to me, a steak is an incredible meal.[1:44:13] Andrew Huberman: Like, I I mean, if I had to pick 1 food that I could eat Even though I'm not pure carnivore, for the rest of my life, it would be that because I think it would get me where I need to go, and then I'd probably have to sneak some fiber. Yeah. You know? But, an excellent point. I I have a question that I don't wanna take us off track, but I'm hoping it relates enough that you could answer it now.[1:44:31] Andrew Huberman: In the context of this, If I'm going to eat, let's say, 2 grams, per kilogram body weight protein, and I'm not eating multiple meals per maybe I'm eating 2 or 3 meals per day, I'm certainly going to be eating more than the 30 gram threshold that was thrown around for a long time that we can only assimilate 30 grams of protein per meal. Should I just not worry about that? Some of it is gonna go towards the thermic, effect of food. Some of that might be converted into glucose of all things through gluconeogenesis. So should I worry about this 30 gram cutoff?[1:45:01] Andrew Huberman: Because I think balancing the the 1.6 gram per kilogram body weight threshold with number of meals, with The need to exercise and work and live my life and sleep, etcetera. Pretty soon, you you you run into bottlenecks Yeah. Where you just can't do it all, or you're spending so much time a focus on[1:45:15] Dr. Layne Norton: can't optimize all the things at the same time.[1:45:17] Andrew Huberman: You'd lose your mind and your body. So, what what What is necessary in terms of, frequency in, if one is getting enough protein? And then tied into that question, Is there any reality to this idea that if you eat 1 meal per day or you're fasting and then you eat, You know, let's say, 200 grams of protein in a single feeding that you can assimilate more because you were So protein starved, is that is that a real thing?[1:45:49] Dr. Layne Norton: So most of the studies with protein are after a fast, like, because, to assess it with a stable isotope, you have to be in a steady state. So, we haven't observed that. It doesn't appear that fasting really Kind of allows you to assimilate more protein after a fast. So this gets into a core of one of the things I looked at my PhD, which is, does protein distribution matter? Because most Americans get about 65 to 70% of their protein at dinner.[1:46:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? Breakfast tends to be pretty minimal protein, foods.[1:46:22] Andrew Huberman: Do any cultures actually eat a big breakfast and not a big lunch and dinner? I get you know, we all heard that that was ideal. We'll get into circadian timing in a little bit, but does anyone actually do that steak and eggs for breakfast and then taper off the rest of the day?[1:46:34] Dr. Layne Norton: I know German culture tends to have a big breakfast, but also tends to be like sugary foods and whatnot. As far as, like, teleologically, I'm not I'm actually not sure about that. So if you look at that and then you consider that Protein doesn't really have a storage mechanism. Right? Like, people will say, well, you know, lean tissue is a storage mechanism.[1:46:56] Dr. Layne Norton: That's like saying a house is a storage facility for wood. You know? Yeah. If the house is made out of wood, you could get wood out of it, but that's not why you build the house. Right?[1:47:04] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, you're building the house out of a demand, same thing for muscle tissue. There is a free pool of amino acids, but it's very, very small. So you consider things like fat, which basically has unlimited storage capacity, carbohydrate, a relatively large storage capacity. You can store, 4 or 500 grams of carbohydrate between your liver and muscles. And then protein, which almost has no storage capacity, The idea that, okay, you could make up for a low protein at 1 meal by overconsuming another meal didn't make sense to me.[1:47:38] Dr. Layne Norton: So one of the studies we did, and again, in rats, we took, both groups were getting whey protein, so high quality protein. They were getting the exact same amount of calories, exact same amount of, you know, Nitrogen, exact same macros. Everything was the same. The only difference was 1 group basically got kinda 3 meals of Similar amounts of protein. Like, dinner was a little bit bigger because we wanted to keep it somewhat similar to how people eat, but each meal was gonna be over the threshold to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.[1:48:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Whereas the other group, I constructed it so the first 2 meals of the day should not stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Should be under that threshold. And then the last meal was about 70% of the total daily protein. And so we had them eat those for 11 weeks, I'll I'll never forget this. This is how, like, obsessive I became about it is there was a 110 animals in this study, and I made all the diets, And I weighed out exactly every single meal for every single animal for 11 weeks.[1:48:41] Dr. Layne Norton: So I was in there at 6 AM. I was in there at, you know, noon, and I was in there at 6 PM, you know.[1:48:46] Andrew Huberman: I love it.[1:48:47] Dr. Layne Norton: So that's[1:48:47] Andrew Huberman: a kinda PhD student that, professors dream of. You must have been a dream student.[1:48:53] Dr. Layne Norton: So At the end of 11 weeks, we looked at, like, lean body mass. We looked at body fat. We looked at, hind limb weights. We didn't really see differences in lean body mass, but what we did see was a difference in hind limb weights. It wasn't massive, but there was a significant difference in the size of the muscles of the hind limbs of these animals.[1:49:15] Dr. Layne Norton: And so it's interesting that there wasn't a a difference in lean body mass. And what we found, at least with the liver, The animals that were eating, the, like, 1 meal with really high protein actually had bigger livers, not like a huge amount and not something that I would consider unsafe, but they it was a statistically significant difference. And so To me, at least, like, if I'm trying to explain, like, no difference in lean body mass, but a a difference in these hind limb weights, maybe there's some, like, sequestering of, You know, like, that that that's fueling a little bit more, protein synthesis of the splanchnic tissues rather than you know, because you're capping out skeletal muscle protein synthesis. And we do know that the splanchnic tissues are more sensitive or have a greater rate of protein synthesis per day. Like, the rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in humans is about, like, 1% per day.[1:50:09] Dr. Layne Norton: So it takes, like, a 100 days to turn over, you know, skeletal muscle. Whereas, like, your entire gut, Your entire GI will turn itself over in, like, 2 to 3 days. Right? So but really and the liver also has a very high amount of protein synthesis, which is one of the reasons is actually one of the most metabolically active organs. So all that to say, it has not it's been there's been 1 human study that showed something similar, And then there's been a couple others that didn't.[1:50:36] Dr. Layne Norton: And then in the intermittent fasting studies, which is maybe a a good tool to look at compared to continuous feeding, It one thing I will say is it looks like the 168 intermittent fasting style. There's been a couple studies with Grant Tinsley, and this is something I've changed my mind on as well. Grant Tinsley has done a couple studies where they did use the 16/8 protocol. They had them trained during their feeding window, And they had them eat I think it was at least 3 protein containing meals[1:51:05] Andrew Huberman: during that 8 hours. These are humans?[1:51:06] Dr. Layne Norton: These are humans. Mhmm. And they saw no difference in lean body mass at the end of the study compared to people who were eating, you, like, you know, as many times as they want throughout the day. Now if you look at some of the more, extreme forms of fasting, like alternate day fasting or, like, 22/2 or 24. There are some studies where you do start to see differences in lean body mass.[1:51:31] Dr. Layne Norton: So my suspicion is and I'm I'm I'm just guessing, so this is tenuous. My suspicion is probably if you're getting, like, 2 to 3, like, high quality protein meals in a day, you're getting the vast majority of the benefits of protein. The the the most important thing is getting enough total. And then secondarily, trying to get, you know, at least 2 or 3 meals with high quality protein in. But if you're going, like, pretty extreme with, like, alternate day fasting or, You know, maybe only 1 meal a day, then I think there may be some effects on lean body mass.[1:52:07] Dr. Layne Norton: But again, these can be mitigated as well if you're doing, you know, hard resistance training. Typically, that is the biggest lever in terms of lean body mass. Yes. You know, protein distribution may make a difference, but trying to put it in context so people don't feel like they need to go out and eat, you know, 4 meals a day. But, again so what I would say is, like, some of the more milder forms of, know, time restricted eating appear to be fine for lean body mass.[1:52:31] Dr. Layne Norton: Now the the caveat is the following. One of the nice things about animal studies is when you consider if you wanna have a high subject number, high level of control, In a long duration, it's pretty much your only option. Right? So I I have a in our research review, reps, I created a Venn diagram, which basically is, like, 3, you know, circles crossing over. 1 is study duration, 1 is, level of control, and the other 1 is subject number.[1:53:05] Dr. Layne Norton: And to get all 3 of those circles to cross over, It almost has to be in animals. Right.[1:53:11] Andrew Huberman: So And this and reps, is it it's a newsletter or a book?[1:53:14] Dr. Layne Norton: So it's, it's our monthly research review. So every month we review, like, 5, studies that come out in fitness and nutrition. Like, we'll usually Do at least 1 nutrition, 1 training, and 1 supplement per per month.[1:53:27] Andrew Huberman: We will put a link to where we can sign up. This is a a sign up Yeah. Format? Great.[1:53:32] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep. Yep. So it's a script subscription based service. So, basically, When people might look at, like, my study, well, why did you see a difference in in muscle weights whereas some of these other studies don't see a difference? I weighed out every single meal for 11 weeks, and keep in mind that 11 weeks in a rodent's lifespan is a really long time.[1:53:56] Dr. Layne Norton: That's about an eighth of their total lifespan. So is it that there's no effect? Or is it that the effect is relatively small and would take a really long time and very high level of control to see in humans? I don't know, but I think what I would say relatively confidently is if you're gonna do, like, a 168 intermittent fasting, You're probably fine, especially and, again, what is the goal? Right?[1:54:25] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, if you're a bodybuilder looking to be the most massive person you possibly can or you're a A football player, you're some in some field that having as much lean body mass as possible is really important for you, Then I would say, well, you're not really gaining a whole lot by doing some form of time restricted eating.[1:54:42] Andrew Huberman: I think most of the people listening to this don't do not fall into that category. I think most people want to maintain or lose Wait. They'd like to perhaps add a bit of, quote, unquote, shape or muscle to specific areas of their body and lose body fat.[1:54:54] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. And I think Yeah. Your normal forms of time restricted, and you're probably perfectly fine for that. Right? And, again, it it I don't want somebody to think, well, I do, you know, alternate day fasting, there's no point to be resistance training because I'm gonna lose muscle mass.[1:55:08] Dr. Layne Norton: No. No. No. No. No.[1:55:09] Dr. Layne Norton: No. You can still build muscle doing that. Just might not build as much muscle as you would if you were eating in a more traditional format. But if that's something that works for you and your goals and especially if it's fat loss or, you know, controlling your calories, Then again, it's it's about the hierarchy of what's important. Right?[1:55:24] Dr. Layne Norton: So to answer your question, I do think that timing and frequency matters a little. Not so much frequency, but distribution more so. So I think the distribution matters, but it's a it's a much smaller lever than just getting enough total protein in. And then as far as, like, animal versus plant, I used to be in the camp of there's no way somebody can build as much muscle on a plant based diet. And now I think I've come back to you can.[1:55:50] Dr. Layne Norton: It just requires a little bit more planning. And I don't wanna say always, but It's very difficult to do without an isolated source of protein. So unless you're gonna supplement with an isolated plant source of protein, it's very difficult to get Enough without going over on total calories because you can figure that especially, like, take somebody who may be calorie restricted, Trying to get enough protein from whole intact plant sources. So you've got a few different things working against you. 1, the sources of protein you're consuming also have carbohydrate and or fat.[1:56:24] Dr. Layne Norton: 2, it's a less bioavailable form of protein. And 3, it's a lower quality of protein in terms of it has typically less leucine, Less branch amino acids and less essential amino acids.[1:56:34] Andrew Huberman: You answered the question that I almost interrupted you to ask, which was, does it boil down to the leucine content? And, it sounds like that is one of the components and that, a lot of the vegan and vegetarian sources of excellent protein, that excellent protein vegetarian or vegan source is copackaged with calories from carbohydrates and or fat that make it hard to Stay stay under the the caloric threshold. Whereas a steak is I'm not and, obviously, for people might wanna avoid that for ethical reasons. Sure. But that's a different matter entirely.[1:57:05] Andrew Huberman: But A steak or a piece of chicken or an egg is well, an egg, you know, has a yolk, which is there's fat there, but is almost a pure protein fat Source, there's no carbohydrate along for the ride.[1:57:16] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. So I think what I would say is that, you know, you can do it. It takes a little more planning. And You're almost always if you're a vegan, especially, you're gonna be better off, like, supplementing with some isolated form of protein, or vegan form of protein. Now this is where it gets into people say, well, what about the limiting amino acids and those sorts of things?[1:57:36] Dr. Layne Norton: It's a consideration. Some of the better forms of, vegan protein in terms of amino acid content are like soy. Now I can everybody hear everybody screaming online about their testosterone levels. In terms of actual outcomes and looking at testosterone, There was a recent meta analysis looking at soy, and I think if it's your only source of protein, Then maybe the dosage is high enough to cause some weird effects. But if you're just using it, like, once or twice a day, doesn't seem to have an effect on testosterone or estrogen.[1:58:09] Dr. Layne Norton: So that can be a decent source of protein because it is a complete protein source. It does have a p d cos of 1, which p d cos is basically a, a measure of protein quality based on does it provide enough of all the amino acids so that none are limiting? And so soy is one of the only vegan sources that does that. Interestingly, potato protein isolate actually has a similar essential amino acid content to whey. Isolated potato protein, it's just really hard to find.[1:58:39] Dr. Layne Norton: I've been I've been trying to source it through.[1:58:41] Andrew Huberman: Take note. Vegetarians take note because or or vegans rather because whey is vegetarian, and whey is a very, high quality protein source. Quality protein source.[1:58:50] Dr. Layne Norton: They're actually, creating whey now out of I think it's, I I may mischaracterize this, but I believe they're able to produce an out of, like, yeast or something like that Amazing. That, you know, so for vegans, now this is a great option whey. So I think that's great. Getting to the leucine let me go back. Sorry.[1:59:17] Dr. Layne Norton: So another reason that the using an isolated protein can be helpful is Because it's more bioavailable as well when it's been isolated out. When it's the protein bound up in the actual plant material, It tends to be less bioavailable. Now cooking can help increase the bioavailability bioavailability because it breaks some of those bonds and and whatnot, but it still seems to be lower. And you don't it's really interesting. There was a recent study where they did a corn, wheat, and pea blend of protein versus whey.[1:59:50] Dr. Layne Norton: And basically, the outcome was, 30 grams of each similar stimulated protein synthesis to a similar degree. But the plasma amino acids in the plant based protein still did not get as high as with whey. Now It may be that that's just it doesn't matter because once you get to a certain level, you get all the benefits. So,[2:00:13] Andrew Huberman: but I[2:00:14] Dr. Layne Norton: still found it interesting nonetheless that they didn't quite get as high. The other thing to consider with the vegan sources of protein is the leucine content. So one of the studies we did was we looked at Wheat, soy, egg, and whey. Isonitrogenous, meaning we equated protein between the groups. Isocaloric, we equated we equated calories, and we looked at muscle protein synthesis.[2:00:40] Dr. Layne Norton: And I think this was the meals were 15% of total energy from protein. So like a like your food guide pyramid level of protein. And we saw that in the wheat and soy group, they did not increase muscle protein synthesis, but the egg and whey group increased muscle protein synthesis. Now what's really interesting is we went back and we took wheat and added free leucine to it to match the leucine content of whey, And the protein synthetic response was identical. So, again, I I don't like to simplify things too much, but Leucine appears to really be driving this ship.[2:01:21] Dr. Layne Norton: And, I I'll never forget. Layman called me in his office one day, And he would always do these, like, thought experiments of he he liked to think about why something occurs the way it does. Dangerous dangerous territory. Yeah. So he he would say, One day, I'll never forget.[2:01:37] Dr. Layne Norton: It's like, Lane, why do you think the body evolved to just sense leucine for muscle protein synthesis? And, of course, I'm like, I don't know, man. I just work here. Like, I'm just trying to get my PhD. And he said, well, think about it.[2:01:52] Dr. Layne Norton: You would want something that really wasn't extensively metabolized by the gut and liver because you would want it to show up in the blood in values that reflect what you just ate. Makes sense. And you would want it to have passive diffusion across the muscle cell because you wanna be concentration dependent, which it is.[2:02:10] Andrew Huberman: So Get into the tissues and cells that need it most.[2:02:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. So, you know, not having active transport, but rather passive transport. So, yeah, I thought that that was really interesting the way you broke that down. So few few different options for the vegan folks out there. You can use an isolated source of of Protein.[2:02:27] Dr. Layne Norton: And again, like, there's gonna be good options coming because this plant based whey is gonna be a great option for folks. You can add free leucine to it to whatever your source of protein is.[2:02:39] Andrew Huberman: Just buy supplemented leucine powder.[2:02:41] Dr. Layne Norton: Now it tastes horrible.[2:02:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think I've heard that. Maybe I've even tried it.[2:02:46] Dr. Layne Norton: It's completely non polar. It does not dissolve in anything. Can it be put into capsules? Gross. It can be put into capsules.[2:02:51] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So you could take a capsule. Like, For example, if you're eating your normal meal, you could just take a capsule of, like, 1 gram of Leucine. It's probably gonna bump you off bump you up enough that you're gonna be good to go. And then there's there's options like, blends, especially with corn.[2:03:08] Dr. Layne Norton: Corn is actually very high in leucine As a percentage of its protein. Now you gotta remember, like, you you go eat corn on a cob, and you're getting, like, 2 grams of total protein. So it's not that much leucine. But if you isolate out the protein, put it into a powder, well, now, you know, when you're getting, like, 80, 90% of the weight is now protein, corn is actually about 12% leucine in terms of the protein. So a great source of leucine.[2:03:31] Dr. Layne Norton: It is, like, almost frank deficient in some other amino acids, but you can blend it with a few other source approaching like you could blend it with a soy, a pea, and you can create these complimentary blends that would actually have quite a bit of leucine, but also some of the other essential amino acids. So there are options out there for plant based folks. And, I mean, we have seen people who are plant based, you know, build impressive amounts of muscle. There's quite a few bodybuilders that are plant based.[2:03:57] Andrew Huberman: And a lot of the endurance athletes like it. And even though, when we talk about muscle, we think about muscle building often, performance in endurance sports, and also just performance for the Typical person who's doing some cardiovascular training, hopefully, some resistance training also, and just living life. I mean, many more people now it seems are vegan or at least avoiding Meat, in particular, red meat. I'm not one of those people. Yep.[2:04:21] Andrew Huberman: I limit the amount, and I certainly focus on the quality of what I eat, but I do eat red meat. Which brings me to a question, about, you know, just generally in terms of food choice. You know, I can we Come up with a relatively short summary of the following. Tell me if this is, correct or not. That most of us Should be focused on for for sake of health, health span and lifespan, should be focused on ingesting minimally Nonprocessed and minimally processed foods, you know, maybe even cooking our own food.[2:04:57] Andrew Huberman: You know, I realize that's heresy now, but, ideally, we do some of that and and really trying to avoid Foods that, are highly processed and have lots of sugar, and I'm using this as a segue to get into a question that I really want your answer to. I've been Dying to ask you this, which is if, sugar intake is not actually going up, as much as people think it is, Why are people getting so much fatter? Right. So what what do you think about, just a general statement that we should try and eat Foods that are low to no minimally to not processed for about 80% of our foods. Is that a Yeah.[2:05:36] Andrew Huberman: Reasonable number?[2:05:37] Dr. Layne Norton: It's hard to actually get, know, completely unprocessed food because almost everything goes through some form of processing.[2:05:41] Andrew Huberman: So I'm thinking an like, anything that wouldn't survive long, on Without refrigerate yeah.[2:05:46] Dr. Layne Norton: On a[2:05:47] Andrew Huberman: shelf, like a like an apple or bananas. Like, oatmeal, like, ground oats to me, as long as there isn't a bunch of other stuff, and there would be minimally processed. Yeah. A stake is not really processed, although it's cut off the the animal, etcetera. So there's a there's a few steps in there.[2:06:00] Andrew Huberman: But Yeah. That sort of that's what I mean. Yep. Yep.[2:06:03] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. And I think everybody kinda gets the gist. I I'm probably a little bit pedantic when it comes to this stuff.[2:06:08] Andrew Huberman: No. This is good. Actually, one of the things I appreciate Appreciate about you is something I get teased a lot by, people close to me, which is the caveats and the the insistence on precision is really important because, Especially with online, communications these days, it's like a runaway train. You know? People will, You know,[2:06:27] Dr. Layne Norton: it's too easy to misinterpret what you're saying.[2:06:29] Andrew Huberman: Very easy to misinterpret, and the misinterpretations are often used to leverage whole new ideas about what is and isn't true, Mostly about what is true. So I really appreciate the nuance, and this is what a long form podcast really allows us to do is is catch every every curve.[2:06:44] Dr. Layne Norton: You know? So I would a 100% agree with what you said that if you were gonna make a broad stroke, that trying to focus on minimally processed foods is very important. The one caveat I would say is I think it's important to understand why. Because otherwise, people can make this weird association that, like, if I eat any minimally or any processed food, it's gonna kill me or, like, every time I eat it, it's like I'm smoking a cigarette. My health you know, my longevity is declining.[2:07:12] Dr. Layne Norton: Based on the studies we have, It's mostly about the energy that processed food just gets people to spontaneously eat more. And and, Kevin Hall showed this in his study that was very I mean, he designed some of the most elegant studies in nutrition.[2:07:30] Andrew Huberman: He's great.[2:07:31] Dr. Layne Norton: And They basically took people from a minimally processed food diet and then gave them access to ultra processed foods. Very few instructions. Just eat you feel satisfied, and they spontaneously increase their calorie intake by 500 calories a day. I mean, that's that's massive. So There's and we quite haven't quite figured it out.[2:07:52] Dr. Layne Norton: You know, people said, well, it's it's it's sugar. It doesn't appear to be sugar, in terms of just in isolation. Well, it's fats. Doesn't appear to be fats in isolation. Well, it's the combination of sugar and fat.[2:08:04] Dr. Layne Norton: Partly, well, it's the combination of sugar, fat, and salt. Partly, but there's some kind of, like, overall magic to the texture and the mouthfeel and just the overall palatability of stuff, in some of these documentaries where they're eating, like, plant based mac and cheese? You know? And again, I love a good mac and cheese, but, like, that should not form Like, that should not be pitched as a healthy diet just because it's plant based. Right?[2:08:34] Dr. Layne Norton: Because, I mean, you're eating a highly processed food that's very palatable and easy to overeat. Same thing for keto. You've now got, like, keto ice creams, and you've got, you know, keto cookies and all these sorts of things. And I'm like, yeah. If you look at them, they actually have more calories than the normal stuff.[2:08:50] Dr. Layne Norton: And I'm like, yeah. This is completely missing the point here. Like, you're actually just taking yourself. Like, the whole point of those diets is the reason you tend to lose weight is originally, like, good luck, you know, 10 years ago doing a keto diet, eating processed food. Right?[2:09:07] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, you just couldn't do it really. Now you can. But the problem is it's not gonna work because you're gonna be still consuming too many calories. Because even though it's keto, what are they doing? Well, they're trying to make it more palatable.[2:09:20] Dr. Layne Norton: They're trying to make a better mouthfeel, which I guess if you're being keto for the sake of being keto, great. But if there's if you have hopes of body composition modification, it's gonna, You know, really negatively impact. So, yes, I think minimizing the amount of processed food you consume can be important. Now that being said, it depends on the individual and their goals. If your goal is to, for example, build muscle or maintain a high body weight for a sport, for example, an NFL offensive lineman or or something of that nature or if you're you know, I I worked with an NBA team.[2:09:55] Dr. Layne Norton: They were kind of I can't disclose anything, but they were looking at drafting a certain player. And, you know, Like for them, processed foods may actually be a tool. Or teenagers. Right.[2:10:08] Andrew Huberman: You know, we all want young people to eat, more healthfully, I think, Develop great habits, but some of them, their caloric needs are so high[2:10:15] Dr. Layne Norton: So high.[2:10:16] Andrew Huberman: That if they were eating what I eat Yeah. They're going to, dissolve into Yeah. You know, they're just waste away.[2:10:21] Dr. Layne Norton: So I I I describe this again with a financial example. It's like a budget. Right? So if I make $1,000,000 a year, for example, Is it okay for me to buy, like, a $100,000 sports car? Let's assume that loans don't exist.[2:10:36] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? Is it okay for me to buy a $100,000 sports car if I still am able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilities and, like, take care of my responsibilities, the things I should do. Is it okay if I do that if it, like, makes me feel good and it's fun?[2:10:51] Andrew Huberman: Find me.[2:10:51] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. It's fine. Right? Like, it fits in your budget. If my if I have if I make, you know, $50 a year.[2:10:58] Dr. Layne Norton: Should I be going out and, you know, buying a sports car? Probably not because I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage and all these other responsibilities. So your Your protein, your fiber, your micronutrients, these are your responsibilities. But those become much easier to hit when you have higher calories. Right.[2:11:13] Dr. Layne Norton: So if you're if you're, you know, eating 4,000 calories a day for whatever goal you have, you're probably gonna have some leftover and, like, good luck Eating 4,000 calories from minimally processed foods, you quite frankly, you'll be miserable because you're you're gonna have such gut fill that you're gonna feel like you can't even move. And so, again, now it becomes, okay. Well, is there something inherent to that food processing? Is there something, you know, that we can pick out that we know, okay. Well, this is gonna be a negative effect on health even, like, body composition stuff aside.[2:11:48] Dr. Layne Norton: And I would say there's not really great evidence of that so far. And a a a great example of that is sugar. I mean, I I actually just wrote a really long Article on my website about why I think sugar was not the root cause of the obesity epidemic. And you kinda mentioned, like, sugar intake in the last 20 years has actually gone down a little bit.[2:12:07] Andrew Huberman: Alcohol intake, well, if you look on the whole, it might have gone up a little bit, but it you know, certain in certainly in the male sector, gone way down. Drinking used to be there was a 5 o'clock people drinking all day. Yeah. People are smoking a lot less. There I think it's a real puzzle.[2:12:24] Andrew Huberman: I'd love to know what your, hypothesis is.[2:12:27] Dr. Layne Norton: Be in opposition because nicotine is actually an appetite suppressant.[2:12:30] Andrew Huberman: Suppressant also Crisis focus. The problem is it often arrives in a delivery device that can kill you. Yep. But nicotine itself is a powerful agent. It also can offset Age related cognitive decline.[2:12:42] Andrew Huberman: Not entirely, but it's it makes the brain work better.[2:12:46] Dr. Layne Norton: I've got a buddy who, doesn't like caffeine, And he just takes those nicotine pouches and, like, basically has 1 in almost all day because he's a, like, a he has a very stressful job and is a high performer. You know?[2:12:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You have to be careful how you deliver it, but There's a Nobel Prize winning neuroscientist that, will chew 5 or 6 pieces of Nicorette an hour, which I do not recommend. And but when he quit smoking, he just simply couldn't function as well, and he was the one who pointed me to the literature on offsetting age related cognitive decline,[2:13:15] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah.[2:13:15] Andrew Huberman: The neuron maintenance and, it's pretty interesting.[2:13:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, it's a pretty it's a pretty impressive nootropic[2:13:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[2:13:20] Dr. Layne Norton: To be honest. So Now the first thing to realize is when we're talking about consumption data, this is based on actual production, Basically, they're assuming that, okay, we're producing this amount of these foods so we can assume the consumption is gonna follow that. So it's not a direct measurement, but it has been validated in a few different studies. We know that oil consumption has gone up. Like, that that's that's that's, yeah, that's one of the the big ones is and this kind of forms the crux of, like, the the seed oils are Yeah.[2:13:50] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, the root of It's[2:13:51] Andrew Huberman: definitely a question that I'm gonna They're they're[2:13:53] Dr. Layne Norton: gonna, you know, Come into your house and kick your dog and, you know, punch your mom and all kinds of stuff, and I'm happy to address those. But So calories have still gone up. There's there's some people who claim that they've gone they've kinda plateaued. I think the data seems to suggest that calorie intake is still increasing. And the other thing to keep in mind is even if it's plateaued, It's still a high enough level that obesity is probably gonna continue to increase up to a point where it'll probably plateau if calories are plateaued.[2:14:26] Andrew Huberman: What about energy output? Leaving aside neat because that sounds highly individual. I mean, people are the people we know are focusing on exercise. There are a lot of folks out there that don't exercise.[2:14:37] Dr. Layne Norton: And and and energy output has gone down over the years. I mean, and and it's very obvious when you look at how people work now compared to even, know, 30, 40 years ago, it's it's much different,[2:14:47] Andrew Huberman: less now. Also, I learned recently that, kids in high school don't take PE class in many schools. It's been We had to suit up and run and suit up. And if you didn't bring your change of clothes or you didn't wash them, in which case, you'd be better off just not wearing them. Nothing like the smell of a boys' locker room after a weekend.[2:15:05] Andrew Huberman: You know? I can still remember it, and it's not, it's not pleasant. But you had to run and do your push ups with everybody else or play volleyball in your in your regular school day clothes. So that I'm I'm my understanding is that Physical education is not part of the basic education any longer.[2:15:23] Dr. Layne Norton: It probably depends on the state, but I I know many states have done away with it just because of budget cuts. So activity is going down. Caloric intake is[2:15:27] Andrew Huberman: is going down. Caloric intake is going up. Maybe[2:15:30] Dr. Layne Norton: Plateauing a little bit.[2:15:31] Andrew Huberman: Plateauing. Is that sufficient to explain the obesity epidemic?[2:15:35] Dr. Layne Norton: Based on what I've seen, I I I think it's pretty sufficient.[2:15:38] Andrew Huberman: So it might not be that big of a mystery after all.[2:15:40] Dr. Layne Norton: No. I don't think it's a big mystery. I I think that People don't like the concept of energy balance, and I I think because they insert judgment into it, which is, Okay. If you're gaining weight over time, at a fundamental level, it means you are eating you're consuming more energy than you're expending. People insert the judgment which is you're lazy.[2:16:07] Dr. Layne Norton: You're a sloth. You're you're whatever it is. And I think there's a lot of people out there who actually think that. I I actually remember talking to somebody who was, like, well, I would never hire an obese person for a job because it's just obvious that they're lazy. And I just remembered going, are you serious?[2:16:22] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, there are plenty of very, very smart high achieving people who are obese. Like, it's not this is what happens when you just put people in buckets. You know? Like, people are much more complicated than this. Yes.[2:16:35] Dr. Layne Norton: There is there is some in personal responsibility. But then when you look through the data and you, like, take, there was a study done in obese women Where they found that women who are obese were 50% more likely to have had some form of sexual assault trauma in their past. Right? We know that people from lower income areas are more prone to be obese. There's several, like, People who have a higher ACE score, I believe, which is kind of measures like traumatic childhood events, I believe there there was a study showing they're more likely to be obese.[2:17:06] Dr. Layne Norton: So there's, Yes. It is an energy imbalance problem. But, you know, just saying eat less, move more, That's like telling broke people, well, just earn more money than you spend. It's technically right, but it's very unhelpful. Right?[2:17:25] Dr. Layne Norton: What is more helpful is to describe and implement the habits and behaviors that will allow them to achieve that. Right? So kinda I realized we kinda got off track a little bit, but circling back to, like, sugar. Circa 2005, I believe that sugar was fattening and bad for your health independent of any other variable. So independent risk factor.[2:17:49] Dr. Layne Norton: And again, I wanna be very clear about what independent means. Independent means independent of all of the variables. This thing is bad for your health and, body composition.[2:18:01] Andrew Huberman: So on its own, independent of whether or not, for instance, it increases hunger and appetite.[2:18:06] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. Or or caloric intake. Right? I was in a graduate school mixer, and one of the professors there was somebody who had done Research on high fructose corn syrup and fructose specifically as well. And he was talking to another professor, and He had done this study in, rodents where he'd fed, like, I think it was, like, 60 or 70% of their calories from fructose.[2:18:38] Dr. Layne Norton: It's pretty obvious that high fructose corn syrup is, you know, fattening. And this professor who had done this research said, yeah, because it's people he's, like, don't you think there's something inherent to it? And he said, no. I think it's just calories. People are eating too many calories.[2:18:53] Dr. Layne Norton: He's, like, we we did a proof of concept looking at, you know, could we, Like, try eating 70% of your daily calories from fructose. You actually can't do it. Like, high fructose corn syrup is only 55% fructose. So if you ate nothing but high fructose corn syrup, you would still not get to this level that they fed in this study. So that got me kind of, like, questioning my beliefs about it.[2:19:14] Dr. Layne Norton: So then I went through and I said, okay. Like, let's take out the epidemiology. Not that epidemiology is useless, but people who eat more sugar are also likely to eat more calories. So then I looked for the randomized controlled trials where they, you know, match calories and vary the amount of sugar, And it doesn't seem to make a difference, at least from fat loss or fat gain.[2:19:36] Andrew Huberman: But what about health? So for instance, if somebody, and I know somebody like this who Loves sweets Mhmm. Is thin. Mhmm. Get some exercise, not a ton.[2:19:47] Andrew Huberman: But my concern is that significant fraction of their calories are coming from these sugary foods, and therefore, they're not getting enough fiber[2:19:55] Dr. Layne Norton: Right.[2:19:56] Andrew Huberman: Maybe protein, etcetera.[2:19:57] Dr. Layne Norton: So Let's look at epidemiology for a second, then I'll address this more directly. When we look at epidemiology, people who eat higher amounts of sugar Tend to be, you know, more obese. They tend to have, you know, worse biomarkers of health. But people who eat fruit, a lot of fruit sugar Don't have those same associations. So why is that?[2:20:19] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, because fruit has fiber with it. Right? So I started to kind of Believe, based on the data I was looking at, that high sugar intake was not the problem per se. Problem was that high sugary foods typically are very low in fiber. But if you're getting enough fiber, is sugar a problem?[2:20:42] Dr. Layne Norton: There was a classic study, by Serwitt in 1997. I think it's still the best study to this day looking at this. And I know those people say, well, it was done 1997. It has no relevance. You know, I know.[2:20:51] Dr. Layne Norton: If it's a good study, it's a good study.[2:20:53] Andrew Huberman: No. Some studies are timeless. In fact, they have greater amounts.[2:20:56] Dr. Layne Norton: Go back and undo the discovery of DNA because it was, you know, 60 years ago or whatever it No. So they they looked at an 1100 calorie diet, so low calorie diet. 1 group was eating over a 110 grams of sugar a day, like sucrose. The other group was eating about 10 grams of sugar per day. Calories, protein, carbs, fats all matched.[2:21:18] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? And they provided all the meals to these participants. So very tightly controlled, and it was over 6 weeks. Both groups lost the exact same amount of body fat. So it doesn't seem to matter for body composition in terms of, like, sugar per se.[2:21:31] Dr. Layne Norton: Then they also looked at some biomarkers of health, like blood lipids and, you know, blood sugar and some other things. Again, there was no real differences. The only difference was so all the biomarkers improved in both groups. The only real difference was a small difference in LDL. The group eating low sugar had a better improvement slightly in LDL, but that's probably because they were eating more fiber.[2:21:55] Dr. Layne Norton: And we know fiber can, you know, bind to cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol. So is now I wanna I wanna caveat this. Sugar probably doesn't have any, like, positive health effects. So there's that. Right?[2:22:09] Dr. Layne Norton: And and nutrition is an exchange. If you're eating one thing, you're not eating another thing. Right? So I but what I would tell people is focus probably less on sugar, focus more on fiber. So if you're eating 30, 40, 50, 60 grams of fiber a day, but your sugar is, you know, Eighty, 90 grams.[2:22:32] Dr. Layne Norton: I I would not be that worried about it, especially if you're controlling calories as well. You know, what I would be worried about is if you're eating, you know, Just a decent amount of calories and not getting enough fiber in in general. Right? And even in studies, fructose and glucose and sucrose. Now why is this important?[2:22:58] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, again, you know, if you're not equate when I say isoeenergetic, that means equal in energy, equal in calories. So, basically, when they exchange either sucrose or glucose or fructose for other forms of carbohydrate, Do they see differences in these markers of health? Like HbA one c, fasting blood glucose, you know, blood lipids. And With rare exceptions, and I I can't remember all the data points exactly, but the the take home is Doesn't really seem to make a difference. Now before anybody out there, straw man's my argument, I am not advocating for sugar consumption, But I think it's important for people to not create weird associations in their minds because one of the things I've observed, especially in the fitness industry, Is when people feel like they can't eat something, like, it it's one thing if you say I am choosing not to eat this just because I'm choosing to.[2:23:54] Dr. Layne Norton: It's a very different thing when you're purposely restricting because you feel like something is bad. And this this I mean, you know, the human brain is In many ways, amazing. In many ways, really dumb. So when you purposely try to restrict something, what tends to happen is you're more prone to binge on it. So people who will try to, well, I'm never gonna eat, you know, sugar again or I'm gonna try and limit sugar.[2:24:19] Dr. Layne Norton: And this isn't the case for everybody, But they have actually shown now in studies, people who are purposely restricting a specific nutrient, They tend to crave more of that nutrient. And if they do get exposed to it, they're more likely to have what's called a disinhibition reflex, which is basically a a binge response. Because the thinking goes, well, this is bad. Any and there's no context on, you know, dosage making the poison. This is just bad in general.[2:24:48] Dr. Layne Norton: So if I have it, I've already screwed up. I might as well just have as much as I want. And I like, Spencer Nadolski's comparison to this is, you know, That's like, you know, getting a flat and then going out and slashing your other 3 tires because, you know, you might as well. So I I really I try to come from that perspective of And And so that's why I'm so pedantic and a stickler about saying, okay. Yes.[2:25:20] Dr. Layne Norton: It's a good idea to eat the minimally processed food and try to avoid processed foods, But not because processed foods are bad per se, but what the outcome tends to be from a lot of processed food[2:25:44] Andrew Huberman: potential for a positive, negative, or neutral behavioral change and perceptual change of, like, craving a food all the time that you can't have is is Terrible. That's a terrible state to be in. And, this, I think, is a perfect segue for something that first brought us together, Which was, you know, which was this this thing about artificial sweeteners. And let me just, for the record, be very clear. I have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners.[2:26:15] Andrew Huberman: So I throughout Graduate school, I didn't have the best habits. They're healthier now than they were back then, but I would drink, you know, a diet Coke or 2 per day. I still have the occasional diet Coke. I'm not completely, Completely, averse to, to drink something that has artificial sweetener. Although I do avoid sucralose for reasons that Maybe I can, get into a little bit later.[2:26:38] Andrew Huberman: But a lot of the things I consume contain stevia, which is Not artificial plant, but it is a plant based non caloric sweetener low caloric sweetener, and I don't have a problem with that. I became very interested in artificial sweeteners because of the animal data, pointing to the idea that They may disrupt the gut microbiome. And then disrupt the gut microbiome, as you pointed out, is a very broad statement. We don't really know the percentage of lactobacillus, bacillus or whatever bacilli whatever cilis, ileus in there, they all seem to end in ileus, is ideal. And in fact, lot of these companies that are having people send in their, stool samples for analysis of the microbiome I mean, take note.[2:27:20] Andrew Huberman: We don't really know what a healthy microbiome looks like, But we know what an unhealthy microbiome might look like, and it's one that doesn't have a lot of diversity in there. So I was interested in that. Then There's the recent human study, which I we should definitely get into, but I was mostly interested in artificial sweeteners for the Reason that there is this, food conditioning effect, and you see it in animals and you see it in humans that if you ingest, well, coffee is a really good example. Coffee doesn't actually taste good, folks, even though I like it. But when you taste coffee for the 1st time, most people think it's bitter and disgusting.[2:27:54] Andrew Huberman: Most everybody, like 95% of people say this doesn't taste good.[2:27:57] Dr. Layne Norton: Wine, beer, same thing.[2:27:59] Andrew Huberman: Yep. But people learn to associate the state of being caffeinated, which Most people like in order to just feel normal. Right? Caffeine's one of the few drugs we ingest just to feel ourselves Enough that soon, myself included, really look forward to and enjoy a cup of coffee. It's a so it's a powerful example, In my opinion of the food conditioning effect so it's like a Pavlovian thing.[2:28:21] Andrew Huberman: Instead of salivating, you crave. Right? Right. Right. And it did seem That this study from Dana Small's lab, which admittedly was a small, no pun intended study itself, not very many subjects, showed that if you ingest artificial sweeteners along with food that contained glucose that you could sort of maybe even get a heightened glucose response just from the artificial sweeteners after a while.[2:28:43] Andrew Huberman: You and I, connected over this study on social media. You pointed out that the that this design of the study wasn't superb. There was, there was co co co consumption of glucose, which made Complicated. We can go into that, but the reason I'm spouting off all this context is artificial sweeteners are many things. So I'd like to talk about their effects on blood sugar In the acute sense and according to what we might ingest them with, what and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation at the level of brain and or body.[2:29:11] Andrew Huberman: And then the gut microbiome data, I think, are interesting enough to discuss, and I have changed my view on artificial sweeteners based on what you've taught me. So this is a case where I've completely changed my view, which is that, now I don't I don't have any problem with them whatsoever based on the current data, which is not to say that I'm, you know, gulping down a cupfuls of sucralose. But I feel okay ingesting some stevia and some aspartame, and I'm not too worried about it.[2:29:42] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep. So I I think kinda stepping back from a broad view, We have to think about, again, the hierarchy of importance. Right? And what are you replacing with? Right?[2:29:56] Dr. Layne Norton: So There is no situation where it is not a net positive to take somebody who drinks sugar sweetened beverages and have them drink an artificially sweetened beverage. Like, the the in the meta analysis, there was actually a recent network meta analysis looking at, like, at markers of adiposity, you know, HbA one c, a bunch of different health markers. And when you substitute, you know, We'll call it non nutritive sweeteners since stevia is not artificial. But so when you substitute n n s for the sugar sweetened beverages, You see improvements in a lot of different things. Okay?[2:30:32] Dr. Layne Norton: What was really interesting about this network meta analysis was they also looked at water substitution in place of sugar sweetened beverages. And the effect wasn't as powerful as and these are randomized controlled trials.[2:30:44] Andrew Huberman: So artificial sweetener containing beverages are more beneficial We're we're we're better for adiposity,[2:30:51] Dr. Layne Norton: for improving adiposity. And then in the health markers, it was kind of a wash. Water and Water and, non nutritive sweetener beverages performed similar, but they were better than sugar sweetened beverages, obviously. So they then based on a network meta analysis is kind of where you can, Compare 2 things that didn't get compared directly. So there's not many studies comparing NNS versus water directly.[2:31:21] Dr. Layne Norton: But if you have a common comparator, so if you compare a to b and b gets compared to c, you compare a to c based on how they interacted with b. I'm Butchering it a little bit, but that's kind of the crux of a network meta analysis. So they looked at, NNS versus water and found that, actually, NNS was slightly better for improving adiposity.[2:31:43] Andrew Huberman: NNS, of course, being non nutritive sweeteners.[2:31:46] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. Yep. So now, again, I'm if you like drinking water and you you don't wanna I'm I'm not trying to convince anybody to do that. What that seems to suggest is there is a little bit of an appetite suppressant effect from these artificial sweeteners or non nutritive sweeteners. Now this gets a little bit more complicated because if these were people's drinking sugar sweetened beverages, maybe they've already developed a sweet taste and try to go to water is too much of a jump for them, so going to having something like intermediate is a little bit better.[2:32:14] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, there's a lot wrapped up in this. But these are the randomized controlled trials which are a little bit more tightly controlled, which I I tend to default to a little bit more than I do the epidemiology, which epidemiology is just so messy because sure, you know, Non nutritive sweetener consumption may be associated with different things, but there's also a whole another set of lifestyle and habits that are tied up in that. So I tend to hang my hand a little bit more on the randomized control trials. So understanding that okay. Now All things being equal, understanding that this is a tool that may help some people.[2:32:49] Dr. Layne Norton: And whenever I post about non nutritive sweeteners in the comments, There's always 1 or 2 or 3 people who say, all I did was cut out soda, and I drink diet soda instead, and I lost £50 or I lost £75. I even had 1 per se. I lost a £100. That's the only thing I did. Wow.[2:33:05] Dr. Layne Norton: I mean, that's a pretty massive lever to pull. If you consider somebody who might be having, like, I mean, 5 or 6 Cokes a day, I mean, that's you know, we're talking a serious amount of calories.[2:33:15] Andrew Huberman: And that also means that by replacing with artificial sweetener containing beverages, They did not replace the soda with food.[2:33:23] Dr. Layne Norton: Correct. So, like, let's now let's talk about, Right. This is where we can get into the microanalysis, but is that obese person who lost a 100 pounds by doing that, Do I really care about maybe a small alteration to their begotten microbiome? No. Because their gut microbiome is actually much more healthy now by them having lost all that Excess adipose tissue.[2:33:45] Dr. Layne Norton: So again, the ranking of what I'm worried about, you know, can change depending on the specific situation. Now let's take somebody like me who's lean, and doesn't really have, you know, any health problems that I'm aware of. What about artificial sweeteners for me? Well, for me, I kind of got using them because of bodybuilding contest prep But do I think that they are healthful? Probably not.[2:34:22] Dr. Layne Norton: Do I think they're unhealthy? I would say based on the current data, I don't think that they're unhealthy. Now the information on blood glucose. So there there's some of the problems with some of these meta analyses or these These reviews is they kinda lump all the non nutritive sweeteners together, and then they may say, well, there's no effect on this, so there's an effect on this. The problem is is these probably are these are different molecules, and they can interact differently.[2:34:50] Dr. Layne Norton: Aspartame very clearly seems to have no effect on blood sugar or insulin. That has been repeatedly shown. Stevia doesn't appear to have much effect. Saccharin and sucralose, the the jury is kinda mixed. Now there was the study that we first connected on, which, I think their primary outcome measure was actually they were looking at, like, kind of the sweet taste, like how it affected sweet taste.[2:35:17] Dr. Layne Norton: So what they did was the group that was getting the sucralose was also paired with maltodextrin. The control group Was getting sucrose, which the is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste because maltodextrin is not as sweet as sucrose. So when you're trying to combine, you know, sucralose, which is already sweet, with another form of carbohydrate, you'd want something less sweet compared to your control. But For the outcome measure of, insulin and blood glucose, probably not as appropriate[2:36:01] Andrew Huberman: For taste, but not for the effect of the the sweeteners, and I think that that was a a key component. And I think, yeah, the the part of that study that intrigued me, actually was, in a talk version of that because that study drove me to watch a talk that and we'll get Dana Small on on the podcast at some point, hopefully, was that they had they had kids do this study, and they actually had to cease the study because a couple of the kids became prediabetic. I mean, it seemed like there was something hazardous about This is at Yale School of Medicine's a good place. I mean, you know, every you know, there's, a range everywhere, but, it just seemed like there's something about Sweet tastes that if taken to the extreme might be able to impact blood sugar to, this has impacted my sort of Behavior in the I try to I try to avoid really sweet things[2:36:52] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[2:36:52] Andrew Huberman: Unless they're exceptionally delicious or the occasion calls for them. Because I do think that it increases my craving for sweet things.[2:36:59] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, it might not be necessarily a craving, but it just programs you so so Let's your taste buds are extremely adaptable. So take for example, like Indian food. If you Bring, like, Indian people over to America and have them eat some of our food. They think it tastes extremely bland because they are used to such Spicy food. The unless they have a certain level of spice, they they hardly even taste it.[2:37:25] Dr. Layne Norton: If you ever done a high sodium diet and then gone to a low sodium diet, It it feels very bland.[2:37:32] Andrew Huberman: That's a styrofoam.[2:37:33] Dr. Layne Norton: But your your over time, your taste buds adjust. So sweet is the same thing. If you're used to eating a lot of sweet, you get kinda desensitized to it, and then if you go to something less sweet, it can kind of, taste bland at first. Over time, it'll get better. But so I think it's one of those things that, again, it depends on the situation.[2:37:55] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? Like, if somebody's obese and they said, well, this is gonna help me, you know, eliminate sugar sweetened beverage. Like, why would you wanna take that tool away from them? Like, that's a a great lever to pull. I mean, if somebody can lose Literally, a £100 from just one change in lifestyle that's not even really that inconvenient of a change.[2:38:13] Dr. Layne Norton: That's that is powerful. But, again, is it the most healthy thing they could do? And I think that's kind of, like, what tends to get asked. We don't know. It it it is it healthier than water?[2:38:27] Dr. Layne Norton: Probably not. Maybe as healthy as it. Who knows? Now the but I I really make all those caveats because you don't want to have people who Could use this as a tool. Think, well, no.[2:38:43] Dr. Layne Norton: I can't do this because it's actually bad for me. Right. If it helps you lose £50 or £75 or whatever it is, Trust me. It's not bad for you. Right?[2:38:52] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, it does[2:38:52] Andrew Huberman: seem to increase these satiety signals. What do you think about the microbiome effects in this recent study? Because the recent study, I think, had some nice features to it. Yeah. And you've done a detailed description of the study.[2:39:04] Andrew Huberman: So for those that want[2:39:05] Dr. Layne Norton: that Is this 2 week study or[2:39:06] Andrew Huberman: the 2 week study? Yeah. And we we will provide a link. You did an excellent video on this on your YouTube channel that really parses each piece, but They compared the various artificial sweeteners, and looked at the glucose response, looked at microbiome, a number of different measures. What was your general And this was in humans for the for, I think, the first time looking at microbiome in humans due to artificial sweetener There's[2:39:29] Dr. Layne Norton: a there's there are a few studies, on the microbiome in humans with artificial sweeteners, the first 2 that came out showed pretty much no effect, but they were a little bit shorter in duration. They were, like, 2 to 4 weeks. And again, it depends on, like, what what bacteria are getting measured. Right? Like, there's, you know, many different kinds of bacteria, so They could just be measuring one that didn't change.[2:39:49] Dr. Layne Norton: And then there was a 10 week study that came out that that got a lot of press, and they showed I think it was sucralose, I think. They showed an effect, of change on the gut microbiome. Now What was interesting is when I went into the species that changed, the the species that changed the most compared to control Was a species called, I'm gonna butcher the name, but looks like, Cloudiacoccoides, I think it's called.[2:40:17] Andrew Huberman: I must say for those that work On the microbiome, the it's it's so difficult to pronounce that you need a nomenclature committee, and you need acronyms. I'm sorry. Just do it. Enough enough already. You're killing us.[2:40:29] Dr. Layne Norton: We'll call it BC. We'll call it BC.[2:40:31] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. We're gonna start the nomenclature committee without you if you don't do it soon.[2:40:36] Dr. Layne Norton: So they they noticed that this went up by, like, 3 to fourfold. So I I kind of went down the rabbit hole on this. So interestingly, That particular species of bacteria is actually associated with lower adiposity, better insulin sensitivity, and people who are Obese and children who are obese tend to have less of it. So I said, well, based on that study, you could actually argue that maybe sucralose actually improved the gut microbiome. Again, I'm not making that claim because, you know, we have a hard time understanding what a healthy microbiome looks like already.[2:41:09] Dr. Layne Norton: What this last study that came out, my my biggest take home was I think it's safe to say that some of these nonnutritive sweeteners are not metabolically inert. The there there are some effects. Now are those effects good, bad, or neutral? I think has yet to be fully elucidated. Now the the I focused more on the blood glucose responses in my analysis.[2:41:35] Dr. Layne Norton: So in that 10 week study, they looked at, they did oral glucose tolerance tests. And their conclusion, I didn't really feel like fit their data. So the conclusion was that and I, again, I think it was sucralose, that it Elevated, blood glucose, and this is where statistics can get kinda tricky. So My take home was the area under the curve, the incremental area under the curve, which is looking at the basically, the entire glucose response Was not different between the control and the sucralose group. To me, that's the biggest take home.[2:42:14] Dr. Layne Norton: There was one time point at the end of the study the sucralose group, the 30 minute time point that was statistically significantly higher blood glucose than the control group. It's kind of one of those things where I go, okay. It was the one time point. It's statistically significant, But even then, we've seen things be statistically significant that end up being data artifacts because they're not reproduced. So I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but, again, the overall Area under the curve was not different.[2:42:44] Dr. Layne Norton: So to me, that was the biggest take home.[2:42:46] Andrew Huberman: And papers, we should, probably mention, are published because of effects, Generally. Yeah. Lack of effect, harder to publish on[2:42:55] Dr. Layne Norton: a hypothesis. Doesn't it it's actually really unfortunate because a null hypothesis is Just as useful data as the the non null hypothesis, but you're right. There is a very strong publication bias towards, Showing an effect Right. Versus not.[2:43:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Unless you can flip a field on its head entirely by showing something did not happen, typically, the positive result outdoes the negative result in positive meaning you see a result. And then, of course, it's 1 study. And, you know Yes. And I think that as you talked about earlier, the center of mass of data in a given field are probably the best basis for what we should do Right.[2:43:35] Andrew Huberman: In terms of and so I'm not changing my behavior around the intake of Artificial sweeteners. I personally am still going to consume stevia and aspartame in relatively small amounts.[2:43:46] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep.[2:43:47] Andrew Huberman: But, Now I'm thinking, well, okay. If something contains sucralose, I don't have to perhaps actively avoid it. Whereas before I was, I was actively avoiding it.[2:43:56] Dr. Layne Norton: So the the the new study, I thought, was very elegantly very involved. I mean, be quite frank, some of the animal stuff they did was Extremely impressive. So there was actually 2 arms to the study. 1 was the human arm, 1 was the animal arm. I I focused much more on the human side of it.[2:44:14] Dr. Layne Norton: So, basically, this was a 2 week study and the really unique aspect of this, which I think is both a strength and a weakness. They had Almost 1400 people, apply for this study, and they only had a 120, I think, that actually went into it because they did a very detailed Food analysis of these folks. All these people said that they avoided artificial sweeteners or didn't consume them. And I think people don't realize how ubiquitous Sweeteners are.[2:44:43] Andrew Huberman: Prior to the study, these people were like it was like jury selection. They'd never Yes. It's like not ever hearing of the the plaintiff than the defendant. These Right. These are these mutant people who have never had an Refochelle sweetener.[2:44:54] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. So the strength is now you don't have a lot of, like, preexisting, you know, effects that may be clouding what would actually happen when you add it in? Like, for example, if you have people who are already consuming artificial sweeteners and then you have them Consume artificial sweeteners, the likelihood things are gonna change is pretty low.[2:45:13] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:45:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So I think that that's a strength. It's also a weakness, and I wanna be really careful because I think people took my words a little bit too far, which means I probably didn't do a good job of being nuanced enough. There is the possibility for a placebo effect here. So to me, if somebody has gone through that much painstaking care to avoid artificial sweeteners, it's likely they have a preconceived notion that those are bad for you.[2:45:40] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, to to because they're difficult to avoid. Yes. It's possible if they're eating a very minimally processed diet that they're just not exposed to them, and that's very true as well. But The other thing that the researchers acknowledged was they weren't able to blind the study. Because if you've never had an artificial sweetener before, you're only used to, Like regular sugar and you have an artificial sweetener, you know.[2:46:01] Dr. Layne Norton: You taste it. You you know. It's still sweet, but it's not the same sweet.[2:46:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And there's an interesting effect there where a lot of people Don't like the taste of aspartame the first time. Yep. I actually quit drinking diet soda for a while Thinking I should and then had 1, it tasted really I can only describe it as kind of artificial chemical. Yeah.[2:46:21] Andrew Huberman: And then pretty soon, tasted great again.[2:46:23] Dr. Layne Norton: Yep. And[2:46:23] Andrew Huberman: so there is some attenuation there. And whether or not that's central, meaning within the brain or peripheral, I don't know, but Very interesting. Well, I I see you as playing a critical role in defining what is and what isn't, What still needs to be determined, in terms of this landscape and and the entire landscape really of nutrition[2:46:44] Dr. Layne Norton: when And that study did change my opinion in terms of, Okay. I I think we can clearly say now that, like, these aren't these aren't neutral or sorry. That they're not inert. Right? Like, that that was the thought process before.[2:46:56] Dr. Layne Norton: It was, well, they're not digested or or whatnot, so they they must be inert. That doesn't appear to be the case. But again, like, when we look at the the blood glucose data, there's And I'm not saying this is what happened. I wanna be very clear. Not saying this is what happened.[2:47:14] Dr. Layne Norton: I'm saying it's possible this happened, And so this is why we need more studies to verify. If these people had a preconceived notion that artificial sweeteners were bad for them, it's possible Knowing they're ingesting artificial sweeteners that they could have had a a blood glucose response. Now the my pushback on my own point there would be we should have expected to see it in all the art in all the nonnutritious sweeteners, which they didn't. It was just in sucralose and saccharin.[2:47:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It was kind of effect where sucralose and saccharin showed the most dramatic change Yep. And Stevia And a few of the others did not.[2:47:51] Dr. Layne Norton: And the the other issue I took with it, maybe it's a ticky tack thing, was their primary outcome measure was, blood glucose, the oral glucose tolerance test. But they had people administer their own oral glucose tolerance test, which basically they give them they said, okay. Drink. Just drink. And they're wearing continuous glucose monitors, which should have been fine.[2:48:10] Dr. Layne Norton: But again, to me and I'm I'm being ticky tacky. And, Again, I know all studies are limited by funding. So, I think overall, this was a great study, but I would have liked to seen them, you know, monitor The the, oral glucose tolerance test Yeah.[2:48:28] Andrew Huberman: To administer it. Before or after. Right. You wanna know that they didn't ingest this or didn't ingest that.[2:48:32] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. Those those 2 things, but the other one of the caveat is it was a 2 week study. Right? So we gotta be really careful how much we interpret in this Because it's also possible that this is a transient effect. Right?[2:48:46] Dr. Layne Norton: And maybe it goes away over time. We don't know. But again, I think it's we can clearly say it's not inert. Right? Now How much emphasis we put on that on a 2 week study, I'm I still will say, okay.[2:49:04] Dr. Layne Norton: Maybe if you're worried, don't consume sucralose. Right? But if you're, you know, a 100 pounds overweight And you wanna use some sucralose as a replacement to help you lose weight, I would say don't let this study deter you from doing that Because the net effect is still gonna be more positive than you not losing the weight. Right? So if it's tool that helps you, fine.[2:49:28] Dr. Layne Norton: But I do hold open the idea that, well, there could be negative effects from it as well. But, again, we're we're looking at, like, what's the Mhmm. What is the overall outcome. Right? And then when I looked at, they examined, like, some of the, different things that were increased with these different, sweeteners.[2:49:46] Dr. Layne Norton: And again, this work gets messy because one of the things I saw was a big increase in butyrate production from the change in the gut microbiome, presumably. As we discussed earlier, butyrate's actually associated with, like, positive outcomes in terms of insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and some other things. So I just I wanna be real cautious before people say, well, there's a change in the microbiome. It must be a bad change. We don't know.[2:50:09] Dr. Layne Norton: It's possible. And again, if we have, you know, 10 more studies come out and start to show this, then I will start to shift my personal opinion of artificial sweeteners.[2:50:18] Andrew Huberman: So in anticipation of sitting down today, I did solicit, for questions on social media. And One of the questions that got a lot of upvotes, likes, if if you will, was it one that I Think raises interesting questions about short term and long term health, and it's the following. I think it's a common scenario. A number of people want to know What is the healthiest way to approach a kind of rapid weight loss? And here, what I think is happening is somebody has an event coming up or they're just tired of being, the weight they are or carrying the amount of adipose tissue they are.[2:50:58] Andrew Huberman: And they wanted to know whether or not It is safe to, for instance, lose £3 a week for a few weeks in anticipation of a wedding or some other event. And whether or not straight caloric restriction and increasing activity, is the best way to approach that, with the understanding that they may gain back a little Afterwards, they might may I think ideally, they'd like to maintain it afterwards. But what do you think of that sort of approach, You know, cutting caloric intake in half, for instance, and then doubling and also doubling your physical output.[2:51:33] Dr. Layne Norton: So it's interesting because the you might be surprised by what I'm gonna say, which is the research data actually tends to suggest that people who are, Like, obese who lose a lot more weight early are more likely to keep it off, which seems a little bit Kinda contradictory. Right? Like, well, that doesn't seem very sustainable. But, again, you're you're weighing competing things. So there's sustainability aspect, but then there's also, Like, buy in is huge for sustainability.[2:52:01] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So for a lot of overweight or obese people, if they start a diet and they don't see something quickly, they kinda bail on it because it's, you know, it's not working. Whereas if they see some rapid results pretty quickly, they buy in even harder. Right? And so I think the the conversation, especially for if there's any coaches or trainers out there, is just presenting that as The there you know, one of my favorite lines is there are no solutions.[2:52:28] Dr. Layne Norton: There's only trade offs. I think Thomas Sowell said that. So You're you're having a trade off here. It is yes. The you're gonna lose fat faster.[2:52:41] Dr. Layne Norton: You might lose lean mass a little bit faster too, which can be a problem. But I will say the more adipose tissue you have, the more aggressively you can diet without negative consequences. Somebody like me doing a really aggressive diet is not gonna be good for my lean mass. One, I have a higher lean mass than normal. 2, I have a lower body fat than normal.[2:53:03] Dr. Layne Norton: As your body fat goes down, the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up. So, people who are very obese because they have so much adipose tissue to pull from, there's very little reason for the body to Catabolize lean tissue. Now that being said, if you go on a people misinterpret, like, They're like, well, I got a InBody done and or a DXA done, and I've lost, you know, 2 pounds of lean mass, and they've, you know, they've lost £20 overall. Well, keep in mind, adipose tissue itself is 13% lean mass. So there's actually, like, you know, protein component to like, the structural component of the adipose tissue, And it does have some water.[2:53:45] Dr. Layne Norton: So it's about 87% lipid, but the other part is lean. So at minimum, you should expect a 13% reduction in lean mass when you diet. And then when you consider, like, you lose body water overall, which is Registers as lean mass, and you lose, your splanchnic tissues can shrink a little bit. So it's normal to lose You know, for the average person to lose, like, 25 or 30% of the weight that they lose from lean mass, but that doesn't mean skeletal muscle tissue. And again, the the more adipose you have, the more aggressively you can approach the diet without really negative long term consequences To lean mass your overall health.[2:54:26] Dr. Layne Norton: But balance that with okay. If I'm gonna do this, I need to understand that I'm not gonna be dieting this way forever. I'm doing this to give myself a boost to the beginning, and I have to be okay at some point with transitioning to something that's a little bit more sustainable.[2:54:42] Andrew Huberman: Based on what you just said, it reminds me of the, satiety signal effect of exercise you mentioned earlier, that exercising can improve Our sense of when we've had enough to eat. I just wanna briefly mention that when Ali Crum was on the podcast, She mentioned that they've been doing a study that I I I have to pair you 2 and have a hear the conversation as a fly on the wall because what she was telling me was that If people believe that a food is nutritious for them, then eating less of it, registers as more satiating. Whereas if people view dieting as a deprivation system[2:55:20] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[2:55:20] Andrew Huberman: You know, like, oh, you know, dieting is hard, and the food Sucks and it's terrible. Well, then they crave all sorts of other things, whereas they could they actually observe in their studies Where people report reduced craving if they are told, for instance, a chicken breast and broccoli and some olive oil and rice is actually quite nourishing. It's actually really good for you. Yeah. Then people eat that, and they feel like they've actually eaten more.[2:55:42] Andrew Huberman: The satiety signaling goes up. So it's just a just a point that Ali made that those aren't my data.[2:55:47] Dr. Layne Norton: Satiety is so Impressive because even the rate at which you eat and right down to the size of the plate and the color of the plate, like, the contrast in color. Really? They they seed I can't remember exactly. I think it's if the plate is a Similar color to the food, I I think people eat more. Whereas if it's a bigger contrast, they eat less.[2:56:13] Dr. Layne Norton: So even, like, plate color can make a difference on how much you eat. So, again, human brain, very amazing, but also very dumb in some ways. Right?[2:56:20] Andrew Huberman: Like Not an optimized algorithm[2:56:22] Dr. Layne Norton: I always I always joke with people. I'm like, just look at how stupid humans are. You put some water in front of them, like, you know, the ocean. They're like, oh, yeah. I'll pay 10 times more for this.[2:56:31] Dr. Layne Norton: You know, like but it's just we're kinda wired that way.[2:56:35] Andrew Huberman: The, the reward signaling pathways in the brain Run one chemical mainly, dopamine. There are others, of course, but and very few algorithms. It's sort of like a Intermittent reinforcement is 1 random reinforcement, but in the end, there aren't many algorithms. And we we are probably not optimized certainly not optimized for our own health because people will eat themselves The death, drug themselves to death, etcetera, simply because something felt good at one point.[2:57:02] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. It's[2:57:03] Andrew Huberman: it proves your point.[2:57:04] Dr. Layne Norton: One of one of the things I tell People, I I said this on, Andy Frasoli's podcast was interestingly, the dichotomy of life is If you do what's easy in the short term, your life will be hard. If you do what's hard in the short term, your life will get easier. It's very strange, and, actually, Ethan Suplee had a great example of this. When he was over £500, he said the amount of work I had to do to construct my life that I could just live was so much more work than just going to the gym for a couple hours a day. He's like, the gym work is hard.[2:57:41] Dr. Layne Norton: He's like, but when I look back, How much work I had to do to sustain that lifestyle versus just going to the gym and, like, you know, restricting calories. He's like, to maintain the lifestyle of being 500 pounds was infinitely more difficult than what I do now. And so, again, a great example. Short term hard, going to the gym, calorie restriction. Long term, Life's easier.[2:58:07] Dr. Layne Norton: Just really interesting dichotomy I think about a lot.[2:58:09] Andrew Huberman: And it can't be restated often enough. Seed oils. People wanna ask about seed oils. And for the and for and for those of you that are listening who are wondering why we're we're sort of, chuckling already, I should mention that Both in the Twittersphere and Instagram and online, the there's there are these very polarized views that probably aren't worth focusing on for too long, but there are a number of Folks out there who are arguing that seed oils are the source of all, you know, the obesity epidemic, all[2:58:40] Dr. Layne Norton: Everything.[2:58:41] Andrew Huberman: Inflammation, etcetera. Illuminating. Everything. And then there are those that would argue just the opposite, that, you know, meat is the source of all problems, etcetera. And I think we've Thanks to your nuance and and expertise.[2:58:54] Andrew Huberman: We've, hopefully, appropriately frame things that it's never that black and white. It's simply not. Really rarely. I love olive oil. I know I realized that doesn't fit exactly into the seed oil category.[2:59:07] Andrew Huberman: I love olive oil. I Use it in moderation. I do also consume some butter in moderation, etcetera. But are there any data on seed oils? Here, a good example, I think, would be, like, canola oil, which comes from the rape seed that literally was renamed canola oil because rape Seed oil is not good marketing.[2:59:27] Dr. Layne Norton: No. No. No. Exactly. So the first thing I'll say is Seed oils have have negatively contributed to our overall health because people in the last, you know, 20, 30 years, what they have tend to added To add into their diet that has increased the overall calorie load is oil, like, these various, mostly from seed oils.[2:59:54] Dr. Layne Norton: But when we look at, like, 1 to 1 replacement with other fats and so I if you look at the epidemiology, Yeah. You can find some epidemiology showing people who consume more Cetal have more negative health outcomes. Problem is, again, tied up with a multitude of other behaviors. And then you can find mechanisms, and the the idea is, well, these have, they're polyunsaturated, which means In the fatty acid chain, there's multiple double bonds, which those double bonds can be oxidized, when they're exposed to heat and some other things. And so the idea is, well, when you cook with these things and, you know, they get they get, ox they make it oxidized, and that's gonna cause inflammation in your body.[3:00:39] Dr. Layne Norton: So that's a a plausible mechanism. So as always, I defer to the human randomized controlled trials. And so what you tend to find is when you substitute polyunsaturated fats Or sorry. When you substitute saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats, it's either neutral or positive in terms of the effects on, like, Inflammation is basically neutral. There there's some studies that show a positive effect of doing, polyunsaturated fats, but it Probably depends on the individual polyunsaturated fat.[3:01:15] Dr. Layne Norton: And that's the other thing I I don't really is difficult because you're you're categorizing, like, everything in this 1 bucket, And there are some differences between individual fatty acids, even with saturated fat. Like, for example, stearic acid Doesn't tend to raise LDL cholesterol, whereas, you know, saturated fat as a whole tends to raise LDL cholesterol, but there are some saturated fats that don't. So again, it's it's like we're putting things in buckets, and it's a little more nuanced than that. Then if you look at, like, the effects of, no. Polyunsaturated fats on markers of cardiovascular disease, again, tends to either be a neutral or positive effect you substitute, saturated fat for polyunsaturated fat.[3:02:00] Dr. Layne Norton: Now if you wanna get into, like, monounsaturated versus polyunsaturated, there's Some there's quite a bit of disagreement between the studies. What I would say, based on the human randomized controlled trials, is that You're probably better off consuming monounsaturated and polyunsaturated in place of saturated fat. But again, if the idea is, well, That means polyunsaturated are good for me, so I'm just gonna dump a bunch of oil on everything, and now you're upping your calories. Well, that's that's that's a negative now. Because you have to deal with the bigger problem of overall energy toxicity.[3:02:33] Dr. Layne Norton: So I'm not somebody who likes to demonize individual nutrients. I just haven't seen really compelling evidence that seed oils are the root cause of the problems that are being suggested. And I think this is a good example of kind of, like, Whenever there's a something that pops up in the fitness industry, there's always like the opposite thing that pops up, and it's like the reactionary, you know, Extreme reaction to whatever this thing was over here. I think that's what we're seeing with some of the the seed oil stuff is it's It's mostly people who are trying to kind of expose the virtues of saturated fat. And Listen.[3:03:11] Dr. Layne Norton: I think it's fine to consume some saturated fat. But, again, you know, I think limiting it to, You know, 7 to 10% of your daily calorie intake is probably wise, again, based on the the all the Consensus of the evidence I've seen. And so once again, like, we're we're struggling with this. Okay. We've got this epidemiology and these mechanisms That sound good, but then what actually happens when we we do some human randomized controlled trials?[3:03:41] Dr. Layne Norton: And and so far, I just haven't seen The evidence to suggest that seed oils are independently bad for you, independent of the calories they contain.[3:03:53] Andrew Huberman: You said the words overall energy toxicity, and I just wanna highlight that I think that's a fabulous term. I don't, I don't think enough people think about that because they they are primed or we are all primed to think, okay. Seed oils might be bad or artificial sweeteners might be bad or this particular component of blood work might represent something good or bad without taking into account Overall energy toxicity of the toxicity of overconsuming calories, energy. And, thank you for Pointing out that most of the data point to the fact that saturated fat should make up about no more than 7 to 10% of total daily caloric intake. Is there a lower end threshold that can be problematic?[3:04:41] Andrew Huberman: For instance, I've noticed that my blood profiles, especially in terms of hormones, Improve when I'm getting sufficient saturated fat. Maybe I'm a mutant, but years ago, because I'm a product of growing up in the nineties, I tried a low fat diet. I it certainly crushed my androgen levels. I started adding some butter back in, and I was right back in the in the in the sweet zone, where I wanted to be. So, you know, 7 to 10% of total, daily caloric intake is, I'm guessing, is probably about what I do now.[3:05:09] Andrew Huberman: I'll have to check. But Is there a danger to going too low in saturated fats?[3:05:14] Dr. Layne Norton: So, again, no solutions, only trade offs. Right? What maximizes out testosterone Might not be the best thing for longevity, right, and and vice versa. Now I'm not I'm not making that claim specifically, but I think it's important to understand this that I think we all have this idea that there's this one Iconic diet out there that is going to be the best diet for building muscle and burning fat and, Preventing cancer and heart disease, and and the reality is, like, there's overall healthy dietary patterns that we see that are good for those things. But when we get down into the weeds, there's probably some push and pull here as well.[3:05:49] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So when it comes to saturated fat, There is some evidence that if you're too low on it, that, yes, you can have a reduction in testosterone. Now is that Reduction in testosterone, let's say 15, 20%, whatever it may be, is that sufficient to actually cause loss of lean mass? That we don't know. That's that's never been shown.[3:06:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Interestingly, I just remember this. There was one study that was comparing Polyunsaturated fat versus saturated fat, and they equated total fat. And one of the really interesting things was the group getting the polyunsaturated fat had more lean mass at the end of the study compared to the group getting saturated fat. So only 1 study I've never seen this replicated, so I I'm very this is a situation where I'd I say, I would like to find out what the mechanism of that is because this could just be random. But if that gets Shown over and over, what I might say is, okay.[3:06:55] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, what's the what do we if polyunsaturated are somehow increasing lean mass compared to saturated fat. Who cares what happens with testosterone? Unless that reduction in testosterone is causing some kind of impudent, impotence for your life. Right? So all that to say, I don't really know.[3:07:14] Dr. Layne Norton: And, by the way, that's something, for those Watching and listening. Real experts. Every once in a while, you should hear them say the following words, I don't know. Exactly.[3:07:23] Andrew Huberman: My graduate adviser was that, and she's and she was brilliant. Right, Harnell?[3:07:28] Dr. Layne Norton: And then in terms of, like, cholesterol synthesis, you really need a very, very small amount of saturated fat For LDL cholesterol synthesis, your your liver can synthesize. Like, the amount of LDL cholesterol or cholesterol that your body requires is So small in terms of, like, just living and being healthy. So I don't think you need to worry about that. And from a cardiovascular disease standpoint, There is some evidence that even taking people who have, like, quote, unquote, low low LDL of, like, you know, 80 or 90 and taking them down to, like, 30 or 40, that there is still A benefit for the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, again, you're you're weighing these these 2 buckets.[3:08:08] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So when I say, you know, if you're doing 7 to 10% from from From saturated fat, you're probably fine.[3:08:15] Andrew Huberman: Received a lot of questions about whether or not there are female specific Diet and exercise protocols. And I realize this is a vast landscape, but, some of those questions related to menopause and premenopause and some relate the menstrual cycle, most related to variations across the menstrual cycle. In terms of, Let's just say diet maintenance or sub caloric diet. Are there any Things that you've observed, we'll talk a little bit later about, the this wonderful app that you've produced, this Carbon app, which helps people, manage their energy intake and a number of other things. And so there you have a sort of a database or at least an experience base.[3:08:58] Andrew Huberman: And then I'm guessing there are probably also studies exploring male versus female differences in terms of adherence and what sorts of diets work. As it are there any general themes that one can extract From that[3:09:08] Dr. Layne Norton: It's gonna be a really unpopular segment for the women. Doesn't seem to make a big difference. Well, actually,[3:09:14] Andrew Huberman: they may be relieved to hear that.[3:09:15] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah.[3:09:16] Andrew Huberman: Because it would make sorting through the information space and, certainly, the information we've covered in this podcast up until now simpler. It means that everything isn't different for them.[3:09:24] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So If you look at the male versus female studies relation to diet, they seem to respond to some similar way. Like, similar calorie deficit, teams produce similar results. If you do low carb, high carb, Regardless, it seems to boil down to the same principles. Now training wise, we do know that female like, the muscle Fibras adapt a little bit differently to training, but it without getting too far into the weeds, it doesn't really change the way you should train Because for the most part, building muscle, there's a lot of different ways to build muscle.[3:10:01] Dr. Layne Norton: So we know that, Like, light loads up to maybe, like, 30 reps, as long as it's taken close to failure, have Basically, the same effect on building muscle, at least in the short term, as heavy loads for low reps. It's mostly about taking the muscle close to fatigue or failure. Right? You don't have to go you don't have to go to failure, but getting close within a few reps. If you're between 1 rep and 30 reps, If you're getting close to failure, seem to produce similar results.[3:10:33] Dr. Layne Norton: So, again, great. You can pick with whichever form of discomfort you you prefer. Right? When it comes to female specific training, again, females actually, this is one thing that a lot of people don't know. They actually put on a similar amount of lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass as men.[3:10:56] Dr. Layne Norton: In fact, there's no statistically significant difference in the amount of lean mass they put on. Now the absolute amount of lean mass that's added will be greater for men because they started with a greater amount of lean mass. But the relative increase in lean mass is pretty much the same from similar training. Now, females, there there's some differences in, like, fiber types. Females tend to be a little bit less fatigable than than men.[3:11:19] Dr. Layne Norton: They can they can Go a little bit harder, a little bit longer. And there's also some evidence that they recover a little bit better, but that also could be Simply due to the fact that they're not able to use as heavy of loads to in to induce hypertrophy. So I kinda had this theory that while, you know, as a percentage, you're 1 rep max, you can program things, I think absolute load matters. 8, £900.[3:11:55] Andrew Huberman: They need more coverage.[3:11:57] Dr. Layne Norton: I I think that there's an overall recovery effect there. Again, I have no data to back this up. This is just my my observation. But when you get into the lighter weight classes, and this goes for men too, you do see quite a few people who do, you know, many training sessions at high RPEs and seem to be able to recover from that. So I do think the absolute load makes a difference.[3:12:17] Dr. Layne Norton: Now when it comes to, like, menstrual cycle, This is one of those things where I kinda tell people, you know, do what you prefer. So there's some people who have said you should program. You should, like, Kind of schedule your training around your menstrual cycle which is, whenever you're going through your menstrual cycle, you know, reduce the intensity, reduce the volume Because you're, you know, you're not gonna feel as good. You're not gonna train as well. What I would say is just autoregulate that.[3:12:44] Dr. Layne Norton: If you go in and you're on your period, but you you feel good And you're doing well that day, then I don't think you necessarily need to back it off. And there there was 1 study that kind of supported that notion. But if you go and you feel terrible and, you know, you feel like you could use, you know, a a reduction in intensity and volume, then it's totally fine to autoregulate that. When I say auto regulation, I'm auto regulation means you are regulating the individual training session based on your performance. So, I autoregulate insofar as, like, I'm a I'm a super nerd, so I have a a velocity device.[3:13:21] Dr. Layne Norton: So I can actually attach to the bar and see how fast the load moves, and I know it various different, like, warm up weights, what velocities I should be hitting. So if I hit my last warm up and my velocity is about 10% higher than usual, I can be pretty confident that that's gonna be a good day for me. If it's lower, then I can back it off a little bit. In fact, at Worlds, when I hit my last deadlift, it was 30% my last my last deadlift warm up, It was 30% faster than I usually hit in the gym, and I turned to look to my coach, and I said, yeah. We're gonna get this today.[3:13:53] Dr. Layne Norton: Right. So there's the various forms of ways to auto regulate. But, again, Women, if you're on your period but you feel good, I don't think there's any reason you need to back off. But if you're not feeling good, then it's totally appropriate to back off.[3:14:05] Andrew Huberman: Raw versus cooked foods. People wanted to know, whether or not, for instance, you know, eating a raw apple verse I don't know. Does anyone cook apples? I guess you could people used to bake. They were baked apples was a dessert.[3:14:17] Andrew Huberman: When I was a kid, it was kind of the letdown dessert. Sorry, mom. It[3:14:20] Dr. Layne Norton: was kinda,[3:14:21] Andrew Huberman: like, not awesome unless it had a ice cream in it. And even then, may maybe not awesome. But, anyway, raw versus cooked. Obviously, if you burn a piece of meat To the point where it's pure charcoal, that's too much. And if you eat there is a small movement, surrounding eating raw meats.[3:14:38] Andrew Huberman: That's not something I particularly enjoy. Frankly, sushi is the only raw food I I personally ingest, and I'm very Same. I am very careful about the sourcing, frankly. Reputable places. Is there anything, you know, real about this in terms of being able to extract the amino acids, vitamins, and minerals from the food, raw versus cooked?[3:14:59] Dr. Layne Norton: It just looks cool for Instagram. So when you cook foods, they actually tend to become in terms of protein containing foods, they tend to become more digestible, Bless. Eggs are this way. Meat are this way. People say, well, you know, when you when you heat protein, you denature it.[3:15:17] Dr. Layne Norton: And I think they hear that word denature, and they think destroy. And that is not what denature means. So proteins fold up into three d dimensional structures. You know this, of course, based on their amino acid sequence and their specific energies of those amino acids. When you heat protein or add acid, It starts to unfold that, that protein structure.[3:15:41] Dr. Layne Norton: That happens during digestion anyway. So I always chuckle when, like, the like, I've seen some companies come out with way that you can cook with. Right? That that's not gonna, you know, destroy the amino acids. I'm like, so you mean, like, regular way.[3:15:53] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? So, yeah, cooking typically, cooking actually makes amino acids more bioavailable, not less. Now, I would stay away from charring your meat, because there is some evidence that charring creates, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, Which, at least in animals, when they give those, they appear to be carcinogenic. So if you do char your meat by accident, I would just cut off the charred portions, and then you should be fine. The chard is delicious.[3:16:24] Andrew Huberman: Not not if it's charred too much, but there is something about a charred crust on a meat. My dad's Argentina. I would like to go to the bar with you. What about, people refer to them in their questions as Carb blockers, but I think what they're referring to are things like Berberine and some of the glucose scavengers. And, 1 glucose scavenger I'd love for you to comment on is this assertion that Taking a brisk walk after a meal or maybe even a slow walk after a meal, some movement can help downshift the amount of circulating glucose in some way.[3:16:54] Andrew Huberman: I've heard that.[3:16:57] Dr. Layne Norton: Not a[3:16:57] Andrew Huberman: lot of people, but some are starting to pay attention to this idea of taking things like Berberine or even Metformin, can scavenge glucose. I personally can't take berbere. If I take it, I get massive headaches unless I've ingested tons of sugar and carbohydrates, I just don't mess around with it. But I I know there are a number of people out there that want to know whether or not these glucose scavengers can be useful.[3:17:20] Dr. Layne Norton: I think that is really majoring in the minors, if I'm being honest. As far as, like, the carb blockers, there's, like, some white kidney bean extract and those sorts of things. They can, they do block the digestion of carbohydrates some. So when I say block, that's Those watching or listening, metabolism is typically not on and off switches. Okay.[3:17:42] Dr. Layne Norton: So when we say things like block or attenuate Or inhibit. Typically, we're we're not talking about just a switch on the wall that you press it and everything turns off. We're talking about a dimmer switch. Okay. Or like, so you it just changes the emphasis.[3:17:57] Dr. Layne Norton: But these carb blockers can reduce the absorption of carbohydrate. Now They don't seem to cause weight loss when when you just do it a normal diet. Now why is that? Well, all it does Is once those carbohydrates get to the, large intestine and your bacteria get a hold of them, they start fermenting them 2 volatile fatty acids which get reabsorbed into your liver so you don't get the increase in blood glucose, but you still get almost all the calories from it. Because it's just in a different form.[3:18:25] Andrew Huberman: I see.[3:18:26] Dr. Layne Norton: So, you know, If carb blockers, if they actually worked really well I mean, if you block something from being absorbed, your GI typically does not Just let undigested material sit in there. You get diarrhea. I mean, that would be the outcome. It's also how I, like, debunk the whole, like, 30 of protein at a meal, you can't absorb any more than that. I'm like, if that was the case, like, when you ate a steak, like, you would just start Having diarrhea every time you went over that 30 gram threshold.[3:18:54] Andrew Huberman: Right? I remember during college, so this would be early nineties, there was the olestra craze.[3:18:58] Dr. Layne Norton: Oh, yeah.[3:18:59] Andrew Huberman: This idea of of putting in Nondigestible, thing into things like potato chips so that it would clear through, the The GI tract faster, not absorb as many calories. It does raise this went nowhere, obviously. You don't hear about this anymore, but it does raise Interesting question related to energy balance, which is gastric emptying time.[3:19:21] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[3:19:22] Andrew Huberman: And, obviously, in in the Landscape of eating disorders, in particular, anorexia, the abuse of lack use and abuse of, laxatives is a way in which people will, in an unhealthy way, I try and control their weight, and there's a lot of problems with that Oh, yeah. Approach. But, what about gastric emptying time? Is this one way that people could, control their energy balance in a healthy way? And, Where does fiber come into play?[3:19:52] Dr. Layne Norton: Fiber tends to improve GI transit time because it adds bulk. So, you know, your Your GI system is basically a tube, and it has peristalsis, which is wave like contractions that moves the food down to the tube. Well, if you have more bulk to the food like with fiber, you can move it through a little bit better. Now in the gastric, the stomach specifically, Fiber tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit, probably because it congeals a little bit. Now This kind of gets into, like, the glycemic index argument.[3:20:27] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? Like, if you do if you do, like, low GI foods, you'll have a slower release of glucose. It's a slower gastric emptying time. Does that affect energy balance? And so there are quite a few studies looking at, like, low GI versus high GI foods.[3:20:43] Dr. Layne Norton: In the studies where they don't control calories, low GI tends to outperform high GI. But when they control calories, there's no difference. And so what that tends to see well, I think that suggests is low GI foods just by their nature tend to be higher in fiber. And so I think it it just kinda comes back to the fiber issue.[3:21:00] Andrew Huberman: Got it. I'd like to ask you about supplements for a moment. Mhmm. It's an enormous landscape, but I believe there are a few things that you Believe in, meaning they exist, and and there are decent data to support their use. Maybe even some anecdotal data based on your own experience.[3:21:16] Andrew Huberman: We as long as we highlight it as such, it could be interesting. I've heard you talk about 2 in particular. One that I'm very familiar with, which is creatine monohydrate. You could Share your thoughts on that, not just for muscle building, but maybe any other purposes for it. And then the other one is one that, frankly, I'm learning more about all the time now, thanks To your prompt, which is ridolia rosea.[3:21:38] Dr. Layne Norton: Mhmm.[3:21:38] Andrew Huberman: I think I pronounced that correctly. And, and Why that might be interesting or of use to people?[3:21:45] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. So touching on creatine, it is the most Tested, safe, and effective sports supplement we have. I mean, it's just there are thousands of studies on creatine monohydrate now. And I I would I would say very clearly too, if you're using any other form of creatine, I think you're wasting your money. Creatine hydrochloride has some Hype around it.[3:22:09] Dr. Layne Norton: It's apparently, it's a little more soluble. The claim is that you need less, but there's only a couple studies on it, and and it's more expensive.[3:22:18] Andrew Huberman: And creatine monohydrate is not particularly expensive.[3:22:20] Dr. Layne Norton: No. I[3:22:21] Andrew Huberman: realize people have to bring budgets, but it's not it doesn't land in the It's budget breaker.[3:22:25] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. It's gotten more expensive because of COVID and supply chain issues. Even the there's forms of creatine that appear to be as good, like hydrochloride, But it's more expensive. And then things like creatine ethyl ester has been shown to be worse than creatine monohydrate. Buffered creatine is as good or worse, and it's much more expensive.[3:22:46] Dr. Layne Norton: So I tell people, just take creatine monohydrate. It is tried and true. It's been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100% with phosphocreatin, and that's what you want. So creatine, works through a few different methodologies. 1, through increasing phosphocreatine content, which helps improve exercise performance.[3:23:04] Dr. Layne Norton: It also appears to improve in cover It appears to improve recovery and it increases lean mass, a lot of which is through bringing water into the muscle cells, but that is I mean, muscle cells are mostly water. So when people say, well, it's just water, That's what muscle cells mostly are, and, it also increases strength and some other metrics. Now It also has been shown in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage. Now that's probably because they're getting an increase in lean mass, and so the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage. But there are a few studies that show a decrease in fat mass as well.[3:23:44] Dr. Layne Norton: I don't think that creatine's a fat burner. I think that people are able to train harder, Build more lean tissue, and so that's probably having an effect on fat mass. Then they've actually shown more recently some cognitive benefits to creatine, which I find really interesting as well. But the only knock on creatine that anybody's been able to come up with because they've they've debunked the kidney stuff. They've debunked the liver stuff.[3:24:04] Dr. Layne Norton: They it there's no evidence that it harms healthy kidney kidney or liver, is hair loss. So what about hair loss? Because there was 1 study in 2009 that showed that creatine increased DHT, But they didn't really show an effect on any other sex hormone, so it's kind of strange. Like, you would think if there was an increase in DHT, there would be, like, something else that changes as well. And it's only 1 study And, again, didn't directly measure hair loss, measured DHT, which we know is involved in the loss of the follicle the follicle.[3:24:40] Dr. Layne Norton: So what I would say is that I am not convinced. It's only 1 study, never been replicated to my knowledge, and it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome. So, if you if you're somebody who's prone to hair loss and you wanna avoid creatine because of that, I understand. But for most people, I I don't think it's a I don't think it's something to worry about.[3:24:58] Andrew Huberman: Do you emphasize the classic loading of creatine, taking it a bunch of times per day and then backing off or just taking it consistently at the I think 5 grams per day is kind of the typical, dose that people take.[3:25:10] Dr. Layne Norton: So, again, no solutions. Only trade offs. You can load it, and you will saturate your phosphocritin phosphocritin stores faster, like, usually within a week. If you just take 5 grams per day, it'll take 2, 3, 4 weeks, but you will get to the same place, and you're Probably gonna have a much lower risk of GI issues. Some people creatine can be a gut irritant.[3:25:36] Dr. Layne Norton: If it is for some folks, I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses. So maybe, like, multiple 2 1 or 2 gram doses per day, And definitely don't load it if you're somebody who has GI issues from it. As far as, royal rosea, The research is still in its infancy. I was just reading a a new systematic review that kinda concluded that we need more high quality research. But the research that is out there Seems to suggest that not only does it reduce physical fatigue, but also reduces the perception of fatigue And may also enhance memory and cognition as well.[3:26:14] Dr. Layne Norton: And it's referred to as an adaptogen. So I I really like it. My anecdotal experience is when I combine that with caffeine, It tends to kind of smooth out the effects of caffeine. It's a more pleasant experience. And there's also some evidence that if you're, like, coming off caffeine, that it can reduce the, the negative side effects to caffeine withdrawal, which, by the way, I I didn't really believe in that until I actually did a cold turkey.[3:26:43] Dr. Layne Norton: So before I meet, I will cut out caffeine for 7 days because you can basically reset your caffeine tolerance in 7 days. And, like, 2 days in, I mean, I'm groggy. I've got the headaches. Usually, I'll get, like, body aches that come up because caffeine is actually a mild analgesic. And yeah.[3:27:00] Dr. Layne Norton: So it was very interesting to see but I slept like a baby. I'll tell you that. I slept like a baby.[3:27:04] Andrew Huberman: Caffeine prior to to your events.[3:27:06] Dr. Layne Norton: To to the meat. Yeah.[3:27:07] Andrew Huberman: So you really want the maximum punch from it.[3:27:09] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah.[3:27:09] Andrew Huberman: That's why you do that.[3:27:10] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. And like I said, rhodiola tends to It doesn't eliminate those those negative effects, but they tend to it tends to dampen them a little bit. So I really like it. Again, would like to see more research on it, but there's a lot more stuff coming out. Ashwagandha is another thing that looks pretty promising, seems to increase testosterone modestly.[3:27:30] Dr. Layne Norton: Interesting. I don't think it's Like, they've shown increases in lean mass. I don't think the increase in testosterone, explains the increase in lean mass. It's just not a big enough increase.[3:27:40] Andrew Huberman: Could it be the decrease in cortisol? People have talked about[3:27:43] Dr. Layne Norton: Possible. It does decrease, stress stress hormones. It also has been shown to help with sleep. But I would like to see more research looking at mechanistically how it's increasingly mass before I kind of say conclusively that this is, you know, the next creatine. There's more research that needs to come out, and then there's some other things that that have an effect.[3:28:03] Dr. Layne Norton: You know, Citrulline Malate, there's there was a new meta analysis that Showed that citrulline malate can reduce fatigue and, increase, I think time to fatigue. And it may actually have some small recovery benefits as well. Different forms of carnany carnitine can actually have recovery benefits and actually interesting. I think it's carnitine tartrate Actually, it's been shown, Volok published a study that actually showed that increased androgen receptor density in muscle cells.[3:28:30] Andrew Huberman: That's interesting. Now L Carnitine and its other forms that are Pretty I think there's good evidence that they can improve, sperm and egg health for people who are looking to conceive.[3:28:38] Dr. Layne Norton: Interesting.[3:28:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There are, surprising number of studies on this in in humans. But, yeah, androgen receptor density, and that that's from oral L Carnitine. People are taking capsules, not injecting directly into a muscle. Yeah.[3:28:52] Dr. Layne Norton: And then you've got things like, obviously, like, the other most effective supplement out there is probably caffeine. I mean, like, if you look at the research studies, caffeine produces very consistently improvements in performance. So that's another one. Some people don't like the effect of caffeine. That's okay.[3:29:07] Dr. Layne Norton: But[3:29:07] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't know because I'd never come off it.[3:29:10] Dr. Layne Norton: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Well, interestingly, they they do show that the effect appears to be consistent That that even if you're a habitual caffeine user, you do still get a benefit every time you take it. But like you said, you're just used to it.[3:29:24] Dr. Layne Norton: You know? So, you know, there's those things you then you've got, like, things like, beta alanine, which for it's in our it's in our pre workout. Probably not super helpful for, most people for resistance training. It does seem to have some, benefits for, Like, high intensity. Like, if you get out, you know, more than, like, 45 seconds or 60 seconds of, like, really hard training, it does appear to help with delaying fatigue for that.[3:29:55] Dr. Layne Norton: And then you've got things like betaine, or also called trimethylglycine, which there's some evidence it can improve lean mass. There's some evidence that it can improve power output. So there's a few things out there, but, you know, Most of the stuff is not very good. So, you know, I think that that's you know, those kinds of supplements, you know, very useful. But, again, I would never tell people they need supplements.[3:30:22] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, again, even like something like creatine is gonna be a very small effect compared to, like, proper nutrition, Recovery and hard training. You know, one of the things I I was I was talking with Ben Bruno the other day, And, I said, you know, like, some people will ask me, like, how does this person make progress? Because, you know, their programming is, you know, is not evidence based. Or Or, this guy, how is he, like, his his exercises are dumb, and I I'll say, yeah, but they train really hard for 20 years. Like, No.[3:30:52] Dr. Layne Norton: One commonality you see between, like, really successful athletes or bodybuilders is they train really hard. And one of the things I have observed is The more into the weeds people tend to get and, again, this is just my own anecdote and observation. The more in the weeds they tend to get, the less hard I see them train. And so one of the things I really like that, Mike Esratol said, who's got a PhD and is a bodybuilder himself, He said you can't out science hard training Mhmm. That if you're looking to build muscle and you're looking to improve your body composition, the the main thing is just doing the work over[3:31:29] Andrew Huberman: I'm consistency and the hard work, and I would add to that, and this is true, academic endeavors, too. Of course, I I think I hope you'll agree.[3:31:37] Dr. Layne Norton: Absolutely.[3:31:38] Andrew Huberman: Which is that yeah. You know, the other thing is given the mental side earlier, we were talking about how satiety signals in the brain and what you think about foods can be relevant. Learning to really enjoy training hard in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well, not just for the effects that it has on body competition composition. Excuse Excuse me. Those 2, of course, but just learning to really enjoy the process of training hard in a in a really hard workout or a really hard, paper that you have to sort through or really digging through a book that's challenging, learning to really enjoy that I think is is a If there is a power tool out there, it's it's the psychological end.[3:32:16] Dr. Layne Norton: And I think a lot of that is getting the confidence of Doing something hard that there's a payoff at the end. You know? And a lot of people I get asked a lot in my q and a's. How do I get more confident? How do I become more confident?[3:32:30] Dr. Layne Norton: I'll tell people you have to do. You have there there's no hack. You can't read about it. You gotta get in the arena. And I don't mean, like, compete in sports necessarily, But, like, doing a PhD or doing something just something hard where you're putting yourself out there and you're saying, this is my goal, and I'm gonna go for it.[3:32:47] Dr. Layne Norton: You just learn so much by doing that about yourself. And so just what you said, I will reframe things in my mind when bad things happen from it's not to say I never get stressed out because I do, and it's not to say that I never get down because I do, because I'm a human. But when something bad happens I should post about this in my store today. When something bad happens, I very rarely anymore do I go, woe is me. Why did this happen to me?[3:33:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Because you're in the universe. Random bad things are gonna happen. So instead, I say, you know, if I'm not dead, instead I say, well, What an exciting opportunity to overcome an obstacle. And I bet because in the experience of my life, The biggest lessons and the best things in my life have actually come out of the most challenging, worst things that have happened. And so, again, this is I would never have been able to do these sorts of things if I hadn't taken up weight lifting because weight lifting taught me so much about Perseverance, delayed gratification, overcoming obstacles, and that's why I love it even to this day.[3:33:58] Dr. Layne Norton: And I'll still get butterflies when I go in for a squat session even though I've been doing it for 23 years.[3:34:03] Andrew Huberman: That's wonderful. Well, it's clear that you embrace hard things, and I for people listening to this, obviously, it doesn't have to be weightlifting. You know? Picking hard things, learning an instrument, learning a language. Challenge is is a is an absolute builder.[3:34:17] Dr. Layne Norton: And they've actually shown, like, those sorts of things, like when you challenge yourself and also mentally that, I think there was a new study that came out basically showing a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's and other age related cognitive decline. I mean, basically, like, use it or lose it. Right?[3:34:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The the the will the desire and the will, to persevere, No doubt translates to this thing we we call the will to live. Right? It's it's related to the will to live. Well, I think That what you just said, you know, beautifully embodies what most people are aspiring to, which is to I think most people actually want to do hard things.[3:34:55] Andrew Huberman: They don't just want to have, the results. I think that most people deep down unders have some understanding that their reward system works that way. I must say this conversation for me has been tremendously rewarding. First of all, it allowed me to meet you in person for the 1st time, which I've really enjoyed. I'm certain this won't be our Last interaction on this podcast and and elsewhere.[3:35:16] Andrew Huberman: Also, the amount of knowledge that you contain inside you is is astonishing. And[3:35:22] Dr. Layne Norton: There's a lot of stuff rattling around up there.[3:35:23] Andrew Huberman: Well and and we all benefit because your ability to pull from the mechanistic side, again, I think In not limited to, but related to your background in biochemistry all the way through to the, the impact in humans, Animal studies, being able to understand where those sit relative to one another, and then you're obviously a practitioner of, you practice what you preach, and what you Talk about pertains to men, to women, younger people, older people, people who are vegan, keto, carnivore. You really are able to net a tremendous number of ideas while staying really nuanced and data driven. And so I just wanna say For myself and on behalf of the listeners, really appreciate you coming in here today and and sharing with us your knowledge. We will absolutely point people in the direction of, where they can learn more about you. And, one of the places, that I want I definitely wanna mention before we we part, however, is, This Carbon app.[3:36:20] Andrew Huberman: And I should just mention, I'm not this isn't a paid promotion or anything of that sort. Actually, one of our podcast team members is has been using Carbon For a long time, this is an app that you devised, which allows people to navigate the exercise, nutrition, energy balance space for weight loss, muscle gain, fat loss, weight maintenance. I would just like to briefly ask you about that before we conclude. Without necessarily telling us everything that's in the Carbon app, I'd love to know what are the major things that it does and is good for, and then what were some of the key things that you wanted to make sure were in there when you built it? Like, what what's the sort of logical backbone behind it?[3:36:55] Andrew Huberman: Because I think there are a lot of, food counting, calorie counting, exercise apps out there. Everyone I've talked to that uses carbon, including, our mutual friend, Sagar and Getty, this member of my podcast, etcetera, raves about it. So what is carbon, and and what does it do, and what was your mindset in building it? What did you really Want to see there that you didn't see elsewhere.[3:37:20] Dr. Layne Norton: So those listening may not know, but I really I started online coaching people for nutrition back in 2005, And that was the the vast majority of my business all the way up until, like, 2017. And I had a lot of success with that where whether whether it be just Average folks looking to lose weight or build muscle and right up to elite level, competitors in physique sport. So I kinda had this idea, like I don't wanna say I had the idea. A few people had the idea. What if we could take what I do in coaching and try to automate as much of that as possible.[3:37:59] Dr. Layne Norton: Because, you know, by the time I was becoming a really popular coach, I mean, I was Expensive. You know, you were looking at, like, you know, me charging. I got to the point where I was charging about $1,000 a month for coaching. Right? And not Most people cannot afford that, and I would like to not just coach rich people.[3:38:16] Dr. Layne Norton: You know what I mean? I would like to be able to help other people. So the idea was to create an app that could do some of this stuff. Now there's always a place for human interaction. But For people who can't afford that, our app is basically $10 a month.[3:38:32] Dr. Layne Norton: And, basically, what we wanted to do was set up An app where think about if you went to a nutrition coach. What what would they do. They would probably ask you some questions about your goals, take some anthropometrics, and they would use, like, that maybe dietary preference, And they'd use that information to kinda formulate a baseline plan. That's what Carbon does. So we ask you I think there's 8 questions in the sign up flow About, like, your activity, your exercise, your lifestyle, your body weight, your body fat percentage.[3:39:07] Dr. Layne Norton: And if you don't know it, we help you calculate it. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing, and then your dietary preferences. And we use that to come up with kind of your baseline, and your baseline will be, you your calories, your protein, your carbohydrates, and fats. And what's different about our app because, like, apps like, you know, MyFitnessPalower will do that as well. What's different about ours is you we encourage people to log their weight daily for the reasons that we talked about earlier, and then you can also track your food in the app.[3:39:38] Dr. Layne Norton: And, honestly, I think our food tracker is actually, like, way easier to use than most of not. There are are what we typically get great Rave reviews about is how user friendly our interface is, that it makes intuitive sense. And so you track your food, Try to hit these these macros that you're prescribed, and each week, you will be prompted to check-in with the coach on your check-in day. And then you you put in some information, and then based on how you're progressing, the app will adjust or not adjust Based on how you're progressing. So, for example, if you're hitting a weight loss plateau, it will sense that, and it will, you know, reduce your calories or or if you're Trying to gain weight and your you know, hit hit a plateau, it'll increase your calories.[3:40:25] Dr. Layne Norton: And there's a lot of, you know, back end algorithm stuff that that takes care of this, but the fundamental crux of the app is We we try to determine your total daily energy expenditure because that's gonna tell us the first big thing we need to know, which is How many calories do you need to be eating for your goal? Right? So on the front end, we we basically Do our best guess based on your anthropometrics. Not gonna be perfect, but it'll get us in the ballpark. And if you do know, like, people already know.[3:40:55] Dr. Layne Norton: Well, I know what I maintain my body weight on. There's actually a spot where you can man manually enter that during the sign up flow, so that's helpful for people who are super nerds like me. But then if you're just people will ask, well, do you do you take Apple Watch data? Do you take this? Do you take that?[3:41:11] Dr. Layne Norton: And, no, for the reasons we talked about that it overestimates energy expenditure. What our app does is it's an algebra equation. If you Because your body weight, your your maintenance calories is your total daily energy expenditure. Your average calories that you eat to maintain your body weight will be the same as your total daily energy expenditure. So if we know how body weight is changing And we know how many calories the person's consuming, we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is.[3:41:42] Dr. Layne Norton: Right? And you can see in the app that we'll, there's a kind of a a maintenance calorie tracker or energy expenditure tracker. And typically, after about 3 to 4 weeks, Even if the app was off at first, it will have you pretty darn close. Because, like, let's say somebody, Comes on, and they their goal is to lose, you know, a pound and a half a week or something like that. In the 1st week, they lose £3.[3:42:08] Dr. Layne Norton: Now The app actually accounts for the fact that you can lose more water weight the 1st weeks. They probably wouldn't get an adjustment, but let's say the next week they lose 3 pounds. The app will sense that And adjust their calories up because it will be estimating that their energy expenditures are actually higher than what it had previously estimated based on the amount of weight they're losing. And the same thing goes in reverse. If they're not losing the amount of weight that they're supposed to, it will lower them based on the fact that it may have overestimated their energy expenditure.[3:42:39] Dr. Layne Norton: But that's the first crux of it is Tracking that energy expenditure. And then the next thing is protein. So when the the back end algorithm stuff is happening, Calories are set 1st based on your energy expenditure and your goal. So, for example, if you have an if you're on an aggressive diet, Your calories are gonna be lower even if your energy expenditure might be a little bit high. Just because if you're trying to lose £2 a week, I mean, you're gonna be in a pretty aggressive calorie deficit.[3:43:09] Dr. Layne Norton: So it's gonna set the calories first, then it will set protein based on your lean body mass. Then the calories that are left over will be allotted to carbohydrate and fat depending on your dietary preference. And we have a few different dietary preferences. There's balanced, which is, about 5050 to 6040 carbohydrate to fat of the remaining calories. Then you have low fat, Which is obviously a higher ratio of carbohydrate.[3:43:36] Dr. Layne Norton: You have low carb. You have a ketogenic diet which is very very low carb, and then there's also a plant based option. And within each of those options, still, you can go in and actually shimmy the macros a little bit within a certain range that you can kind of dial in what your specific dietary preference is. Because, again, if we go back to what is gonna produce the best long term results, preference that they want. And there's some other apps out there that are good apps.[3:44:13] Dr. Layne Norton: Like, for example, we get asked a lot what's the difference in our app and the Renaissance periodization app. And they have a great app. But there's this kinda more rigid, and it'll say, you know, you're gonna eat this many meals, and you're gonna have these foods at these times. So we're kind of the opposite. We wanna give you maximum flexibility.[3:44:28] Dr. Layne Norton: Now for some people, they would prefer the the rigid structure at first, but we find that for most people, giving them more flexibility, Typically improves adherence over the long run. So that's kinda how the app works. And, again, like, there's multiple different goals. It's not just a weight loss app. There's a maintenance.[3:44:46] Dr. Layne Norton: There's a muscle building. So you've got all kinds of different goals that can be accommodated, different rates of each of those goals. And, I mean, I've used the app for over 3 years now to do my body weight. And, I mean, Like, when I say that it's dialed me in because I'm I'm very regimented with, you know, logging and and and logging my weight. So what I targeted to weigh in at worlds, I got down to the 0.1 kilogram.[3:45:17] Dr. Layne Norton: So fantastic. It's it's pretty cool to be able to, like, use a tool that I helped develop to actually coach me. So It's a great tool. You know, we we we did some statistics. We pulled 25 100 members.[3:45:30] Dr. Layne Norton: And, one of the questions we asked is, would you recommend this to a friend? And 91% said yes. So we we on our average, I think our average retention is, like, 7 months, which for an app that costs $10 a month is is really great.[3:45:43] Andrew Huberman: So Yeah. As I mentioned, a number of people I know use it. This is not a paid promotion. I, but I think people need guidance and tools. And What we know about the human brain is that winging it can work, but that, the brain will cheat itself often.[3:45:59] Andrew Huberman: What's there's a Feynman quote about this, and I'll get it wrong. And Always bad to try and quote Feynman, anyway, because he said it so much better, but that we are the easiest, you know, it's easy to fool our Ourselves, basically, is what he was saying. Easiest of all of us.[3:46:12] Dr. Layne Norton: Absolutely.[3:46:13] Andrew Huberman: Sounds great. We will put a link to it so that people can check it out. Again, it sounds like a a wonderful tool and and a tool that nets a lot of the the principles that sit as, major themes For weight loss, weight gain, I would assume, directed, lean muscle lean tissue gain is what most people are after Yeah. And weight maintenance because a number of people would like to just maintain. Listen.[3:46:39] Andrew Huberman: I really appreciate your time and all that you're doing.
