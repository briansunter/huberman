Kronikle AI - Dr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations | Huberman Lab Podcast - TranscriptDr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations | Huberman Lab Podcast - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Oded Rehavi. Doctor Oded Rehavi is a professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University in Israel. His laboratory studies genetic inheritance.[0:00:25] Andrew Huberman: Now everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents, and indeed, that is true. Many people are also probably now aware of the so called epigenome. That is ways in which our environment and experiences can change our genome and, therefore, The genes that we inherit or pass on to our children. What is less known, however, and what is discussed today is the evidence that we can actually pass on Traits that relate to our experiences. That's right.[0:00:54] Andrew Huberman: There is evidence in worms, in flies, in mice, And indeed in human beings, that memories can indeed be passed from 1 generation to the next. And that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how our parents' experiences And our experiences can be passed on from 1 generation to the next, both in terms of modifying the biological circuits of the brain and body and the psychological consequences of those biological changes. During today's episode, doctor Rehavi gives us a beautiful description of how genetics work. So even if you don't have a background in biology or science, by the end of today's episode, you will understand the core elements of genetics and the genetic passage of traits from 1 generation to the next. In addition, he makes it clear how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes Such that they are passed from our parents to us and even transgenerationally across multi generations.[0:01:49] Andrew Huberman: That is, One generation could experience something and their grandchildren would still have genetic modifications that reflect those prior of their grandparents. Doctor Rojavi takes us on an incredible journey explaining how our genes and different patterns of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:02:25] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers From Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly under any conditions. ROKA understands this and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly.[0:02:53] Andrew Huberman: Originally, ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed for sport, that is for things like running and cycling, And many of the features they have reflect that. So for instance, they are extremely lightweight. They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty, And they can indeed be worn for running and cycling and things of that sort. However, they also come in a number of different aesthetics and styles that make them perfectly suited, not just for sport, but also for wearing to the office to work. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.[0:03:35] Andrew Huberman: Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones. Most everybody has heard of the so called ketogenic diet. Most people, including myself, do not follow a ketogenic diet. That does not, however, mean That ketones cannot be valuable because ketones are one of the primary sources of brain fuel and body fuel that allows us To think clearly for long durations of time and to perform well physically, which is all to say that even if you're somebody who's not on a ketogenic diet, such as myself, Increasing your blood ketones can be immensely beneficial for cognitive and physical performance. Indeed, that's how I use Ketone IQ.[0:04:10] Andrew Huberman: I'll take 1 or 2 servings per day typically, sometimes before a workout, but most typically before doing a bout of cognitive work. So I'm going Sit down and prepare a podcast or focus on research for my lab or a writing project or anything that requires a high degree of concentration for a prolonged period of time. Ingesting Keton IQ prior to that, I've noticed greatly increases my level of concentration, and I can sustain that concentration for much longer periods of time than if I don't take Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. So I've talked about many times before on the podcast, there's a critical relationship between sleep and temperature and indeed between waking up and temperature.[0:05:02] Andrew Huberman: That is your body temperature needs to decrease by about 1 to 3 degrees in order for you to fall and stay deeply asleep at night. And when you wake up in the morning, in order to do that feeling refreshed, your body temperature actually needs to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. So it's critical that you control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that that temperature be controlled very specifically across the night and into the morning. With 8 Sleep mattress covers, that's all extremely easy to do. You can program the temperature of your mattress in the beginning, middle, and throughout the night, and when you wake up.[0:05:33] Andrew Huberman: Been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for over a year now, and it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep. And indeed, I know that because 8 Sleep also includes A terrific sleep tracker built directly into that mattress cover. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman to save $150 off their pod 3 cover, 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/ Huberman. And now for my discussion with doctor Oded Rojavi.[0:06:04] Andrew Huberman: Oded, thank you so much for being here.[0:06:06] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Totally my pleasure.[0:06:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This Podcast has an somewhat unusual origin because I am familiar with your work, but we essentially met on Twitter, where you are known for many things, but, lately, especially, You have been focusing not just on the discoveries in your laboratory and other laboratories, but also, sort of meme type humor that relates to the scientific process, and we'll return to this a little bit later. But, first of all, I think it's wonderful that you're so active on social media in this positive stance around science That also includes humor. But today, what I mainly want to talk about is the incredible questions that you probe in your lab, which are highly unusual, Incredibly significant for each and all of our lives and very controversial and at times even, A little bit dangerous or morbid. So this is going to be a fun one for me and for the audience.[0:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Just to start off very basically, get everyone up to speed, because people have different backgrounds. I think most people have a general understanding of what genes are, what RNA is, and so on. But maybe you could, explain to people in very basic terms. And I'll just preface all this by saying that I think most people understand that if they have 2 blue eyed parents, that there's a higher probability that they their offspring will have blue eyes than brown eyes.[0:07:32] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[0:07:33] Andrew Huberman: Similarly, if 2 brown eyed parents, probability that they have brown eyes rather than blue eyes and so on. But that most people generally understand and accept that If they spend part of their life, let's say, studying architecture, that if they have children, that there's no real genetic reason, We assume that their children would somehow be better at architecture because they contain the knowledge through the DNA of their parents. They might be exposed to it in the home, so called nature nurture. Mhmm. So nurture in that case, but that they wouldn't inherit knowledge or other traits.[0:08:10] Andrew Huberman: And today, I'm hoping you can explain to us why eye color but not knowledge is thought to be inherited and the huge landscape of interesting questions that This opens up including some evidence that, contrary to what we might think, certain types of knowledge at the level of cells and systems can be inherited. So inheritance really work?[0:08:38] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay. So DNA are the is is the material, the genetic instructions that is contained in every one of our cells. We have the set of genes Containing, the entire set is called the genome. And this is present in every cell of our body, the same set of instructions. And Genes are made of DNA and they're all they also contain, and chromosomes.[0:09:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: They're they're containing chromosomes. Chromosomes is the DNA and the proteins that Condense the DNA because we have a huge amount of DNA in every cell that you need to content it to.[0:09:11] Andrew Huberman: Sort of like, thread on a on a spool. Right.[0:09:14] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Huge amounts that you have to condense. And we have the same genome, the same DNA in every cell in our body.[0:09:21] Andrew Huberman: Can I just interrupt? And I'll do that periodically just to make sure that, people are being carried along. I sometimes find that even remarkable that a skin cell and a brain cell, a neuron, for instance, Very different functions, but they all contain the full menu of genes and the same menu of genes.[0:09:40] Dr. Oded Rechavi: No. It it is amazing. It is amazing. And perhaps good to have an analogy to to understand how it works. So this is I hope this is not a commercial, but this is like the IKEA book that you have in every cell In your body, the instructions to make everything that you need in your house.[0:09:55] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The chairs, the the the kitchen, the pictures. But in every in but in every room, you want something else. So in the kitchen, you want things that fit the kitchen. And in the toilet, you want things that fit the toilet. So you only Remove one particular page of instructions, which is instructions of how to build a chair.[0:10:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this you place in the key in the in the living room. Okay. And in and the toilet, you put in the toilet. So the DNA, is the instruction to make the the genome. The It's the instruction to make everything.[0:10:23] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is the care book. And in every cell, we we take just instructions for make 1 particular furniture, and this is the RNA. This is the RNA. This is the set. And then the end, you'll you'll build a chair.[0:10:35] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The chair is the protein. So the d n the RNA is there are instructions to make one particular Protein based on the entire set of possibilities. And and this is, this is true for one particular type of RNA, which won't be the style of of this conversation, which is messenger RNA. This is the RNA that contains the information for making proteins. In fact, this is just A small percent of our of the RNA in the cell.[0:11:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So we have a very big genome and less than 2% of each encodes for this messenger RNA. However, a lot of the the the genome is transcribed to make RNA that does other things. Some of these RNAs we understand, And many of them, we don't.[0:11:23] Andrew Huberman: I think it's a beautiful description, and IKEA is not a sponsor of the podcast. So, it's Totally fair game to to use the IKEA catalog as as the analogy for DNA. The specific instructions for specific pieces of furniture is the RNA, and the furniture pieces being the proteins that are that are essentially made from RNA using messenger RNA. Right. Okay.[0:11:43] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that. So despite the fact that the same genes are contained in all the cells of the body, there is a difference between certain Cell types. Right? I was is it fair to say that there is basically one very important exception, which is somatic cells versus germ cells? And would you mind sharing with us what that distinction is?[0:12:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Sure. So so, yes, every cell every cell type is different because it expresses, It brings into action different genes from the entire collection and assumes an identity. And, so we have, we have, cells in the legs. We have cells in the brain. We have in the in the brain.[0:12:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We have cells that produce dopamine, cells with and so on. And we can make, different, separation, different, distinctions, But we can make one very important distinction between the somatic cells and the germ cells. The germ cells are supposed to be the only cells that contributes To the next generation. That's out of which the next generation will be made. So each of us is made just from a a a combination of a sperm and an egg.[0:12:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: These are 2 types of germ cells. And then they fuse and you make you you you get 1 fertilized egg. And out of this one cell, all the rest of the body will develop. And what happens in the soma, which is which are all the cells that are not the the germ cells Should stay in the summer, should not be able to contribute to the next generation. This is very important, and it's thought to be one of the main barriers For the inheritance of acquired traits, inheritance of memory, and so on.[0:13:21] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Because for example, like the example that you gave her in with if I learn about architecture, the information is encoded in my brain. And since my brain cells Can't transfer information to the experiment d egg because the information is supposed to reside In synaptic connections between different neurons in particular, circuits that, developed. So what's what what happens is the brain shouldn't be able Transfer to the next generation. Even simpler a simpler example, if you go to the gym and you build up muscles, you know that your kids will We'll we'll have to work out on their own. It won't this shortcut won't won't happen.[0:14:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is something that we know intuitively, even if we don't have any background in biology. And this is connected to the fact that as we said at the beginning, every cell in the body has its own genome. And the next generation will only form from the combination of the genomes in the sperm and the egg. Even if you somehow, acquire the mutation or a change in your DNA in one of particular brain cells, it wouldn't matter because this mutation, there's no way to transfer to the DNA of the of the germ cells that will contribute to the next generation.[0:14:37] Andrew Huberman: So despite that, there is, As you will tell us, some evidence for inheritance of experience, let's call it. Or, And here, we have to be careful with the language. Right? I just wanna, put a big asterisk and underline and highlight that the language around what we're about to talk about is both Confusing and at the same time, fairly simple and controversial. Right?[0:15:01] Andrew Huberman: It's a little bit like in the, in the field of longevity. People sometimes will say antiaging. Some people say longevity. The antiaging folks feel that longevity is more about longevity clinics. They don't like that.[0:15:12] Andrew Huberman: Antiaging is related to some other kind of niche, clinics, sometimes FDA approved or, government approved, sometimes not. And so there's a lot of argument about the naming, but it's about living longer and living healthier. In this field of acquiring traits or the passage of information to offspring, What is the proper language to refer to what we're about to, discuss? There is this idea, and I'll say it so that you don't have to, that Dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution, very controversial. Right?[0:15:44] Andrew Huberman: And maybe not even controversial. I think it's very, like, offensive even to certain people. This idea of inheritance of Choir traits. The idea that one could change themselves through some activity. Use the example of going to the gym.[0:15:55] Andrew Huberman: We could also use the example of somebody who becomes an endurance runner, Then decides to have children within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this Running, and not just because they were biased towards running in the 1st place Right. But because they of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners. Okay. This Lamarckian, concept is, we believe, wrong. So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits?[0:16:24] Andrew Huberman: What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion?[0:16:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. We have to be very careful, like you said, and there are many complications and many ambiguities.[0:16:31] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you could tell us why Lamarckian evolution, for those that don't know, is so, so such a stained thing. Right.[0:16:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So it's not polite. Fred, perhaps perhaps we'll start with just just say that we can talk about inheritance required traits, Transmission of parental responses, inheritance of memory, all of these things. And we can also talk about epigenetics and transgenerational epigenetics an intergenerational epigenetics. There are many terms that we need to to to make clear for for the audience. The the reason that is so, toxic or controversial is very complicated and goes a long time back.[0:17:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Even way before Lamarck. So even the the Greeks be talked about inheritance acquired trade. Lamarck is associated with the term, But it's probably a mistake. Although everyone talks about including people who studied. So Lamarck worked he published his book About a little more than 200 years ago.[0:17:30] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And he, he believed in the inheritance acquired traits. Absolutely. But just like anyone else in his time, just everyone believed it. This is it seemed obvious to them that that it was long before Mendel and the rules of of, genetic inheritance. And also Mendel was long before the the understanding the DNA is the heritable material.[0:17:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So this happens a long time ago. Everyone believed in it, including Darwin. Darwin was perhaps more Lamarckian than Lamarck. Really? Yes.[0:18:00] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Absolute.[0:18:00] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Now we're now we're getting into the into the[0:18:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: meat of it. And and and this is, in the in in the origin of the species. It's in all of his writings. Lamarck didn't even really make the distinction between the generations. He had many other reasons for being wrong, but he connected the terms inheritance of acquired traits to evolution.[0:18:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this is some of the reason he that he was very controversial even in his time. There were other reasons. For example, he rejected Current day chemistry and thought that he can explain everything based on fluids, earth, wind, fire, and water.[0:18:33] Andrew Huberman: There's still some people on the Internet that think they can Discard with chemistry and explain everything that's on earth, wind, fire, and fog.[0:18:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this wasn't only biology. It was also the weather and everything. So so that was part of the reason. But, Lamarck so so Lamarck made many mistakes, but he did have a a a full tier of inheritance, Which was a big step towards where we are today. So they he had important contributions, Nevertheless, although he was mistaken about the mechanism, what he believed, like everyone else, drives evolution is The transmission of the traits that you acquire during your life, although the the things that you do or don't you do, we talked about use and misuse of of certain organs that shape The, our organs and eventually also the organs of the next generation.[0:19:24] Andrew Huberman: He sounds a little bit like the, the first Self help public figure. Right? Well, this idea you know, I mean, this is heavily embedded into a lot of the health and fitness space on the in Twitter and Instagram and on the Internet, which is that, and it's the and it's the idea that we're sold very early in life, At least here in the United States and probably elsewhere, which is that we can become anything that we want to become, and that that will forever change the offspring, either because of nature or nurture.[0:19:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. And this is a very dangerous idea as I'll explain in a second, and it led to horrible things. This is part of the reason that this is such a taboo. It's not only self help. You're helping your all this helping yourself.[0:20:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The problem is when you apply it to others. And this happened a very, very dramatic and horrible way in in in recent in the recent past. As I I'll I'll tell in a second. So Lamarck, this is what he believed, and and, he thought this what is this is how evolution progress progress. And and later, Darwin, showed that it's really natural selection.[0:20:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The selecting of the the people that of of the organisms that are Already, that already contain the the the particular qualities are selected based on the whether they survive or not in particular environments. And therefore, the, evolution progresses, they become more common and take over. This is very different. Two different explanations. The most common way this is contrasted is the neck of the giraffe.[0:20:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is the classic example. According to to Lamarck, the giraffes had to stretch their necks towards the trees To eat when the tree when the trees were high. And because of that, they're the they transmitted these traits, long necks to their children who also had Long neck. By the way, you only mentioned this example, you know, a handful of times. He didn't really focus on that.[0:21:15] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And according to that, we just the the a giraffe that will happen to be born with a long neck survive because it aids. So it's genetic Heritable materials didn't know about genetics, but, a takeover. And the rest of the genomes that have different heritable materials just die. So this is natural selection versus inheritance for quiet rates. There are many reasons why Lamarckism and inheritance for quiet rates became such a bad term.[0:21:41] Dr. Oded Rechavi: One of the biggest is what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin. There was a scientist called Lysenko Who thought that, Mendelism, normal genetics is, bourgeois science shouldn't be done. And Weber did normal genetics was either killed or sent to the Siberia. And and he thought that just like you said, we can not only we can become everything that we want, but we can grow everything that we want in every field. We can take a Frozen field and raw potatoes there and so on.[0:22:15] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this led to massive starvation, ruin agriculture in in in, in In the Soviet Union also, in science for many, many years and put a very dark cloud on the entire field. And only Probably in the eighties or something like this, the field started to recuperate for that. Aside for that, which is a very dramatic thing, there was also Crazy stories, around an attempt to to prove the inheritance of acquired traits despite The realization of many scientists, this is something that is very rare or that normally doesn't happen. It's that it is not a normal way that inheritance And I can tell you about 2 such dramatic cases that will illustrate it.[0:22:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Please.[0:22:59] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So so in the in the beginning of 20th century in Vienna, There was a researcher called Paul Kamre, was a very famous and and also very colorful figure Who did experiments on many different types of animals. He did experiments on toads that are called the midwife's toad because the male carries the the eggs. And, there's a beautiful book about it from from Kessler Telling the story of what happened there. And he there there are a couple of types of of toads. Some of them live Underwater and some of them live on land.[0:23:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And these toads are different in the shape and in their behavior. So, of course, the cap the capacity to live underwater is one thing, but also the the morphology, and appearance changes. The toads that live underwater develop these pads, these black pads on their hands that allow the males to grab Onto the female without sleeping. For mating. For mating.[0:24:04] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And the ones on land don't have them. He claimed that he can take the toads and train them To live underwater, changing the temperature and all kinds of things, it's a very difficult animal to work with. Eventually, according to, they will acquire the capacity to live underwater and also change the physiology and develop this new black nuch pital pads on their heads. With this discovery, he traveled the world, became very famous. This was, In just the beginning of the previous century, as the person who found the true full inheritance for acquired traits despite the controllable fee and so on, and they are and in the beginning of the realization of how it actually works with DNA and so on.[0:24:49] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Not with DNA, but with, natural selection. DNA came later. And, and people didn't believe him. He was actually under a lot of attacks, But it seemed convincing. At the end, what happened is that they found that he injected ink to the toads to to to make them Become black to have this.[0:25:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So we fake the results. And, and he couldn't stand up with, the the accusations and and killed himself. Wow. In this book by Kessler, it's just maybe it was it was the assistant who did it.[0:25:26] Andrew Huberman: Who killed him?[0:25:27] Dr. Oded Rechavi: No. No. I who who injected it to to sort of Saving from because the the samples lost the coloring or something. So it it might be. Who knows what Yeah.[0:25:36] Andrew Huberman: Well, in science, whenever there's a, fraud Accusation or controversy that it's not uncommon to see a passing of responsibility.[0:25:43] Speaker 2: Right.[0:25:44] Andrew Huberman: There are recent cases. There are ongoing cases now where it's a question of who did what, etcetera. Actually, I have 2 questions, before the 2nd story. I'm struck by the idea that he was traveling and talking. I'm guessing this was before PowerPoint and Keynote, but also before transparencies, which are actually were still in place when I was For those of you who don't know, transparencies are basically transparent, pieces of plastic paper that are that, that you put onto a Projector, and then you can write on them and do, demonstrations, but can show photographs and things like that.[0:26:18] Andrew Huberman: So how was he giving these talks, and would he travel with the toads? He I see.[0:26:23] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And and I'm basing this on this Kessler book, which is on its own very controversial. It's more of a beautiful Story then, you know, perhaps, the truth. But and and and according to the story there, he had to stand one side of the lecture hall with his hands behind the back While others would examine the samples and pass them around and so on. But he cheated.[0:26:43] Andrew Huberman: Someone cheated.[0:26:44] Dr. Oded Rechavi: He probably he probably did it. Let's at least that that's the what Most people think that this wasn't replicated. I mean, also, I don't think anyone tried to replicate it.[0:26:54] Andrew Huberman: And you're saying, Rep rep this is just a point about replication and, actually, another tragic example, not but a few years ago, Sakai, who was, As far as we knew, it was doing very accomplished work on, the growth of retinas, literally growing eyes in a dish. Think everyone believes that result, but then there were some accusations about another result, that turned out to be fraudulent, and Sakai killed himself.[0:27:19] Speaker 2: Right.[0:27:19] Andrew Huberman: This was a recent this was only about maybe 5, 10 years ago. Right. So it still happens.[0:27:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. It happens. I think it's rare, but it does happen, especially in this Pretty high profile[0:27:29] Andrew Huberman: situation. I would argue I'd love to know what your number is, but I would argue that 99% of scientists are seeking truth and are well meaning honest people.[0:27:38] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I totally agree. And I think that, even think when people are wrong, It's mostly not because they're evil and trying to act. Like, they maybe they really want to believe the results, or there are all kinds of way to be wrong, And and even to, bend truth without, you know, just a blatant fraud.[0:27:59] Speaker 2: Right.[0:27:59] Dr. Oded Rechavi: But but this is according to the story, an an example of of very bad thoughts, which is, I agree is rare because most scientists, as you said, is also my just trying to to discover truth and do the best they can.[0:28:10] Andrew Huberman: Well, why else would you go into it? Because it's certainly not a profession to go into if you wanna get rich. Not the money. And it's, probably not even a profession to go into if you wanna get famous. If you wanna be famous, you should go to Hollywood or, become a serial killer because they'll make specials about please don't, but, Please don't do either.[0:28:26] Andrew Huberman: No. Hollywood, I suppose, for some is fine. But in any case, okay. So camera around 1907, 1906.[0:28:34] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is slightly before the the whole the the the controversy broke out after the First World War.[0:28:40] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:28:40] Speaker 2: Yeah.[0:28:41] Andrew Huberman: Great. So, camera is gone. His toads with their, either ink or whatever, Neupatil pads, they have to go back to mating On land.[0:28:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. Yeah.[0:28:51] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.[0:29:18] Andrew Huberman: Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that Communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/ Huberman, and they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:29:59] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:30:06] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So so this is forget about that. We, we also had the the Lisenko episode. You know? That's a very big thing. And and then in the US, there was in the seventies eighties, a researcher named McConnell who did very different experiments.[0:30:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And he was also a character. He worked he worked on, he so he was the joker type of thing, and he published Many of his results in, at Jonah that he published that was called Worms Breeders Gazette and had many cartoons and[0:30:33] Andrew Huberman: So he started his own journal? Yes. And but It's one way to publish a lot.[0:30:37] Speaker 2: Yeah.[0:30:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: But they also published in in in very respected, journals in parallel. He was he was a psychologist, American psychologist, and he worked on a worm, which a flat worm, which is called planaria, is very interesting. This is different than what we'll discuss today, different type of worm. You know, worms are are very common. So 4 out of 5 animals on this planet is a worm.[0:31:03] Andrew Huberman: Really? Yes.[0:31:04] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Numerically. It's just count the individual. So we are the exception. And And so but but I'll talk about it very different worm later. This is a flat worm.[0:31:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is called planaria. And it is remarkable in many ways. It was also a model that many people worked on including the the fathers of of genetics, the people who started genetics Morgan, they worked on it in the beginning, but it's very, very hard to study genetics in this worm. Because unlike us, unlike what we explained before about how we all develop from sperm and egg, these worms, most of the time, reproduce just by fission. They tear themselves apart.[0:31:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So they have a head and a tail, and the part of the head would just tear itself apart from the tail, Grow a new the the head will grow a new tail. The tail will grow a new head. You can even cut them to 200 pieces. Each piece will grow into a new one. Wow.[0:31:56] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And and they have centralized brains with lobes and everything and even this degenerate eyes. He studied these worms and he said that he can teach them certain things. Associations By pairing all, for I don't remember exactly what he did. I think it was either lights or electricity with Shock them Which which shock them with with other things, and it could train them to learn and remember particular things.[0:32:24] Andrew Huberman: Like, they might get shocked on one side of the tank Exactly. And then Avoid that side of the tank. Yes. And then I guess the question is whether or not they're all they're ripped apart selves, and their Subsequent generations will know to avoid that side of the tank without having ever been exposed to the shock.[0:32:40] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. So without ever been exposed to shock or They whether the the new generation, the new head will be able to remember to learn faster. That's another the subtlety that you might have. Okay? And and this what he said happened.[0:32:55] Dr. Oded Rechavi: He said he can teach them certain things. Remove cut off their heads and new heads With all the brain, will will grow and that it will contain the memory. This was the start of the controversy, not the end of it. Only the beginning. Then he said something even much wilder, which is it can train them to learn certain things.[0:33:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And then just chop them up, put them in a blender, And feed them to other worms because they are cannibalistic. They eat each other. And that the memory will transfer through feeding. This sounds[0:33:27] Andrew Huberman: Such a dramatic field.[0:33:30] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And by the way, this this opened the field. So people did experiments that not only in planaria, but in gold flea fish and certain rodents. And did these memory brain transfer essays implanting brain? And this is in the back when they They had the an idea that some memories could be moleculars, could have a molecular form, which is very appealing. It's almost like sand science fiction.[0:33:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You could have a memory in a tube. Unlike the way we think about memory normally, which is something that is distributed in neuronal circuits And encoded in the strength of particular synapses and so on. But but the idea that you can take a a memory and reduce it into a molecule And transfer it around is very, very interesting. So this why it attracted so many people. This ended up in a catastrophe.[0:34:17] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So there was an NIH investigation. Couldn't no one can replicate anything. It was a big mess. Although there were always scientists who said, yes, we can replicate this and they were in the back. Okay?[0:34:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: McConnell's stuff was different. Again, people thought that they couldn't The that's there there are problems replicating, but it wasn't necessarily but some people replicate, but it wasn't necessarily about replicating the whole thing. But The question was, did the memory that transfer is specific, or is it an overall sensitization that transmits and so on? Right. Like, you[0:34:49] Andrew Huberman: could imagine that what gets transmitted is a Hypersensitivity to electricity as opposed to the specific location that the electricity was introduced.[0:34:57] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Or or even more than that. Even just, you know, hypersensitivity engine in in general, more You're more vigilant, and you'll learn anything so fast. That's also a possibility. Mhmm. But his problem wasn't the accusation.[0:35:07] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It was much worse That he was targeted by the Unabomber, these terrorist who sent letters with bombs to many scientists for 15 years. And and his assistant, again, is the assistant, I think, exploded. And this is how his line of research ended. Just Recently, a few years ago, a researcher from Boston, Mike Levin, and, and his postdoc, Tal Shomrat, Replicated some of McConnell's experiment with the cutting of the head, but in the very using very fancy equipment and automated tracking. They could say that they can replicate some of this his, his, his experiments.[0:35:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Really?[0:35:48] Andrew Huberman: Yes. And they don't open packages in that[0:35:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: They have they have interesting stories. You should have Mike over Yeah. I'm familiar with this[0:35:55] Andrew Huberman: with a bit of his work. Not I didn't realize they had done that Yeah.[0:35:58] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So so they published it yet, a few years ago. And this is very interesting, but, of course, they they don't know how it happens. The mechanism is unclear. McConnell went a step further than this. And what's fascinating is is that these these are experiments that were done in the seventies and eighties.[0:36:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: He said that It cannot only transfer the memories through chopped animals, but he can take the other animals that that learned And break it down into different fractions. So just the DNA, just the RNA, just the the fats, the the proteins, the sugars. And he said that the fraction that transmit the memory is the RNA. And this is very, very interesting because it was a long time before everything that we know about How are you today? I'll soon go into my research, explain what what we do, and then you'll see that you can actually feed worms without an a And get and and have many things happen.[0:36:49] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is everyone knows this is true. Okay? So this is why it was so appealing to to go back to that and and study. By the way, At the time it became popular knowledge. Everyone knew this experiment.[0:37:00] Dr. Oded Rechavi: There was a there was a Star Trek episode about it from 84. There's a there are comics books about it, books about it. So this was very and people were eating RNA because they thought it was RNA memory. This was, of course, complete nonsense. But but this was it made a lot of noise In these years, which is part of the reason it was so toxic until recently.[0:37:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You couldn't touch it because it's it it was considered pseudoscience Likely SENCO, like, Kamal. So this was just something you you didn't wanna touch at all. And And then we go back to to to these, studies about inheritance of memory or inheritance of acquired traits in other organisms, In in mammals, in in in in humans. And aside from the dark clouds that these, episodes left. There were also theoretical problems of why of why this can't happen.[0:37:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Barriers That have to be breached for this to happen. And you can you can talk about many different types of barriers. And and and you can also narrow it down to 2 main barriers. 1st barrier, we mentioned it. This is the separation of the soma from the germline.[0:38:11] Andrew Huberman: Right. The somatic cells, They can change in response to experience the sperm and the egg, the so called germ cells, cannot. They're That's the idea.[0:38:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Or they are isolated from what happens in the summer. Okay. The man who first thought about this barrier is called Wiseman, August Wiseman. This was in the 19th century. So it is called today the wise man barrier.[0:38:33] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Separation of the soma from the germline, only the germline transmitting from it to the next generation. And this is also called the 2nd law of biology. So this is very, very fundamental. So natural selection is the first one. This is the second one because it's so important to how we work, To how our bodies work.[0:38:49] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Wiseman, by by the way, thought that if you will have direct influence of the environment on the germ cells, Then perhaps this could transfer to the next generation. So it he wasn't as strict as his burial suggest, but, But this is not how most people remember it. Okay. But he thought that this is unnecessary. It it's possible that natural selection can expand everything.[0:39:14] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it compared to to a boat, which is in the ocean. It is sailing, and it has a sail open. So you don't have to assume that it has an engine. Wind is blowing. You don't have to assume other things.[0:39:25] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The natural selection might be enough. So this barrier is still standing, But not entirely. It is bridging some organisms. We'll go into that in a second. The other barrier is the Now we have to to ex to understand the other barrier, we have to talk about epigenetics.[0:39:44] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We have to define epigenetics and what it is. And epigenetics is another term which people misuse horribly and say about everything that is epigenetics, Even people from the field. Okay? The the the the the the word itself that the term was defined in the forties By, Wellington Konrad Wellington. And he talked about the interaction between genes and that and and their product That act that's in in the end bring about the phenotype of the consequences and how genes influence development.[0:40:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Later, people discovered mechanisms That are that that change the action of genes, the different mechanisms, and started talking about these As epigenetics, for example, the DNA is built out of 4 basic elements. Is all the the The AT GNC. Right? And they could be mod chemically modified. So in addition to just the information that you have in the sequence Of the DNA, you also have this information in the modification of the basis.[0:40:52] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The most common modification that has been studied more than others is Modification of the letter c of cytosine, methylation, addition of a methyl group to this, c. And and And this can be, replicated. So after the the the DNA, the cells divide and and replicate the genetic material. In certain cases also, these chemical modifications could be added on and replicate and be preserved.[0:41:20] Andrew Huberman: For those who aren't, as familiar with thinking about genes, and gene structure and epigenetics. Could we think of, these you mentioned For, nucleotide bases, CGAD. But could we imagine that, through things like methylation, it's sort of like taking the primary colors and adding a a changing one of them a little bit, changing the the hue just slightly, which then opens up an enormous number of new Options of colored, integration.[0:41:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It's just more combinations, more ways, more information. There are the modifications of the DNA, And also there are the modifications of the proteins which condense the DNA that are called histones. So they are also modified by many Different chemicals. Again, methylation is a very common, modification. Acetylation, even serotonin.[0:42:09] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The serotonin of of histones.[0:42:11] Andrew Huberman: Serotonin.[0:42:12] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. This is a new paper from Nature from a few years ago. Can change DNA. The the not the DNA but the protein that condenses it.[0:42:19] Andrew Huberman: Essentially, how, in the analogy I used before of, of how the thread is wrapped around the spool, Essentially.[0:42:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. And and this determines the the the degree of condensation of the DNA whether the gene is now more or less Sesibed, and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less. This is this is one way to affect the the Gene expression and and bring about the the function of the gene. There are many additional weights, not the only one. So then when this was when all of this was Starting to be elucidated.[0:42:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: People talked about epigenetics. They started talking about these modifications, forgot the original definition. And when people said epigenetics, they talk about methylation and things like that.[0:43:01] Andrew Huberman: And, again, to just frame this up so we could imagine 2 identical twins, so called monozygotic twins. We could go a step further and say that they're monochorionic, They were in the same placental sac because twins can be raised in separate sacs, slightly different early environments. Let's say those 2 twins are raised separately. One experiences certain things. The other other things, they eat different foods, etcetera, and there is the possibility through epigenetic mechanisms that Through methylation, acetylation, serotonin production, etcetera, that the expression of certain genes in one of the twins could be amplified relative to the other.[0:43:36] Speaker 2: Correct. So[0:43:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: yeah. So we know that even a totally identical twins, genetically, they're identical, but they they look different and they are different. This we we experience we all experience it. And this is this can happen because of these epigenetic changes. Okay?[0:43:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Or it can happen because of other mechanisms. Because genes respond to the environment. Genes don't exist in a vacuum. There are, genes are need to be activated by transcription factors. And there's a whole, there's there's a lot of machinery that He's responsible for making genes function.[0:44:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So we are a combination of our genetic material and the environment. K. So when people talk about epigenetics and talks that talks just about the modification, they're also not exactly right. My definition of epigenetics Is inheritance which occurs either across cell division or more interestingly also for this podcast now, across generations, Not because of changes to the DNA sequence. By but through other mechanisms.[0:44:38] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I think this is the The the the most robust definition that that allows you to understand what you're talking about. And then again and then, and then the question is, this happens, then what are the molecules that actually transmit information across generations? Are they the these can become modifications To the DNA or to the proteins that condense the DNA? Or are there other other agents that transmit information? And which molecules can do it?[0:45:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And I actually think that the most interesting players today are RNA molecules. Okay? But before I go into that, I just want to say that when we talk about the barriers to epigenetic inheritance or the barriers to inheritance of acquired traits, In addition to the separation of the soma from the germline that we discussed, the other main barrier, it's called epigenetic reprogramming, which is That we acquired our our cells. The the the genetic material in in our cells acquires all kinds of changes. This chemical changes, Modification we discussed.[0:45:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: But these modifications are largely erased in the transition between generations. So in the germline, in the in the the sperm and the egg, and also in the early embryo, most of them modifications are removed So we can start a blank slate based on the genetic instructions. And this is crucial. Otherwise, According to the theory, it's not clear that actually true because in some organisms, it doesn't really happen. We will just we will not develop according to the, and species typical genetic instructions.[0:46:17] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[0:46:17] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So to preserve this, we we raise the the the all these modifications that start anew. And this is in in mammals and in humans. This is allowed to do most of the modifications on the in the sperm and indeed are removed. So about 90% Some remain which will be interesting.[0:46:36] Andrew Huberman: So the idea, if I understand correctly, is that there's some advantage, to wiping the slate clean and returning to the original, plan. In in the context of the IKEA furniture analogy, the instruction book[0:46:51] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[0:46:51] Andrew Huberman: Is the one that's issued to everybody, okay, or every cell. Right? Only certain instructions are used for certain cells, say a skin cell or a neuron or a liver cell or a, any other cell for that matter. Through the course of the lifespan of the organism, those specific instructions are adjusted somewhat. Okay.[0:47:09] Andrew Huberman: So maybe, like IKEA furniture, sometimes you you they sent you 7, not 8 of particular screws, or they sent you, the proper number, but you put them in the wrong place, and it sort of changes the way that the thing works a little bit. Once that assuming furniture could reproduce But here in the analogy of the furniture as as the cell or, or the organ in the mates with another organism, That needs to be replicated. And so the idea is to take the instruction, but go through and erase all the pen and pencil marks, erase all those additional little modifications that The the owner used, were introduced to it and returned to the original instruction.[0:47:48] Speaker 2: Right.[0:47:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Because if you want to bring back the instruction book, you want it to have all the potential to make all the furnitures. Don't want it to be restricted to the ones that you made in a particular[0:47:56] Andrew Huberman: room. So it's essentially the opposite of acquired traits and characteristics based on Your, what we say in biology, geeks speak, lineage based experience, but what your parents experience. Right? In some ways, we want to eliminate all that and go back to just the genes they provided.[0:48:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. But it's more complicated than that. It's more complicated than that because we have some very striking examples even in memes where some Of the of the marks are maintained. For example, the classic example is imprint. Imprinting is a very interesting phenomena.[0:48:31] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The the way DNA works is that we you you inherit, a copy for every chromosome From your mother and your father. And then you have in every cell of your body, 2 copies, if you're a human, of every chromosome. Okay. And then so so every gene is represented twice. These are called alleles, the different versions of the genes.[0:48:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And The the thought is that once you at the in the next generation, the 2 copies that you inherited are equal. It doesn't matter whether you inquire inquire them from your mother or from your father. Right? There are some situations where it does matter. There is there is a limited number of genes that are in pre are called imprintages where it does matter whether you inherited from your mother or your father.[0:49:18] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And and this is happening through epigenetic enhances from not because of changes to the DNA sequence, but because of maintain maintenance of this, chem chemical modifications across generations.[0:49:29] Andrew Huberman: And as I recall from the beautiful work of Katharine Dulak, at Harvard that especially in the brain, there is evidence that some cells contain the complete genome From mom or the complete genome from dad.[0:49:44] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it can also switch during your life. So for her work show that Early on in in in your life, it's different whether you express the the maternal or paternal copy than when you're, more mature.[0:49:57] Andrew Huberman: So parents and children take note. You know? For those of you that are saying, oh, you know, the child is more like you or more like me, that can change across the lifespan. And if you're Thinking about your parental lineage and wondering whether or not you, quote, unquote, inherited some sort of trait, from Mother or from father, it can be, of course, both, or it can be just 1 or just the other, which I think most parents tend to See and describe in their children from time to time. That's just like the father.[0:50:26] Andrew Huberman: That's just like the mother,[0:50:27] Dr. Oded Rechavi: for instance. Right. But it's important to know that in this situation, the environment played no role. This was just whether it passed to mother or the father. It's not that something that happened to the mother or the father affected this.[0:50:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay? So this is slightly different. The question is now, can the environment Change the head of the material. Okay? So it's very important to understand that there's a difference between nurture and nature.[0:50:56] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this is very confusing. People are are it's it's a little subtle. So for example, people tell me I'm growing horses for many years, and I just know that this Horse has a particular, character. It's very different from from the other horse. And so this is epigenetic inheritance.[0:51:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: No. It could be just genetically determined. Yes. This horse inherited a different set of genetic instructions, so it is different. Doesn't have to be About epigenetics.[0:51:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Epigenetic inheritance, means that the environment of the parents somehow changed the the the children. Okay. And there, there are these 2 main barriers that are serious bed bottlenecks that we have to Think what type of molecule and how they can be bridged. So one possibility is that it's really this limited number of chemical modifications that survive, Which is about 10% or so. That could be very interesting.[0:51:51] Andrew Huberman: Not a small number.[0:51:52] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Not a small number, but perhaps.[0:51:53] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[0:51:54] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Perhaps. Okay? This is one one possibility. The other possibility that there are other mechanisms. The the Situation now in humans is that it's just really unclear what transmit, if it can transmit, and which molecule does it.[0:52:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We talk later about other organisms worried. It is a lot more clear. But in humans and mammals in general, there are many examples For, environments that change the children, whether they the you will need to invoke An epigenetic mechanism to explain this phenomena, this is unclear. First of all, because it's how to separate nurse nurture from nurture. And second, because, the mechanism is just not understood.[0:52:41] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So there are classic examples for in humans, there were periods of Famine, starvation in different places in the world, in the Netherlands, in China, in Russia, where people did huge epidemiological study to study the next generations and so that the children of women who were starved during pregnancy are different. A different in many ways. They have, different birth weight, glucose sensitivity, And also some neurological, higher chances of getting some neurological diseases. And this has been shown in very large studies.[0:53:24] Andrew Huberman: Is there ever an instance of which starvation or hardship of some kind, some challenge, a sensory challenge, or, survival based challenge led to adaptive traits?[0:53:36] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. There are in different organisms. It could be as a result of a trade off. So there could be a downside as well. But for example, there are 2 examples that come into mind.[0:53:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: One of them is that if you stress Male, mice or or, or rats. I don't remember. This is work of Isabelle Mansui in the ETH in Switzerland. If you stress the males, you can do it in many different ways. I don't remember exactly how they did, but you could you could do you can separate them from their mothers.[0:54:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Can do social defeat, all kinds of things, then the next generations are less stressed. They show less anxiety.[0:54:15] Andrew Huberman: So their threshold for stress is higher?[0:54:18] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. However, I think they have memory deficits and and other metabolic problems.[0:54:22] Andrew Huberman: May be an advantage for dealing with stress.[0:54:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Could be. It could.[0:54:25] Andrew Huberman: Don't have any direct evidence of that, but there's some there's some simmering ideas that, you know, our ability to anchor our thoughts in the past, present, or future seems very adaptive[0:54:34] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[0:54:34] Andrew Huberman: In certain context, in other context, it can keep us ruminating and not Right. You know Right. Adaptively present to our current[0:54:41] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Another example is that, nicotine exposure. This is, I think the work of, Oliver Rando, from UMass Is I if I'm not mistaken, these are not my studies, but they improve the the tolerance to exposure to similar drugs in the next generation. The interesting thing here is that it's very nonspecific. So you you treat them with nicotine, but then in the next generation, they are more tolling into nicotine, but also to other, I think, cocaine or[0:55:11] Andrew Huberman: That sort of makes sense to me because, yeah, obviously, nicotine, Activates the cholinergic system, the dopaminergic system, epinephrine, and etcetera. And you can imagine that there's crossover because other drugs like glucan amphetamine Mainly target the catecholamines, the dopamine, and norepinephrine.[0:55:28] Dr. Oded Rechavi: In in in in this particular study, if I remember correctly, they show that this happens, this Heritable effect, even if you use an antagonist to block the nicotine receptor. Wow. So so so it's something more about clearance of xenobiotics And and hepatic functions that is transmitted and is very nonspecific.[0:55:48] Andrew Huberman: What I love about all the examples you've given today and And, especially, that one is and I hope that people, if you're just listening, I'm smiling because biology is so cryptic sometimes. You know? The The the obvious mechanism is rarely the the one that's actually at play. Right. And, people always ask, well, why?[0:56:06] Andrew Huberman: Why is it like this? And I always say, you know, the one thing I know for sure is that I wasn't consulted the design phase. And if anyone claims they were, then you definitely, wanna back away very fast. And then[0:56:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And there could be so many trade offs so many trade offs. So for for example, we studied and also other many many other people studied. Effects, these are in in worms. We'll go we'll go deep into that in a second. But, show that when you starve them, the next generations, live longer.[0:56:34] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this, I think, could be a trade off with other things like, Like fertility. So the next generations are more sick and and and less fertile. And perhaps because of death, They live longer. So there could be it's not necessarily a good thing. K?[0:56:50] Andrew Huberman: I don't wanna draw you off course, because this is magnificent what you're doing and and and, splaying out for us here. But do you recall there was a few years ago, it actually ended very tragically. It was an example. I think it was down in San Diego County. There was a a cult of sorts that were interested in, living forever.[0:57:06] Andrew Huberman: And so they castrated the male self castrated themselves in the idea that somehow, maintaining some pew prepubescent state or reverting to a pseudo prepubescent state would somehow extend longevity. The idea that, sexual behavior somehow limited lifespan. This has been an idea that's been thrown around in the kinda more wacky longevity communities. They also shaved their heads. They also wore the Same sneakers, but then they also all committed suicide right as the Hale Bopp comet came through town.[0:57:34] Andrew Huberman: But that's just but one example of many cults Aimed at sort of, that obviously was not life extension. That was life truncation, but, aimed at kind of eternal life or some sort of, Through caloric restriction. That's right. This this cult also was very into the whole idea that by through caloric restriction, we can live much longer, which, it may actually turn out to be true. I think it's still debated.[0:57:55] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Hence, all the debate about intermittent fasting, etcetera. But, also, it is known that if you overeat, you shorten life. This is this is clear. It's known that big bodied members of a species live Far, shorter lives than the smaller Mhmm.[0:58:11] Andrew Huberman: Members of a Great Dane versus a Chihuahua, for instance. So there is some, like, sort of shards of truths in all of these things, But I I it seems to me that the real question is, like, what is the real mechanism, and and why would something like this exist?[0:58:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right.[0:58:25] Andrew Huberman: And why questions are very dangerous Right. Biology. Right?[0:58:27] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. But but very interesting also. And and so so when it comes to metabolic changes and nutrition, there are numerous examples Well, you either overfeed or starve and get effects in the next generations. Many of the sometimes the effects contrast Depending on the the way you do this, again, these are none of we don't do any of that in in mammals, but people show that starving or overfeeding the mothers or the fuddles Changes the body weight of the the next generation and also the the glucose tolerance and and other and and and also a productive, success. And, and and so the the fact that there's an effect, that there's that something transmits, this is clear.[0:59:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The question is, how miraculous is it And whether you need new biology and epigenetics to explain. What do I mean by that? If you affect the next generation, It doesn't necessarily has to go through the oocyte of the sperm and involve the epigenome. You change the metabolism of the Animal as it develops, and obviously, it will affect it. The when you, for example, starve women that are pregnant As happened during the the the this, famous, starvation studies.[0:59:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The the the baby is already in utero exposed exposed directly to the environment. So it's not even a heritable effect. The baby is itself affected. It's a direct effect. Very interesting, important, and has many implications.[0:59:59] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it will be separate from the genetics. You have to take it into account to understand what's going on. Doesn't require necessarily new biology, a new new biology of inheritance. Not only is the embryo affected, The embryo while in Utah already has jumps off. So it's also the next generation.[1:00:19] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So it's directly exposed. And you don't need any new biology necessarily to explain it, and it doesn't have has to involve genet epigenetics or epigenetic.[1:00:29] Andrew Huberman: It's clear to me, that in the female fetus, the total number of eggs that she will someday produce and Potentially, have fertilized by sperm exist. But in males with a 60 day sperm cycle, leads me to the question, do, fetal males, males as fetuses, living as fetuses in their moms already start producing sperm, or it's the primordial cells that give rise to sperm?[1:00:54] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So I'm I'm not an expert, so I don't wanna go into the details of exactly when in mammals. Yeah. But but But, yes, exposure of the of the mother also affect the, eventually, the the the the transmission of the father of genetic information for the sperm's father. And there are also many examples of just stressing the fathers, affecting the sperm, and affecting the next generation. There, if you go to the f generations.[1:01:19] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So if you got 2 generations down the road, not to the kids, but to the grandkids, then it is a real epigenetic effect because, Because you you examine something that happens although the the next generation was was never exposed to the original challenge. So when we say about epigenetic inheritance in through the paternal lineage, through the funders, we talk about, 2 generations. And when you go through the mother, it's 3 generations to talk about to to when you need to, invoke some real epigenetic mechanism. And there, the evidence becomes much more scarce in men's. There are examples More or less convincing, the field is evolving and improving a lot.[1:02:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So for example, now to People use, the cutting edges to use IVS in vitro fertilization or transfer of embryos to make sure that you actually it's the it's the Heritable information and not the environment, or and that it goes through the germline. So this is something that is being done now. Are studies You said I'm[1:02:25] Andrew Huberman: at the 3 parent IVF where they take the DNA from mom, the sperm from dad, and they take the DNA from mom and put it into a novel cytoplasm? Or[1:02:33] Dr. Oded Rechavi: No. Not at all. You just you just take the sperm and transfer it and fertilize the the the,[1:02:40] Andrew Huberman: an egg. So standard IVF. Yes. Standard IVF. Yeah.[1:02:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You can do it in many different ways, but this idea that you separate the the the environmental the environment of the mother from the inheritance or the environment of the father and, to to control and separate nature from nature.[1:02:55] Andrew Huberman: The the environment becomes the culture dish.[1:02:57] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. Yeah. So so the field is is improving. People do experiments that have a higher end, so more replicates and better controlled. And there are some examples for effects that transfer.[1:03:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it depends who you ask whether people believe it or not. Many geneticists do not believe it, and many people do believe it. And it depends on the community. There are strong resistance for many reasons. Some of them are are justified.[1:03:25] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Some are less justified and are part of the scientific process of and how things work. Because it's it's it's a new it's challenging the dogma. So this is very interesting on its own. If you ask psychologist, Many psychologists believe that those hurtable trauma and and things like that. Population geneticists, less so.[1:03:45] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay? So this really depends. And I think that we are just at a point in time where we don't really know whether it happens and to what extent. And we need bigger studies. Even if you think about normal just genetic studies where people trying to understand the genetic underpinning Of, complex traits like, anything that involves the brain pretty much.[1:04:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We now know that you need to study many, many, many people. So now this big genome wide association studies, big genetic studies involve Hundreds of thousands of people. No one did an experiment like this for epigenetics. It's much more complicated because you need to also take into account the environment and to It's I don't I'm not even sure we know how to design such an experiment. It's very, very challenging.[1:04:33] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So so the part of the resistance The resistant to the idea is based on to a law theoretical grounds because of these barriers and because of the of the controversies. On the other hand, there's people really want to believe it. People really want to believe it. Because it sorts of gives your life meaning. If you can change your biology Through changing of of your kids, through changing your biology.[1:05:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So to psychologically, I can understand why many people want this to happen. Even Schrodinger, the famous physicist. So he wrote a very important book in 44. So this was before the the double helix. And, That's it's called what is life?[1:05:21] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is actually a book that was drove many by physicists to establish molecular biology. It's very, very important. He talks about the heritable material. It also talks about evolution. And he said, unfortunately, Lamarckism or inheritance of acquired trait is untenable.[1:05:34] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It doesn't happen. And it and it you're right. This is very, very sad or unfortunate because unlike Darwinism or natural selection, which is gloomy, Doesn't matter what you do. The next generation will be born based on the instruction in the the sperm and egg. It doesn't met you can't influence it.[1:05:52] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Course, you can give your kids money and education, but you can't biologically influence it.[1:05:56] Andrew Huberman: You can also so, one thing I'm Fascinated by for a number of reasons is partner selection. I mean, in some ways, you know, we think, oh, we we wanna find someone who is, you know, kind. That does seem to be, by the way, the primary Feature, at least in, the data tell us. We had David Boss on the podcast of how women select men that people are kind. There's also resource potential.[1:06:16] Andrew Huberman: There's also beauty or, Aesthetic attractiveness in males and females, etcetera. Male male, female female as the case may be, but in terms of reproduction, sperm, egg, male, female, obviously. So we're selecting for a number of traits, but, presumably, subconsciously, we are also selecting for a number of related to vigor and in the the idea that if we were to have offspring with somebody, that those traits would be selected for.[1:06:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. And we actually have a a a a work on that in nematodes that I'll be happy to tell you about in a second after we we[1:06:47] Andrew Huberman: The dating the dating and, the dating[1:06:49] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The dating in worms. And and and where we understand the mechanism, and and we'll go into that, in a second, but, or in a few minutes after we we we dive into the worms. But, but, yes, the the original, calculations of how population genetics work To simplify things and to do the math, so it would be easy. It was random mating. Of course, it doesn't work like that.[1:07:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So it's complicated things because we know. And there are there's research about Potential, capacity to somehow sense, immune compatibility and things like this, which is I don't know. I'm not An expert on that, but[1:07:24] Andrew Huberman: And neither am I. But my understanding is that, of course, we're familiar with the other traits we select for, like potential nurturing ability. Or not someone is reliable predicts something about their nurturing ability and Right. Offspring potentially. I mean, you can draw lines between these things without any, direct evidence, but But they seem so logical, right, that somebody kind who might also stick around or be honest in these kinds of things that Right.[1:07:46] Andrew Huberman: That it makes sense. But that one would be selecting certain biological traits like immune function or, some other form of robustness that we're not aware of is, I think, a fascinating fascinating area of biology. Yeah.[1:07:58] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. So so this is where the the the the work in mammals stand. However, there's also one additional thing to to mention, which is That on top of, chemical modifications to the DNA and, and the proteins that Condensed DNA, which are called histones. There are also other mechanisms that might transmit information, including transmission between generations of RNA. And there are different types of RNA, not just the RNA that we mentioned before, the messenger RNA, which Encodes, for, the information for making potent, but also other RNAs that regulate gene expression.[1:08:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this is and I think that In recent years, also in the mammalian field, RNA as the molecule that has the potential to transmit information between generation took center stage. So I think this is the cutting edge. A lot more to understand than know. But RNA has a lot of potential for doing that As we'll explain, soon, but we have to go to worms first.[1:09:03] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to just take a brief moment and thank one of our podcast sponsors, which is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that blood work is the only way that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors, etcetera, The impact, your immediate and long term health. One major challenge with blood work, however, is that most of the time, it does not come back with any about what to do in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, into the ranges that you want. With InsideTracker, Changing those values becomes very straightforward because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use to address the nutrition based, Behavior based, supplement based approaches that you can use in order to move those values into the ranges that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.[1:09:58] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker now includes a measurement of Apolipoprotein b, so called ApoB, in their ultimate plan. ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health, And therefore, there's extreme value to knowing your APOB levels. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any[1:10:15] Speaker 2: of InsideTracker's plans.

Thank you for that incredible overview of genetics and RNA and, epigenetics and was essentially a survey of this very interesting, and on the face of it, sort of complex field, but You've simplified it a great deal for us. In our transition to talking about worms, I would like to plant a flag in the, in the Huberman Lab Podcast and say that what we are about to discuss is the first time that anyone on this podcast has discussed so called model organisms.[1:10:53] Andrew Huberman: I may have mentioned a fly paper here or there or a study on honeybees and caffeine and, flower preference at one point, But, typically, that's done in passing, and we quickly, rotate to humans. I know that many, if not most of our listeners, are focused on humans and human biology and health, etcetera, But I cannot emphasize enough the importance of model organisms and the incredible degree to which they've informed us about human health, especially when it Comes to very basic functions in cells. Right? I mean, one could argue, okay. There and there's been some debate.[1:11:25] Andrew Huberman: Telomeres in mice, did that really lead to the same sort of data in humans? Okay. There are these those k says, certainly, but model organisms are absolutely critical and have been and basically inform most of what we understand about human health. So before we, start to go into the description about worms per se. Could you just explain to a general audience what a model organism is?[1:11:46] Andrew Huberman: Right? They're not modeling. They're not posing for photographs, obviously. What what that means and what some of the general model organisms are and why you've Selected or elected to work on a particular type of worm to study these fascinating topics that There's zero question also take place in in humans at some level.[1:12:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So it's it's a it's a real pleasure and an honor to represent the model organisms Tiara, I'm really happy just for that. This is it was worth it. Because as you said, model organisms are really important, and we learn so much about about biology through them. The the modern organisms mean that it's an it's an organism That many people work on so there's a community of people that work on. People work study many types of organism, but not around every organ.[1:12:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: There's a a huge community Of researchers that come that's, combined sources to create all the the resources and the tools and understanding that accumulates. There is just a handful of model organisms in the his in the short history of the field of biology. It's not so long. We learned about every aspect of biology through them, including many important diseases, human diseases. And these are E.[1:13:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Coli bacteria, phage, which is a a virus of bacteria, and Flies, worms that are called C elegans nematodes, this is what we study in the lab. Fish which are called zebra fish. It's a particular[1:13:23] Andrew Huberman: It's Daniel Daniel or something.[1:13:25] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. Yeah. And, and of course, there are also model logonist The other and mouse.[1:13:30] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[1:13:31] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And, and also plants, important plants. The most studies one is the apoptosis.[1:13:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And perhaps less so nowadays, but nonhuman primates. Macaque monkeys, marmosets, squirrel monkeys Right. Mainly.[1:13:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: These I I don't know exactly how to definition is but emerging model organisms. There are many of model log names that are emerging and there are communities that are formed including also around the planaria that we mentioned before, the Flatworm that regenerate is a great model for studying regenerations. If we could develop new heads, it would be incredible. And we can learn from these organisms. And the reason that we can learn a lot also about humans by studying these animals is that we all evolved from the same ancestor.[1:14:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So we shared we shared we share a lot of our, our functions with them and also a lot of our genes. C elegans and and they have the different model organisms have different advantages that serve us. They, they sometimes have some Things that are much more apparent in them that we can study. For example, learning and memory was largely studied in the beginning in a snail, aelysia, where Many of the discoveries were made because it has big noise ones that you can easily study and and examine.[1:14:45] Andrew Huberman: And, yes, snails learn.[1:14:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. They learn. Even c elegans, the these nematodes that we study learn, and they are much simpler than, than Another important reason to sending them, of course, is you can you can actually experiment on them. We can't do this to humans. The things that we do to these animals.[1:15:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And we can change their genes, do all kinds of things for them.[1:15:07] Andrew Huberman: And in some, sorry to interrupt. But in some cases, I think you're going to tell us, for instance, in c elegans in particular, They the presence of particular cell types is so stereotyped that you can look at several different worms and you can The the community of people that study C. Elegans has literally numbered and named each neuron so that 2 laboratories on opposite sides of the world Can publish papers on the same neuron knowing that it's the same neuron in the 2 different laboratories, something that is extremely hard to do in any Mammalian model Right. Mouse or certainly in humans and, has posed huge challenges that, give great advantages to studies of things like C. Elegans.[1:15:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. So ceiligants, this is the star now of of what what and and this is what what we study. These are nematodes, small worms, round worms That is just 1 millimeter long, so you can't see them with the naked eye. You have to look under the scope.[1:16:02] Andrew Huberman: Where do they live in the in the natural world?[1:16:06] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So they they used to call them soil nematode, but this is not really true. They are they are in many places, but they're mostly in in rotten fruits and leaves. And, you can find them in the ground as well, but you can also find them and and they are free living, so they're not parasites, but you can sometimes also find them in snails. Okay. But but the best way to isolate them is from rotten fruits.[1:16:28] Speaker 2: Okay. Yep.[1:16:28] Andrew Huberman: I like the idea that they're not parasites. I I'm one of these people that gets a little squeamish about the notion of parasites.[1:16:33] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. So so they're not parasites. They're really fun to handle because they're so small and easy. You just grow them on plates with Edgar and E. Coli bacteria.[1:16:40] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is what they eat in the lab. You can just pick them with, with a small, pick, wire pick, move them around and Change their their genes and do many things to them. But but they have many advantages for neuroscience and for studying inheritance. As you mentioned, they have Always certain number of cells in the body. So a silicon stethoscope always has 959 cells It's about it.[1:17:07] Dr. Oded Rechavi: That's it. Okay?[1:17:08] Andrew Huberman: Not 960. No. Not 958.[1:17:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: 959. Okay? Mhmm.[1:17:12] Speaker 2: And[1:17:12] Dr. Oded Rechavi: out of which, 302 Our neurons, always 302. There's a huge debate now over Twitter on whether it's 302 or 300. I, I mean, I don't wanna get into trouble. Okay? But people take this very, very, hard.[1:17:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I think it's 302, but wait. Let's not get into it because I'll get into trouble.[1:17:32] Andrew Huberman: Well, we can equilibrate all things here by you say 302, granted you're far more informed in this model organism than I am or ever will be. I'll say 300, and then we're balanced in terms of partisan politics in the C elegans community. Perfect. Right.[1:17:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So so so it's and it's always the same. And each has a name, Like you said, and when we not only does every neuron has a name, many of the of them, we know what they do. So there's a, a few cells that are sensory neurons that, sense particular chemicals. In certain situations, we'll know that a chemical will be sent just by 1 neuron. There are the motor neurons and internal neurons and all of that.[1:18:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We know how many dopamine neurons there and serotonin neurons, and And we know them all by their name. Not only that, we know how they are connected to one another. We have a mech, a connectome since the eighties, Like a subway map tells us which no one talks with which other no ones, and it is the same. Okay? It was used think to people thought that it was exactly the same between genetically agentical morphs.[1:18:35] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Now we know that there are slight differences, but By and large, it is the same. And we have a map, a road map that we can use to study.[1:18:42] Andrew Huberman: The so called connectome.[1:18:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The connectome. Not only that, the worms are transparent So we can actually see the neurons fire using particular tools. And we can activate genes And silo genes using optogenetics, like, was discussed, you know, on the podcast, we can make the worms go forward or backward or lay an egg By shining different wave of line of of light on them. And so we have very powerful tools for manipulating the Brain. On top of that, we have great understanding of the genetics of the one of of the genome.[1:19:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is silicon is the first Animal to have its its genome sequenced before humans. For that, of course, there were bacteria. But and, And we know that in each worm produce each mother produces about 250 babies, which are almost genetically identical. So we can and and we know what we get where we grow them. The the environment is very controlled.[1:19:45] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So we grow them in the plate with just bacteria. So we can easily separate between nature and nurture.[1:19:52] Andrew Huberman: And and one thing that, I wonder about often is generation time. You know? Even, Though mice are not humans, mice have certain advantages because they're mammalian species. You you can't do all the magnificent things you can do in C. Elegans in mice, but, one major issue with mice is that the generation time is somewhat long.[1:20:10] Andrew Huberman: You pair 2 mice, they mate. You get a mouse or litter of mice 21 days later. It might seem like, okay. That's only 21 days or so. But if you are a graduate student or postdoc trying to do a project, I mean, that can extend The time to do experiments out 3 or 4 years compared to what you could do in c elements.[1:20:28] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You're absolutely right. This is one of the major advantages. The generation time in silicons is 3 days 3 days. So you can do hundreds of worm generations in 1 PhD. This is very important.[1:20:40] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Not only that, every worm will produce hundreds of progeny so you will have that are genetically identical, so you will have great statistics for your experiment.[1:20:47] Andrew Huberman: And the worms probably don't mind living on these agar plates, you know, munching away on E. Coli where,[1:20:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It's the good life.[1:20:53] Andrew Huberman: You know, it's questionable whether or not mice or certainly, listen. I I I'm a proponent of well controlled, Over and as long as there's oversight, animal research, it's necessary for the development of treatments of diseases that, that, hinder humans. But it is always a little bit of a of a of a kind of a a cringe and go kind of thing when you're dealing with with mammals that are living so far outside their natural environment. Know, I'd be lying if I didn't say that it it gets to you after a while. And if it doesn't get you, you kind of have to wonder about your own psyche a bit.[1:21:23] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. I also think that this is important. But for me, it's much easier to work on worms. I don't have to, you know, feel bad about it.[1:21:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're happy.[1:21:33] Dr. Oded Rechavi: They're happy. And you also I mean, if if a if a worm dies, it's less painful to the human than if, and other More sensitive animals.[1:21:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I would argue. Yes. I agree. Yep.[1:21:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So, yes, there so there are many advantages for studying c elegans. And In the one, we now have very obvious and clear cut proof That there is inheritance of acquired trades. So much so that I don't think that anyone pretty much in the epigenetic field argues against it.[1:22:07] Andrew Huberman: Well and in large part, thanks to you and the work you've done. So could you tell us what was the first experiment that you did on C. Elegans that Confirmed for you that there is inheritance of acquired traits. Because, of course, like, the best experiments and experimenters, always set out to disprove their hypothesis. And when the hypothesis survives, despite all the control experiments and Poking and prodding and, attempts to contradict oneself[1:22:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Mhmm.[1:22:37] Andrew Huberman: Then it's considered a victory. But it's one that you have to be, We all have to be very cautious about enjoying because, of the tendency to want our our hypotheses to be true. So what was the first experiment where you were convinced that Inheritance of acquired traits is real.[1:22:52] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The 1st experiment I did was when I in my postdoc, which I did with Oliver Hobert in University of Columbia, we set to test whether worms can produce transgenerational For long multiproduct generation, the resistance to viruses.[1:23:12] Andrew Huberman: Oh, wow. This is a very pertinent topic.[1:23:14] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Which is relevant. And and Warms these worms don't have dedicated immune cells like we do. They don't have t cells or b cells. They defend themselves from viruses Very efficiently using RNA. So in fact, when we started these experiments, there wasn't any natural vials that was known to infect C.[1:23:35] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Elegans, which is amazing because viruses are very good as we all experience now in infecting. And the the worms are resistant to viruses because of RNA molecules short RNA molecules that destroy viruses. And these are called small RNAs. Now we need to discuss them before I explain my experiment. In 2006, 2 researchers that were studying c elegans, Andrew Feil and and Craig Mello got the Nobel Prize for showing That there is a mechanism that regulate genes that happens for small RNAs.[1:24:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: What they've shown is that if you Inject the worms with RNA molecules with our which are double stranded. They lead to the site to to they shut off the genes that correspond that that match in sequence to this RNA.[1:24:34] Andrew Huberman: So sort of like taking the specific instructions for the coffee table from your IKEA, handbook, and you Insert a copy of that into the book, and in doing so, you prevent the expression of, you sort of erase the original page.[1:24:50] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Perfect explanation. Perfect explanation. And for for they found that double strand RNA RNA that was 2 strands is what starts the response Leading to the production of small RNA molecules, which are the ones that actually find the messenger RNA and leads to its destruction. Silence it so you don't get proteins in the end. For that, they got the Nobel Prize after people found that this is conserved in many organisms, including humans.[1:25:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And now there are now drugs. Was only in 2006 that the the Nobel Prize. The paper was published in 98. There are now drugs that use this mechanism also in new in in humans.[1:25:27] Andrew Huberman: And I'll just interject and say that not only is it a recent discovery and an incredibly important one, but Andy Fire and Craig Mello are also really nice people. Yeah. They just happen to be very nice people. And Craig Mills is an excellent, I think he's a kite surfer. When I, the only time I met him in person was at a meeting and he had a black eye.[1:25:45] Andrew Huberman: And I thought, okay. Wow. I guess he's also a pugilist or something, but turns out he had, done that kite surfing. So scientists actually do things other than, go to the laboratory, Nobel Prize winning scientist that is. Okay.[1:25:59] Andrew Huberman: I'll let you continue. Thanks for allowing that.[1:26:01] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. Incredible scientists. And There were also, studies in many organisms on the mechanisms of how this happens. It is called RNA intercedents. RNA interferes in the expression of a gene in the in the function of a gene.[1:26:15] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it's also also called gene silencing because these RNAs enforce the Silencing of genes instead of the genes being expressed. They have silenced it, and you don't manifest the function. Okay? Already in this pay the 1st paper that they published about this, where they've shown the double stranded RNA is what leads to the silencing of the control. They've shown 2 very important things.[1:26:38] Dr. Oded Rechavi: One of them is that if you inject the worms with double stranded RNA, you don't only see the Action in the cell that you injected or in the tissue that you injected, but you see it all over the worm's body. It spreads. It wasn't exactly clear what spreads, but it was clear that it spreads. You see the silencing all over the body. This includes also The germ cells.[1:27:04] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So if you inject the double stranded RNA just to somatic cells, even to the head, You will get also the effect in the germ cells and in the next generation. K? In the immediate progeny, the f one generation, The the kids. So this was really clear proof that this is inherited. However, this is Just 1 generation, okay, in this original study.[1:27:31] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Later they've shown something which will immediately remind you what I told you about with planaria. That you can just take worms and feed them on bacteria that produce this double stranded RNA. And that the and the silencing would move from the site of ingestion from the gut where the bacteria are eaten To the rest of the body and also to the next generation. Okay? So before we left, when I mentioned this cannibalistic experiments of with the planaria.[1:28:00] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And now you see that it can happen. And and this is not controversial at all. This is being done routinely every day by any C. Elegans biologist in the world. This is has been replicated a 1000000 times.[1:28:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Not only that, you can also feed planaria, these other worms With RNA, you can just put it in chopped liver and let them eat it. And again, this will synergies throughout the body. Okay.[1:28:25] Andrew Huberman: Wild. Okay.[1:28:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this is what we do, Utili. We always when we want we use this technique to see what genes do. If you want to see whether a particular gene is important for a certain behavior or or for for a certain something, The way to study is is to neutralize the gene activity. And we do it by just introducing the worms with double stranded RNA that correspond in sequence, that match and sequence this gene. This will lead to the silencing.[1:28:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This activate the gene's activity. And then we and if then the the the Effect stops. We know this gene is is involved in the in the function. And we never wanna just examine 1 worm. So We feed the mother with double stranded RNA, and then we examine all of its children so we can have the statistics over hundreds of worms or thousands of worms.[1:29:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So this is validated and not controversial at all and totally routine.[1:29:18] Andrew Huberman: Is it fair to say that McConnell's experiments of, chop blending up these worms. Very graphic image. Blending up these worms and then feeding them to other worms, planaria, that Those experiments can, yes, be explained by, double stranded RNA, which and through RNA interference.[1:29:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It hasn't been done yet. We are working on it in in my lab now in collaboration with other labs.[1:29:42] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic.[1:29:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: But it wasn't published. But, yes, this this could be the explanation. Okay? So, so Fire and Mello did these experiments. Some other people did these experiments.[1:29:54] Dr. Oded Rechavi: When I Started my work. I wanted to see whether in addition to artificial double stranded RNA, some natural traits can can also transmit across generations because of RNA, because of small RNA.[1:30:07] Andrew Huberman: Right. Because, injecting RNAi or, in intermediate short end of the ring RNAs, That is or, you know, putting worms into an environment with an abundance of inhibitory RNAs as an experiment is very different than Worms experiencing something and then passing on that acquired trait to their offspring. And it's it's a world apart in my opinion. It does. Manipulation that illustrates an underlying principle.[1:30:32] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. The other is something that in theory occurs in the passage of of generations just naturally.[1:30:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We're going from the less artificial to the more artificial. The the advantages, just like with model organisms, that the more artificial it is, the easy it is to an you know exactly what you did. Just now introduce 1 factor and you can follow the result. So this is always the trade. What I did was in Oliver's lab is to see whether the magic part of the magic for the worms resistance to viruses is the capacity to transmit information In the form of RNA molecules, inhibitory RNA molecules to the next generations.[1:31:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it has been shown before in c elegans that the worms Resist viruses be using this mechanism, the small RNAs. K? In fact, this is probably the reason that these small RNAs evolved in the 1st place, To get rid of viruses and other, parasitic genomic elements, and this is a mechanism to Fight them. And what I I did is a very simple experiment. I took worms and I infected them with the virus.[1:31:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: When you do this, this also has been shown in the past. The worms destroy the virus. Okay? We demonstrated this Very clearly using a a fluorescent virus. So when if the if if the virus replicates Successfully, the worms just turns green.[1:32:01] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And if the virus is destroyed, the worm stays black. This is very simple. It's a clear cut off. It's not This you don't examine the worm and ask whether it feels good. You just see this green light.[1:32:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Binary response. Yes. Yeah. And so we we took worms. We infect them with the fluorescent virus.[1:32:19] Dr. Oded Rechavi: They destroy it. This also has been done in the past. But then what we did is we neutralized The machinery that makes small RNAs in the descendants of the worms. So they cannot make small RNAs From the start on their own because they just don't have the genes that you need to to make this more or less. Okay?[1:32:41] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And then we ask When we will what will happen when we'll affect these worms with the vials? Will they be green or black? They can't make their own small RNAs. So they can't protect themselves on their own. The only way for them to stay black for have them not having the virus applicate is if they inherit the small on their pet.[1:33:01] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this is exactly what happens. All the worms progeny, although they don't have the gene that is needed for making the small RNAs are black. They sign the virus. And this also continues for additional generations. Okay?[1:33:13] Andrew Huberman: So the the parent worms effectively put something into the Genetic instructions of the offspring that would afford them, this let's call it an advantage in this case. Right. Afford them an advantage If they were to be confronted with the same thing that the parents were.[1:33:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. And we know exactly what this advantage is. The the advantages are small RNAs that match the viral genome. Then just chop up that virus in the next generation. And we can identify these small RNAs in the the the inhibitor RNAs in the descendants, although they don't have the machinery to make it Just because in her we can identify them by sequencing.[1:33:53] Dr. Oded Rechavi: By RNA sequencing, which is like DNA sequencing. You actually Get the actual sequence of the RNA molecules, and we can see that they correspond to the virus. And they have they inherited small RNAs only if their their parents were infected with them.[1:34:06] Andrew Huberman: So there's specificity there.[1:34:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: There's specificity.[1:34:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's not some just general, resilience passage.[1:34:12] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right.[1:34:13] Andrew Huberman: I have to be careful in drawing an analogy that isn't correct, And I wanna acknowledge that what I'm about to say, with certainty cannot be entirely correct. But the the analogy that comes to mind in mammals is this idea that if 1 generation is Dressed that their offspring may, in some cases, have a higher stress threshold, resilience to stress. I could imagine why that would be advantageous. Right. Your parents have a hard life.[1:34:37] Andrew Huberman: They have offspring, and they want their children to have a higher threshold of stress because stress can inhibit reproduction, etcetera. And I always say, you know, at the at the end of the day and at the end of life, evolution is about the offspring, not about the parents. And every species pretty much Seems to want to make more of itself and protect its young one way or another, either through nature or through nurture. This is a nature based protection of young. Is it fair to say that In the mammalian experiment with a passage of stress resilience, that it could be RNA based, That that would be, perhaps, set some new threshold on glucocorticoid production.[1:35:14] Andrew Huberman: Here, I'm speculating, but I and I wanna highlight that I'm speculating. I'm speculating with a reason, which is, I think, for people that are hearing about this in worms, you've done a beautiful, job of splaying out why, model organisms are really important. But to think about how this operate in in our in the passage of human generations, I think is a reasonable thing to entertain.[1:35:32] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. And and it it is true that also in in, mammals, Now RNAs and small RNAs are a leading candidate for something that could mediate the transmission of of Stress protection or also of harmful effects to transmit between generations. Perhaps RNA do it. However, In worms, the RNAs have one more trick that we don't we don't know the equivalent in mammals yet. This is something very crucial that we showed in that particular paper in the first paper.[1:36:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Which is? So the effect that I described, this transmission of resistance of viruses Through these RNAs, doesn't only affect the next generation. It also affect multiple additional generations.[1:36:15] Andrew Huberman: So it gets passed?[1:36:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It's get passed and you have to ask yourself, how doesn't it get dilutes? Why why isn't it diluted? Right? Because, I mean, everyone produces 250 babies. So you dilute by 250.[1:36:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And if something is diluted for 4 generations, so it's 250 times 252. After 4 generations, it's a dilution of 4,000,000,000 completely homeopathic would never work. Okay? It's just there's nothing left. The secret of these worms is that they have a machinery for amplifying the small RNAs in every generation.[1:36:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: K. This is called RNA dependent RNA polymers. It's a complex Which uses the RNA to find and and once it finds the messenger RNA, just create many, many, many, many smaller they don't get diluted, and they pass on for additional generations. Mhmm. Okay?[1:37:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this is the the trick. We later also identify genes that regulate For how long an effect would last? Otherwise I mean, in the if if in beginning, we ask why does how doesn't it after 1 generation, now we have to ask why doesn't it last forever? And it doesn't. Typically, we see that the responses last Not only with the valvulopathy, but also with other traits for a few generations, 3 to 5 generations.[1:37:34] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We found genes that Function as a sort of a a clock. The times the duration of the inheritance.[1:37:40] Andrew Huberman: What what sorts of genes are those?[1:37:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So we call these genes Motic genes. Motic, I don't know how is your Hebrew, but motex mean it means sweetheart in Hebrew. But the acronym is modified transgenerational epigenetic in head kinetics. There there are different types of genes like that. And for some of them, if you mutate, if you Disrupt their function.[1:38:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Now now the effect would transmit stably for 100 of generations. It would never stop. Because their role is to stop the inheritance From going from from just you don't wanna carry over something forever. Otherwise, you would it will no longer fit the environment of the parents, and you'll be prepared for the wrong things. So this is important.[1:38:23] Dr. Oded Rechavi: There are what type of genes are they? One gene that we studied, it's called MET 2. It's actually a gene that, functions in methylation of the of the proteins that condense the DNA. So this is, and there are but when there are other genes that affect also production[1:38:41] Andrew Huberman: Is there some mechanism that controls the duration of passage in a way that logically links up with the lifespan of the organism. So for instance, I knew my grandparents, met them. I did not ever meet my great grandparents, and I certainly didn't meet my great great grandparents. I could imagine that my great great grandparents my great grandparents experienced certain things that were passed into their children and and, perhaps into their children. But It seems reasonable given that humans live somewhere between 0 and, a 100 years.[1:39:17] Andrew Huberman: Typically, what now? 80 years. Is that the typical lifespan? More or less. Okay.[1:39:22] Andrew Huberman: That the if I were gonna design the system and, again, I was not consulted at the design phase. I would want an adaptive, trait to be passed for 2 generations because given the way that our Given how long our species lives and certainly given the way the world looks now as opposed to the turn of the the previous century or the turn of the previous century, Different stressors, different adapt you know, different life environments. Mhmm. And what I would want to pass on to my offspring, I can basically Hedge pretty well. I can place a good bet on the next 100 years, maybe the next 200, but I don't have the foggiest clue what The world is gonna look like in 300 years.[1:40:02] Andrew Huberman: Is is what I'm saying make any sense whatsoever?[1:40:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It makes a lot of sense. And really, it we need to to talk about 2 things in response to this First of all, yes. You can imagine that the reason that the worms in hertz typically for 3 to 5 generations is that is relevant to something that happened in the environment. For example, we also show that when you starve the worms, it affects the next generations again for A few generations.[1:40:28] Andrew Huberman: Which itself is amazing. Right? I just, like, wanna highlight that that I mean, you can imagine next generation sort of like A genetic version of be careful kids, but I'm gonna give you this extra lunch pack in your genome that protects you against the possibility of starvation. It's also saying, and were you to have kids[1:40:44] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right.[1:40:45] Andrew Huberman: They have it also.[1:40:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. So I have to but just I I have to just make a disclaim that we not don't know that necessarily it's adaptive. Could also be damaged. As I said, when you starve them, the next generations live longer, but this could be a trade off of a trade off for fertility or something. So Other labs is also have also shown following our work that if you starve the worms, the next generations are also more resistance to household starvation.[1:41:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This sounds This is not my artwork, but this sounds adaptive. Mhmm. Okay? But when whenever you're talking about the adaptation, you have to see it in the context of evolution. There's also this famous saying, nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.[1:41:21] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And so it's it's very hard to say without doing the Lab evolution experiments, we actually see who wins, the ones that inherit or the ones who don't have it. Who takes over? Otherwise, it's it's hard to talk about whether it's adaptive or not. But when it comes to the duration of the response, yes, it could be programmed to fit something. For example, if you're talking about starvation, Warms transition between periods of starvation and trans periods where they have a lot of food.[1:41:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So let's say they find an apple. For a few generations, they will consume the apple, and then they will be starved for a while. Perhaps this is the number of generations that takes them to finish an apple, Oh, perhaps, there are other responses also to higher temperatures. If you grow worms in higher temperatures, the offerings are diff different. They change How they mate is what I'm I alluded to before.[1:42:09] Andrew Huberman: We're gonna get back to this because it relates to cold exposure, which many listeners are And[1:42:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: perhaps It is somehow correlated with, the cycle of the year. Okay? But to tell you the truth, I don't know. As I said, we we, we go from the more artificial to the less artificial. If double stranded, just synthetic RNA is the most artificial.[1:42:32] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Starvation is not more natural, but it's not starvation in real the real context of the world in a real apple. It's it's a plate with or without E. Coli bacteria, but it's not an apple on a tree exposed to the elements With other worms, with bacteria, with all kinds of complications. And it could be that we will see different durations of heritable effects. The more natural we go, it's just much less controllable and hard to do.[1:42:58] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Mhmm. And, again, when when we're talking about humans, part of the argument why people While the disbelievers it's not about faith. But, you know, the the critics say that this wouldn't happen in humans is they say, You know, the the warm generation time is just 3 days. The chances that the parents' environment will match the children's environment is very high. Because,[1:43:21] Speaker 2: there[1:43:21] Dr. Oded Rechavi: there's not a lot of time to for for the environment to change it. Plus they can go very far, small. There are many examples of epigenetic inheritance in plants. This is a big field where the very established, proof for inheritance of acquired trait. For for epigenetic inheritance, I'll be more careful.[1:43:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Epigenetic, inherits the acquired trait is more loaded But in plants, it also happens. And there you also say these are sessile organisms. They can't run away, so the environment is more constant.[1:43:50] Andrew Huberman: Well, ideas, maybe just a quick example that I've heard before. Tell me if I'm wrong. I very well maybe. For instance, a a particular, species or plant that grows a a straight, maybe slightly bended stalk might be exposed to some environment where in order to capture enough, Sunlight and other other nutrients might need to grow in a corkscrew form. The corkscrew form can be inherited several generations.[1:44:13] Andrew Huberman: Yes.[1:44:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is an example that I don't know, but perhaps[1:44:15] Andrew Huberman: if there Something like that.[1:44:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I seem[1:44:17] Andrew Huberman: to someone will tell trust me.[1:44:18] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The one[1:44:18] Andrew Huberman: thing we know about podcasting and YouTube is someone will tell us in the comments. So, Ben, please do. We invite that.[1:44:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. But there's a long history of epigenetic inheritance studies in plants with excellent studies, Well control showing that it happens also there. So this is very clear. When it comes to humans, you could say maybe my kids will go off to live in a different Continent. And they will be on the computer every day.[1:44:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Everything will be different. So it makes less sense to prepare them For the same hardships that I experienced. However, this, in my opinion, this is this argument comes a lot. It's not the best Argument because it depends on the scale of of how you look at things. We experience we we meet, for example.[1:45:02] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I'm not saying that this is inherited, but in humans, but We experience the same pathogens in the same viruses all the time. So perhaps it is worth preparing for that.[1:45:09] Speaker 2: Right.[1:45:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Again, I'm not saying that that it happens, But but it depends on the on the on the scale.[1:45:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, what you're describing makes perfect sense, and I do want to acknowledge these critics whoever they may be. I do have the advantage that I don't work in this exact field, and so I'm I'm happy to stand, on toe to toe with those critics now and say that At least in terms of an inheritance of reactions or adaptive or maladaptive traits To stress or to reward. You talked about nicotine before. You know, passage of response to drugs of different kinds not being specific to nicotine. It was sort of a more general, passage of of some sort of information related to, reactions to chemicals present in nicotine, but other other drugs.[1:45:54] Andrew Huberman: I have long been irritated and a little bit tickled by the fact that people say, oh, you know, we have this system for Stress that was really designed to keep us, you know, safe from lions and saber toothed tigers. Sure. But the hallmark of the stress system is that it generalizes. I mean, if I get a troubling text message or if I suddenly see a dark figure in the in the hallway when I go to the bathroom at night that I don't recognize, Both of those have the same generic response, which is the deployment of adrenaline, in both brain and body, you know, changes in the optics of the eyes, quickening of the heart rate. Stress is by design generic, and so one could imagine that a passage of of some sort of stress resilience, or a maladaptive passage to stress would be also somewhat generic, and that's actually advantageous overall.[1:46:41] Andrew Huberman: Same thing with the reward system. You know? We essentially have One or 2 chemical systems of reward. I mean, there's the opioid system and there's, like, a cannabinoid system. But in large part, anticipation and reward is governed by the dopamine circuits, And anticipation reward of an ice cream cone for a kid is the same neural circuitry that's going to be repurposed When they get to reproductive age and they are anticipating, creating children with their mate and assuming they want to do that, the dopaminergic system's gonna be engaged.[1:47:08] Andrew Huberman: So ice cream, sex, you know, stress to weather, stress to famine, the the biology of of these more modal systems and especially in the nervous system are again, I have to be careful with the words by design, are certainly generic. And so I don't see the need for so for immense specificity. I mean, it's not like we're, well, COVID just happened. So could you imagine that there's the passage of a a COVID nineteen specific resilience? No.[1:47:36] Andrew Huberman: I think what would probably be, passed along would be some sort of if it does occur, would be some sort of resilience to viruses more generally, And that would be advantageous.[1:47:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. So I I agree. And this this opens the question of what is the bandwidth of inheritance? How specific that it makes sense for it to be specific. And in the case of c elegans, the response can be very specific inheritance of RNA's, which are just sequence specific, they down regulate they they they control one particular gene.[1:48:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay? In other cases, It could be a very general response. And and and and it's very interesting to think about it when we talk about inheritance of memories, Which is the most interesting thing we could imagine. Can brain activity of some sort transmit at least in these words? I said, Noah, I I said this disclaimer multiple times in in in members.[1:48:30] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We don't know. Times will tell. In worms, we we know a lot. So can worms transmit brain activity to to do they have the specificities to do it? Okay?[1:48:40] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Before I'll say that, just said that we, over the years, learned a lot about the mechanisms that shuttle the RNAs between generations. We know about genes that are needed just for that. About worms, it would be perfectly okay, but just don't have the capacity to transfer the RNAs to the next generations. We know about genes that will make the responses Longer or shorter. We know about genes that prevent the transfer of RNA between different tissues.[1:49:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: About genes that make certain small RNA. So we know a lot about that. And then the question arises, we can we can finally ask, can memory transfer between generation? I think that first of all, we need to define memory for this. And the broadest definition would be any, change in your behavior because of what happened in the past Or in your response because what happened in the past or because of your history.[1:49:32] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The more interesting part, of course, is to talk about memories that are encoded in the brain. And the reason is that the brain is capable of holding much more specific and elaborate memories. Then I think that any tissues that transmit to transmit RNA to the next generation and affect the next generation is interesting. The gut, muscles, everything. But the brain Can synthesize information about the environment and about internal state and can also think ahead.[1:50:00] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And the most provocative thing you can say is that you could plan how somehow the fate of your of your nation using your brain. You know, after many things into the This is[1:50:10] Andrew Huberman: Without talking to them.[1:50:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. Without talking. Alright.[1:50:13] Andrew Huberman: And the instruction so it's again, we go back to this instruction manual. Like writing something into the instruction manual based on your own experience.[1:50:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. And and can it happen? Okay. And what is the bandwidth? Can we transfer specific things?[1:50:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And And then I have to agree with you that I would imagine that what can transfer, and I could be wrong, is a general Something. Sensitivity. Okay? We can make the analogy to being inflamed or not. Hypersensitive to pathogens, hyper hypervigil, something.[1:50:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay? But it can also be something very specific. We now we have to we have to understand that the brain uses a different language than the language of inheritance. The brain, the way we normally think about the brain is that it keeps information in Synapses in the connections between different neurons. When you learn something, you make you make some connections stronger and some connect other connections weaker.[1:51:14] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And you wire Nervous system in a different way. The information in the brain is synaptic, and it it is in the connections. On the other hand, Hereditary information of any sort has to go through a bottleneck of 1 cell, the fertilized egg, Because we all start from just 1 cell. So it cannot be in the connections because this cell doesn't have any connections with other cell there alone. So we do so heritable information has to be molecular.[1:51:42] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It has to be inside this one cell. So the question is, can you or do you translate the information? This free restructure information Of synapses and the connection between brains in the architecture of the brain, can you somehow translate it to heritable information to a molecular form?[1:51:58] Andrew Huberman: It's an incredibly important and deep question. It brings to mind something that was once told to me, which as soon as I heard it was obvious, but was very important In formulating my, understanding of biology, which is that, a map is just the transformation of one set of points into another set of points. Right? So a map of of the world essentially is just you take the what's been drawn out in terms of the architecture and the The coastlines, etcetera, and divisions between states, and you transfer that to an electronic map or a piece of paper. Seems so obvious as sort of a duh.[1:52:32] Andrew Huberman: Why are we talking about this? But just to make sure that people understand, what you're really talking about is, let's say, the memory, and I have a very distinct memory for, my childhood phone number. Phone number doesn't exist anymore.[1:52:44] Speaker 2: Mhmm. And I[1:52:44] Andrew Huberman: won't give it out because then some other person might get your return with repeated calls. But in any case, I remember it. It's totally useless information, but it lives in my Neocortex or my hippocampus or somewhere as a series of connections between neurons at the locations as you call synapses. Would my grandchildren know that phone number? There's no reason[1:53:03] Speaker 2: to know[1:53:04] Andrew Huberman: No. No. Right? Would my children know that? Unless there was some adaptive Reason or some other reason for them to know and the up and this passage of of acquired traits.[1:53:13] Andrew Huberman: And what you're saying is in order for that to happen, There has to be a transformation of the neural circuit, literally the wiring of neuron a, b, c, d that relates to and carries the information of that number into The kind of nucleotide sequences that are contained in DNA or patterns of methylation or RNA, more likely. So it's a transformation of one set of points in physical space to a translation of points in genetic space.[1:53:39] Speaker 2: Right.[1:53:39] Andrew Huberman: Does that make Right.[1:53:40] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And then we have many problems when it first of all, we don't know a mechanism translate between the 2 different languages, the language of the brain and the language of inheritance. We are not familiar with the mechanism like that. Second, the next generation, If it's not a worm, if it's a mammal, we'd have a different brain. Even if it's if if even if it was genetically identical to the parent, The the wiring of the brain and the particular neuronal circuits will be different. This is true for twins.[1:54:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It will always be true because it depends because it's partially random and it depends on the environment even if you have the same genetic instructions. So let's say you somehow had the mechanism, miracle mechanism to take the three d information and translate it to the magic to the language of inheritance. Would then in the next generation have to translate it again to the brain, although it is different. This sounds very unlikely. You.[1:54:35] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Mhmm. I I'm playing a trick on you now. Okay? Because I'm gonna leave it.[1:54:41] Andrew Huberman: Okay. But I'm easy to[1:54:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay. But but but but if if this is how it happened or if this was required, it could never happen in my opinion. Which means and I still think that there are certain memories that cannot transfer transgenerational. This complex and things that you learn about the environment that are arbitrary. If you if I none of our listeners' kids will remember this conversation.[1:55:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: No way. This is impossible.[1:55:06] Andrew Huberman: Unless they're listening. Not There are some families or parents that tell me[1:55:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: they're listening to that. But but but it cannot transmit because it's it's random. And it's these are connections that are arbitrary. So this seems to be a limitation on what can transfer. On the other hand so so perhaps more general things could pass.[1:55:27] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Some these these type of things, I doubt take it. However, you can nevertheless imagine that some things that are very specific, Some memories that are very, very specific could nevertheless transmit from the brain after learning to the next stage. I'll give you an example. You can teach worms even though though they have just 302 neurons, you can teach them simple things about the world. For example, you can take an odor that the worms like.[1:55:50] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The worms have Thousands of odorant receptors, and they can recognize many, many, many molecules. They can smell them so they can find food or avoid Enemies. You can take a food that the worms an odor that the worms like and pair it to something bad like starvation. And then the worms will learn to dislike this auto. We don't know that this learning involves necessarily Changing in the strength of synapses, it's a possibility.[1:56:18] Dr. Oded Rechavi: But it doesn't have to be the case. It could be that just the receptor for this particular odor is being removed when they and this is how they live. Now they won't have the receptacle. They won't smell. They won't like the odor.[1:56:30] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is a possibility. This type of thing, you can perhaps, not that anyone has showed it convincingly, transmit to the next generation because All it would take is an RNA that with will control this particular receptor. Mhmm. Okay? So this is a possible.[1:56:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: People have shown things like that not in C elegans, but people have shown things like this in mammals. They said that you learn certain thing, and then just in the next generation, that's a particular receptor would be methylated or would change, And this would transmit the response. And on the one hand, it could be true. On the other hand, you need to understand They'll need to prove, and this wasn't done convincingly enough yet, how exactly does information transfer from the brain to the germ cells, and then in the next generation from the germ cells back the brain to where the receptor need the receptor need to operate. And this is a challenge.[1:57:27] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is the current state of of the field that this is something that needs to be proven. What we did in C. Elegans is we showed that certain, that the brain can communicate with the next generations using small RNAs. And the disc can change behavior. And it doesn't require any translating between any language.[1:57:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It is very simple. What we've shown is that if you take a worm and you change the production of small RNAs just in its brain, In the next generations, their behavior will be different even though you don't mess with their brains. This is a paper that we published in 2000 and in nineteen in cell, we show that you just manipulate the production of endogenous natural RNAs in the worms brain that are always made, but you you change their amount. And this changes the capacity of the worms in the next generation to find food. To find not only in 1 generation, but 3 generations down the road.[1:58:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And the way that it works is that Per trobing the production of these small RNAs in the brain affect, in the end, the expression of a gene In the germline, 1 gene is called Sage 2. Don't know how it works. But we can do all kinds of controls where we manipulate of the gene and see that this also affects behavior. And this gene works in the jumpsets. The information needs to go from the brain the germsis, it doesn't need to go back from the germsis to the brain to affect behavior.[1:58:57] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this depends we know that this is a 2 epigenetic effect because It goes on for multiple generations. And also because it requires the machinery that transfers RNA between generations. If you don't have that protein that physically carries the RNA between generation, doesn't happen.[1:59:12] Andrew Huberman: So it has to be RNA?[1:59:14] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It has to be RNA.[1:59:15] Andrew Huberman: And,[1:59:16] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And not we can actually we can also find the RNAs in the next generation that change. We sequence the actual RNAs that change in the next generation.[1:59:24] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned that you don't know what sage this gene sage does. Mhmm. But is it reasonable to assume that it does something in the context of the nervous system, or that's unclear as well?[1:59:33] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It is possible. It is possible, but we have reasons to believe or experiments to to show, although There could be alternative explanations that it functions for the germline. Now you may ask, how can you affect behavior just by changing the germ cells? Right?[1:59:50] Andrew Huberman: Well, it would have to change the germ cells in very specific ways because as, people probably recall, the germ line the germ cells are where the inheritable information is contained. But you can imagine it, for instance, adjusting the gain or sensitivity rather on, some sort of sensory foraging system. Right?[2:00:13] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. And and the the the interesting thing is that it again can be quite Unspecific. So it sounds weird that you change germ cells and it changes behavior, experiment. But if you think about it, it's trivial. If you castrate a dog, it behaves differently.[2:00:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right?[2:00:30] Andrew Huberman: Sadly, yeah. I did that to my dog, and I ended up putting him on testosterone therapy later, and it brought him back. Yeah. Just as a as a sigh as an aside.[2:00:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. This is because the germ cells affect the soma, including the brain, in many ways by secreting Certain chemicals. And also because this the other cells develop develop from the from the germ cells. So some information could be transmitted Over development or the course of development could be altered because of changes that occur in the germ cells. And and for example, in mammals, one of the explanations, for how heritable information transmits is that it just affects something very on in development.[2:01:10] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I I I told you that the secrets to worms inheritance is that they have the capacity to amplify these small RNAs all the time. This is what keeps it going and Prevents the dilution. In mammals, we don't know of such an amplification mechanism. So you ask, how can a little bit of RNA or something without amplifying affect the entire organism. And it could be that you just perturb something in the very beginning, in when you just have a few cells or even if the in the placenta That develops in pregnancy.[2:01:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And this later throws everything off. And because of that, you have you have many problems in metabolism and so on. And this is called the the it's it's an idea of the develop developmental origin of health and disease. Many of the of the functions occur early on in development.[2:01:55] Andrew Huberman: So you raise a number of incredibly fascinating aspects of this. I I do have a question about 1 particular aspect, and feel free to pass on this for a future episode if it's gonna take us too far off track. But something you said, it really captured my attention, although I was listening to all of it, which is that the germ cells so in the Case of males, it's gonna be sperm, and in the case of females, it can be eggs. Something perhaps not coincidental about those cells in the environment that they Live in is that, yes, they contain the genetic information to pass to offspring. Right?[2:02:28] Andrew Huberman: Of course, you explain how that works. But, also, it's a So it it those cells live in a region that is rich with hormones that can be secreted and, in fact, are Created and through so called endocrine signaling, communicate with other cells, not just at the level of receptors on their surface, but also can enter the genomes of those cells and modify those cells. Those cells. In other words, it seems to me that the microenvironment to the germ cells, the testes and the ovaries, are Rich with information, not just for the passage to next generations, but also for all the, as you said, all the somatic cells of the body, They're telling the somatic cells of the body what to do and what to become. And the best example I can think about this would be puberty.[2:03:09] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, I would argue that the that one of the greatest, rates of aging and and transitions we go through in life is from puberty. I mean, a child becomes a very different person after puberty. They look at the world differently. They think about it differently.[2:03:22] Andrew Huberman: Growth of it's not just about the growth of the hair and the jaw and the Adam's apple and breasts and so on. It's a transformation of the somatic cells from the same microenvironment that the DNA containing, cells reside.[2:03:36] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. So once you think about it like this, It becomes obvious that just by affecting the germ cells, you can affect the rest of the body. And in C. Elegans, there are experiments that show it very clearly. So for example, if you type Just take worms and prevent sperm production.[2:03:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It changes the capacity to smell. These are experiments done by others, which is obviously a brain function.[2:04:00] Andrew Huberman: And in a castrated dog, you're not just eliminating the the Possibility of transfer of DNA information to subsequent, generations. You're also limiting communication of the yeah. Oh, without question, my bulldog, Costello, changed after castration, And it was a wonderful dog, but at some point developed some health issues. The introduction of a small amount of testosterone every other day changed him fundamentally, in that case, for the better, back to a version of himself that I'd only observed earlier, but also a different Version of the same dog. And, no, he wasn't humping everything, maybe the occasional knee, particular people who whose names I won't mention, but It was absolutely clear that the hormone was not just taking a system and amplifying it.[2:04:40] Andrew Huberman: It was actually modifying the system. So, anyway, I just wanted to, highlight that. And then now, thank you for indulging me. I let's, if you will, let's continue down this path of, that we were going on because I wanna make sure that we absolutely get to this issue of transmission of information about sex choice of offspring.[2:04:59] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So the worms are hermaphrodites, which means that they make both sperm and an egg. But there are also males which are much more rare. And they can choose to mate with their males or not. And when they mate with the male, it's a huge decision because It's very costly, energetically, and they also risk predation and all kinds of troubles. The males hurt them and reduce their lifespan when they met with them.[2:05:25] Andrew Huberman: People are gonna draw all sorts of analogies here, but it's inevitable. But, hey, here we go. Yes. So[2:05:30] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And and most importantly for evolution, when you mate With another animal, you dilute your genome in half. Because the worms can just self fertilize and transmit the exact same genome to the next generation. But when they mate, they dilute it in half. So this is a big price to pay. On the other hand, when you mate, you diversify your genome.[2:05:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So maybe some combination of gene will be good.[2:05:54] Andrew Huberman: And we know that in humans I mean, you know, it's kind of interesting that the brain circuits that are associated, with a with a version and with approach are, Fairly hardwired for a number of things, like puddle of vomit. Almost everybody kinda cringes. Plate of cookies. If you like cookies, you move towards it. There's one particular word in, the English and presumably the Israeli language that that ought to evoke disgust, and that's incest.[2:06:17] Andrew Huberman: Because incest is actually not just disgusting as a practice, but it's dangerous genetically, right, because of the inbreeding creates[2:06:25] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. So there are studies on how people in Israeli kibbutz, for example, where they all grow together, the children live together. It used to be like that. Don't, date each other. Okay.[2:06:34] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is the classic thing. I talked to some of whom the keyboard, they told me that's not true. But but, yes, that there are studies like this that say but it makes sense.[2:06:41] Andrew Huberman: And in some countries, Scandinavian country or in Lapland and Iceland more populations are small, they keep exquisite records of lineage in order to avoid inbreeding.[2:06:50] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right.[2:06:50] Speaker 2: Yeah.[2:06:50] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. So you're absolutely right. But the worms, It's the safe choice for them is to self mate. And and if they mate with a male, they take a risk but they diversify. Okay.[2:07:02] Dr. Oded Rechavi: What what we found is that if you take the hermaphrodites, the the we can Call it the the female for just one second. And you stress it with high temperatures, then the next generations of worms For 3 generations, mate much more with males. And they do it because the the female starts secreting a pheromone that attracts the males.[2:07:26] Speaker 2: It's[2:07:26] Andrew Huberman: very cryptic, mechanism. It's not that she somehow changes and then goes seeking males. It's that it draws males there.[2:07:32] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It draws men. Oh, and we know how it works. We think we know how it works. What happens is that the stress, the high temperatures, compromise the production of sperm in the hermaphrodites. So the hermaphrodite don't they make sperm enough to to make make generations.[2:07:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: But the sperm, because of defective smaller inherits, because RNA is not are not inherited. Okay? The sperm is not made optimally, so they make less sperm. And when they don't make a lot of sperm, They feel that they don't sell fertilize correctly, so they call the males by secreting the pheromones so that it would provide It's on sperm, and they can continue to make babies. Okay?[2:08:09] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And we know this also from experiments. You just take hermaphrodites, and you kill its sperm, starts a crystal hormone, and the males come.[2:08:15] Andrew Huberman: It's a need based system. Exactly. Incredible. And I I hope people can appreciate as they're hearing this that none of this we assume. I'm not I don't know how to speak worm.[2:08:26] Andrew Huberman: None of this we assume is a conscious decision in these animals. They much like human mating behavior, which To us, always seems so conscious, but is being governed by both conscious and subconscious decision making. None of this is an active decision To secrete the hormone to draw in more males, it's simply a biasing of probabilities. Right? The hormone is now secreted in in greater quantities are more greater frequency.[2:08:51] Andrew Huberman: The males, therefore, approach more. So it's just increasing probability of interactions. Is that right?[2:08:55] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. What happens natural normally, if you don't the the ancestors is that the worms start secreting the pheromone only when they are old. It's also, you know, people will[2:09:05] Andrew Huberman: When they're run when they're running out of of their own fertility.[2:09:08] Speaker 2: Exact[2:09:08] Dr. Oded Rechavi: exactly. Because they only make the sperm at a particular time, and then they run out of stem. They cancel satellite, so they have to call the meds if they wanna continue to med.[2:09:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, this is sort of the, plastic surgery approach. Okay. I'll take the heat for that one. But, you know, but it's true. I think as as certain people age to a certain point and they feel that their fertility is waning, If they want offspring, they need to take any number of different approaches.[2:09:32] Andrew Huberman: They could get a here, we're talking about a female, but we could also do the reverse. Right? Sperm donor. Right? Or but if they want to attract a lifelong mate or co parent with somebody, oftentimes, they will, Do things to adjust their, attractiveness in any number of different ways, psychological attractiveness or physical attractiveness.[2:09:49] Andrew Huberman: I'm not afraid to bring this up because I think that the parallels are very important because I do think that every species and individuals within a species, of course, decides whether or not they wanna reproduce or not, but has an inherent understanding, conscious or subconscious, about where they reside in the arc of their lifespan. I do believe that, not just based on experience. Some people are very attuned to the the, passage of time being very fast, others very slow. I think that knowing how long your parents and their parents lived Makes a big difference. I have friends whose, fathers in particular died fairly young, and all these guys basically got married and had kids really young.[2:10:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Right. So here, the the luckily for me, I don't have to get into psychology of the worms. The explanation is just like an instinct. When they run out of sperm, they start to get the pheromones and attract the males. There are studies also in humans about older fathers The children of older fathers have more has a higher chance of have of becoming autistic.[2:10:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: There are studies[2:10:48] Andrew Huberman: 40 and up, But basically[2:10:49] Dr. Oded Rechavi: However, in this case, it's not clear that this is not that this is something epigenetics could be just because of DNA damage, you know, because it accumulates Yeah.[2:10:58] Andrew Huberman: And, actually, nowadays, they're, we have an episode on fertility coming up, both male and female fertility, and there's, there are actually DNA fragmentation kits for, at home DNA fragmentation kits are sperm analysis. You send the sperm back in. You don't need the DNA. People pipetting, semen at home would be an odd picture. Let's not go there.[2:11:15] Andrew Huberman: But the, but there are clinics that do this for a for a a nominal charge. But the, but it's yeah. I did wanna ask about autism and human disease in particular. Another thing that you hear sometimes and here I wanna acknowledge autism is on a spectrum. Some people get upset if you call it a disorder.[2:11:31] Andrew Huberman: There are some adaptive autistic traits and etcetera. But One thing that, often comes up is this idea that 2 people who are more of the kind of engineering, hard Science, if you will, of phenotype, mate and have children, higher probability of the offspring being on the spectrum. Some people would argue, ah, but that's already selecting for people that might have already been partially on the spectrum, so maybe it's a gene copy issue. I'm not asking you to comment on autism in particular, But when you hear things like that that, the children of older fathers, born from older fathers tend the higher probability of of autism, What is that at the level of intuition, does that strike you as an epigenetic phenomenon, as a nature nurture, mishmash, or the possibility that's RNA passage, or anything does anything sort of trigger the whiskers, your your your your By Descent.[2:12:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So in that case, I would go with the most parsimonious explanation, which is it just less fidelity or ever DNA less DNA maintenance and some damage that passes on. It doesn't have to be, an epigenetic thing.[2:12:39] Andrew Huberman: But the sperm are generated at once every 60 days. So the damage must be at the level of the germ cells not having the proper machinery Right. Mitochondria or something[2:12:48] Speaker 2: like that?[2:12:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Or or the DNA repair machinery. The DNA repair machinery could be defective or or could work less well in older people, leading to the constant production of Germ cells with more mutation, this is a possibility.[2:13:01] Andrew Huberman: Do we know exactly what the DNA repair machinery is?[2:13:04] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yes. There are many types of DNA repair. And there there was one that use, other copies of the DNA to to, to correct. There there are ones that just Recognize all kind of lesions on the DNA, and and remove it. It it's a very elaborate and complicated system.[2:13:23] Andrew Huberman: And is it a system that is now tractable that can be, modified through pharmacology or through anything like that?[2:13:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So I don't know about drugs that correct that improve it. Maybe they exist, and I'm not aware, but it's very well understood, and many people are studying these directions.[2:13:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. One thing that, Came across in the, exploration of the fertility work is that what I'm about to describe is not Legal in the US. It is illegal, but is legal in the UK and in other countries is this notion of 3 parent, IVF where It does seem that some of the eggs that persist in older females, don't, even if fertilized, don't produce healthy embryos. They have chromosomal abnormalities or replications and and, deletions that are problematic for the development of the embryo, such as trisomy 21 a k a Down syndrome in part or in large part because of deficits in the mitochondrial genome. So what they now do As they take the, because the mitochondrial genome resides mainly in the cytoplasm, they'll take the, an egg from the the mother, the sperm from the father, but they'll take the nucleus from the mother and put that into a cytoplasm of a younger woman whose mitochondrial DNA is healthy, then Use the sperm to fertilize that egg and then egg and that's why it's called 3 parent IVF, then implant that into the mother.[2:14:45] Andrew Huberman: And this has been done several times For in cases of mitochondrial damage or, or, mutations in the in the mother Mhmm. It works. The question is whether or not those offspring will grow up to be healthy. So this, of course, is not just a pure divergence. It raises a bigger question that I have for you, which is in terms of the work in either C.[2:15:04] Andrew Huberman: Elegans or in other model organisms, but in particular, in C. Elegans, where do you see this going next? And if you would indulge us, I would love for you to tell us a little bit about the Admittedly, unpublished work that you're doing on temperature, exposure, and environments. I mean, how malleable is this system? Because to me, it just seems Incredibly malleable, and yet a lot of us still cloaked off to us.[2:15:28] Andrew Huberman: There's still a ton to learn.[2:15:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So assuming that we will discover Similar things in in humans, which we don't know that this is the case, but let's say we we find it. I think there are many things you can do before you change it. For example, you could you could also change it change a a parent inheritance by, having the the parent exercise, for Some things like this have been done. For example, there are experiments in in the roll downs where it showed that overfeeding the, the the rodents creates problems for the next generations, for the f for the children. However, if you let the the the rodent exercise, Then it corrects the aberrant in health.[2:16:11] Dr. Oded Rechavi: So this is one possibility. And you can also manipulate it at, at the source. You can change If it's RNAs, let's say you could, in the future, perhaps if we understand how it works, actually change the composition of the hair of our RNAs.[2:16:25] Andrew Huberman: By eating RNAs just like the worms? Our RNA sandwich?[2:16:27] Dr. Oded Rechavi: No. So the RNA sandwich will be difficult because it's not I don't know. But but you could if you do IVF, you really with the fertilization, you can perhaps change the composition of the RNAs in the the stuff that you introduce. But way before that, what you could do, perhaps even in the not so far future, is use this for diagnostics. DNA based, diagnostics for, every couple that wants to have a kid, you can in Israel, this is done for for most couples.[2:16:58] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You can look at the DNA and look for genetic disease. But no one look is looking at the RNA at the moment. If we understand how it works better, we'll have another level, a whole New world to look at. And perhaps there will be some RNAs that correlate with disease that, that will say, okay. You're not covered.[2:17:15] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The the beauty is that this unlike DNA, it's plastic. So with DNA, this is your DNA. Perhaps we can choose another embryo. Mhmm. But here you could say, perhaps or again, in the future, this is science fiction.[2:17:26] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It doesn't happen now. But If we understand this and it's true, we can say, maybe you should run on the treadmill a little bit. This will change the profile of your RNAs, and then we will use it for IVF. This seems more because just it correlates with healthy profiles of RNAs. This is a level that no one looks at now and holds great potential.[2:17:46] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Again, with the disclaimer that we no know how it works in humans at all.[2:17:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yes.[2:17:51] Speaker 2: But, of[2:17:52] Dr. Oded Rechavi: course, this is why why why it's so interesting. Yeah.[2:17:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's Super interesting. Incredibly promising. So along the lines of things that one can do in the short term and your experiments on C. Elegans, I'd love for you to share with us what you're observing about cold exposure and how that impacts subsequent generations of C elegans.[2:18:13] Andrew Huberman: And, and if you would indulge us with the story of this discovery, like some of the earlier stories you told us, it is a A surprising and fascinating one.[2:18:22] Dr. Oded Rechavi: I'll gladly tell you about it. This is not a story about transgenerational inheritance. It's it's a story about memory within 1 generation.[2:18:28] Andrew Huberman: Excuse me. Okay.[2:18:29] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Within 1 generation. Okay. And and as you said, the story of how it happens is it's it's it's totally by excellent. It's a funny story. And I'm I'm bringing this up because I know Dana is a huge fan of your post office.[2:18:41] Dr. Oded Rechavi: We really, you know, be happy. That that This is[2:18:44] Speaker 2: her work.[2:18:44] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This is her work, and this is unpublished work. It's it's even we didn't even finish it. So we're working on it.[2:18:50] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Well, when it's published, we will feature the paper because I love this story. So[2:18:55] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Great. So so What happened is that when you we talked about transgenerational memories. And I said that in worms, there are very long transgenerational memories. If a if a generation time for silicon 3 days, some memories last for many generations. So way beyond the the lifespan of the of the worm.[2:19:14] Dr. Oded Rechavi: The lifespan of the worm is 3 weeks. K. So you have a new generation every 3 days, but every worm lives for 3 weeks. But there's a lot of research that shows that unlike heritable memory, which can be very long, The memories that the worms acquire during their lifetime is very short lived. So if you teach something, after 2 hours, it forgets.[2:19:34] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Okay. So for example, you can teach the worm. You can take an odor that it likes and pair it With starvation, and then it would dislike the odor. And then there's a simple test. You just put it in a plate.[2:19:47] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You put the the odor in one side and the control and you see whether it's prefers this order or not, and it stops preferring it. Okay? There is 30 years or more of research, 40 years of research on on this showing that the worms forget after 2 hours. The reason I went to study c elegans is that I wanted to understand memory. Because such a simple nervous system.[2:20:07] Dr. Oded Rechavi: You say, maybe I have the potential to actually understand how it works. But this is slightly disappointing because they forget after 2 hours. So what is it exactly? Okay? My idea was and I tried to convince students to do it for 10 years.[2:20:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Is to take the worms, teach them this association to dislike the odor that they innately like, And then just put the worms in minus 80 and freeze them freeze them completely. Thaw them and see whether they still remember after their thought.[2:20:34] Andrew Huberman: The Han Solo experiment.[2:20:35] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And and I didn't wanna do it because of cryopreservation or something like this. I wanted to do it because As you know better than me, many theories about memory say that you need electrical activity to maintain the memory. You need to reverberate it in the brain.[2:20:49] Andrew Huberman: During dreams or replay of The thing or whatever.[2:20:52] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And if the memories will nevertheless be kept even though the worms were frozen in minus 80, it would mean That it was kept in the absence of of electricity because there's no electricity in minus 8 degrees. This was the idea. I asked many students. No one wanted to do it because of it's it's not so easy and also a little crazy.[2:21:12] Andrew Huberman: Well and when the PI, the principal investigator or lab has a pet Experiment, no one wants to do that experiment.[2:21:18] Dr. Oded Rechavi: University tool. So, I and then then I agreed to do it, done a lunch shift. I was very happy. Only later to find out that she ignored me completely and did a different experiment. The experiment that data did in in instead is to just take the worms, teach them the association, and place them on ice.[2:21:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: She wanted to see how the kinetics of memory and forgetting change In low temperature. Because maybe whatever memory is, the breakdown of the memory is affected by the temperature. A very simple idea. We know Different experiment. A different experiment.[2:21:56] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Yeah. By a cool experiment. Very cool. Yeah. And what she found is that when you place the worms on ice, after you teach them, they just don't forget.[2:22:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: If they're even 10 times longer than control worms, at that point, after 24 hours, if no one wants to forget after 2 hours, After 24 hours, the worms will become 6. So normally, we do shorter experiments. Okay? But for 2 hours, the worms don't forget. This is cool, but it was only the beginning.[2:22:22] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Because the Boeing explanation is just what I just said. Everything slows down in low temperatures. The breakdown of memory, again, we don't know what it is, but whatever it is, happens slower in low temperatures. But this is not the case. It's not merely the physical.[2:22:37] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It's the response. It's Ponds is the changing of the internal state of the worms which affect the memory kinetics. How do we know this? There's a beautiful work over the last 1 years on cold tolerance In C. Elegans nematode.[2:22:49] Dr. Oded Rechavi: If you take the worms and you place them on ice like she did, but longer for 48 hours, they all die. However, if you take the worms, acclimate them to lower temperatures for a few hours, 5 hours is a minimum, and then place them on ice, they all survive. They become cold tolerant. And people who study this show that this involves changes in lipid metabolism and many things. So Dana took the worms, acclimated them to slightly lower temperatures, made them cold resistant, And then taught them the association and place them on ice.[2:23:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And now they forgot immediately. Which means that when they change their internal state to become cold tolerant, They no longer extend memories on ice, which means it's not only the temperature because the temperature was anyway low. Now they know the memory. We took this as a starting point to understand what which genes change when the worms are becoming cold tolerant on and off ice. And we found genes that when you mutate them, The worms, just remember longer always even when they're off ice, because these are the genes that normally change when they are surprised on the ice.[2:23:55] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And these genes are expressed just in 1 pair of neurons. Just 2 out of the 302.[2:24:02] Andrew Huberman: Notice he said 302, not 300.[2:24:05] Speaker 2: And we[2:24:05] Dr. Oded Rechavi: can manipulate the activities of these genes in these neurons to extend memory. And then the punchline of everything That happened is that we found out that this this neuron where these genes function, this one pair of neuron, It's the only known in silicones which is sensitive to lithium. And lithium is a drug That is being given to bipolar, disorder patients for decades. Although it's not entirely clear how it works, it's very, very interesting. It's also interesting.[2:24:39] Dr. Oded Rechavi: There's an episode, of course, in your podcast about this. You know more about this than me a lot. But it's also interesting because it's just an atom created in the big bang, yet it works on our brains in such a fundamental way. And wanted to see whether it works on the also on the world because this neuron was tied to this memory extension phenotype that we found. So Danig grew the worms on lithium, removed them from lithium, got them the association, and found Out that they learn a lot long they they remember a lot longer than control worms.[2:25:09] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Not only that, if you first make the worms cold tolerant, And then lithium doesn't work on them. So lithium switches this forgetfulness mechanism on and off.[2:25:19] Andrew Huberman: Amazing.[2:25:20] Dr. Oded Rechavi: And it it all and it it's all connected to call tolerance.[2:25:25] Andrew Huberman: Amazing and amazing for a number of reasons. And so at risk of being Long winded in my response, I just wanted to highlight something, that I think will be of relevance to most people, which is when, At some point, we did a few episodes on memory, and I highlighted a review that was written by the great James McGaugh, one of the great Mammalian memory researchers who just worked a lot on humans and mice, and I was, shocked, pun intended, and amused to learn that in medieval times, If people wanted children to remember lessons, they could be religious lessons or school doctrine or whatever it was, mathematics, whether they would take children, Teach them and then throw them into cold water to introduce a a memory instilling event. And we now know that the memory instilling event is the release of adrenaline in the body, which makes perfect sense if you think about traumatic events, but it also this whole general mechanism also applies to the learning of other types of information. And so if I understand correctly about the role of lithium and the role of cold in the experiments that you just described, there's some general State switch, some internal state switch that says what happened in the, minutes or hours preceding this important.[2:26:36] Andrew Huberman: It acts as sort of like a highlighter pen[2:26:38] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Exactly. In in the[2:26:38] Andrew Huberman: book of experiences. Exactly. And I'm Absolutely curious to know whether or not this is an RNA dependent mechanism in some way.[2:26:48] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This we[2:26:48] Andrew Huberman: don't know. Literally like the highlighter in the IKEA instruction book.[2:26:51] Dr. Oded Rechavi: This, we don't know. This, we don't know. And as I said, this is not even a finished work.[2:26:56] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[2:26:57] Dr. Oded Rechavi: It's not peer reviewed. It's just the state that I told you about, But, but it's it's very exciting for for me to to go into this new field. And, you know, once it's out, I'd be happy to We'll talk more about it, and think about the implications and the connections, so other things, and more about the mechanisms.[2:27:13] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, thank you for, sharing with us despite the fact that it's not finished. We, people now know that it's also not finished, and I love a good cliffhanger. So we, we we await the full the full conclusion and interpretation of these results. Today, you've taken us on an amazing journey through the genome, RNA, short interfering RNAs, Is, a ton of history of prior experiments, some of which ended tragically, many of which unfortunately did not, and they were true triumphs.[2:27:42] Andrew Huberman: And, in particular, the work in your laboratory, which is just incredible, and also this introduction of model organisms. So and I only mentioned a short handful of the things that, you've taught us about today. So first, I wanna extend thanks for the incredible teaching. I also wanna say thank you for, Something equally important, which is, that absolutely came through, but is what initially brought me to explore you and your work more, Although I had certainly heard of you, which is that your spirit and kind of approach to biology, is an is an extremely unique and intoxicating one. It's, it's even I'd venture to call it seductive.[2:28:22] Andrew Huberman: It's a you know, there's a I I do believe that whether or not it's music or poetry or science or mathematics that, the spirit behind something It dictates the amount of intelligence and and precision with which that thing is is carried out, and, it absolutely comes through. So if I'm making a feel on the But about this, I I've succeeded.[2:28:43] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.[2:28:45] Andrew Huberman: But I I know that the listeners can can, yeah, feel it. It's a it's a felt thing. So thank you. There there are, many scientists out there, fewer with this phenotype, and even fewer that, You know, I think they can communicate with such, articulate precision. So thank you so much.[2:29:01] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Thank you.[2:29:02] Andrew Huberman: It's been a real pleasure.[2:29:03] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Pleasure was all mine. Thanks a lot.[2:29:05] Andrew Huberman: Great. Well, we'll do it again, and we'll learn about all the incredible things you're doing, trying to transform science as it were at the level of publishing, at the level of social media because there's a whole other discussion there. Meanwhile, we will, of course, point people in the direction of you and, to learn more about your work, And, I look forward to hearing the conclusion of Dana's studies.[2:29:24] Dr. Oded Rechavi: Thanks a lot. It's been a real pleasure.[2:29:26] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor Oded about genetics, inheritance, the epigenome, and transgenerational passage of traits.
