I'm Andrew Tim Ferris is an author, a podcaster, an investor, and is known for having a near supernatural ability to predict the future, which has allowed him to obtain success in a huge number of different endeavors. For instance, he is a 5 time number one New York Times bestselling author. But perhaps equally or more important to that, he's also exceptionally good at teaching people how to write the entire process of writing and marketing a book. In.[0:00:43] Andrew Huberman: His books, The 4 Hour Chef and The 4 Hour Body and The 4 Hour Workweek, not only explain his own exploration of how to optimize and prioritize his time and learn particular skills, but he teaches you those skills as well. This is really what sets Tim apart. He is an exceptional learner in and an exceptional teacher. And today, you learn why that is and, in a characteristic Tim Ferriss way, he explains the process in a way that you can apply it. He lists out, for instance, the specific questions that you should ask when approaching any endeavor in order to get the information that you want And to make the process of learning and getting better at something and achieving great success in something, that much more likely.[0:01:25] Andrew Huberman: That ability that Tim has To identify the specific questions that one needs to ask and answer and the specific action steps to take in order to achieve success is really what I believe sets Tim apart from everyone else on the Internet or on the bookshelf that's giving advice as to how to become good at something. Tim Ferris is also dedicated to various philanthropic efforts. The most recent of which is the donation of several 1,000,000 of his own dollars to research on psychedelics for the treatment of otherwise intractable psychiatric challenges, such as major depression, suicidal depression, eating disorders, an addiction, and he's also brought together other philanthropists, which has really galvanized the whole field of psychedelic research for the treatment a mental health, transforming it from what was recently kind of a fringe area of science to a mainstay that's actually funded not only by philanthropy, but by the National Institutes of Health. So he's really transformed this entire scientific field into one that now is transforming the laws around psychedelics and is providing mental health treatment for people that would otherwise suffer. Today's discussion was a particularly meaningful one because not only is Tim, a pioneer in the world of podcasting, but it also marked the 9 year anniversary of his podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show.[0:02:42] Andrew Huberman: Now as I mentioned earlier, Tim is known for being able to see around corners or predict the future. He really does seem to be about 5, if not 10, years ahead of of everybody else in thinking about tools for optimization in particular domains of life. And so we were very fortunate that during today's discussion, he shares with us his current creative endeavors and how he's thinking about and approaching those. And he also breaks down for us the process of how how to think about and prioritize one's schedule, not just on the order of the day, not just on the order of the week, but really thinking about one's life as a journey and how to organize and go about that journey. So today's discussion will provide with you tremendous insight into who Tim Ferriss is and how that incredible mind of his works In order to do all the amazing things that he's done, and, of course, he teaches you how to do it.[0:03:33] Andrew Huberman: He will tell you the exact questions that you should ask and that you should answer and how to step back and think about those questions and then prioritize so that you can decide how to best invest your time. I'm sure many of you are familiar with The Tim Ferriss Show. However, if you're not already subscribing to The Tim Ferriss Show, I highly recommend you do. I still go back and listen to early episodes of The Tim Ferriss and I'm a weekly listener to the new episodes. We provide a link to the Tim Ferriss Show in the show note captions.[0:04:01] Andrew Huberman: Also in the show note captions, you'll find links in to Tim's many New York Times best selling books and a link to his excellent weekly blog. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.[0:04:26] Andrew Huberman: Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available. I've talked before on this podcast about the importance of striving to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Now when one strives to do that, it's also important to maximize the quality protein to calorie ratio. In other words, you don't wanna consume a lot of extra calories in order to get your quality protein. Maui Nui Venison, in having an extremely high quality protein and nutrient to calorie ratio allows you to do that very easily.[0:04:56] Andrew Huberman: And in addition to that, Maui Nui Venison is delicious. I particularly like their bone broth, which has an unmatched 25 grams of protein per 100 calories. I also love their ground venison and their venison steaks. All of them are absolutely delicious. If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison, go to Maui Nui Venison .com/huberman and get 20% off your first order.[0:05:16] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's Maui Nui Venison com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need, That is the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, but nothing you don't, which means no sugar. It's critical that we get electrolytes because every cell of our body, but in particular, our nerve cells, our neurons rely on electrolytes in order to function properly. With Element, it's very easy to ingest the correct ratios mate.[0:05:44] Andrew Huberman: Of electrolytes. They come in these little packets. They're really delicious. You mix them up with anywhere from 8 to 16 to 32 ounces of fluid. I like mine pretty concentrated, so I'll drink a 16 ounce glass of water with element in it when I first wake up.[0:05:57] Andrew Huberman: I'll also consume another one of those, maybe 32 ounces with 1 packet when I exercise and maybe another one if I happen to sweat a lot during exercise or if I was in the sauna and sweating a lot if it's a very hot day, etcetera. If If you'd like to try LMNT, go to drink LMNT, that's l m n t.com/huberman to claim a free LMNT sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element, l m n t.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities impact your blood glucose levels or blood sugar levels as they're sometimes referred to.[0:06:31] Andrew Huberman: With levels, you can see how the specific foods you eat, When you eat and exercise, as well as any other activities, impact your blood glucose and how those affect things like your energy level or your quality of sleep or your level of clarity and focus for mental work or your physical output for physical endeavors. I first started using Levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods and activities impact my blood glucose levels, and it's really impacted my entire schedule. In fact, I've shuffled a number of things around such that now I have more stable energy throughout the day. Yes. I eliminated 1 or 2 foods.[0:07:04] Andrew Huberman: Fortunately, they weren't my favorite foods. I've also added some new foods to my nutrition program that have allowed my blood sugar levels to remain much more steady throughout the day and to achieve better sleep at night. Levels even provides a simple score after any meal you eat so you can see how different foods affect you and develop a personalized nutrition program that's exactly right for you. And that's really what levels is about. It's really about tailoring things to your specific needs.[0:07:28] Andrew Huberman: So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a CGM yourself, go to levels.link slash Huberman. Right now, they're offering an additional 2 free months of membership. Again, that's levels.link/huberman. And now for my discussion with Tim Ferris. Tim Ferriss.[0:07:45] Andrew Huberman: I am nothing short of thrilled to have you here. I've been Reading your books, reading your blogs, listening to your podcasts for a very long time. And in preparing for today, I was thinking, you know, who does Tim remind me of? Because I knew you reminded me of somebody, but I didn't know who. And then I realized it.[0:08:06] Andrew Huberman: You remind me of the neurobiologist Ramon y Cajal. You don't look anything like him. He doesn't look anything like you. He was a brilliant scientist. He won the Nobel Prize in 1906 for essentially describing the structure of the nervous system.[0:08:22] Andrew Huberman: He was the first, along with another guy, to define synapses, like this fundamental connection in the nervous system. But the reason that you remind me of Kahal is that it's a well known or not so secret secret in neuroscience that if you want to pick a really excellent a project to work on. You simply go and look at what Quachal talked about or hypothesized, and then you work on that. You know, he had this almost supernatural ability to look at fixed stained tissue of the nervous system, much of it is incredibly beautiful, by the way, and think about how it worked when it was alive. And he's considered the greatest neurobiologist of all time without question.[0:09:10] Andrew Huberman: And It's really this feature of being able to, like, see around corners or into the future that establishes that link for me. It's it's in absolute truth that if you look back to what you were doing 10 years ago, 15 years ago, the kinds of things you were doing, the kinds of questions you were asking, that translates to much of what people like myself and people in the fitness space, tech space, investor space, mindfulness space, psychedelic space, all these different arenas, what they're doing now. So, it's not hyperbole to say that you are the Ramon y Cajal of all those different spaces, and podcasting, of course, is one of those. So I owe you a great debt of gratitude, and many others do as well. So my first question for you is, What was your mindset around the time that you wrote 4 Hour Body, 4 Hour Workweek, but in particular, 4 Hour Body?[0:10:07] Andrew Huberman: Because the protocols in that book are so very useful. They were at the time it was published. They still are now. And so many of the things like ice bath, the discussion around brown fat thermogenesis, resistance training in its, you know, kind of basic form of just providing enough progressive overload to get an adaptation, not excessively long workouts, weight loss, slow carb diet, in and on and on and on. What what were you thinking at that time?[0:10:37] Andrew Huberman: Like, what what if you can think back to them, like, what what were you foraging for? Were you thinking about when you woke up in the morning thinking, oh, I'm gonna go find all this stuff that at the time was really esoteric? Because it is all played out very well. In. What I'm basically saying is if you want to know what's going to be happening hot and useful in 5 years, 10 years, and onwards.[0:10:58] Andrew Huberman: Just look at what Tim's doing at any moment. So there it is.[0:11:03] Tim Ferriss: Well, thank you for the very generous comparison and intro. I'm thrilled to be here, so thanks for having me. And the forerunner body represented an opportunity for me to do a few things. The first was to diversify my identity from outside of the realm of the, say, business category. So it was a deliberate move since the success of the 1st book book bought me permission to do something else that publishers would still wanna gamble on.[0:11:30] Tim Ferriss: I wanted to see if I could, maybe like a Michael Lewis, take my audience with me to other topics. So that was a lateral move that was very deliberate from a a career optionality standpoint. And then I was doing, I think, what I've done for a very long time and what I enjoy doing, which is looking at the most in Prevalent beliefs and maybe dogmatic assumptions in a given field. Could be anything. If anyone says always never should, I pay attention and take note of that.[0:12:01] Tim Ferriss: They may very well be right. But if anything is said in absolutes, I like to stress test. And in the case of, say, physical performance or physical manipulation, in Tracking. 2008, 2009 was a very interesting time because a number of different technologies were coming online, meaning being adopted by small groups. You had very early stages of, say, accelerometers as wearables.[0:12:30] Tim Ferriss: In. You had a number of different innovations and means of tracking that had never been available before. You had, for instance and this took a bit of ferreting on my side. It wasn't immediately on the road map for for our body, but continuous glucose monitors. At the time, that was, I wanna say, exclusively limited to type 1 diabetics or the maybe type 2 diabetics, but largely type 1 diabetics.[0:12:56] Tim Ferriss: In. And what captured my interest and I can't recall how I came across it, but it was probably through the very earliest iterations of what later became the quantified self movement, and I remember attending the very first gathering at Kevin Kelly's house in Pacifica, California. This is This was around 2009, 12 people, 13 people to discuss quantifying health. But the The example of a professional race car driver, I can't remember the the form factor, whether it was f one or NASCAR or other, who was using this continual glucose monitor in for paying attention to glucose levels while driving. And I thought to myself, in.[0:13:39] Tim Ferriss: Would that not be useful for healthy normals? Would that not have other applications? If this if this is being used by a high performer in this type of context, in. Might it have other types of applications, which then led me to use the very early versions of Dexcom, which were really painful to implant. No longer the case.[0:13:58] Tim Ferriss: Of Of course, that's changed a lot, and I wanted to see how I might be able to find a handful of different categories of things. There's the new, like, the genuinely new. Like, CGM at that point was genuinely new. The very old That might have some room for scientific investigation. And I would say when I say scientific, I don't necessarily mean randomized controlled trials at a university.[0:14:26] Tim Ferriss: I do think as an end of 1, if you think about study design and you can even blind, You could even placebo control, and I knew people in the small subculture of quantified self who did this. You can, I think, approach things in a methodical way in where you can make a lot of progress in trying to determine causality or or lack thereof? Looking at very old things, looking at orphaned things. So for instance, in. There are many examples in the world of doping where you have, say, Balco back in the day where in.[0:15:01] Tim Ferriss: Famously, Barry Bonds and others purportedly use things like the cream and the clear, and these were based on anabolics that were sourced from Soviet literature or older literature from the fifties sixties that might not be on the radar of, say, the anti doping, groups that would administer the testing. So all of these different buckets were of interest to me, and I began where I usually do, which is interviewing folks. So I would interview 1 or 2 people in a given field, and I might ask them any number of questions. So one in is what are the nerds doing on the weekends or at night? This is also really good for investing.[0:15:41] Tim Ferriss: It's like, alright. What are the really technical nerds doing at night or on the weekends after they've put in a really long workday or workweek. Let's take a really close look at that. Another one is, and I'll I'll create a flow for this, but what are rich people doing now that everyone or tens or hundreds of millions of people might be doing 10 years from now. And an example of that would be, let's just say, full time assistant, virtual assistant, AI.[0:16:13] Tim Ferriss: Right? So we've seen the needs and wants being addressed by different technology, but it's an iteration of the same thing on some level in the case of, say, using chat GPT tied into Zapier for various functions. And then where are people cobbling together awkward solutions? So where are people piecing together awkward solutions, in. And is there room for some type of innovation there?[0:16:38] Tim Ferriss: These are a few of the questions that I would not only ask myself, but ask experts in different areas. So if I end up spending time, say this was a few years prior to writing the 4 hour body, I spent time at NASA Ames was interacting with a number of scientists, some people who were working on all sorts of biological tests and looking at genomics, in and had a very frank discussion about where they thought if they had to push. Right? So I'll ask questions like, push a little bit into the realm of science fiction and speculation because I'm sure you can't support any type of projection like that with the literature with scientific literature, but what do you think some of the risks are of, say, publishing your genome? Because at the time, a number of high profile folks had just made their full genomes available.[0:17:26] Tim Ferriss: They're like, well, I think in the near future, it'd be possible to reconstruct someone's face based on their genetic data, and they're, like, high degree of confidence. Like, 0 to a 100%, how confident? Oh, yeah. 80, 90%. I'm like, okay.[0:17:40] Tim Ferriss: In. I should pay attention to that because if you're making your data available, let's just say, and it's anonymized per se, you still might be identifiable. Like, okay. That raises some interesting questions. Like, okay.[0:17:49] Tim Ferriss: Well, then how might you get around that? How might you put in safeguards so that You are the one and only keeper of your data, so to speak. Brought up all sorts of targeted weaponry, by sort of bioweapons possibilities that I was interested in. And then I would ask that person, who's clearly, like, willing to step outside of the box of whatever he's working on day to day, Who are 2 of your close friends or 2 thinkers you really pay a lot of attention to or kind of at the bleeding edge of something and unorthodox? In, and then I would just continue to have these conversations over and over again.[0:18:25] Tim Ferriss: And the the the the the stream of development that I paid a lot to something along the lines of the following. So the the the very beginnings are usually in some type of extreme case, and I think the extremes, and this goes for product design as well, but the extremes inform the mean but not vice versa, so you can actually learn a lot by studying the edge cases. So racehorses, for instance. You'll often see things start with, say, racehorses, or people with wasting diseases, for instance, for any type of chronic or terminal illness who are willing to try some more experimental interventions, in. Then let's just take 1 step further bodybuilding.[0:19:09] Tim Ferriss: See a lot of interesting behavior in bodybuilding and high level athletes, then billionaires, then rich people, then the rest of us. In. Right. So my assumption is and was for the 4 hour body that along the lines of William Gibson's quote, you know, the future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed.[0:19:25] Tim Ferriss: So I'm never predicting the future. I'm just finding the seeds that are germinating that I think are gonna bloom and end up spreading really, really widely. So that's that's that's generally where I start, and I assume the practitioners are gonna be ahead of the papers. In. So studying, say, the coaches whose jobs are on the line, who are getting paid based on athlete performance, And assuming that a lot of that will eventually, if it holds up, make its way into, say, the peer reviewed exercise science papers, but it's gonna have a lag time of 3 to 5 years.[0:19:58] Andrew Huberman: In At least.[0:19:59] Tim Ferriss: At least.[0:20:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[0:20:00] Tim Ferriss: At least. Takes a long time.[0:20:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Science is often very slow to catch up. Yeah. You mentioned many things I have questions about. You mentioned paying attention to the new, the very old, for the orphaned.[0:20:16] Andrew Huberman: So interesting. And I just thought I'd, tell you that when you sit down with a graduate student or a postdoc and they're trying to come up with a project. Rarely do you say, you know, like, what do you wanna work on? And they fire back, like, a really interesting in question. Sometimes they do, but that's the rare person.[0:20:33] Andrew Huberman: More often than not, you'll send them to the literature, and they'll come back with like, okay. There's this new technique that we can use to answer a set of questions better than ever before, or there's a very old theory I wanna revisit, in for there's this theory that no one pays attention to. In fact, we had 1 guest on here, Oded Rishavi, who is studying it, essentially, inheritance of traits, transgenerational inheritance of traits. It's a little bit, although different from Lamarckian Mhmm. Evolution, but it's a lot like that, in some ways, and, you know, these orphan theories that everyone assumed were wrong and that there is a basis for them.[0:21:08] Andrew Huberman: So I think there's real genius in that, analysis. It also struck me as you were, listing off some of your process circa in the the writing of The 4 Hour Body that I and many other people are are probably curious about what the operations around all that looked like. So are you or were you at the time, like, waking up in the morning going, okay. I'm gonna take a walk and think about the new, the old, and the orphaned, or in. I'm gonna take a walk or sit in and share and think about, like, what are the nerds doing right now?[0:21:42] Andrew Huberman: What are rich people doing right now or cobbling together awkward solutions? Mhmm. Was Was that exploration a structured practice for you, or is this just something that, was the consequence of being Tim Ferriss waking up in the morning and just, like, leaning into that because I've Yeah. I've experienced both. Right?[0:21:58] Andrew Huberman: You know? But I think a lot of us are, curious. I mean, that there's a lot of mystique around you.[0:22:05] Tim Ferriss: Man. Whether you like best to dispel it.[0:22:07] Andrew Huberman: Whether whether you like it or not, it it it it's there, and, and we're not trying to to pry. In. But Proway. Is the is the establishment of structure for you something that's the consequence of structure in the 1st place. It's like, okay.[0:22:24] Andrew Huberman: Now it's time to think. Mhmm.[0:22:25] Tim Ferriss: Or do[0:22:26] Andrew Huberman: you just allow things to geyser up to the surface?[0:22:28] Tim Ferriss: In. I do both. And I would say that in the case of The 4 Hour Body, it's it's a bit of an anomaly compared to my later books because I had recorded effectively every workout I'd done since age 16 as a competitive athlete. I just I had a lot of records, and I kept copious notes on supplement use and everything imaginable. So I have what you might call hypergraphia.[0:22:52] Tim Ferriss: I just capture it almost everything in writing, and that was very useful because at various points in time, let's just say I looked at a photograph of myself from making this up, but 2004, and I think I would like to look and feel like that again. Okay. Let me revisit my workout logs. Let me just replicate the proceeding 3 to 6 months of workouts and look at my intake and my diet at the time. And lo and behold, more or less, I could replicate the same type of look and feel and performance.[0:23:22] Tim Ferriss: So I had a lot already logged that I thought was worth examining in and putting under scrutiny, trying to replicate with other people. I do think replication is really important. And then when it came time to commit to writing the book, I thought about what types of mini books would be of great interest to me personally? And That book, like many of my other books, was written in such a fashion that it could be a choose your own adventure book. Did not need to be read.[0:23:52] Tim Ferriss: In fact, in many ways, it shouldn't be read linearly from page 1 to the end. You get to pick and choose which chapters are of interest based on breath hold, vertical jump, endurance, hypertrophy, cold exposure for fat loss, whatever it might be. And then I began talking to people. In. And at the at the very outer bounds of self experimentation, at least in the Bay Area, It's a pretty small community, so you're 1 or 2 lily pads from just about everyone.[0:24:22] Tim Ferriss: And it's not accidental that I put myself in that environment in San Francisco specifically and more generally in the Bay Area, Silicon Valley because there's just a high surface area for luck to stick to because you have so many serendipitous encounters. You have so many people focusing on different disciplines. That I think was the fertilizer, and the fertile ground for everything else was actually the choosing the where of writing, physically being located in San Francisco. And then when I'm structuring things, in. Maybe I'll get into some of the nitty gritty, but I was using at the time, and I still like to use a program called Scrivener, which is actually designed predominantly for screenwriting.[0:25:09] Tim Ferriss: It's used for many things now, novels and so on. It's expanded its reach quite a bit, but it allows you to gather research in. And all of your documents and drafts so that you can move them around in very novel ways so you can view, say, a split pane of your research and what you're working on simultaneously without having to toggle between a lot of different windows. And I was very promiscuous in my gathering of data. So I would gather from, say, the web using a web clipper from Evernote, which I was involved with as a company.[0:25:42] Tim Ferriss: And, basically without bias capture as much as possible, put 3 asterisks next to anything that I thought I really might want to revisit after I had read something a second time, which I would always do. Then I could control f to find just 3 asterisks because they don't occur much in normal writing. Just like people, in authors, writers, will you t use t k, meaning find such and such a date. Data needs to be inserted later, but I don't wanna interrupt flow of writing only put in t k because it doesn't really appear in natural English much. In terms of structured thinking, the way I approached it was during that period of time in my life.[0:26:20] Tim Ferriss: It was interviews, tracking people down, conversations, emails, in[0:26:27] Andrew Huberman: reading,[0:26:28] Tim Ferriss: so ingestion, let's just say, for the workday, then a break for training and in And actually using myself as the human guinea pig for various things that had surfaced that might be on the docket.[0:26:42] Andrew Huberman: Where were you training at that time? I San Francisco is not, famous for amazing gyms.[0:26:46] Tim Ferriss: It's not famous for amazing gyms. At the time, I was training mostly at a climbing gym called Mission Cliffs. They didn't have much, but they had barbells.[0:26:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I know that.[0:26:54] Tim Ferriss: And they[0:26:55] Andrew Huberman: had Yep.[0:26:55] Tim Ferriss: And they had kettlebells. Yep. I also had in the in the walkway leading from the front door of the apartment I was renting. It's more of a house. The front door all the way to the 1st set of stairs, there were 30 kettle kettlebells of various types.[0:27:09] Tim Ferriss: And I was training for certification, so So I wanted to put myself on some type of deadline with accountability for that type of training to get a better understanding of it. So I trained for a few hours. I also had developed a friendship with Kelly Starrett, so San Francisco CrossFit, who I have tremendous amount of respect for[0:27:26] Andrew Huberman: Likewise. On multiple levels. Terrific. And his new book,[0:27:29] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Built to Move.[0:27:31] Andrew Huberman: This great book.[0:27:32] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[0:27:32] Andrew Huberman: He's so good.[0:27:33] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. He he really not only talks the talk, but walks the walk and exemplifies many of the capabilities that he teaches, which I take seriously. I like practitioners[0:27:44] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:27:45] Tim Ferriss: Not just the in people with pretty theories. Although the theories are important, I prefer to see someone who can actually put them into practice. So Kelly served that function, in, certainly, and we're still very close friends. And then after that, alright, shake off the cobwebs, get the body moving, Get the brain moving, also eat, and then I would actually focus on synthesis. So I would write generally from, let's call it, 9 PM or 10 PM through to 4 or 5 AM, and I would ride the wave if I happen to be in the zone.[0:28:20] Tim Ferriss: If If I weren't in the zone, I wouldn't force it, and I would try to get more sleep, but I have always performed best with my writing in those witching hours of, let's call it, 10 PM to 4 AM. And my experience is that The writers I've interviewed, the the writer friends I've become close with, if you look at when they made themselves not necessarily what they do now. Right? But what they did that eventually got them to escape velocity, They're almost always doing most of their writing very late at night or very early in the morning when the rest of the world or their social group is inactive. Wow.[0:29:02] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[0:29:02] Andrew Huberman: And I say wow because, of course, all of this was prior to the publication of Matt Walker's Yeah. Seminal book, right, Why We Sleep, which I really see as the book that shifted a lot of people, fortunately, from the I'll sleep when I'm dead mindset, too I'll you know, to really paying attention to it, and, you know, I don't think Matt gets enough credit. I mean, there, there's been a revision of a few points within that book, but the majority of it is just spot on and hyper of them. So good. And, and yet what you're describing is a schedule that you know, starting to write at 9 PM and finishing up around 4 AM, but you talked about research earlier that day and training and eating.[0:29:41] Andrew Huberman: So were there[0:29:41] Tim Ferriss: naps in there? I would sleep from, say, 4 to maybe 11 or 12, so I would be getting up later. And I've had conversations with Matt about this, and There are night owls and morning larks. Yep. And there are certainly differences in the code, meaning the genetics, but in.[0:30:03] Tim Ferriss: That worked very, very well for me for a very long time. It is, however, a very challenging social schedule. So once you have a significant other and every girlfriend I've ever had is a morning person, if you wanna spend time together, that schedule just does not work. So I made compromises later for the social side of things. But if if you put a gun to my head and said, you need to write best book humanly possible.[0:30:29] Tim Ferriss: That is your only priority outside of some exercise and fuel. I would follow the same schedule.[0:30:35] Andrew Huberman: I know several, very successful podcasters. Lex Friedman, in particular, who I think he's trying to follow a more normal schedule now, but in. He's pseudo nocturnal, at least by my ex my read.[0:30:46] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[0:30:47] Andrew Huberman: And there are couple other online content creators. In, Derek from More Plates More Dates who's hyperproductive in his domain Mhmm. And is mostly nocturnal.[0:30:58] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[0:30:58] Andrew Huberman: And then As you're describing your, writing routine and your overall routine, I was thinking that, you know, the the great skateboarder everyone knows Tony Hawk, who is obviously a great skateboarder. No doubt about that. But Rodney Mullen who invented the ollie on street, the kick flip, the ollie like, Rodney is basically nocturnal Mhmm. And has been for a long time and would, you know, skateboard up and down the boardwalk in Santa Monica in the middle of the night because lack of distraction. Yes.[0:31:22] Andrew Huberman: It really was and he's been doing that since his teens. I don't know what he's doing these days, but I think a lot of creators just need space. And and I always wonder if that's because when they at least the ones that are not, socially dysfunctional, like yourself who, when they are around people, there's this almost hopefully a desire to interact, so you almost have to remove the stimulus completely.[0:31:46] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It it it removes the plausible deniability, which might not be the perfect use of that phrase, but in the sense that you it's harder to fool yourself into thinking you're doing something important when you're checking your messages or social media at 2 in the morning. Who are we kidding, folks? You should be writing in this case. Right?[0:32:05] Tim Ferriss: And writers will do anything to avoid writing. I remember, Ayn Rand wrote a book about writing, which is actually fantastic. I can't remember the exact title. It might just be on nonfiction writing, something like that. And she talked about polishing the sneakers or the shoes before writing.[0:32:20] Tim Ferriss: Like, I really just need to to this one thing, which is to just clean up that shoe because somebody should really clean it up. And at some point, I should clean it up, and therefore, why don't I just do this? There's no time like the present. I'll just do that, and it's all to avoid writing, Which is the harder thing. And in my conversation with Matt also, I should say that in.[0:32:38] Tim Ferriss: As someone who has self described as a person who struggles with onset insomnia, Matt made the point, and sometimes we need to relearn things. In. Maybe you should just go to bed later. Mhmm. Sure.[0:32:51] Tim Ferriss: And that might address some of this onset insomnia. And I don't know the causes for that, but I do get a 2nd wind very late. Could be related to some cortisol release, abnormality, or just different scripting in my system. Who knows?[0:33:06] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG One, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:33:34] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, in. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, And they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you year supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:34:14] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:34:21] Tim Ferriss: I'll mention 1 other 1 other maybe heuristic that I use for trying to peek around corners, which is If I find an example of an outlier trying to find 2 or 3, right, because one is an exception, 2 is interesting. 3 is worth investigating. That's sort of how I think about it. And I recognize that your old anecdote does not equal data. However, a lot of interesting discoveries begin as case studies or case histories.[0:34:52] Tim Ferriss: And so there are some things we could talk about that that I've pay attention over the last few years that are not in the for our body that I think are quite interesting and raise very, very in exciting questions, but[0:35:05] Andrew Huberman: I'd love to hear about those. Yeah. And and along lines of what I call anec data. I mean, most of what we know about human memory stems from 1 patient, who had his hippocampi removed for, epilepsy. And, of course, there have been millions probably close to millions of studies in animals and humans focusing on the hippocampi, but most of what we know about human memory is from 1 guy.[0:35:28] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So there's there's there's a lot to be examined. Not all of it will get funding for RCTs.[0:35:36] Tim Ferriss: Let's be realistic. This is especially true if you're hoping for any type of directive data. I noticed I'm not saying conclusive, but if If you are a human who's gonna be making decisions about diet, health, exercise, if you want any consensus, you're doomed. You'll be you're not gonna get any answers before you die.[0:35:54] Andrew Huberman: Can you say that twice so that the Internet can hear it extra loud and clear? For those of you that are arguing about nutrition on Twitter, like, it it might actually be life wasted. Yeah. I mean, I'm not being judgmental. I mean, I think that there's validity in lots of those pockets.[0:36:09] Andrew Huberman: There's stuff that's wrong in lots of those pockets.[0:36:12] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[0:36:13] Andrew Huberman: They're diets that work extremely well, like, you know, 4 hour diet or a slow carb. I was called the 4 hour diet, but the low carb diet. Yeah. Yeah. It works extremely well.[0:36:21] Andrew Huberman: Anytime I followed it, you know, I get much leaner and stronger and all that stuff, that it's, purported to do. It it works. But, yeah, maybe you could just, explain what you mean by that because I think there are some argument slash friction spaces Yeah. That are that are truly an energy sink.[0:36:41] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would just say focus on what works for you and your family for your team. And if you're arguing on the Internet, recognize that you're just doing it because you like arguing on the Internet. You're not gonna convince anyone of anything. And, you're just gonna make yourself, more frustrated if you plan on changing any opinions.[0:37:03] Tim Ferriss: In. So for me, it's live and let live. And, the more people who engage in that type of behavior, the more competitive advantage you have if you don't. So for me, I'm like, okay. If you wanna spend this vital nonrenewable resource of yours called time on that.[0:37:22] Tim Ferriss: If I ever compete against you, I'm gonna win. So great. I'll just, I'll I'll also not even try to convince you to stop doing that unless you see the logic in it, which I have, which is why I also don't have, at least for 2 years, have mostly had no social apps installed on my phone. In, and we could talk about that because I think recognizing that these things have been engineered to overcome any type of self discipline in with 1,000,000,000 of dollars at stake, should lead you to believe that you're bringing a a knife to a gunfight. So I just don't have the apps on my phone to begin with.[0:37:55] Tim Ferriss: And I find it much more gratifying to see disproportionate change in from small inputs. So that's what I'm looking for. And, I'm also looking for changes that are easy to make, that can have high adherence, that have very limited downside, which is very different from proving something. For instance, in the four hour body, took a look at the potential effect of cell phones or the proximity of cell phones to, say, gonadal function and reproductive health. And the literature that was available at the time was very limited, had some animal studies, mice, rats, etcetera.[0:38:40] Tim Ferriss: I recognize humans are not just large mice, so they don't always translate. But I looked at it and I said, okay. In. Looking at this simplistically, is it plausible that there could be similar effects on humans? Seems to be the case also based on conversations with people who are specialists but would never go on record.[0:39:00] Tim Ferriss: Therefore, if your phone is in your pocket, just have it on airplane mode. I mean, it it does not have a high cost. And and then pending any revision, we can see, but While the jury is still out, I'm gonna risk mitigate by taking this step.[0:39:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well and I just wanna say, thank you there too. I read that recommendation. I followed the recommendation of not keeping the phone on in my front pocket or back pocket. Again, that's anecdata.[0:39:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. In. My sperm analysis isn't relevant to this conversation, but worked out, but, you know, you could say, well, that's not be necessarily because you had the phone off, but, in. I did a very long detailed episode on male and female fertility. Mhmm.[0:39:45] Andrew Huberman: There is now a what I view as a really quality in meta analysis, and it's pretty clear that there are effects of the smartphone on proximity of the smartphone when it's turned on, that are not good for sperm isn't necessarily gonna render somebody sterile, but, on sperm, that can be separated out from the heat effects. Mhmm. And so, essentially, this is another instance in which, you were you were right. And I think more data will come out. And am I a EMF conspiracy theorist.[0:40:17] Andrew Huberman: No. Do I wear tinfoil underwear? No. But, I think it's interesting. I think it's important, and, thanks to you, it cued my attention to it.[0:40:29] Andrew Huberman: In fact, I teach about that in a course on on neurocircuits and biology and health and disease.[0:40:35] Tim Ferriss: Amazing. Yeah. And I don't expect to get everything right at all. That would be crazy. I'd like to think I'm not totally crazy, and it's very important if you are going to do self fermentation or experimentation in small groups, which the quantified self community did quite well and I think still does quite well.[0:40:57] Tim Ferriss: You should really make every effort to not fool yourself, which Mhmm. Is hard. In. It's it's challenging at times, but read books like Bad Science. Read books like How to Lie With Statistics.[0:41:11] Tim Ferriss: Ensure that you are able to read studies well. In. You don't have to be the best in the world, but that you can, on some level, identify the strengths and weaknesses of studies. This doesn't take a long time. Certainly our friend, Peter Attia, doctor Peter Attia has studying the studies, which is a multiple part blog series dedicated to this.[0:41:31] Tim Ferriss: There are other ways to approach it. I took one of his podcast, republished it on the Tim Ferriss show because it talked about how to examine studies, what powering refers to, things like this. In the span of 1 or 2 weeks, you could really become literate with the building blocks of scientific literacy with respect into reading studies, and that gives you such an enormous life advantage. It's hard to overstate.[0:41:58] Andrew Huberman: In. Yeah. I agree. And I also think that there are a lot of things that just simply will not ever be explored in a randomized controlled trial. Mhmm.[0:42:05] Tim Ferriss: One[0:42:05] Andrew Huberman: of the things that Peter and I have talked about before is, he texted me, you know, what are your thoughts on BPC 157? This is a gastric peptide that's now been synthesized so people will inject it into a tissue that they're trying to heal or improve. Lots and lots of Anik data on BPC 157, making injuries heal faster, etcetera. Again, Anik data. I've used it.[0:42:26] Andrew Huberman: I took an injection of it yesterday, in fact. Peter basically is not a believer in because there's a lack of published data on this, which is perfectly fine, or I should say he's, skeptical. Mhmm. And so there's always that possibility of a placebo effect. Yeah.[0:42:45] Andrew Huberman: But I don't think there will ever be a really nice controlled trial on BPC 157 because the financial incentives aren't there. Yep. And no smart graduate student is going to go do a thesis on this. That so that's the reality. I mean, maybe 1 will do it now that we're having this conversation, but it just doesn't the the payout isn't there.[0:43:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[0:43:04] Tim Ferriss: And that last 1 you mentioned is one that people miss a lot. People doing these studies are people with careers for planning their careers, and so they choose what they're going to invest time in very carefully. So that's another limiter on what will end up in our RCT Mhmm. Or not. Right?[0:43:20] Tim Ferriss: So, I think that's good for people to hear. And as You get more involved with science, and in my case through a foundation, the SciSae Foundation funding a lot of early stage science, you realize how expensive it is and how long it takes. In. It is a long term investment, and if you are looking to make behavioral changes or modify aspects of yourself, cognitive, physical, psychoemotional, or otherwise, identifying interventions or options that seem to have some plausible upside. Like, there is a a mechanism that might make sense in humans.[0:44:01] Tim Ferriss: In. If you feel fairly certain there's very limited downside, which should include talking to people who are presenting their results as Anik data, Then maybe you consider using X if you can cap your downside. And I recall, for instance, looking at trans Resveratrol, specifically not for longevity, but in potentially increasing endurance for for our body. And I ended up testing it. And there's a funny story associated with that.[0:44:32] Tim Ferriss: In. Didn't quite work out as planned, and I don't use it any longer. But what I experienced prior to actually finding this on forums was joint pain, elbow pain. The one most consistent side effect was what felt like tendinosis in the elbows. And then I went online, and I'd already done this, but I hadn't come across.[0:44:52] Tim Ferriss: I think it was the 500 group. People have been using 500 milligrams of trans resveratrol daily for long periods of time. In. And one of the most common reported side effects is joint pain. And I was like, okay.[0:45:04] Tim Ferriss: I'm not willing to make that trade Yeah. And[0:45:09] Andrew Huberman: Makes sense to me. Yeah. I think, it would be fun if ever you were willing that we could do[0:45:17] Tim Ferriss: in a[0:45:17] Andrew Huberman: hybrid podcast on supplement fails.[0:45:21] Tim Ferriss: I have some spectacular failures.[0:45:22] Andrew Huberman: As do I. And I'm thinking I'm thinking about a few of them. I mean, some that were really, like, took me off course. Like, there's one supplement, called Bulbine natalensis. This is another one of these shrubs.[0:45:35] Tim Ferriss: Sounds like an infection.[0:45:36] Andrew Huberman: I mean, this thing will really spike your testosterone and free testosterone. I'm talking back acne, like huge strength gains, aggression. It's really wild. And then after about 7 to 10 days. It all crashes, and you go below baseline.[0:45:52] Andrew Huberman: Oh, sounds terrible. Even testicular pain, so it was unclear. So you you if you're a smart person you halt use. Right? So I can understand why people are skeptical of certain things.[0:46:00] Andrew Huberman: And then, of course, there are supplements that I'm a big fan of and that You're a big fan of we talked about those things elsewhere, but, it might be fun to do a supplement fails podcast. If ever you're willing, that'd[0:46:10] Tim Ferriss: be I could do just experimental fails. Oh, yeah. Yeah. End of 1 experimental fails, which include things that people might not think about. For instance, for our body had quite a bit of real estate dedicated to looking at things like PRP.[0:46:25] Tim Ferriss: So platelet rich plasma, I think there's a role for it. It's not useful for everything, but for certain types of injury repair, I think it's very interesting. But, every time you get injected, this is where you have to be careful because there are very few free lunches out there. There's there's usually some type of feedback loop. Your system is very smart at autoregulating things.[0:46:50] Tim Ferriss: This is this is outside of that, a consideration that I hadn't made, which is every time you have an injection, there's a chance of an infection, particularly if the site, in my case, was the elbow. And the injection was made for the PRP, not quite where it should have been slightly to the rear of the elbow where the the skin is very thick, and so it pushed staph bacteria from a mid layer of the skin into the joint capsule.[0:47:19] Andrew Huberman: Not good.[0:47:20] Tim Ferriss: And that really could have ended very poorly. I ended up having to go to the ER and get get it all removed and so on, but that could have ended up, in a in a much, much more severe situation. So You do have to be careful with this stuff. I've become a little more conservative with some[0:47:38] Andrew Huberman: of[0:47:38] Tim Ferriss: what I do, including injections. I'm like, alright. Like, let me think in Twice about the injections. If I'm gonna swallow something, let me make sure I'm really looking at the implications for the liver.[0:47:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Smart. Very smart. I'm curious about some of the things that you talked about in the 4 Hour Body and that you've mentioned today, things like accelerometers, in continuous glucose monitors, deliberate cold exposure. How many of those things are you still doing on a regular basis?[0:48:07] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And how many do you, you know, use couple times a week or a couple times a month or go through phases of using and not using. Cold exposure,[0:48:16] Tim Ferriss: I use as consistently as is practical. In. So if I'm traveling, it's a little harder, but we're in LA right now. One of the first things I did was find a few options for contrast therapy. One of the first things I did.[0:48:28] Tim Ferriss: And by contrast, I do not mean infrared sauna in. And cold plunge, I'd much rather have hot and cold water just in terms of sort of speed of heating.[0:48:39] Andrew Huberman: The Japanese approach.[0:48:40] Tim Ferriss: Right. For just speed of vasodilation, particularly for injury recovery. I think it's incredibly helpful. For mood regulation, certainly, that's the case. And cold water for mood regulation or the treatment of, say, depression or as a preemptive intervention to avoid or mitigate depression is old.[0:49:03] Tim Ferriss: Used to be prescribed for melancholy, and people like the Van Gogh's of the world would be prescribed cold baths. So that was something I was like, well, let's take a look at some of the old history, read about that, and then look into PubMed and so on to see what might be supported. So the cold, I'm still using. I become increasingly interested. This was not in the 4 hour body, but whole body hyperthermia[0:49:27] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:49:27] Tim Ferriss: Often excluding the head for depression, which I I know there's some some research[0:49:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Out of UCSF Yeah. Exactly. Right now. They have really interesting studies.[0:49:37] Andrew Huberman: Too early to report. I'm not involved in these, but I think these are really important[0:49:42] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[0:49:42] Andrew Huberman: Studies because for all the people saying, oh, well, you know, this ice bath stuff, you know, metabolism this, metabolism that. One thing that's very clear is long lasting, very significant increase in the catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine. In, not a replacement, perhaps, for antidepressant medication, but as you said, to to move the needle toward antidepressant states.[0:50:02] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[0:50:03] Andrew Huberman: That's the cocktail, and, at heat as well.[0:50:07] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. And the hyperthermia, especially the way it is formatted right now with some of the research, is is very early stages. There's gonna be less adherence. It's not as readily available, say, cold shower or cold bath.[0:50:18] Tim Ferriss: So I do think about the practical indications of that, but right now, it's it's very interesting. Slow carb diet, still use it all the time. It is not my default 247 as it used to be, so maybe I'm just getting older and more self indulgent. But If I find myself going off the rails a bit and I'm like, okay. I'm getting closer to muffin top here.[0:50:36] Tim Ferriss: Let's stage an intervention, in. Then I will go immediately back to slow carb diet. And within within a matter of weeks, I it's it's pretty easily corrected. And it's[0:50:46] Andrew Huberman: just a cue for people. I know it's, you know, slow carb diet, achieved great prominence. In fact, wasn't it featured on, or mentioned in an episode of Orange is the New Black?[0:50:56] Tim Ferriss: I think it it might have been. It's made it's made appearances on a handful of shows.[0:51:00] Andrew Huberman: Great. I realized that I've been referring to the slow carb diet several times throughout this discussion. So for those that aren't familiar with the slow carb diet, I know they can go look up what that is. Mhmm. But so that we can keep them here Sure.[0:51:12] Tim Ferriss: For the[0:51:12] Andrew Huberman: rest of this discussion and not have to send them out and back, just yet. Could you give us just a brief top contour of what the slow carb diet is?[0:51:20] Tim Ferriss: Sure. Yeah. So the slow carb diet is intended to be a simple, easy to adhere to diet for people who have perhaps failed other diets that allows you to in. Recompose your body, so improve muscle mass, decrease body fat percentage, and the rules are really simple, and that's part of what makes it work. It's not ideal for every sport in every circumstance, but broadly speaking, it works for a lot of people who've had trouble with dieting in the past.[0:51:51] Tim Ferriss: So rule number 1, don't drink calories. That's it. Very simple. So black coffee, unsweetened tea, great. In.[0:51:59] Tim Ferriss: Juice, out. Anything with calories, out. You could add a little bit of heavy cream to your coffee, let's say, in, but that's that's also bending the rules in a way that I don't like. So in the beginning, it's like follow the rules so you can break them later. So in the beginning, let's just say you can't drink calories.[0:52:16] Tim Ferriss: Number 2, don't eat anything white. Sounds pretty basic. Right? Just don't eat anything that is the color of white or that could be white. Basically, that means you're gonna be avoiding starches in And, things that are are similar to starches.[0:52:29] Andrew Huberman: That includes things like oatmeal.[0:52:30] Tim Ferriss: That includes things like oatmeal. Yeah. So roughly speaking, Just avoiding things that are white or that could be white will get you pretty far. And, yes, there are exceptions. Like cauliflower, fine.[0:52:41] Tim Ferriss: You can have cauliflower. But, again, don't get fancy. Right? It's it's very easy to outsmart yourself when it comes to behavioral change. Keep it simple.[0:52:49] Tim Ferriss: So for at least 2 weeks, Forget about the exceptions. Right? Don't drink calories. Don't eat anything white. And then eat 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking up.[0:53:04] Tim Ferriss: Okay. We got that. And Then there are a few buckets you can choose from. Right? So you have vegetables, beans and lentils, in, and then some type of protein.[0:53:16] Tim Ferriss: So you're going to come up with meals that you can follow without deviating for a period of 1 or 2 weeks. Just come up with the same meals, and that's gonna sound boring. Yes. But guess what? You do it already.[0:53:28] Tim Ferriss: You just might not realize it. And the the lentils and the beans specifically as a prereq, we can get into some of the reasons, but add a lot of fiber in and also inhibit appetite. Right? So that's actually a very important component of these meals. And there may be a handful of other rules, but those are the basics.[0:53:48] Tim Ferriss: And then the redemption is take 1 day off per week and just go fucking crazy. That's cheat day. There are some epic cheat days out there. Some I've captured for myself, and anything goes. When I say anything, I do mean anything.[0:54:05] Tim Ferriss: So if you wanna consume multiple pizzas, in Pints of ice cream. Whatever. Indulge. I left 1 out. No fruit during the week.[0:54:14] Tim Ferriss: So avoid fruit. Avoid fructose. So, in agave nectar. Anything that is sort of hidden sugar, avoid all that. So no added sweeteners, obviously, in, but avoid avoid fruit and fructose.[0:54:27] Tim Ferriss: And, again, it's not gonna kill you. Guess what? If you're from European ancestry, Your ancestors did did not have, like, blueberries in the middle of winter, generally speaking. Right? So you'll you'll be fine for a few weeks.[0:54:42] Tim Ferriss: In. And then there's that cheat day. And cheat day anything goes. The amount of damage you can do on cheat day is pretty limited, and there are ways you can mitigate that. There's a whole chapter called damage control in the forehand body, but focusing just on that diet and having one day off Where you know you can do anything means when you are controlling yourself for those 6 days of the week, you're not giving up your favorite foods forever.[0:55:06] Tim Ferriss: You can even keep a list of all things you wanna eat on cheap day, and then you have free license to eat on cheap day. And, that provides you with a release valve in so that you can build in the cheating as opposed to having it occur as a failure point. And there are a handful of other things there. If you have domino foods in the house, for instance, if you eat a lot of almonds or mixed nuts and you're just gonna sit there compulsively eating them While you're sitting at your laptop, don't have what I call dominoed foods in the house, which are going to really create some portion control issues. But Broadly speaking, don't drink calories.[0:55:42] Tim Ferriss: Don't eat things that are white. Take from 3 categories and build your meals out, and those are the meals that you follow. Do not eat fruit or fructures and then cheat one day a week. And Saturday is a nice day or cheat day for most folks. And, just to answer some questions questions people are gonna have.[0:55:59] Tim Ferriss: No. That doesn't mean 24 hours that you can spread out over 2 days. That won't actually set you back. But the amount of fat that you can store in a handful of sittings over 24 hours, which legitimately is more like 12 to 18 hours. In pretty limited.[0:56:18] Tim Ferriss: So that's Slugger B diet.[0:56:20] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you for that. I also wanna ask, is it okay in to take the day after cheat day and fast or do 1 meal that day. When I followed the slow carb diet, I benefited from it tremendously. A lost fat, gained muscle, tons of energy, sleeping great, required less caffeine, all sorts of wonderful things.[0:56:41] Andrew Huberman: Stable blood sugar. I felt so, so good. In, really enjoyed the cheat days. I really, really enjoyed the cheat days. So much fun.[0:56:48] Andrew Huberman: At some point, there's some gastric distress that comes from, you know, not regulating intake, which led me to not want to eat the next day. Mhmm. So I tended to do the cheat days on Sunday, in my case. Mhmm. And then I would fast most of Monday just water, black coffee, tea, and then I might have a small meal in the evening.[0:57:08] Andrew Huberman: And then by Tuesday, I was back on the slow carb diet. Does does that seem like a, in, sort of a detrimental deviation from the from the plan.[0:57:18] Tim Ferriss: I think that if that is what works for you, then that is what works for you. So this is the this the slow carb diet template for me is a starting point. And generally, I'll say, in. I think this is from Picasso. Right?[0:57:30] Tim Ferriss: It's like learn the rules as an amateur so you can break them as a professional. Mhmm. But it's like I recommend most people kinda stick with the format in for a handful of weeks and measure the results. Right? There's so there are guidelines for how to measure.[0:57:46] Tim Ferriss: The the scale is a bit of a blunt instrument, so there are other ways. But if you're extremely overweight, you can just use the scale. And in fasting, I think, is fine or just ratcheting back your caloric consumption significantly. And what happens over time for most people also in is for the 1st, say, 4 weeks on cheat day, you're gonna go completely insane. And, I remember I was doing something much stricter called the cyclical ketogenic diet, which is a whole separate thing.[0:58:17] Tim Ferriss: It's much more limiting in terms of what you can eat, but I was training for ultimately the nationals in Chinese kickboxing. This was happening in 99. So I was training super hard. I was following a cyclical ketogenic diet, which meant I could eat very few things, but I did have this 1 cheat day. And I would do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand, which is one of the things you can do to limit the damage on cheat day.[0:58:41] Tim Ferriss: Do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand, and then I would just go crazy. I mean, I would drive to, like, Krispy Kreme, buy 12 donuts, and they would be gone by the time I got home. And it wasn't an hour away. It was, like, a 10 minute drive. Donuts be gone.[0:58:54] Tim Ferriss: Right? I would go to Safeway, and I would buy a bag of those fun sized Snickers, and that would be just a tiny portion of my calories.[0:59:03] Andrew Huberman: Stuff for you. Uh-huh.[0:59:04] Tim Ferriss: It a lot of sweet stuff. I also did the savory stuff. I mean, I had my favorites. Nothing was safe, sir. Nothing was safe.[0:59:11] Tim Ferriss: Nothing was safe. My my paws got into everything. And then over time, because the next day, you're gonna feel like you got hit by a a diabetic dump truck, in. You start ratcheting back, and you're like, okay. Maybe I don't need to do that.[0:59:25] Tim Ferriss: Maybe cheat day will just be 2 meals, or maybe cheat day will just be, like, the pastries in the morning with the coffee, and, you start to regulate a bit generally. You don't have to, but over time, you generally will. And I think after you've followed it to the tee, just follow the commandments for, say, 4 to 8 weeks, then you can certainly deviate. And I'm not saying if you're not hungry, don't eat. In.[0:59:49] Tim Ferriss: However, in many cases, people have they have acclimated to not eating in the morning, in, and then they end up overeating later in the day. If you have that habit, right, if you're consuming 50% of your calories or more at dinner in and you want to lose body fat, I would say, get some cottage cheese or something that will give you 30 grams easily in the morning. Worst case scenario, use a protein of some type. Just don't make it hypochloric.[1:00:21] Andrew Huberman: You mean powdered protein? Like[1:00:22] Tim Ferriss: Could be powdered way powdered whey protein. Whole food is gonna do a lot more.[1:00:26] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And no calorie counting. Correct?[1:00:29] Tim Ferriss: No calorie counting. It tends to be self limiting. When you're eating this much fiber and this much protein, it tends to be very self limiting, what you'll want to consume and what you can consume.[1:00:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Once again, I had great experiences with slow carb diet, and, I'm gonna go back on.[1:00:46] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And nobody and, nobody needs to buy anything to figure it out If you just search on 10.blog, slow carb diet, there you'll get everything that you need to get started. No purchase necessary.[1:00:59] Andrew Huberman: Well, it works very, very well, I'll say that, and it's very straightforward to follow, and it does include the the notorious, cheat day, infamous cheat day. Yep. And it can be done, on a on a very reasonable budget. And so if people wanna learn more about that, they should go to Tim's blog on four hour, in, for our body and, slow carb diet. We'll provide a link.[1:01:21] Andrew Huberman: Yep. But it's you know, I I think it's worth highlighting again just how effective that is. In. You know? As you pointed out, thousands and thousands of people, using it to great success, some of whom were, quite obese.[1:01:34] Andrew Huberman: And, yeah, any updates on those folks? Are they still keeping the weight off? I would like[1:01:38] Tim Ferriss: to do a follow-up. It's I think with diets in general, in. There's a lot of reversion to the mean, you know, regression to the mean. So I would expect that that some have kept it off and some have not. That would be true of, I think, every possible diet, especially for people who are overcoming behavioral inertia of having gained hundreds of pounds.[1:01:59] Tim Ferriss: But, I'd like to do some follow-up. What was fun about the post I put together called how to lose a 100 pounds on the slow carb diet? We had we profiled, say, 4 or 5 people, but there were dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens, and this was a very long time ago. So I would say that A long term follow-up would be super interesting, and we did at one point track several 1,000 people through a platform at the time. I think it was coach dot me in as they follow the soy carb diet for the 1st sort of 4 to 12 weeks.[1:02:32] Tim Ferriss: And that was fascinating because I want the data, and I'm happy to be proven incorrect with any of my assumptions. I mean, I I don't view that as a failure. I mean, I view that as a as a huge net gain, and, It has a very high adherence rate. So I I pay attention to not just is something effective, does it get you the outcome you want? Not only is it efficient from a time and resource perspective, but how high is the adherence rate?[1:02:59] Tim Ferriss: Right? So if you take a random sampling of a 1000 people from the US across socioeconomic classes, etcetera, how many people, practically speaking, will be able to or willing to follow this for, say, an 8 week period of time or 4 week period of time, and I try to optimize for the widest adherence because I know the the slow carb diet people come on, they're like, what? But what about intermittent fasting? What about this? And what about endurance athletes?[1:03:23] Tim Ferriss: I'm like, this is not for everybody in all cases. It just happens to be a good default diet with a high adherence rate. And like you said, it's very inexpensive. It can be followed very, very inexpensively.[1:03:34] Andrew Huberman: Could I sorry to interrupt you. One thing that I really like about it is that, many, variants on caloric restriction, which is because in laws of thermodynamics definitely apply.[1:03:46] Tim Ferriss: Folks, we're[1:03:46] Andrew Huberman: not we're not trying to say they don't, but one of the issues with a lot of things, including intermittent fasting, which I sort of do some variant of because I'm not really hungry to eat until about 11. I like to train in the morning if I can, etcetera, in is that they can sometimes prevent best performance in terms of especially resistance training, high intensity resistance training. So very low carb diets. I've have tried them. Yeah.[1:04:09] Andrew Huberman: Even if you're paying attention to, you know, other ways to restock glycogen, performance drops off. Whereas with slow carb diet, I feel like I can think. In. I can work. I can exercise.[1:04:19] Andrew Huberman: I can sleep. Like, everything just works well, but there's 1 thing in it that I want to raise that I when I heard this, I thought there's no way this is true, which was, making sure that you get 30 or so grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. Yep. And I thought, how can that be? Like, how can adding protein early in the day actually make a difference, and it really did work.[1:04:37] Andrew Huberman: I was I still track my numbers. So in terms of dropping body fat percentage, increasing muscle, it really does work. Now whether or not that's simply because it's offsetting food intake that I would have, food that I would have taken in later in the day, I don't know, and I don't I'm not gonna make myself my own control experiment to the point that I drive myself crazy.[1:04:55] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[1:04:56] Andrew Huberman: But, it really does work, quite well, to get past sticking points to just get that 30 grams of protein early. So sort of violate the in the, time restricted feeding component deliberately with some protein in the morning Yep. Then still train and do all the other things and, you know, carry on as usual, and it it's just so it seems so peculiar, like eating more and and losing body fat, but Yeah.[1:05:17] Tim Ferriss: It works. In. Yeah. It's counterintuitive, and a lot of approaches can work for a lot of different people. Right?[1:05:25] Tim Ferriss: To state the obvious. In, but this particular aspect of the slow carb diet is helpful for, let's just say, the majority of the people in that 1,000 person sample I was talking about the hypothetical pull from different parts of, say, the US or anywhere because it it it seems to help with a few things. First, there's just the thermic effect of food, and for protein, there's a greater thermic effect. You also have and I think there's there's decent at the time, there was decent literature to support this, so I don't know if it's changed that the protein intake along those lines has an appetite suppressing effect so that the net daily calories consumed tends to be less when someone has a higher protein meal earlier in the day. In.[1:06:13] Tim Ferriss: And last but not least, I will say one of the risks and there are many people who execute well on this, but you have to be very meticulous, which is true of the ketogenic diet as well. So You can get yourself into a lot of trouble if you do it 60% right or 70% right. You're really Yeah. In there.[1:06:28] Andrew Huberman: You can[1:06:28] Tim Ferriss: get yourself in there.[1:06:29] Andrew Huberman: Massive psoriasis. I mean, my scalp, you know, sloughing off when, like, when I'm in ketosis, like, I'm like, what the hell is going on here going back on some Complex carbohydrates, and it going away?[1:06:40] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean Exactly. So I[1:06:41] Andrew Huberman: don't need I don't need a randomized controlled trial. You know, I simply don't wanna run that experiment again.[1:06:45] Tim Ferriss: Your scalp. Yeah. So in the case of, in, say, time restricted feeding. Some people who do intermittent fasting lose a lot of muscle mass, in, and there are multiple reasons for this. I I think people should make use of relatively widely available tools like DXA and so on to ensure sure that your composition is actually moving the way you think it's moving.[1:07:09] Tim Ferriss: Make sure you standardize your hydration for that as well as time of day. Just pro tip. That's true for blood tests as well, but it seems to get net net better effects in trying to teach people how to fast effectively, which you can do, and we can talk about fasting. That's something that was not included in the 4 hour body that in. Were I to rewrite it today, I would include a section, and there was a bit in tools of titans to address that on more extended fasts.[1:07:37] Tim Ferriss: Let's just call it 3 to 7 day fasts. So that's an area that's of of great interest to me as is ketosis and metabolic psychiatry. I'll, Chris Palmer Yeah. Who we both know.[1:07:48] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Incredible. I mean, what he's what the awakening that he's, created in through his book and going on your podcast, my podcast, and others in in, you know, letting people be aware that changes in diet can impact mental health. So I think in 2, 3 years, it's gonna be a duh. Yeah.[1:08:07] Andrew Huberman: And we're not just talking about the difference between, you know, slamming back horrible foods, horrible for us foods versus eating really clean. I mean, really specific diet protocols to treat mental health. Yeah. Incredible.[1:08:19] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Super exciting. So that's that's one of the things that I'm paying a lot of attention to right now. There are handful in that realm within the, just say the the interplay of mind and body since the car Cartesian duality and separation of those 2 makes no sense in from a biological standpoint. So, that's that's something that certainly captured my attention.[1:08:40] Tim Ferriss: I paid a lot of attention to even as far back as early 2000, in, for mental health and just cognitive performance.[1:08:48] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. Mitt. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers, but no information mentioning about what to do with all of that data.[1:09:20] Andrew Huberman: Insight Tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, And then to assess what sorts of behavioral, nutritional, supplementation, or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for your health. For this week only, the week of June 19, 2023, InsideTracker is offering a buy 1, get 1 free on their ultimate plan. This is their best discount of the year. You can get this offer by going to insidetracker.com/huberman. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.[1:09:53] Andrew Huberman: Thanks for, revisiting some of the 4 Hour Body and Slow Carb Diet and elaborating on, some of the process that went into that. And I think, a creators of all kinds, thinkers of all kinds, and people who are interested in the contents of The 4 Hour Body are going to be very grateful for that information. I certainly am fascinated by your process. One of the things that you mentioned along the lines of process was, you know, the power of places in where one happens to live. I think there's a essay by Paul Graham that talks about this.[1:10:25] Andrew Huberman: It's a little outdated. Yeah. You know, and it talks about the messages that you, the tacit messages of being in certain cities. I think it was, you know, like Boston, You're not smart enough. What was it?[1:10:39] Andrew Huberman: It was New York. You're not powerful enough, and not you always. I'm just thinking and, or you should be more powerful is the message, like the task and message. Los Angeles, what you're, what What you're doing, people aren't paying attention paying enough attention to it, something like that. Like, the facet messages that these are stereotypes about cities.[1:10:58] Andrew Huberman: Certainly, cities change. The role of places is an interesting one. Like, you you know, you mentioned, you know, a small gathering, Kevin Kelly's house, quantified self, and I think for people who don't know people like that.[1:11:10] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[1:11:11] Andrew Huberman: Right? Maybe we could get your thoughts on, you know, how would one think about where to live and and maybe even curating their own gatherings Mhmm. Useful gatherings because it's not that, I have to imagine it's not that you guys sat back and you're I'm Tim Ferriss, and he's like, I'm Kevin Kelly. Let's have a gathering so we can talk about it in a few years on a podcast. This stuff happens.[1:11:32] Andrew Huberman: In Mhmm. That word, you know, it's a dangerous word, organically. When people who have common interests decide to get together and talk and listen and brainstorm, and I'm yet to do that in a you know, with good people and not have something really incredible come out of it, not necessarily that day Yep. But looking 5 years looking back 5 years later and just go, god. That was really worthwhile.[1:11:57] Tim Ferriss: Totally. Yeah. In. Few thoughts in no particular order. I would say the first is it depends my recommendations depend a lot on where you are in the arc of your career in life.[1:12:08] Tim Ferriss: In. If you are in full growth hyperdrive mode and you are trying to build both yourself and your capabilities in a very concentrated way where you're not necessarily focused on family. You maybe have fewer obligations. In. Then if you're serious, I think many people should consider moving to an area of high density in for a period of time.[1:12:37] Tim Ferriss: It could be 3 months. It could be 6 months. It could be longer. But putting yourself in in New York or in LA or San Francisco or Chicago or as new places develop. I'll I'll give you one you might not expect, say, in Ottawa, Canada, where Shopify is based, and the presence and Growth of Shopify has spawned an entire ecosystem of startups.[1:13:03] Tim Ferriss: So there may be options outside of the usual cast of characters. Pittsburgh and Duolingo, similar effect. So there are more options than people might recognize, but taking a journey and placing yourself in a place where you can be in a very active pinball machine where you may interact serendipitously with many different people from many different worlds, I think is in is is hard to overstate the value of. And my drive And my filtering function, let's just say because when I first got to the Bay Area, nobody cared about me. I was nobody.[1:13:42] Tim Ferriss: I was driving my mom's used minivan hand me down that had the seats stolen out of the back. Were you in the were[1:13:48] Andrew Huberman: you in the South Bay?[1:13:49] Tim Ferriss: I was I was working in San Jose. Yep.[1:13:52] Andrew Huberman: I mean, no disrespect to San Jose. I'm from the South Bay. Yep. But there's a there's a bleakness to the south.[1:13:58] Tim Ferriss: There is there is a little bit of bleakness, and then I lived across the street in this tiny apartment, lived across the street from the Jack in the Box in Mountain View. So it's not like I was strolling onto the big stage and just blowing people away.[1:14:09] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I I I I grew up right near Mountain View. I'm very familiar. I skated the curves of that jacket. Probably did. Yeah.[1:14:15] Andrew Huberman: Did you train at the Gold's Gym in off Rangstor? Did, actually. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah.[1:14:19] Andrew Huberman: That was a great gym.[1:14:20] Tim Ferriss: That was a great gym. That was[1:14:21] Andrew Huberman: a great gym. I don't think it's still[1:14:22] Tim Ferriss: there. Super late before my writing sessions.[1:14:25] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:14:25] Tim Ferriss: And it had the benefit of being open really, really late. Mhmm. And, wow, Ringstor. Haven't thought about that in a long time. So the the point is I also started where a lot of people are starting.[1:14:37] Tim Ferriss: And what did I do? I put myself in a high density environment. Next, what did I do knowing no one? I started to volunteer at events where they had interesting speakers and interesting people coming to hear those speakers. So I put myself in Silicon Valley, and then I began volunteering for groups like Essbase.[1:14:58] Tim Ferriss: I don't know if it exists anymore. The Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs, I think it was. In. Hi. The Indus entrepreneur, which is a very sort of Indian or Indian American focused organization that does a lot in the realm of startups.[1:15:14] Tim Ferriss: And I would carry water, I would take out garbage, I would check name badges, I would check people in. Nothing was too low for me. And I'll give you guys a tip that will be obvious to some, but non obvious to many. When you are volunteering, a lot of folks who volunteer do the absolute bare minimum because they are not getting paid. This is not gonna get you noticed, but It sets a very low bar so that if you volunteer at these events and someone's dropping the ball or there's something happening that needs fixing and you just proactively do it, The producers of these events will notice you.[1:15:51] Tim Ferriss: And this is what happened over time over a few months, and then I got invited to join in on meetings that were planning future events, and I eventually got to the point where I was recruiting speakers and able to set the agenda for an entire main event. And then that's how I got to know, say, Jack Canfield, who is the cocreator of Chicken Soup For The Soul and many others who introduced me to my book agent many, many, many, many years later, Jack Canfield, but I was a nobody then. You have to play the long game, but you can be methodical on how you play that. And that is one approach. Just as an example For how to build your network, which snowballs over time, don't hump every VIP's leg within 10 minutes of meeting them.[1:16:38] Tim Ferriss: Play it cool. You know?[1:16:39] Andrew Huberman: And the and the gatherings where that person is, has a lot of demands on them is the last place you wanna do that. Yep.[1:16:47] Tim Ferriss: The way you're gonna make yourself[1:16:48] Andrew Huberman: memorable to that. Yeah. The way[1:16:49] Tim Ferriss: you're gonna make yourself memorable with people like that is to be very professional, always on time, in predict what they are going to need or problems they'll run into beforehand and address them before they even think of them and be easy to deal with. In, and people like that, high performers notice these things. They will make note of it.[1:17:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The being easy to work with is something that I used to tell my graduate students, postdocs. I mean, it because the opposite of that, nobody wants. Yep. Right?[1:17:20] Andrew Huberman: Nobody wants that. Yeah.[1:17:21] Tim Ferriss: Especially in the beginning. Like, later? Okay. Great. You're Steve Jobs.[1:17:23] Tim Ferriss: You wanna be difficult here and there or a lot? No problem. Yeah. Right? But in the beginning, that can be a real liability.[1:17:32] Tim Ferriss: You can make up for that if you're the best in the world, but in the very beginning, you probably won't be. In. So trying to stack the deck in your favor. Volunteering is a shortcut, and that would be one way of doing it. Another now, especially given the virtual communities that exist.[1:17:47] Tim Ferriss: So you have subreddits. You have online communities. You have Twitter groups. You have Clubhouse. You've got a 1000000 different options, which can be overwhelming.[1:17:55] Andrew Huberman: Clubhouse still going?[1:17:56] Tim Ferriss: Maybe not. I have no idea.[1:17:57] Andrew Huberman: Oh, no. I don't know. I'm not saying it's gone. I just I remember during the pandemic, there were some Clubhouse gatherings. I hopped on there, but I've sort of forgotten to to get on the mic.[1:18:05] Tim Ferriss: The the platform affinity is really fickle, which is why I think, in. To the extent possible, if you wanna build a world class, and I use that term very deliberately, network in record time just to give you a nice headline, in. I would say focus on the uncrowded channel, which is in person. It's out of fashion. It's out of vogue.[1:18:26] Tim Ferriss: Going to a conference and actually interacting with humans in the hallway, approaching panelists. This is another thing that I did. I'll give it give another tip. So very early on, I would go to conferences. Nobody cared who I was.[1:18:39] Tim Ferriss: Nobody knew who I was. Fine. And I would study the panels. Let's say I'm going to a big event like South by Southwest, and I would this is what I did in 2007, which was just prior to the 1st book coming out. And I would go to these various in person events.[1:18:57] Tim Ferriss: I was focused mostly on events that had, the the thematic focus of blogs. We'd come back to that. The blogs were what podcasts were a few years ago. Right? They drove incredible traffic, but they were undervalued by mainstream media, undervalued by mainstream publishers, etcetera, which meant there was an arbitrage opportunity in a way.[1:19:18] Tim Ferriss: And I would pick, say, a handful of Panels with topics I thought were super interesting, and then the panel would end. And what would happen? The panelists would get rushed by various folks because many of them were well known. Who was not getting rushed? The moderator.[1:19:36] Tim Ferriss: I would go straight to the moderator, And I would talk to the moderator. I'd thank them for the panel. I'd be very genuine. None of it was made up. And talk to them for a bit.[1:19:44] Tim Ferriss: They would generally ask why I was there, what I was interested in, I would mention whatever that happened to be. In this case, it was. I'm finishing my 1st book or I have my 1st book coming out soon. I'm here to hopefully meet people, in who are involved with a, b, or c. And then if we hit it off, which is not true every time, but if it seemed to be going well, I would say is I don't know anyone here.[1:20:06] Tim Ferriss: In. I'm really sort of orphaned here making my way through, this entire event. Is there anyone else here you think I would get along with who maybe I could buy a drink or a coffee. And the vast majority of the time, they'd be like, oh, yeah. You should meet so and so.[1:20:21] Tim Ferriss: And then I get the introduction, and then I would meet that person. In. I would have a genuine interaction with that person. And if it made sense, if things were going well, I'd do the same thing. Is Is there anybody else here you think I should just say hi to and get along with?[1:20:36] Tim Ferriss: Not who I can ask for something, And that wasn't deception. I was being honest. Like, someone I could actually vibe with. And in. If so, would you mind making the intro?[1:20:48] Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem. Many of those people are still my friends. And by being surgical in that way, not trying to gather business cards, to use a really antiquated metaphor.[1:21:02] Andrew Huberman: People still hand them out.[1:21:03] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People still hand them out. I guess, depends on where you are, especially like Boston. But, if if rather than trying to collect people as Pokemon cards developing, say, 5 3 to 5 deeper relationships through longer conversations at an event. That is what directly led ultimately to the hockey stick for the 4 hour work week in within tech, within specifically San Francisco.[1:21:32] Tim Ferriss: So those would be a few approaches for for building your network when you don't have the ability to just walk up to say Kevin Kelly and have a conversation. That came over time.[1:21:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Whether or not it's at health practices or, nutritional practices or at meetings. Seems you're oriented toward the uncrowded but very interesting people in spaces.[1:21:58] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[1:21:59] Andrew Huberman: But the in keyword there, I think, is uncrowded, and, of course, the other keyword is interesting. Right? Mhmm. I mean, it's not like you're standing in the parking lot talking to whoever happens to be there, although that can be interesting. There's a serendipity there, and, you know, there's always, things to learn from people.[1:22:13] Andrew Huberman: But in terms of, career advancement and and building new ideas and forging for information, I'm just struck how you've done that over and over. And, again, thank you for, giving us some insight, into the process. Please.[1:22:27] Tim Ferriss: Here's another one. In. So I think there's a tendency among people who want to develop their networks or their relationships to be star fuckers. Not to get too technical, but[1:22:40] Andrew Huberman: not a technical term.[1:22:41] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They want to tell other people they are friends with someone more than they want to develop skills or learn from someone this puts you in a very disadvantaged position because then that means alright you wanna become friends with Elon Musk good luck in. Or you wanna become friends with this a lister celebrity who everyone else wants to meet?[1:23:03] Tim Ferriss: Good luck. It's gonna be a crowded, bloody path to get there. And by the way, they've also certainly developed really attuned defenses against at people like you, so it's gonna be hard. On the[1:23:16] Andrew Huberman: other They have staff to prevent[1:23:18] Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. From happening. Phalanx of protectors to prevent you from ever getting to that person. On the other hand, if you're approaching it from the standpoint of developing skills, learning and actually becoming potential friends with someone. I'll give you an example.[1:23:34] Tim Ferriss: You could go after you wanna become better at boxing. Let's just make that up. Alright. Maybe not the greatest example. Skiing would be another one, but let's let's stick with boxing just because, in of the way I'll explain it.[1:23:48] Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to say get personalized lessons from Floyd Mayweather, ain't gonna happen. Okay. Let's go then maybe a step down out of the pro ranks to gold medalist. Okay. If it's brand new gold medalist, let's just say, Oscar De La Hoya when he was really the golden boy and had just thrashed everyone.[1:24:06] Tim Ferriss: Still gonna be hard. What about the silver medalist who just had a bad day when he had that last bout against Oscar De La Hoya, potentially. Right? From a technical perspective, from a personal connection perspective. You may have more in common with that person or bronze medalist, and they can get you 70, 80, 90% of the way there.[1:24:25] Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you You probably don't have the physical attributes to make it do a 100% anyway if you're coming to it this late. And in. You could get, in many cases, 1 on 1 lessons whether in person or virtually with someone who is of that caliber. In. They're in the same front of the pack as the names I just mentioned, maybe not as famous.[1:24:49] Tim Ferriss: $100, $200 per hour. Mhmm. For a lot of people, that is within reach.[1:24:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I'm not sure what the value of saying one knows somebody very famous is. It's just never been something that I've oriented to. It's a common orientation, though.[1:25:06] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And, I think that's true for a lot of things. Like, many people use, say psychedelics because they want to tell other people the story that they have of doing psychedelics. Right? They're not doing it intrinsically for what they hope to get out of that experience, maybe there's part of them, but it's more the social signaling and validation they get when they project that out at a group dinner into a story that think I can tell, and that's true for many things.[1:25:32] Tim Ferriss: So one of the questions I ask myself with all sorts of things, if I could never talk about this, would I do it?[1:25:38] Andrew Huberman: What a what a great, great,[1:25:41] Tim Ferriss: right,[1:25:42] Andrew Huberman: thing to think about.[1:25:43] Tim Ferriss: Right? Like, if I could if I could have let's just say we didn't know each other, and I was like, okay. I'm earlier in my career. Let's apply some constraints. So I'm not where I am.[1:25:51] Tim Ferriss: I still want to do a, b, and c in the public eye. Maybe I wanna build a podcast, whoever. If I could meet with you but I could never tell a soul, would I do it?[1:26:00] Andrew Huberman: I don't know. Would you? I would. Thank you. I would.[1:26:03] Andrew Huberman: But I would too. Right?[1:26:04] Tim Ferriss: But for a lot of folks, if this[1:26:06] Andrew Huberman: Meaning, I'd meet with you. I'm not saying I'd meet[1:26:08] Tim Ferriss: with me, by the way.[1:26:10] Andrew Huberman: I'd meet with me. You know? The Believe me, I meet with me all the time, and sometimes it's pretty unpleasant.[1:26:16] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And and that can be applied to all sorts of things. Right? It's like and it's it's a useful question because I ask myself this in For examining your motivations. And I'm not saying one motivation is always better than another, but it's it's you should at least be aware of your driving motivations because you can end up playing games you're not even aware you're playing, and that's how you end up, I think, getting into a lot of trouble in life, one of the ways.[1:26:39] Tim Ferriss: So that would be a question I might apply. I apply other questions. Like, there's a great question, that Seth Godin applies who really I admire tremendously and has built an incredibly unorthodox unique life for himself and his family. He's he's he's zigged when everyone would expect him to zag, and I I and he always has a defensible logic behind it. In.[1:27:02] Tim Ferriss: And, much like Derek Sivers, but most people have probably heard the hypothetical question like, what would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? Right. Or what would you do if you couldn't fail? And Seth turns that around. I think that's a good question, but he turns around and said, what would you do if you knew you were gonna fail?[1:27:19] Tim Ferriss: In. In terms of identifying what you would do for the process, right, what would you do If you knew it was gonna fail okay. You're considering these 5 different projects. Let's say they're all gonna fail, but you still have to choose 1 of the 5. Which would you choose?[1:27:34] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's a great question. Yeah. Much harder to answer. Yep.[1:27:39] Andrew Huberman: And, you know, at the same time, I'm called back to when When I was a graduate student and still now with the podcast, I have this, litmus test, which is, in. You know? Is the experiment that I'm working on the one that I wanna be working on most? Is the podcast that I'm working on the one that I wanna be on most. I mean, there's truly no other podcast I'd rather be having today than this one.[1:28:02] Andrew Huberman: Right? And the moment I'm starting to think, oh, I wish I was doing that in thing over there. I realize I'm off target. I'm off target. And, I think that asking really good questions something clearly that you're very good at, and getting a little bit deeper into your process around that, do you write those things down?[1:28:20] Andrew Huberman: Like, is there a notebook someplace in the kingdom of, at, of Tim Ferriss in Austin or elsewhere, that says, you know, those questions that that, Essentially, those questions are written. Are they Yeah.[1:28:33] Tim Ferriss: I collect I I literally have a document with questions that I've gathered from Seth printed out and at the Airbnb where I'm staying here.[1:28:40] Andrew Huberman: So So I'm I brought it with you.[1:28:42] Tim Ferriss: I printed it out here, and then I went through and I read it last night. I was highlighting questions from past interviews I've had with him on podcast to revisit his questions. So I I was literally doing that last night over dinner, and I collect questions. I collect questions. If I am reading a magazine and I come across a good question, I take take a photo or I capture it somehow in notes or in Evernote, which I know is kinda old fashioned these days, but we used it for everything.[1:29:08] Tim Ferriss: So the critical mass is beyond enormous, and I do collect and revisit these things. I capture them in journals as well, but I I absolutely capture good questions when I find them.[1:29:22] Andrew Huberman: Questions are so powerful for the brain. I don't wanna go into this in too much detail because I have a lot more questions for you, but, we Just wrapped a a series on mental health, that will come out later this year with Paul Contee, and he, is brilliant as we both know and, does truly important work, and, and he pointed to the value of asking really good questions about oneself. And the because of the way that questions that are really directed at self inquiry queue up the subconscious. So you you asked the question, and unlike a statement or a meme, the brain works with that in the days and hours after asking the question in ways that, simple declarative statements probably don't ping the system the same way, which is probably why we can see so many points of wisdom and truth everywhere, and it doesn't necessarily transform us, but asking really good questions really does seem to transform us.[1:30:18] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. There there's, in. I think judging people by their questions is is also a shortcut to assessing and learning a lot about how someone functions and what makes them tick. I think it's Voltaire who said, you know, judge a man by his questions, by his answers, something along those lines. But when in doubt, attribute to Voltaire, it sounds good.[1:30:40] Andrew Huberman: Does sound good.[1:30:41] Tim Ferriss: And, I think about this a lot. I do think about the questions, and I refine the questions that I ask myself, especially while journaling because it's easier to cross examine and stress test your own certainty in and beliefs when they are captured on paper[1:30:58] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:30:59] Tim Ferriss: Or digitally on a laptop, for instance. So I I do routinely revisit certain questions that I found helpful over time. I mean, one that people can play with in is with whatever is really causing you consternation or stress at the moment, some kind of decision or relationship, business, Could be anything. Just what might this look like if it were easy? Right?[1:31:26] Tim Ferriss: What might this look like? If it were easy, if it had to be easy, if that were possible, what might it look like?[1:31:32] Andrew Huberman: In, and that could apply to anything.[1:31:33] Tim Ferriss: That could apply to anything. Mhmm. You know? Could apply to could apply to fitness. It's like, look.[1:31:37] Tim Ferriss: If you do really intense kettlebell swings twice a week with proper weight and load and time under tension, and you do push ups a few times a week and handle a couple of other elements. You can get in pretty good shape. It's so simple, but hits a lot. I mean, it hits your entire posterior chain. Okay.[1:31:58] Tim Ferriss: Fine. Do some push ups and some core work. Yeah. But if you're not exercising at all because you've made the assumption that it's 4 hours, 5 hours a week rather than completely remove that objective in and call it just impractical. Can you ratchet down the scale?[1:32:21] Tim Ferriss: How far can you ratchet down the scale until you have no excuses. Right? It'll just be one one example. Language learning, tech investing, plus everything. In.[1:32:31] Andrew Huberman: Making life easier is something that definitely gets my vote. Yeah. Making it easier[1:32:36] Tim Ferriss: and making it more elegant.[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:32:38] Tim Ferriss: The more pieces in your life you have floating around, the more contacts, the more extraneous loose connections, the harder your life is gonna be. The cognitive overload or overhead is really high, so I'm always looking for maybe, like, Japanese, you know, flower arrangements. Like, okay. How how many pieces can I remove while still, like, maintaining the essence of what I'm trying to achieve?[1:33:00] Andrew Huberman: You and Rick Rubin, man, I'm telling you, you know, 2 people I am fortunate enough to know personally and that I have tremendous Beckford, and, you know, the work and, is self evident. You know? It's really remarkable. So, in. Rewind that and listen to that segment right there, folks.[1:33:17] Andrew Huberman: I'm telling you, I've worked hard to apply it because it's not my default, and, a boy. Does it make a significant improvement to simplify, simplify, simplify? Take some thought and question asking. It's like you just can't delete things at random Yeah. Till you get down to some fixed number, but, I'd like to ask you about another area where you really have seemed to see around corners.[1:33:40] Andrew Huberman: And this is one that actually carried with it significant risk. Not necessarily risk to health and to life, but risk in terms of outside perceptions, and that's psychedelics. Mhmm. As you know, I've substantially changed my view on this. We don't need to go into my former Stan Sona.[1:33:59] Andrew Huberman: I talked about that when you were gracious enough to host me on your podcast for a 2nd time. Done some psychedelics recreationally as a kid. It was correlated with, not so great times in my life, stayed away from them, then eventually revisited MDMA in particular from a therapeutic standpoint, found tremendous benefit. Again, therapeutically with a medical doctor. Again, these drugs are illegal.[1:34:20] Andrew Huberman: Soon to change, perhaps, hopefully, and we'll talk about that. But, man. It's becoming clear from the controlled studies by Robin Carter Harris. There are many others. Okay?[1:34:33] Andrew Huberman: Nolan Williams, others, in, that these drugs have enormous potential to help relieve depression, trauma, in, help people explore their psyche, their mind for sake of feeling better, doing better in the world, for leaning into life, not tune in, drop out, but, in, you know, to really lean into life with more purpose and more satisfaction. In some cases, they've really have saved lives, I think. What was your mindset around psychedelics when you first started exploring them? Mhmm. What led you to overcome the inevitable, you know, fear gap there, because you do seem like somebody who takes value in your health.[1:35:17] Andrew Huberman: Right? You're not reckless. Ma'am. You may have been more adventurous in the past with things like, I hate the word, but biohacking and self experimentation than you are now, but but you obviously have some self preservation mechanism intact. We learn.[1:35:29] Andrew Huberman: We learn. We learn. What was your mindset around it at the time? And then I want to get to what you've learned from it, and, frankly, the tremendous efforts that you've put that are now translating to tremendous value for, really millions of people, and, ultimately, I think it's going to be billions of people, by establishing funding for the pioneering research in this area, helping to promote the movement of these compounds from illegal to legal in the therapeutic setting, so on and so on. So take us back to, in, your first thoughtful exploration of psychedelics.[1:36:07] Andrew Huberman: What'd that look like? You're like, mushrooms. I'll eat them. Was that it, or was it, or what or was it a a dedicated, research process? And who'd you talk to?[1:36:18] Andrew Huberman: What was it all about?[1:36:19] Tim Ferriss: In. So let's go way back to my undergrad experience, and in. There are many reasons that I end up going to Princeton. I I think I was very lucky to get in. My SAT scores, because I can never finish the damn test.[1:36:34] Tim Ferriss: I was so much of a perfectionist. I would get stuck in. And ended up not doing terribly well, but through essays and other things, ultimately, was able to go.[1:36:42] Andrew Huberman: Part of the trial interrupt you and just say, I think at this point, we can say they They were lucky to have you.[1:36:47] Tim Ferriss: Well, thank you for[1:36:48] Andrew Huberman: saying that. Yeah.[1:36:48] Tim Ferriss: Thank you for saying that.[1:36:49] Andrew Huberman: Great institution, and you've done great, and you're a a a great, a poster on the wall for them. Yeah. No. Oh, really? I hope so.[1:36:57] Andrew Huberman: Really. Really. Yeah. I I I just wanna say it because you're not going to, and I think it's important that these are great institutions of great minds go through there, and, you know, Einstein went through there. Yeah.[1:37:08] Andrew Huberman: And, and their success rests not just on the Einsteins, but also on the student body and what they go out into the world and do. Yeah. And not just in the realm of science. So Yeah. Really, they're lucky they're lucky to have had you.[1:37:18] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I studied Chinese in a room where Einstein used to teach. It's pretty cool to set foot and spend time weekly in a space that was shared by some of these people. Amazing.[1:37:29] Tim Ferriss: It really it really gets the imagination firing. If we go back to that chapter in my life, I was initially a psychology major with focus on neuroscience, so I want to be a neuroscientist. And there are many reasons for that. I have neurodegenerative disease on both sides of my family, so Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. So that was certainly a personal driving interest in.[1:37:56] Tim Ferriss: In terms of looking at mechanisms, understanding what therapeutics existed or did not exist, how things were developing in the research. And while I was there, which later I ended up, switching gears and transferring to focus on language acquisition and East Asian studies, Hence, the Chinese that I mentioned earlier and Japanese and Korean. But on the neuroscience side, there were a lot of cool breakthroughs also that came out of, in. Princeton, around that time looking at the amazing discovery of, say, neuronal, I I wanna say regenesis, but neurogenesis in the hippocampus. And those Goulds were Exactly.[1:38:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Exactly. So there was[1:38:38] Tim Ferriss: quite a bit happening at that time. I was a subject. I loved volunteering for studies just to try to get an inside look at how things were done in some of, Daniel Kahneman's experiments. In. So it was a cool time to be there.[1:38:52] Tim Ferriss: And within the 1st 2 years, I wanna say I had my first experience recreationally with mushrooms. And looking back now, I mean, I'm horrified by the lack of control in. And meaning not control, but lack of supervision. Right? I mean, the setting the set and setting ended up being fine.[1:39:13] Tim Ferriss: Nothing terrible happened, but there are a lot of ways it could have gone sideways, but that first experience and I must have consumed in retrospect just a dizzying amount of mushrooms. Man. It should[1:39:23] Andrew Huberman: be in excess of 5 grams.[1:39:25] Tim Ferriss: I would been more. Yeah. Just knowing what I know now,[1:39:27] Andrew Huberman: it would have been Kids don't do this at all.[1:39:30] Tim Ferriss: Don't don't do that.[1:39:31] Andrew Huberman: I'm not I'm I'm not gonna say don't do it at home. Don't do it at all.[1:39:33] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yep.[1:39:34] Andrew Huberman: Please. I don't think I actually don't think, the young developing brain should be exposed to psychedelics. We could talk about we could talk about that. Yeah. We can just we can[1:39:43] Tim Ferriss: talk about[1:39:43] Andrew Huberman: my stance. I'm gonna take the stance. For now,[1:39:45] Tim Ferriss: in the I mean, in in the world in which we live in the US, I would I would totally agree with you. There are some interesting cultural exceptions in other places, where there things are more set up to provide for that type of use, but I certainly would not recommend it. But but coming back to my my recreational experience, in. My my subjective experience was so bizarre, and my experience of time so nonlinear, my experience of self in So different from anything I had experienced up to that point. And therefore, my destruction of reality being so completely unlike anything I had experienced was enough to make me want to learn about these compounds.[1:40:34] Tim Ferriss: In, and very early on, I still have a scan of it somewhere. I think it was in 1998 or 99. I actually wrote a Paper. One of my junior papers was focused on examining potential similarities between REM sleep and, LSD. Mhmm.[1:40:53] Tim Ferriss: LSD 25. And looking at some of the patterns of of neural activity. Of course, we can do a lot more now with with the tools that we have available. But from a scientific perspective, I was very curious about how much we knew and how much we didn't know, and I would say that latter category gets me more excited in a way.[1:41:17] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And I'm[1:41:17] Tim Ferriss: like, okay. How how much room is there for growth here? Right? Because if if we're just putting on the finishing touches with marginal, you know, incremental improvements on something that we feel like we've largely figured out that's less interesting to me than something[1:41:34] Andrew Huberman: that baffles in[1:41:34] Tim Ferriss: most people examining them on some level. And there was a professor named Barry Jacobs who was doing some very interesting work. He did a lot of work looking at the in Serotonergic systems and, did a lot of work with cats. Ultimately, I could not do personally the animal work required of the sort of indentured servitude that I would[1:41:56] Andrew Huberman: I think you wrote someplace once. You know? You you said, you know, when confronted with the, the prospect of, installing a a computer printer into the[1:42:05] Tim Ferriss: head of jack on the back of a cat head.[1:42:07] Andrew Huberman: On the back of a cat head.[1:42:08] Tim Ferriss: They they literally had those, like, those little VGA ports on the back of these cats' heads because cats sleep a lot, and so they're an interesting study. Yeah. A lot[1:42:16] Andrew Huberman: of that cats, Very few laboratories work on cats any longer. It's mostly a mouse, still some nonhuman primate work. My laboratory is essentially shut down, or is in The process is shutting down. Even our mouse work, I much prefer to work on humans. They can give consent, and they house themselves.[1:42:31] Andrew Huberman: And, the animal research thing is tough for an for any sentient being.[1:42:35] Tim Ferriss: In. Yeah. It's it's tough. Yeah. For what it's worth, the cats seem pretty happy.[1:42:39] Tim Ferriss: Like, they were just sleeping. I mean, the the ports were for tracking, so the cats were pretty, I mean, they were just normal cats. The cats were fine, but I would have been we would have been injecting retroviruses into rats and then perfusing them, which means bleeding them to death, in. To avoid bruising of the tissue because then if you're gonna take thin slices and scans, you didn't wanna have bruising, in, and I just couldn't I just couldn't do it. I think it's important.[1:43:04] Tim Ferriss: I do think I do think there's a place for it, but I couldn't do it. So that's why I transferred out. But the the point I was trying to make is that I had the experience, and then I had that drive the scientific interest. In. And then I had probably 1 experience per year for a few years after that.[1:43:25] Tim Ferriss: In. And what I noticed for myself personally, because I've suffered from major depressive disorder and extended depressive episodes, let's just say, on average, 3 to 4 a year. And by by extended Even before you had started out before. Yeah.[1:43:40] Andrew Huberman: From from a young age.[1:43:41] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. From a young age. And I would say so So let's just call it 3 to 4 on average a year. Those could last each a few weeks or a few months. I mean, this is this is a a very high percentage of my total year.[1:43:53] Tim Ferriss: In. And when I had these higher dose experiences with with mushrooms so we're talking about psilocybe mushrooms. And then If we're looking at the molecule that's being examined scientifically, psilocybin, I noticed this afterglow effect that was really durable, and that was an antidepressant effect or a mood elevating effect that lasted far longer than the half life could explain. Right? Because 4 to 6 hours.[1:44:21] Tim Ferriss: You're you're you're kind of on the other side, and I would experience this this afterglow effect for 3 to 6 months. In. And that raised all sorts of interesting questions. What the hell is going on here? Is it the content?[1:44:35] Tim Ferriss: Is it some structural change? There were a lot of unanswered questions for me. And then I had a very, very scary experience that led me to completely stop use of psychedelics where, again, uncontrolled in environment ended up in rural, in rural New York coming out of my trip standing in the middle of the road in the middle of the night with headlights coming at me.[1:44:57] Andrew Huberman: Goodness gracious.[1:44:58] Tim Ferriss: So you don't wanna do that. Yeah. And I was like, okay. Too dangerous.[1:45:01] Andrew Huberman: Were were you taking them alone? Is that how that is?[1:45:03] Tim Ferriss: Taking them with 2 friends, and my 2 friends, without telling me, just went for a walk and left me alone.[1:45:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So don't do that. To the you know, I mean, the they're these are powerful compounds.[1:45:12] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You're you're you're playing with nuclear power. Like, these these are the this is the nuclear power of, like, psychological or, psychoemotional surgery, is is the way I'd encourage people to think about them. And I stopped using any psychedelics completely. I was still very interested in them, but I basically hit pause.[1:45:39] Tim Ferriss: And I didn't revisit that until, let's call it, 2012, 2013 where I was still struggling with major depressive disorder, and I saw my girlfriend at the time completely transformed by supervised facilitated use of, in this case, Ayahuasca, which, in, was not quite as common as it is in conversation at the time, in. And she did that in South America, but she not only explained her experience, but I was able to see the transformation in her that seemed to have some durability over time, and that is when I started stepping back into in researching psychedelics, looking at what had been published in the last, let's just call it, 10 years, in, as of that point in time. And thinking about how I would approach it systematically in with safeguards, with proper supervision, basically approaching it the way I would have approached any of the topics in the 4 hour body. And That is what led me back into along with a number of other interventions, I should say. So I wasn't betting the farm on psychedelics.[1:46:51] Tim Ferriss: I also started TM at that point. I was I was[1:46:54] Andrew Huberman: Scoot yourself. Some people might, trans, Transcendental Meditation. These are, like, 4 to 10 day meditation retreats.[1:47:02] Tim Ferriss: This was actually much shorter. It was a 2 or 3 day training. Mhmm. And you're visiting the instructor, I wanna say it's once or twice a day, probably once a day, and getting up to speed. And I did this because I was going through an a period of acute stress.[1:47:18] Tim Ferriss: This is finishing the 4 Hour Chef. This is, actually probably in the years preceding that, and I had 1 friend who I'd seen in really changed from, let's just call, hyperkinetic high anxiety to low anxiety. And he said, You have the time. You have the money. Pay for the course.[1:47:38] Tim Ferriss: Just take it. Yes. There are all these criticisms of TM. Yes. There are all these weird historical anecdotes, people trying to levitate and all this weirdness.[1:47:46] Tim Ferriss: Just ignore that.[1:47:46] Andrew Huberman: I'm trying to levitate. Nothing against it. If you actually levitate, then we gotta have a discussion. But trying to levitate seems like it. Why not?[1:47:52] Andrew Huberman: You know, every kid every kid tries all sorts of things.[1:47:55] Tim Ferriss: Give it a go. He's like, just put that aside because I I kept coming up with pushback. And he's like, look. All I'm saying is it's like a warm bath through your mind that you take twice a day, and it'll chill you the fuck out. So try it.[1:48:07] Tim Ferriss: And I was like, okay. Fine. It's a[1:48:08] Andrew Huberman: good endorsement.[1:48:09] Tim Ferriss: I was like I was like, at this point, I was I had been burning the candle at both ends so intensely. It's like, okay. So there's TM, and then I began examining how I might approach. Notice I didn't just jump into using them. I was like, how could I approach taking psychedelics in a sequence in a logical sequence in with proper protections, with safety assurances, and that took me probably a month or two.[1:48:35] Tim Ferriss: And I was right in the middle of In Northern California, you have access to a lot, and only then did I start looking at having my own experiences. And Lo and behold, I mean, I'll I'll cut to the chase, but the the personal outcome and there there are many different benefits, and risks. I should make very clear these things can be extremely dangerous in certain ways. Generally, not physiologically, but they can be dangerous. In.[1:49:04] Tim Ferriss: I would say instead of 3 to 4 times per year on average, I probably have 1 depressive episode every 2 years.[1:49:12] Andrew Huberman: It's a significant improvement. That right.[1:49:14] Tim Ferriss: I mean, from a quality of life perspective, those are 2 different people. Mhmm. And, in. That then led me to and I as I did with all my workouts, right, I took copious notes over the span I mean, now we're looking at 10 plus years. So if I were to ever write another book, it would probably be related to all of the really fine details of the experiments and my learnings, including some of the more, in bizarre things over the last 10 years, but it would be a it would be just a beast to create.[1:49:51] Andrew Huberman: So With with psychedelics experiences with psychedelics?[1:49:54] Tim Ferriss: Psychedelics and sort of psychedelic adjacent, nonordinary experiences of consciousness, which I think often are touching at edges of the same thing, which which is gonna be controversial for some folks. But to to come back to story line just to put a bow on that. When I saw the personal outcomes for me, the anecdotal in from friends who are facilitators who have worked with thousands of people, right, which is pretty good sample size. Mhmm. Still anecdote, but these are people who are very smart, who keep records, and I I believe that these people have spotted patterns that are only going to be possible to test and verify over the next 5 to 10 years.[1:50:42] Tim Ferriss: So I I at least as a as a means of in generating hypotheses. I take these people very seriously. Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins, began looking at the most compelling data related to, say, MDMA assisted psychotherapy and complex PTSD. I I made the commitment to myself that as soon as I had enough money to move the dial because I really felt like these tools were so outside of the normal paradigm of psychiatry and pharmacology, and that made me very excited because it was uncrowded. There's very little funding coming to the space.[1:51:27] Tim Ferriss: It was high leverage, and I looked at it just as I've looked at my many start up investments. In. Limited downside risk, really high upside potential. And I should say before that, I'd already been funding, in a very small way, science. So the 1st check I ever wrote was personally to Adam Gezali's lab at CSF Yeah.[1:51:48] Andrew Huberman: Great lab.[1:51:48] Tim Ferriss: Which at the time was looking at software. He's not gonna like this description, but I'm gonna simplify it. Software that might attenuate or reverse age related cognitive impairment, specifically related to various aspects of in of attention, and that was my 1st foray into funding early stage science, which was very analogous to me of, in to to funding early stage startups. And then later on, to touch on the reputational thing, I know this is a TED talk, so thank you for listening.[1:52:22] Andrew Huberman: No. This is great. Please please, you're always so gracious on your podcast. This is what people want.[1:52:27] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[1:52:27] Andrew Huberman: This is certainly what I wanna hear.[1:52:29] Tim Ferriss: So so on the reputational side, you're right that at the time, especially, let's just call it 2013 to 2015, this was not a a comfortable national conversation of any type.[1:52:41] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't have had this conversation back then.[1:52:43] Tim Ferriss: No way.[1:52:44] Andrew Huberman: I'd lose I I don't know that I would have lost my job. It just would have raised a lot of eyebrows. And now Such studies are happening at[1:52:50] Tim Ferriss: Stanford University. Yeah. The perception was that these are a professional third rail, at the very least. Right? Also illegal.[1:53:00] Tim Ferriss: Therefore, if I talk about them, am I giving someone probable cause? Am I gonna get myself in some type of really tricky legal situation, etcetera? There are a lot of considerations, but I tested that. Just like I was saying, I I like to capture my assumptions on paper so I can stress this. And I was like, okay.[1:53:17] Tim Ferriss: I think that might be true. Most people I know think that is true. But is it true? How could we test to see if that is true or not? In, and I decided to crowdfund for a Hopkins pilot study looking at psilocybin for treatment resistant depression.[1:53:35] Tim Ferriss: In. And I thought to myself, okay. We have we have a couple of couple of things falling in our favor here. Number 1, depression does not discriminate. So across socioeconomic classes, across gender, across race, this is a problem.[1:53:52] Tim Ferriss: In. Almost everyone knows someone who takes antidepressants who is still depressed. Okay. Treatment resistant depression, therefore, is the indication. Psilocybin is the intervention.[1:54:05] Tim Ferriss: Let me crowdfund, and I did that throughout the time, Crowdrise, which was cofounded by Edward Norton who had become a friend and was The actor, Edward Norton. Who's very smart. Very, very, very smart. Also, one of the best investors I've ever met, which a lot of people don't know. Very bright guy.[1:54:21] Tim Ferriss: And so crowdfunded, and I also like to put my, money where my mouth is. I said, okay, guys. I'm gonna seed this. Like, I'm putting in x. The goal is to raise, I think it was 80,000, something like that, for the following study.[1:54:35] Tim Ferriss: And then I was like, let's see. Let's see what happens. And there was basically zero negative blowback. And not only once was there no discernible negative blowback, a number of people and this was deliberate. I wanted to see this.[1:54:51] Tim Ferriss: A number of people came out of the woodwork to support in a bigger way, and I was like, oh, okay. I see you. Bunch a handful of folks I knew, and I was like, oh, interesting. Okay. There are at least a half a dozen folks who are studying the same thing, who are paying attention to the same thing.[1:55:07] Tim Ferriss: And then I just got bolder. I was like, okay. If I tested that, let me push, and then let's see what happens, and I'll wait. And lo and behold, I realized that the perception did not match the reality. The reality was if you're talking about indications that cause an incredible amount of suffering for a very large number of people, in.[1:55:30] Tim Ferriss: Even those who are antidrug per se, just say no to drugs, want solutions, and the current treatments for many of these things do not work very well. And in the best of cases are often masking symptoms and not addressing root causes, I would say. So at that point, I just went whole hog, and I said, okay. Look. I like to think that I am exactly what you see is what you get.[1:55:54] Tim Ferriss: Right. The person you talk to off camera, the person you talk to on camera, same. And if I start feeling like I have too much to protect, I want to do something to counteract that. In other words, if if if I feel like I need to censor my true feelings and beliefs, maybe not share my hardships, perhaps not promote certain things because I have a reputation to lose. That's a fragile position.[1:56:20] Tim Ferriss: In. I want to be as antifragile as possible. And so by talking about this, I viewed it as a way of inoculating myself against fear of reputation loss. Like, okay. Let me push this.[1:56:30] Tim Ferriss: Like, I'll ride this horse. Other people might not, but I want to remove the stigma for funding purposes, hopefully open up federal funding. That's starting to happen now from different agencies. And then to focus on access and reduction of cost and insurance reimbursement and so on. So I set a game plan, let's call it maybe 5 years ago, and I've just been slowly, methodically executing on that since.[1:56:58] Tim Ferriss: And, in. The reason I chose this to focus on and I've funded other things, but I've really focused on this mental health therapeutics, which is not limited to psychedelics. We could talk about some other things that I find interesting, but psychedelics are, like I said, what makes it attractive, very uncrowded. You can do a lot with a small amount of money unlike saying cancer research. It can be very hard.[1:57:22] Tim Ferriss: Like, okay. You're deca billionaire? Great. Maybe you can do something interesting, and I'm sure other people could. But if you have 20,000, $50,000, it's gonna be hard to make a dent there.[1:57:30] Tim Ferriss: In psychedelics, you can actually still make a difference. In. And very high leverage in part because these compounds seem to challenge much of what we assume to be true about treating mental health. In. And, so that's, that makes for an attractive bet.[1:57:47] Tim Ferriss: So that's where I've been been going.[1:57:49] Andrew Huberman: Man. Yeah. I'm so glad that you shared that with us and that you did that exploration, and that you've been spearheading the funding efforts. You know, this podcast has a, a premium channel that's for raising funds for scientific studies. We are in the process now making our first 4, contributions.[1:58:10] Andrew Huberman: One of those includes, in, work in Nolan Williams' laboratory at Stanford to combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with, studies of Ibogaine and, five m a o DMT, maybe a few other things, but, basically, that he's free to do what he wants with the funds. We trust him to do great work. But that, again, was inspired by in you. Right? Podcast with a scientific, slant, certainly.[1:58:34] Andrew Huberman: This podcast obviously has a scientific slant, but, in the idea of doing philanthropy for the sorts of work that, really deserves funding and exploration. And, by the way, in thinking about other hybrid things that would be fun to do. I mean, I would love to, contribute and join those efforts that you because in the Amazing. Work to continue to raise funding for psychedelic studies and all these great laboratories continues. Right?[1:58:59] Tim Ferriss: It continues.[1:59:00] Andrew Huberman: And you've rallied a a collection of, some pretty, a powerful people to contribute to this, and I know you've joined arms with Michael Pollan Yeah. In many ways. Do you wanna talk about the fellowships[1:59:10] Tim Ferriss: Did[1:59:10] Andrew Huberman: you guys put together? I find that really cool. You you've got fellowships, in the works or maybe already happening at UC Berkeley. Is that right?[1:59:18] Tim Ferriss: UC Berkeley. Yeah. So the what what I try to do and for people who wanna check it out, it's it's the name of the foundation is Saissei Foundation. And let me explain that for a second. So it's s a I s e I.[1:59:28] Tim Ferriss: So saisei foundation.org. I speak Japanese. I went there as an exchange student and speak, read, and write it. In still to this day pretty well. Can mean a lot of things.[1:59:38] Tim Ferriss: It means rebirth in Japanese, and I've seen what can only be described or can certainly be described as rebirth in so many clinical outcomes that I thought it was appropriate to use. And What I've tried to do with the foundation is, I think, do what I'm pretty good at, which is trying to peek around corners and find something to prototype. Right? So just like the CGM and, like, alright. How can I just getting ahold of a Dexcom back then when it was just for type 1 diabetics was was hard?[2:00:11] Tim Ferriss: It[2:00:11] Andrew Huberman: was thing that you have to actually go under the skin. So it's[2:00:14] Tim Ferriss: it's like taking a barbecue prong and putting it under your ab abdominal skin. It was not comfortable.[2:00:20] Andrew Huberman: Can you describe your, cortisol level in, subjective terms. When you're at home, you got this thing, and you're about to implant it, and you don't have any precedent. It's not like this is, you know, like Levels or one of these other, CGMs that are out there. You know, as you stamp the thing in, you can look on Instagram and see someone else do it. There's nothing like that.[2:00:38] Andrew Huberman: So you're at home wondering if you're gonna secure your liver.[2:00:41] Tim Ferriss: I I'm I'm at home doing it myself, and I'm sweating like a stuck dick. I'm sitting there. I'm like, oh my god. I don't even know know if I can[2:00:47] Andrew Huberman: help you out. There? Like to support you in case you[2:00:50] Tim Ferriss: Oh, let's see.[2:00:50] Andrew Huberman: She's dying.[2:00:51] Tim Ferriss: I think at the time she wasn't because she was squeamish and didn't wanna see it. And I'm so I'm sitting there at my kitchen table. I remember this god. I'm sweating just thinking about it. And no videos to watch in.[2:01:03] Tim Ferriss: And, wasn't really supposed to have it in the 1st place. And, the device for readout, by the way, no iPhone. Right? Right. So it's like this a janky pager looking thing that had a readout that made you think you were playing Pong or something.[2:01:19] Tim Ferriss: I mean, it's very[2:01:20] Andrew Huberman: The green the green tint Greenfield.[2:01:22] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Greenfield's dot. Font. It is so primitive. And, put this thing under my skin, would a tape.[2:01:31] Tim Ferriss: I would cut a ziplock bag and put it on top and and masking tape it to my skin to take showers because otherwise it wouldn't work. And it was it was great. And I'll just say that I don't use a CPU.[2:01:44] Andrew Huberman: You realize you said it was great. I did. I did say it was great because I'm sweating, and it was I was But[2:01:49] Tim Ferriss: it gave me a lot of insight. Okay. And, then once I had the insight over a course of a handful of weeks, then I felt like I didn't really need it anymore. And that was also just a heavy tax to pay.[2:02:01] Andrew Huberman: You don't[2:02:01] Tim Ferriss: have to wear that thing around. Look like you have a, you know, what does it call? A colostomy bag or something? And it's just like it was big. It was bulky.[2:02:08] Tim Ferriss: Man. So just like I did that, I wanted to do proof of concept. Right? The goal was Mhmm. Can I use this for healthy, normal applications?[2:02:19] Tim Ferriss: Will the insights be actionable? And they were, lo and behold. Similarly, with the foundation, Since I'm dealing with smaller amounts of money, you know, I'm not, in the billionaire club by any stretch of the imagination, and science can be expensive. I'm looking for small bets. Where can I pilot something that if successful will be emulated or can be scaled?[2:02:43] Tim Ferriss: And So in the, like, say, the crowdfunding for for the Hopkins treatment resistant depression pilot study, we ended up exceeding the goal. They were able to recruit more subjects. In. In the case of UC Berkeley, Michael Pollan and I partnered on this, and my foundation funded it. The Farris UC Berkeley Journalism Fellowship Psychedelic Journalism Fellowship is providing funding to up and coming journalists who want to focus on psychedelics as their beat, which to this date has not been financially feasible.[2:03:16] Tim Ferriss: In. You just don't have the space to do really long form investigative work. In. The hope being that these journalists can apply their skills and their dedication to examine different facets of the psychedelic ecosystem, therapeutic potential, regulatory issues, etcetera, in a way that can shape and inform national and international discourse in a in a very critical way because these things are not a panacea. There's a lot of claims that are made about these that are totally unbacked by any type of science, and there are a lot of charlatans.[2:03:58] Tim Ferriss: And so I want wanted to also invite really competent, really good journalists to the table who might want to watch for bad actors. I think that's really important. And, so this fellowship has been in been, has been awarding fellows with these grants, and I think it's a relatively small amount of money. It's, like, $10,000 per or something like that, but the outcomes have been amazing. We had a huge I wanna say a 7,000 word piece that was one of the main features in Rolling Stone magazine.[2:04:31] Tim Ferriss: Huge piece in National Geographic focused on Iboga and fair trade and some of the implications for in local harvesting and or overharvesting, all the dynamics present in that, in, which I think has some incredible promise for particular forms of, opioid use, opioid use disorder in particular, but, in. That has been a huge success. So the hope is that other journalism schools will say that's a great idea, and I will have derisked it for some other philanthropist or foundation or government, say, director and agencies say, okay. We'll green like that. Right?[2:05:11] Tim Ferriss: Because I've done it, and it's been received very well, and it's had a real impact on how things are moving along. Another one would be, say, at Harvard Poplar. This is at Harvard Law School. It was the first is the 1st dedicated team focused on law policy and regulation related to psychedelics from a legal perspective. Super important.[2:05:31] Tim Ferriss: Super important. Super, super important. Also, another pilot, let's just call it, proof of concept that Saisai Foundation funded was helping to develop curricula for I think it was Yale, Johns Hopkins in NYU. Effectively a an an accreditation or module they could put into their existing psychiatry MD programs such that people could develop the skills necessary and the understanding necessary to administer psychedelic assist therapies if and when they become legal, prescribable.[2:06:10] Andrew Huberman: Which so it if I understand correctly, it it sounds like within the next 12 to 24 months, MDMA assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of trauma is likely to become legal in the hands of, psychiatrists, at least, and maybe certain clinical psychologists as well in the US. Is that right? The the through the through the efforts of the MAPS group.[2:06:33] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Through through the efforts of maps.org and Rick Doblin and many others. That is the tip of the spear, in So I think anyone who's interested in psychedelics should have a vested interest in supporting those efforts, in. Not because we know everything works. I wanna be clear.[2:06:52] Tim Ferriss: Not because we know a priori that all these things do all the things. No. In. But if if MDMA fails, it's gonna be very hard to draft. It'll be impossible to draft on that with commands that are more difficult to administer like psilocybin, which would be next in line for alcohol use disorder, also major depressive disorder.[2:07:13] Tim Ferriss: In. So I I I really feel that just like everything I've talked about, whether it's networking, putting together the 4 hour body, in Or trying to change national policy and say, reclassification of these compounds, getting them out of schedule 1 to some extent. You wanna break it down into its constituent pieces. You wanna do an 80 20 analysis, figure out what the critical few are and then put them in a logical sequence and execute the plan. One of the greatest weaknesses in the psychedelic ecosystem is there are a lot of people who just wanna do all the things and save all the people and all the animals and all the places all at once, and that just doesn't work very well.[2:07:55] Tim Ferriss: There are also some really good people who are executing, And we could talk about the for profit side and so on, but, I've been very, very, very pleased with the outcomes that the foundation has been able to achieve with very limited money. I'm prouder of those outcomes than I am of the startup record, and the startup record is pretty good. In. And it's the same lens. I'm using the same the same filters and the same approach, which is kinda what I'm always looking for.[2:08:24] Tim Ferriss: I'm looking for stuff that'll translate across fields if possible. And then you mentioned one like TMS. I think[2:08:29] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:08:30] Tim Ferriss: TMS, a very interesting[2:08:31] Andrew Huberman: transcranial mind neck stimulation, yeah, which at one point was, more commonly used to inhibit specific brain areas. This is a noninvasive technique. I've had it done where it's over my motor cortex, and you're tapping your finger, and all of a sudden, you can't tap your fingers. It's pretty eerie, but now it can be used to stimulate particular frequencies, enhanced neuroplasticity, and and in combination with psychedelics is the it's kind of the burning question now. Can you get a, in, a synergistic effect of TMS and and, psychedelics.[2:08:59] Andrew Huberman: Maybe, not just during the the psilocybin or, a EBoga journey, but in the days weeks after when we know for sure a lot of plasticity is still occurring. Yeah. So keep the plasticity on board or accelerate it.[2:09:12] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. So t TMS, also as a monotherapy, very interesting to me for depression, anxiety, even substance use disorders, super interesting. And there are many different protocols, all sorts of different technology.[2:09:27] Tim Ferriss: I would say low intensity or low power ultrasound, also super interesting, for various various applications potentially to addiction. So I'm not, to be clear, a card carrying evangelist for psychedelics. I am a proponent of looking for high leverage uncrowded bets with limited downside and testing them out, and very optimistic about psychedelics. If anyone listening has a family history of, say, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, which we might in which this is be being very simplistic, but categorize or describe as more chaotic conditions compared to hyper rigid conditions like an OCD or anorexia nervosa, chronic depression, etcetera. Then we can talk about why some of these psychedelics, at least some of the classical psychedelics, seem to have cross efficacy with multiple conditions, but psychedelics seem very helpful for certain types of hyperrigidity.[2:10:39] Tim Ferriss: When you get into schizophrenia borderline personality disorder, they can be really heavily contraindicated. Not to say that they cause those those conditions, but they can precipitate the onset of those symptoms. And for that reason, it'd be very destabilizing and dangerous for for certain people. However, that's where something like metabolic psychiatry comes in and the use of ketosis and the ketogenic diet, which appears to be very effective in some patients[2:11:09] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:11:10] Tim Ferriss: For that grouping of, say, more chaotic conditions, which is very exciting. So I'm interested in in in any tools that are off the beaten path that seem to raise interesting questions that have not been answered in a satisfying way yet in medicine. In, and I think we're still largely in the dark ages with respect to psychiatry.[2:11:34] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I think, The best psychiatrist would agree with you.[2:11:38] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And and the best psychiatrists, and the best scientists, in. And the best fill in the blank are acutely aware of the limitations of our current methods and the limitations of our current knowledge. In. So I think the mark of a good thinker, the mark of a good scientist, the mark of a good fill in the blank, anything is someone who says, I have no idea or we have no idea.[2:12:01] Tim Ferriss: A lot. Mhmm.[2:12:02] Andrew Huberman: And, hopefully, they also say, let's go figure it out or try try some things. And I in. I I really wanna thank you for sharing, that narrative, especially because it makes clear that you brought the same systematic process of using and asking excellent questions to arrive at solutions, to arrive at more questions, to fund areas of inquiry, and to do it all in this really structured way, as you said, from policy all the way down to, like, how many grams or, you know, x of in of some substance somebody might take. I mean, I think Matthew Johnson's laboratory at Hopkins, Roland Griffiths, man. Robin Cardart Harris at UCSF, Nolan Williams, the MAPS Group, Rick Doblin.[2:12:46] Andrew Huberman: Peter Hendricks[2:12:47] Tim Ferriss: at University of Alabama looking at cocaine, addiction, Yeah. Other things?[2:12:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You, Michael Pollan. You know, I'm leaving some names out here, and I don't wanna take anything away from the, classic, as they're called, a, explorers of psychedelics and and writers about psychedelics, but we are in the moment of a renaissance now, and it's important that this have a lot of, feel. So we'll put a link into, your philanthropy efforts and and the journalism, fellowships as well because I think there's gonna be a lot of interest there, and I'm huge supporter of what you're doing as as you know, and I just think it's the way great science and clinical progress is made. So you[2:13:26] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew.[2:13:27] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's I, which brings me to another parallel topic. You know? It used to be that meditation and psychedelics were, have nested in the same territory. This would be in the late sixties, early seventies, the birth of places like Esalen, etcetera, with the consequence of in the dual exploration of those things.[2:13:42] Andrew Huberman: Meditation sort of escaped from the psychedelics umbrella and vice versa, starting sometime in the, you know, mid 2000 when neuroimaging became a little bit more accessible, and, you know, I think nowadays, if you told anybody, okay. You know, meditation's good for you. It can help, ratchet down your anxiety, give more self awareness, you know, improve sleep, and on and on, maybe even give some insight into consciousness. No one's going to bulk. There's just a lot of studies.[2:14:11] Andrew Huberman: There are thousands of studies. My laboratory's done a few of them. There are other laboratories who've done, in, far more. The book Altered Traits is the one that comes to mind in the group out of Wisconsin. It was early to early to the game on this.[2:14:24] Andrew Huberman: In any event, you talked about TM. Mhmm. I'm curious from a practical standpoint. Do you still meditate daily? Do you do meditation retreats?[2:14:36] Andrew Huberman: What sorts of meditative practices do you have? Because I realize this can be done walking, writing as its own form of meditation. What sorts of formal practices do you still engage in now?[2:14:46] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. I do 10 to 20 minutes in the morning, so I am not currently doing the TM twice daily 20 minutes. I think that would be better for me, probably.[2:14:55] Andrew Huberman: Do you set a clock and you or or[2:14:57] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I'll set a clock, which would be more of the concentration practice have to say a TM where you're repeating a mantra. Honestly, it could be any in my opinion, some TM purists will bulk at this, but, it could be really any nonsense syllable. It could be a word, although I think something without any attached meaning is probably more beneficial for a host of reasons. So it cause could be a concentration practice with 20 minutes of sitting.[2:15:22] Tim Ferriss: It might also be a guided meditation, and I have no vested interest in this app, but I think the waking up app by Sam Harris is fantastic. I've[2:15:30] Andrew Huberman: do I.[2:15:30] Tim Ferriss: I have used the introductory course, which is Sam leading you through my catnip, which is a a logical progression of skill development from day 1, 2, 3, and and forward. In. I have gone through that course multiple times when I'm getting back on the horse for meditation as a bit of a reboot. Once you develop, I think, a certain degree of awareness and mindfulness. I do think there are other activities that probably allow you the parallel experience of doing one thing while experiencing some of the benefits of meditation.[2:16:06] Tim Ferriss: And in. So for me, I wonder at times, are the benefits of meditation the concentration practice itself, is it just sitting still with my eyes closed, down regulating my system a little bit, activating my parasympathetic, and not rushing or doing anything for 20 minutes.[2:16:24] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:16:25] Tim Ferriss: Is that it? Maybe. Is it simply correcting my posture for 20 minutes? How do I weight these different inputs? And the the the short answer is you probably don't need to know, but I have found that spending time in silence in nature without anything to do disallowing myself from doing things.[2:16:50] Tim Ferriss: No note taking, no reading, etcetera, and spending I have spent a number of extended fasts in nature, just like water only by myself. No talking, no reading, no writing. What's extended? 7 days, generally.[2:17:04] Andrew Huberman: Wow. So you're camping in nature[2:17:06] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[2:17:07] Andrew Huberman: With just water.[2:17:08] Tim Ferriss: Yep. That's it. By myself. And there are risks associated with that. Right?[2:17:12] Tim Ferriss: You gotta be careful and not stupid about it, but, in. That does a lot for me with some persistent benefits.[2:17:21] Andrew Huberman: Are there some favorite places that you've gone, into nature. It doesn't have to be too fast. Like, for instance, I'm a big fan of, some of the national parks up in the Pacific Northwest because it's, like, being transported to a different planet. Yosemite is obviously amazing, but any favorite spots, where we won't go people won't go looking for you there. Don't worry.[2:17:39] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would You[2:17:40] Andrew Huberman: live in Austin all the time. So That's right. Yeah.[2:17:43] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So I would say, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico. Spending time in mountains, around rivers, lakes, I find a very therapeutic and just gorgeous. I I I do think we suffer from, odd deficiency disorder, you know, a bit of ADD when we're trapped in the mundane for too long with too much distraction, with too many to dos, with too many relationships, in, and there's no space for awe there. There isn't the room necessary.[2:18:16] Tim Ferriss: Awe isn't, from my perspective, generally a quick hit that you get in the 30 seconds between using 2 apps. There's there's more breathing room required for genuine transcendent experience of awe. So I try to on a yearly basis as one of my top priorities, block out these weeks of time in nature.[2:18:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Last year was the 1st year I did that. I went out to Colorado, in, in August and just took daily hikes. I stayed in a hotel. I was I'm not as beastie as you doing water fast.[2:18:47] Andrew Huberman: I was eating every day, but, man. It was spectacular. One thing I noticed, and I'd like to know your process on, how do you handle going back into life? Great question. You know?[2:18:59] Andrew Huberman: Because those days were and are amazing. Right? You you know, like detached and, you know, maybe 1 text message here or there or in between hikes or something, and then you just really clued in. Even the the process of watching a show at night, like, one felt so rich and, like, enough. So I'm I wasn't, as aesthetic as you are, and, I like to really clean to all the clutter.[2:19:18] Andrew Huberman: But once you return to life[2:19:20] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[2:19:20] Andrew Huberman: It's almost like getting being awash in demands, and and I can See from a place of more equanimity, how one could make better choices, but how do you handle those transition?[2:19:29] Tim Ferriss: The reentry. Yeah. So before getting to the reentry, I think it might make sense here to talk about what comes before. So let's say it's, like, pre, during, post. Part of The reason I do these 1 week or longer periods off the grid is because it forces me to put better systems in place.[2:19:53] Tim Ferriss: In. So there's the benefit that you derive from, say, that week, and I have 3 weeks coming up right after this interview where I'm gonna be off the grid. To set myself up for 3 weeks off the grid. I have a team. I have the podcast.[2:20:06] Tim Ferriss: I have a lot of things that are in motion at any given point in time. In. If you disappear for, say, a 2 to 4 week period, generally, you cannot let the whole house catch on fire then come back and put it out which means you need to put some policies and rules and so on in place in advance. And there's a carryover effect that has a host of benefits Mhmm. And makes things smoother for the reentry, so they're related.[2:20:32] Tim Ferriss: Like, the more you set up the pre, the easier the post is gonna be. In. And then you have this beautiful expansive experience in nature, whatever it might be, whether you're making it suffer fest like I do or at a hotel at night. Either way, these things can work, and nature in and of itself is super helpful. I do think that a lot of the time, in.[2:20:54] Tim Ferriss: We like to imagine because we're driven, smart, accomplished people that our problems are very complex. And at the end of the day, it's like, you just need some time in nature and a cold shower and some fucking macadamia nuts, and you'll be fine. You don't need to solve, like, all the existential dilemmas of humankind, actually, or fancy pharmaceuticals. So You have this experience over this week, and what I will do then is set at least a, let's call, integration period of 2 to 3 days where I will slowly edge back in into my previous routine. I will not, within 12 hours of getting back to so called civilization, have a day full of calls or meetings.[2:21:40] Tim Ferriss: I will not do that. It's too much of a shock to the system, and I think it robs you of a tail end of benefits, in, which would also be the case with, say, fast or ketogenic diet or any number of interventions. You can squeeze out a long tail of benefits if you make a handful of look changes. For instance, after an extended fast, what if you started with a subcaloric ketogenic diet for a few days? You get to extend some of the benefits as opposed to going straight back to, say, a diet that includes a lot of carbohydrates.[2:22:11] Tim Ferriss: Similarly, when you create more of a vacuum, you more space for awe, insight, reflection, recovery. I think you're doing yourself a disservice if you jump from park into 6th gear. And so I plan for that, and it's a function of scheduling. I also have a predictable weekly schedule. So I tend to schedule podcast recordings on Mondays Fridays.[2:22:36] Tim Ferriss: In preparation for an extended trip, I will batch a lot of similar activities that we have, say, a bunch of episodes in the bank that are prescheduled. Everything is figured out in advance. In. And over time, the more you take these breaks, the better your systems become and the more liberated you are from the day to day, which means when you get back, you also don't need to rush as much into hyperactivity. And if you do, You know that that is more from a compulsivity than from a necessity.[2:23:08] Andrew Huberman: While you're on these Nature retreats. Are you writing on a daily basis? Are you just thinking and allowing thoughts to enter and leave your system?[2:23:17] Tim Ferriss: Depends on the retreat. So sometimes I'm writing, but writing, I think, can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive, and I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of the time. In. So there are many areas in my life now. So if you were to ask me, what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote the 4 hour body, I would say that Rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately deoptimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being.[2:23:56] Tim Ferriss: Where can I deoptimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise for my life altogether for a period of time?[2:24:11] Tim Ferriss: Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in x related to, say, AI or whatever it might be. Like, where can I deoptimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole? Does that make sense?[2:24:24] Andrew Huberman: Makes good sense. Yeah.[2:24:25] Tim Ferriss: And Before we started recording, I gave you a book, which is a short collection of poetry by, Halaliza Ghafuri, which is called Gold. It's a collection of Rumi poetry. Reading poetry is an activity almost by definition, which is is the antithesis of optimization. In. So I've tried to also integrate more of those activities into my life, and this relates to your question because there are times when I would force myself to sit on my goddamn hands and not write, not read.[2:24:58] Tim Ferriss: Just do the thing that is so uncomfortable sometimes, which is just sitting there with yourself.[2:25:03] Andrew Huberman: In. You know, it can be incredibly uncomfortable, in part because of the fear that it could become comfortable[2:25:11] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[2:25:11] Andrew Huberman: Especially for proactive people with a[2:25:14] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[2:25:15] Andrew Huberman: Strong well, to use Paul Contee's words, generative drive. You know, you're gonna that's, You know, the the which is a good thing, I I believe.[2:25:24] Tim Ferriss: It's a good thing, and it it can be a good thing. It can indicate really incredible adaptations. It can also sometimes, I think, indicate maladaptations. Right? And so I think it's it's helpful to take a break from that generative drive or at least just put it in park position Mhmm.[2:25:48] Tim Ferriss: To see if That generative drive is is perhaps indicative of you leaning towards something[2:25:56] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:25:57] Tim Ferriss: In a healthy proactive way in versus running from something in a long term destructive way.[2:26:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well and I think Paul would say that part of the generative drive in process is, peace. You know? Not as necessarily even as a still state, but as a, you know, being able to experience peace even in the transitions, and there's a lot more to say about that. And he would say it far better than I ever would, so I'll, leave it at that.[2:26:23] Andrew Huberman: And,[2:26:24] Tim Ferriss: I mean, for people who have the option, getting in nature, it doesn't have to be all day every day on a water fast. I just take certain things to an extreme because that's who I am. But[2:26:33] Andrew Huberman: sorry. When you say water fast, that means fasting with water.[2:26:37] Tim Ferriss: Right. It[2:26:37] Andrew Huberman: just Fasting, but, yes, drinking water.[2:26:39] Tim Ferriss: It just means you're allowed to have water and nothing else.[2:26:41] Andrew Huberman: For for a long time, I thought it meant that you're not drinking water.[2:26:44] Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah.[2:26:45] Andrew Huberman: No. Don't do that. Some people do that. Right? They do these crazy food water fasts, in, as a weight.[2:26:50] Andrew Huberman: I think they believe it clears senescent cells or something, but, probably clears a lot more than just senescent cells.[2:26:56] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I, there might be something to it. I mean, like, there are people who recycle by drinking their own urine, not my jam. But in. I would say it's, like, 3 hours without shelter, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food.[2:27:10] Tim Ferriss: General rule of thumb. So in. Be careful with dehydration. You can go a long time without food. If you have I don't care how ripped you are.[2:27:17] Tim Ferriss: You get 8% body fat, man. You got plenty of time. You can go a couple No problem. Yeah.[2:27:21] Andrew Huberman: You got calories.[2:27:22] Tim Ferriss: Stop throwing it. Calories per pound stored body fat, you got plenty. Don't worry. So for people who have the option in. To be in nature and just exercise several hours a day to exhaustion, See how many of your problems seem to just go away.[2:27:41] Tim Ferriss: Just try that. Mhmm.[2:27:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, my Sunday routine, is to try and get outside and move as much as possible. Yeah. I don't always succeed, but, I'm going to try a longer retreat into nature. I think, Olympic National Forest is is calling me again.[2:27:58] Andrew Huberman: It seems like once a year, I just wanna get back up there. It's, it's calling.[2:28:02] Tim Ferriss: It's I you should get back out there. Spectacular.[2:28:05] Andrew Huberman: I have a question about mentors.[2:28:08] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[2:28:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm a big believer in mentors either, mentors that know us and we know them or, people that we assign as mentors without them realizing it, this sort of thing. Do you have mentors at this stage of life, for particular areas of life. Are you, you mentoring yourself? Are you flying with, a few ma'am.[2:28:31] Andrew Huberman: Voices in your head, that serve you well. Who who are your mentors?[2:28:35] Tim Ferriss: I definitely have people I consider mentors. It's, I think, at this point, in rarely one way[2:28:43] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:28:43] Tim Ferriss: In the sense that they tend to be friends I spend time with. They get something from it. I get something from it. Not in a transactional way. Mhmm.[2:28:53] Tim Ferriss: But they find it fun or beneficial or amusing in some way redeeming to spend time with me. That's the hope.[2:29:00] Andrew Huberman: But how is that different from, like, traditional friendship? You know, just sort of standard friendship? Are you folk are you spending time with some orientation toward, like, their embodying areas of life that you would like to emulate.[2:29:15] Tim Ferriss: Totally. I mean, I spend I spend time around people I hope to be more like Mhmm. In some way because guess what? You're going to average into, say the the just the the sum holistic whole of the 5 or 6 people you spend the most time with, so you should choose that very carefully. That includes virtual parasocial relationships.[2:29:37] Tim Ferriss: It's like, okay. If you're listening to fill in the blank person for 4 hours a week, 5 hours a week, 2 hours a week, Whoever that group is comprised of is going to influence who you become. And in for me then. I think carefully about my friendships, and they could be older. Like, Kevin Kelly has become a good friend in who has a wealth of life experience that I don't have.[2:30:05] Tim Ferriss: And so I might just call him and say, Kevin, I have a question for you, but I do that with my younger friends too. And they could be younger than I am, and I might still view them as a mentor in x, y, or z. I think mentor has a heavyweight Mhmm. To it. It has a connotation of maybe never ending time consuming obligation.[2:30:26] Tim Ferriss: So I in. I would never, for instance, and I know a lot of people try this, ask someone to be my mentor. It's like, would you like to be my free life coach forever? You know, it's like, that's Kinda how it sounds to the recipient.[2:30:37] Andrew Huberman: So it it sounds very formal.[2:30:39] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It sounds very formal. Yeah. And so for me, I would say there have certainly been mentors. I've had wrestling coaches.[2:30:46] Tim Ferriss: I've had teachers. I've had resident advisers who are reverends, who had a huge impact on my life, in and followed up with me and paid attention to me and cared for me in more of a one directional sense. Right? I I view myself as the beneficiary. Of course, they they certainly got something out of it if they had that job.[2:31:07] Tim Ferriss: I mean, they probably found it to be very gratifying in its own way. In, and teachers like professor Ed Shao at Princeton, I feel in incredibly indebted to. These days in. And for a long time, I've believed that you can learn something powerful from almost anyone, probably anyone you interact with. Could be an Uber driver, could be someone taking garbage out of a restaurant.[2:31:36] Tim Ferriss: In. If you really take the time to dig, you can find something. And before you can, I think, as an adult, effectively think about who you would like to learn from, if I put it that way? It's helpful to have a baseline of self awareness that you know what you might want to work on to either amplify strengths, develop skills, address weaknesses. In.[2:32:03] Tim Ferriss: And so for instance, one of my close friends, Matt Mollenweg, is younger than I am. He's the he's the founder of Automatic, which runs WordPress .com. He was the lead developer of WordPress, although it was an open source project, of course, with many, many contributors. He was one of the lead developers, now powers something like 32% of the Internet, in. And he exemplifies a cool and calm temperament even in the most chaotic periods imaginable, during the most chaotic events imaginable.[2:32:36] Tim Ferriss: And when I find myself getting dysregulated, to use a fancy term, losing my shit or getting carried away by emotion, getting righteously angry or whatever it might be. And I recognize at some point that it's really not serving me and that I am being owned by the emotion. Right? Like, I'm the dog on the leash, not the other way around. In.[2:32:58] Tim Ferriss: Then I think of Matt. I'm like, what would Matt do? What advice would Matt give me right now? How would Matt act in these circumstances? In, and I do that with with with many friends.[2:33:11] Tim Ferriss: I also think a lot about and this is borrowing from someone named Kathy Sierra from a long time ago. Focusing more on just in time information as opposed to just in case information. So just in case information is like, I'm gonna read these 20 books because in 2 years, I might be interested in x, y, and z. That, I think, is often a waste of time because if it ever becomes relevant, you're just gonna have to reread those books. People do the same thing with humans.[2:33:40] Tim Ferriss: They're like, I wanna meet so and so and have them as my mentor because maybe 5 years from now, I'll do x, y, and z, and then they'll be useful for a, b, c. That's too speculative, and I think it ends up in a lot of wasted energy. So the podcast for me, in writing the books and doing the interviews even prior to the podcast, becoming involved with startups, delving into the world of science and scientists all helps me to develop a confidence that almost any question I could ask, I can find some semblance of an answer for by just reaching out to a few people and saying, who do you know who might be able to answer this?[2:34:24] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:34:25] Tim Ferriss: And that's very reassuring, and it it relieves some of the in anxiety or pressure that people might feel to assemble some personal board of directors of, like, x men and women who[2:34:37] Andrew Huberman: can[2:34:38] Tim Ferriss: help them with everything. And and then there are people I hire to be accountable to. Right? So I might work with coaches, therapists, in and so on who I would view as mentors. They just happen to get getting paid for it.[2:34:51] Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah.[2:34:52] Andrew Huberman: The reason I asked the question is because we were talking about the meditative process going into nature, and even with psychedelics, there's you know, it can be viewed a lot of different ways, but I think of them largely as going inward to explore. I mean, you're out in nature and learning from nature. There's such a cork truth to nature. I know that sounds a little bit, you know, in, wishy washy, but it's, it's true. Like, if you it's there.[2:35:19] Andrew Huberman: It's concrete. It's really something. It was there long before any of us, and it'll be there a lot longer than any of us, will ever be, we hope. Certainly, if it goes, we go.[2:35:30] Tim Ferriss: So,[2:35:32] Andrew Huberman: but the process of learning from others and paying attention to others is is really an outward anything. I mean, we have to bring that in, but I was just curious how you balance those and as a way to really understand not just your time allocation. Right? I think, we could talk about that. You know?[2:35:47] Andrew Huberman: What's how's your morning structured, etcetera, which I think there's great value in in in knowing. But more, what what's your mind allocation? Right? I think about this. You know?[2:35:57] Andrew Huberman: Like, where's my brain? Is it am I focused on what's going on in here? And, You know? Is that is there a need to excavate there? Sure.[2:36:04] Andrew Huberman: You know? But how much time am I out of my head and bringing things in from the outside world and back and forth? So do you have some sense of, in. Across the year, across the day, how you mind allocate. I don't know if, that's the best phrase, but I can't think of any better one.[2:36:20] Andrew Huberman: If you can think of a better one, please please, table it because I I'm happy to to use that.[2:36:25] Tim Ferriss: How do I think about mind allocation or attention allocation. I try to in and most frequently think of my mind share across a year and across week, a weekly time frame, and I find that to be manageable in the sense that on a yearly basis on New Year's Eve or roughly around New Year's. Every year, I'll do a past year review. PYR, past year review, where I'll go back and I'll look at my entire last year. A piece of paper in front of me, line down the center, plus negative, and I will go through every week in my calendar for the previous year, and I will write down the in people, places, activities, commitments, etcetera that produced peak positive emotional experiences.[2:37:33] Tim Ferriss: So right. We're doing an eighty twenty analysis here. Like, what are the big rocks that really move the needle in a meaningful way? And conversely, Who are the people? What are the things?[2:37:42] Tim Ferriss: What are the places that just made me go, and were draining produce peak negative experiences. Why the hell did I commit to this type experiences? And that presents me with a do more of, do less of list. Then I look forward to the next year, and I did this, I suppose, just a handful of months ago around New Year's with the positive. I'm like, okay.[2:38:06] Tim Ferriss: Here's my list of do more of. It's not real until it's in the calendar. Let's get these things in the calendar. And then I will start talking to people, booking things, having people help with organizing if that is required and getting things blocked out. So I have already this year, and we're in the reasonable beginning stages of the year.[2:38:28] Tim Ferriss: I have things blocked out until November of this year, in. And those provide the breaks in the action, not just the breaks in the action, but the fun stuff. Because by the way, guys, in. I thought for a long time, like, yeah, you take care of a, b, and c, and the good stuff just takes care of itself. I've I do not any longer believe that to be true.[2:38:49] Tim Ferriss: Unless you schedule these things that you claim are important, they're gonna get crowded out by bullshit. And, maybe not bullshit, but just less important things. The urgent will crush the important. So I get these things on the calendar, and then I back up and I look at optimal weekly mind allocation. Right?[2:39:11] Tim Ferriss: Attentional allocation. And there's a there's There's an incredible cost to cognitive switching if you're just test switching all day. So I will try my best to format a weekly rhythm, a weekly sequence that allows me to focus on certain types of tasks. So Monday is very frequently admin of some type. Just bits and ends, flotsam, jetsam, all the miscellaneous pieces that our part of life.[2:39:43] Tim Ferriss: You gotta deal with them. Yep. That tends to be Monday. Whenever possible and especially if I am focused on physical activity, Let's just say, in a place like Colorado. I will try to schedule most of that for after lunch in to ensure that I get in a lot of exercise and movement in the 1st portion of the day.[2:40:04] Tim Ferriss: Not everybody has that ability, but I will say more of you have that capacity than you might think because most of what we all do is just not important.[2:40:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So time on social media first thing in the morning is probably the most poisonous activity that I could take part in. I I don't wanna, you know, point fingers at anyone else. But Oh, yeah. I think if people ask, you know, what what is the, you know, amount of time it takes to get in a really good workout.[2:40:32] Andrew Huberman: It's gonna be about an hour. Yeah. You know? But a lot can be done in 45 or even 30 minutes. When you think about how quickly that time goes by on social media?[2:40:40] Tim Ferriss: I'm sure I'm not the only one, that that's probably the reason I deleted a lot of these apps from my phone. It's like I would be in. I'd go into the bathroom to take a, you know, quick bit of business, and then 45 minutes later, I'm like, How have I been looking at Instagram? 45 minutes.[2:40:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Lines in for restrooms have gotten very long in the last 10 10 years. Has anyone noticed in. The wait for the restrooms has gotten very long.[2:41:03] Tim Ferriss: So Yeah. You have time for the important stuff. It's like and and just look at some of the extreme overteachers out there. They have the same amount of time that you do.[2:41:11] Andrew Huberman: Have you I was gonna ask this later, but I'll just we'll just quickly interject this now. Had I saw perhaps it was on Twitter. Maybe I heard overheard this that you're back on Instagram. It's, I mean, you you've always had an account[2:41:25] Tim Ferriss: Yep.[2:41:26] Andrew Huberman: That posts. But are you back in there? Are you out of there?[2:41:29] Tim Ferriss: I mean, look. My the dirty little secret, I'm single again, and that's a great way to connect with with eligible ladies who might be of interest.[2:41:37] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Is it Instagram? So you're on, so you're on Instagram.[2:41:40] Tim Ferriss: To pay the tax of dealing with the brain damage of using Instagram as a result.[2:41:47] Andrew Huberman: And, look, finding a great life partner is is is is great.[2:41:51] Tim Ferriss: Exactly. So that's that is the reason for that, but, otherwise, it would not be on my phone. It's It[2:41:58] Andrew Huberman: wouldn't even be on your phone.[2:42:00] Tim Ferriss: Absolutely not. It's too well designed. Mhmm. These companies are very smart. They have very good data scientists.[2:42:04] Tim Ferriss: They have very good UI specialists. If anyone out there thinks that they can like, maybe maybe Jocko can can discipline his way through it. I'm sure he can because he's he is Jocko. But in my case and in the case of most people, like, you're bringing a knife to a gunfight. If you think you can use your self control to keep your use of Instagram to say 10 minutes at a clip.[2:42:27] Tim Ferriss: Good luck. Yeah. And even if you can, people say, ah, but I do that anyway. I'm like, alright. How much time do you spend sending memes and links from Instagram or fill in the blank platform to your friends in group chat.[2:42:39] Tim Ferriss: How much time does that in Consume. I[2:42:41] Andrew Huberman: spend a fair amount of time on Instagram and Twitter posting things related to the podcast, but, I don't have someone to do that for me. And I I actually enjoy doing it, and it challenges me in certain ways, but I completely agree with everything you're saying. I also wanna note that you didn't say that you're on Twitter, possibly to meet somebody, which is more a statement about Twitter. Yeah.[2:43:00] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It's not the it's not the not the friendliest neighborhood I've found. Yeah. And, I would say in. Twitter has its use cases.[2:43:08] Tim Ferriss: I I find it useful in some respects. It has become much less useful and much less practical in the last year with a lot of the product changes, but it has its place. It's not on my phone. It was on my phone for a very brief period of time. I do not want.[2:43:24] Tim Ferriss: In. I find that my ability to be still and calm is eroded if I am in Too easily able to escape boredom. If you cease to have the ability to be bored for 5 to 10 minutes, I think that makes you very fragile. It makes you very easy to manipulate also, and there are a lot of forces at play online that want to manipulate or shape your behavior in different ways, so I feel like it is imperative for me to cultivate the ability to just sit still in and not consume the 5 minutes in line waiting to get into a restaurant by hopping on Twitter or Instagram. So that's part of the reason they're not on my phone.[2:44:12] Andrew Huberman: Could you tell us about cockpunch?[2:44:17] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I can tell you about Cockpunch. So Cockpunch is a creative project intended once again to make me less precious about protecting whatever brand I think I might have. And this is an investment in my long term mental health also. And I think in my career flexibility, my willingness to experiment.[2:44:42] Tim Ferriss: In. Cock punch. Could be a long story, but the gist of it is I wanted to experiment with fiction writing. I've been saying this for years, and I've never done it. That's the backdrop.[2:44:53] Tim Ferriss: On top of that, I have wanted to get back into illustration in and work in the visual arts, which I did for a long time when I was younger, and I've not done that consistently. Why not? Because I haven't had accountability. I haven't had deadlines. It hasn't been in the calendar.[2:45:09] Tim Ferriss: This should sound somewhat familiar by now. And At the same time, I was becoming very interested in Web 3 and what was happening in the world of NFTs. This is probably 2020, and I know they've they've developed a fairly negative connotation for a lot of good reasons, but I started to think about a fundraising for early stage science. And if I could do if I could conduct an experiment as a proof of concept with different novel approaches to fundraising. So rather than just calling the rich friends who might sort of bend to the pressure or be willing to fund.[2:45:51] Tim Ferriss: I wanted to look at, say, crowdfunding back in the day. Then I wanted to look at different options for perhaps art auctions, and I was gonna do this with with contemporary art. This is many years ago in in the process of wanting to fund the the Hopkins Center focused on psychedelic and consciousness research, which which the was the first of its kind in the United States. And, the technology gave me the opportunity to learn about a new, Let's just call it set of technologies, so to develop skills and knowledge. It would give me the opportunity to reconnect and deepen friendships with a number of my very, very smart friends who are playing in that area.[2:46:34] Tim Ferriss: Also test fundraising, also get back into fiction and art and all that combined this thing that I end up calling cockpunch because it made me laugh. And you know what? Man, if you take your work too seriously, you're gonna burn out before you get the really serious work done, and I think it was, Bertrand Russell who said it's a sure sign of an impending nervous breakdown if you start taking your work too seriously or believing your work to be very, very serious. And for that reason, I wanted to give it an absurd name that would also have some word-of-mouth benefit and that to in. See what would happen.[2:47:15] Tim Ferriss: Honestly, just see what would happen. Because I was like, alright. Look. What is honestly the worst thing that happens? Like, people write a bunch of pieces where they're, like, shaking their fist at the Skye.[2:47:24] Tim Ferriss: How dare Tim Ferris Cockroach. Create a a project called Cockroach?[2:47:28] Andrew Huberman: You could turn it around on them and just say that what they were doing is a cockpunch.[2:47:31] Tim Ferriss: No. Well, I I'm attempting. Attempting. Well, that was kind of the thing. That was kind of part of the thinking that it would just be entertaining to watch people seriously trying to critique something called cockpunch.[2:47:43] Tim Ferriss: And, the upshot of that is it raised almost $2,000,000, in sold out in something like 30 minutes or 40 minutes for the foundation. All that money went to Sisem Foundation. All of that money has already been distributed in the form of grants.[2:47:58] Andrew Huberman: Wonderful.[2:47:59] Tim Ferriss: And along the way, I got to work with artists, in with programmers, learn new technologies, reconnect with old friends, and now we're back in touch, and it's it's extremely fun to be back in touch with these folks. In, and I've written the equivalent of a short book in fiction in the form of short stories that are this fantasy world building exercise for me, and I'm having a blast. So I'm exercising new creative muscles that has led me back into the worlds in of comic books, which I haven't created yet, led me back into the worlds of gaming, led me back into my fascination of tabletop gaming because I played D and D forever when I was a kid. That was my refuge as a runt who got the crap kicked out of him left and right, and I'm having just a blast. And the the takeaway, I think, on some level is that You should do things.[2:48:57] Tim Ferriss: Should is should is a is a is a loaded term. It's helpful for me to consider doing things that give me energy. Right? Because if we say our time management is fine, but time doesn't really have any practical value unless you have attention. Right?[2:49:13] Tim Ferriss: So then there's attentional management. But that attention is limited also physically and sort of metaphorically in by energy. Right? So you have, like, substrates, diets, neurotransmitters, and so on. If you do not have the the basic batteries required, in.[2:49:31] Tim Ferriss: The rest of the things that are higher up on that pyramid can't really be executed properly. So for me, it's like, okay. Let's say Cock punch doesn't do anything. It's a total failure. Right?[2:49:43] Tim Ferriss: Coming back to, like,[2:49:43] Andrew Huberman: what raised $2,000,000 for science. It it did. Right? Science could be breakthrough science.[2:49:47] Tim Ferriss: So It could.[2:49:48] Andrew Huberman: It could. So Cock Punch. Hey. Sorry. I yelled.[2:49:51] Andrew Huberman: I'm sorry. So cock punch is, at least thus far, a success.[2:49:56] Tim Ferriss: It is. But coming back to Seth Godin's question, I asked myself, would I do this even if it turns out to be a complete failure financially? And I was like, yes. Because I think the relationships and the skills, even if this quote unquote fails from the outside looking in, Those will transcend this project and be life affirming and helpful and fun in other areas, and that's proven to be true even though the project is ongoing. And I have more energy now because of this ridiculous project.[2:50:27] Tim Ferriss: I'm very proud of the fiction actually. This ridiculous project called Cockpunch. People can find the legend of Cockpunch on, any fine provider of podcasts in. And hired voice actors, did the scripting, the production. I it hit number 1 fiction worldwide on Apple Podcasts for a while.[2:50:44] Tim Ferriss: The whole thing's hilarious.[2:50:46] Andrew Huberman: And, and if you could, can you explain a little bit about the characters in cock punch? Yeah. I can. Who's who's punching whose cock? Yeah.[2:50:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Or which cocks are punching?[2:50:55] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Which cocks are punching? Which how does this work? So here we go. Alright.[2:51:00] Tim Ferriss: So the legend of cockpunch takes place in this realm called Varlata, and, Varlata is being described through the narrator who we know as the 7th scribe. We don't know much about 7th scribe, but 7th scribe makes an appearance in episode 1 as the reliable but possibly a sometimes unreliable narrator of this space, and there's a there's a mind bending time component where there's something called restarts. In Something like the edge of tomorrow, if people have ever seen this movie, where time restarts, maybe like Groundhog Day. Time restarts, in. And it's unclear as of yet in the story why that is the case, but people basically snap into being.[2:51:40] Tim Ferriss: They know who they are and what they do, but they have no real memories to speak of. So the world is constantly being reconstructed and pieced together by these scribes, The 7th of which is the narrator. So you can you you might read into this that I am a fan of fantasy, Tolkien, you name it, Ursula k Le Guin, the wizard of Earthsea, etcetera. Then there are 8 primary houses. These are the greater houses.[2:52:08] Tim Ferriss: Some might call them clans, and they have different characteristics. Just prior to the 7th scribe in Beginning his piecing together, which turns into the story in the podcast. There was a warring states period. This much he's been able to establish, And the peacekeeping mechanism that was devised is something called the great games. And the great games is a combat competition, and the 8 greater houses send their best fighters who've been vetted through preliminary competitions 2 of the great games, which is in the free trade zone, which is this one place where all of the races mingle and trade and so on.[2:52:50] Tim Ferriss: In. And all these characters happen to be anthropomorphized roosters. So they have, generally, each one gauntlet of some type, and, clearly, they punch each other with this gauntlet, and there are many other types of weapons. So the colloquial nickname for this Olympics of combat is cockpunch, and that is the that is the etymology, so the scholars say of cockpunch, the legend of cockpunch, and there's a lot more to it. And there are many wrinkles, a lot of Easter eggs in this entire story.[2:53:25] Tim Ferriss: The idea came to me, and it started off as a bit of a farce. Right? It was just gonna be something funny, See if it works. Maybe it raises some money. Very light lift.[2:53:35] Tim Ferriss: But once I got into the fiction, I started taking it super seriously, so it's become very, very elaborate. It's become really, really elaborate, and I'm loving it. It's great. So who knows where it'll go? I have no idea.[2:53:47] Tim Ferriss: That's part of the reason why I called it an emergent long fiction project. I didn't call it an NFT project. I was like, this is an emergent long fiction project where I'm taking inputs from the audience. I'm I'm watching very closely what people understand or don't understand or find interesting. I'm looking at, for instance, what is generated when I host an an AI assisted art competition, which I did with the fans.[2:54:09] Tim Ferriss: And a lot of these bits and pieces get integrated in some into this thing that chapter by chapter is coalescing. So that's Cockpunch. Amazing, and I had to buy cockpunch.com and the at cockpunch Twitter handle.[2:54:26] Andrew Huberman: Well, like, you had to buy it from somebody?[2:54:28] Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. The whole process.[2:54:30] Andrew Huberman: I don't wanna ask what it was being used for prior to your purchasing.[2:54:33] Tim Ferriss: It was not being used for, fantasy world building. I'll put it that way.[2:54:37] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Amazing. And for so many reasons, I have so much to say about it. First of all, your excitement about it is tangible. Yeah.[2:54:46] Andrew Huberman: The energy you have around it is infectious, and while I don't wanna go into the total, depth and contour of, what Paul Contee has been telling me over the last week of preparing this mental health series about what's really great in life that we all should cultivate. It has a lot to do with this generative drive, which has a lot to do with positive energy, not just positive thinking, but positive energy, but this, this triad of peace, contentment, and delight. And as you were explaining it, it's clear that it brings you great peace, contentment, and delight as action terms, not like sit there and just hover in the basking in it. It's just so clear that this is a great idea. And I love that you started it as a way to Kind of, I don't know.[2:55:35] Andrew Huberman: Like, knock the fear out of yourself a little bit by knocking a little fear into the whole thing.[2:55:41] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[2:55:41] Andrew Huberman: Like like, what would happen if you let your mind go and and allowed yourself Yeah.[2:55:45] Tim Ferriss: To explore this? And and what permission would it buy you if it's not a total disaster. This is true for the 4 hour body too. I'm like, what if this partially works? It's not even a home run, but let's say I get on base.[2:55:58] Tim Ferriss: What permission does this then buy me? What other impossibles, in quotation marks, am I willing to challenge? And I was able to make the hop from 1 category in the bookstore to a completely different category. And then the sky's the limit. I was like, I can do anything.[2:56:12] Tim Ferriss: I can do whatever I want. I've given myself permission, and the market has given me permission, but the most important first step is you giving yourself permission. In and with, say, cockpunch as ludicrous as it is. Now that I've done that, my career hasn't ended, hasn't had any negative impact on my career whatsoever. I'm like, okay.[2:56:33] Tim Ferriss: That's actually kinda surprising.[2:56:35] Andrew Huberman: To the contrary, it seems like it gives you energy. It's It's raised money for science. Is it still raising money. It's, it's not is there still an opportunity for people to No.[2:56:44] Tim Ferriss: It's it's sold it's sold out. If people wanna contribute to say the early stage science, and let's just say specifically psychedelics. I would say it's very, very hard to get a very solid understanding of the field and the shifting sands and the projects and so on. It's it's very rapidly changing. So I would say just provide money to a foundation that's already doing good work.[2:57:12] Tim Ferriss: It could be Riverstix Foundation. It could be Beckley Foundation. My foundation, Saisai Foundation, I think does pretty good work.[2:57:19] Andrew Huberman: And Saisai is not just the, the journalism fellowships. They're also this, it's funding for psychedelics.[2:57:25] Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. There's there's tons of stuff. There's a project page on sci say foundation.org. You can see the projects. They're probably 15 to 20 of them, and they can see the basic science all the way from really basic science looking at possible mechanisms of action for something like DIPT, which is a very strange compound that[2:57:43] Andrew Huberman: DIPT.[2:57:44] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Most people aren't gonna know it. That that produces profound auditory distortions and hallucinations in humans, very hard to animal model. And from that all the way up to really sophisticated imaging studies, from that to say at least a year or 2 ago supporting phase three trials for MDMA assisted psychotherapy, then the journalism, then this, then the that, but a lot of a lot of different, scientific studies that are that are being supported. So that's that's very exciting to me.[2:58:18] Tim Ferriss: But the the cockpunch side of things is all done. In. Money's been distributed, and maybe I'll do more of this kind of thing, but I'm I might take a different approach. I I I feel like, okay. In.[2:58:30] Tim Ferriss: I learned what I feel I wanted to learn from that, and maybe I'll try something new next time.[2:58:37] Andrew Huberman: One thing's clear. Nobody tells you what to do, except you, and but that's vetted through many important filters, like Yeah. Structured filters and, very thoughtful filters are the words that come to mind when I think about[2:58:52] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[2:58:52] Andrew Huberman: Your process as you're sharing. Hey.[2:58:54] Tim Ferriss: I'll have one more thing, which is in. One of the sources of joy of cockpunch is that it is not overplanned. I set some initial conditions, and now it's emergent. And as someone who has hyperanalyzed and meticulously planned most of my life for decades. I think it's helpful to have an improv component.[2:59:23] Tim Ferriss: So if if you are a hyper planner, if you're a hypermeasurer, If you like that degree of control, maybe you should try something that's a little less controlled. Take an improv class. Try fiction writing. Do something that isn't totally scripted where you don't know the outcome. I think it's really good medicine for people.[2:59:41] Tim Ferriss: Just like if you spend all your time in a yoga class, maybe you should spend 1 day a week lifting weights. See what that's like. And if you spend all your time in the gym and you can barely touch your toes, maybe you should do some more downward dog. Try some yoga.[2:59:52] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:59:53] Tim Ferriss: Similar. I think the spectrum of hyper planned to completely free flowing and improv provides ample opportunity to, enrich themselves and maybe address some weaknesses at the same time. So for me, cockpunch has been incredibly therapeutic. Probably the 1st time that anyone's ever uttered that sentence, but yes.[3:00:16] Andrew Huberman: Probably. Yeah. But that's part of what makes it so cool.[3:00:19] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Totally.[3:00:20] Andrew Huberman: I love it. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share with us a little bit about in your mindset, maybe even your motivation, but, certainly, your mindset around sharing some of the hard personal tribulations that you shared. In preparation for this discussion today, I went back to some of those posts that you did and the, podcasts that you did around this, and, I'd listened to them at the time. And, you know, they deal with quite serious violations in of childhood and of self, and, they're hard. I mean, they're they're hard to listen to, and I can only imagine they must be even far, far harder to to experience.[3:01:08] Andrew Huberman: And I was curious what led to your willingness to do that. And, yeah, I mean, I have my own ideas about what might have motivated it, but I'd like to hear it from you.[3:01:21] Tim Ferriss: Sure. Happy to talk about it. And I think there are 2 particular examples that come to mind. So one is my near suicide in college. And, if people search some practical thoughts on suicide and my name.[3:01:38] Tim Ferriss: It'll pop right up. I mean, if you just search my name and suicide, it'll probably pop right up. Pretty well indexed at this point, which is very deliberate. In. People can look at the URL structure for a little wink and, hat tip.[3:01:54] Tim Ferriss: It'll tell you something about, in optimizing for Google. If you look at it, I'll just tell you. The URL is spells out how to commit suicide. But, clearly, I'm not teaching people how to commit suicide, but I wanted that to be a honeypot for some of that traffic, because it's a lot easier now to find that type of practical implementation advice. And it's a bit harder to find, I think, compelling intervention.[3:02:19] Tim Ferriss: So first of all, if you're feeling suicide, obviously, call suicide hotline, please. Right. That's, sometimes the last thing that people want to hear when they are in a place of suicidal ideation. And The reason I ended up writing a long post about this, which was terrifying to write because I had never told my parents. I had never told my closest friends.[3:02:43] Tim Ferriss: This was a secret. This is a dark, dark secret. And in. I wrote about it because I went to an event in San Francisco. I was interviewed on stage by Jason Calacanis, who's a friend and a very good interviewer at an event.[3:03:03] Tim Ferriss: And after I got off stage, A bunch of people approached me, and I was saying hi and taking photos and signing things and so on. And there was 1 young man there, very well dressed, which isn't really relevant. I just it was striking because in San Francisco, sometimes people in are very underdressed, and he was he had dressed up for it. Like, he'd taken it seriously, and he was in a suit and tie. He asked me if I could sign a book for his brother, and I said, sure.[3:03:34] Tim Ferriss: No problem. And I asked him, what would you like me to write to your brother? And he kinda blanked. He didn't kinda blank. He totally blanked, but the look behind his eyes was unusual.[3:03:45] Tim Ferriss: It wasn't just I don't know what to say blank. There was something else behind it, and I could tell that he felt under pressure. In. And I said, no problem. Take your time.[3:03:55] Tim Ferriss: I'll tell you what. I'll just chat with a couple of other people, and I'll sign the book. No problem. I'm not going anywhere. In.[3:04:01] Tim Ferriss: And, chatted with the other folks, and then he asked if he could just walk me to the elevator, and then I could sign the book. I was like, sure. In. And he explained to me as I walked to the elevator how his brother had been a huge fan of mine in, and that I'd really kept his brother afloat for a long time, and eventually his brother killed himself. And that They kept his room exactly how it was, and he wanted me to sign the book so that he could put the book in his brother's room.[3:04:37] Tim Ferriss: In. And he asked me if I'd ever considered talking about mental health and mental health challenges met because he thought it would really help a lot of people, and that just I mean, I was, like, feeling myself tear up right now. I mean, it's it it was so crushing to hear the story. And totally unbeknownst to him, I had a lot of history with depressive episodes. And when I say near suicide, I had it on the calendar.[3:05:08] Tim Ferriss: I had a plan. I was gonna kill myself. I knew exactly how I was gonna do it. I knew where I was gonna do it. I knew all of the variables that I needed to account for to get it done.[3:05:17] Tim Ferriss: And The only reason that didn't happen for people who don't have the context, which most people want, is I had tried to reserve a book at Firestone Library. This is at Princeton, which had something to do with suicide. It was like assisted suicide, like, the the clinician's guide to euthanasia, something like that. And it wasn't in, and I have forgotten to change my address at the registrar's office. I was taking a year away from school, and that was to focus on finishing my thesis.[3:05:49] Tim Ferriss: It was try a few jobs, but I'd ended up in a very bad place and was feeling very isolated. And my friends were graduating a year ahead of me, and I was stuck on this thesis, and there's a lot of backstory that I won't bore people with. But it got to the point where I decided in not that objectively objectively my life is bad. I think this is where people who haven't experienced depression get a little confused or that it's hard for them to identify when they give advice to a depressed person because you might say to a depressed person like, but look. Your life is so great.[3:06:21] Tim Ferriss: Like, There's this. There's that. There's this. And for a lot of depressed people to say, yeah. I know.[3:06:26] Tim Ferriss: I look at that, and I can't fix my state[3:06:29] Andrew Huberman: in[3:06:29] Tim Ferriss: because I am broken. And if this is how I'm gonna have to live forever with being this broken and dysfunctional and to have this internal hell that I live day by day, I just want to escape. It's like someone jumping out of a burning building. It's like they don't wanna kill themselves, but they're jumping out of a burning building. And in.[3:06:52] Tim Ferriss: So I had it on the calendar, and thank god this is back when they would still send you a physical reminder in the mail, a little postcard that says your book is in. And that card went to my parents' house. And my mom saw it and panicked and called me, and I lied. I said it was for a friend who went to Rutgers who's doing a project on a, b, and c, but it's it was just enough to kinda snap me out of the trance and realize that in. Killing yourself is like putting on a suicide vest with explosives and walking to a room of all the people you care the most about and and blowing yourself up.[3:07:27] Tim Ferriss: In. So that snapped me out of it, but no one knew this. This guy certainly didn't know that. And that is when I went at home and thought about it and just decided. Okay.[3:07:42] Tim Ferriss: There's a chance if I write this, it's it's not certain, but there's a chance that this might help someone. It might prevent someone from doing what I was almost about to do. And so I spent months getting this post written and put it out, and I and I know for a fact it has saved minimum dozens of lives. And there are other things, including a very extensive list of resources. In.[3:08:10] Tim Ferriss: And, so that gave me, I suppose, not a toe in the water, but sort of jumping feet first into the deep end, an experience of being that vulnerable, and this was a long time ago. I mean, this is, I wanna say, at least 8 to 10 years ago when I put that post out. And Then, I wanna say it was just before COVID lockdown. I was in Costa Rica visiting a friend. I was with my girlfriend at the time, and she knew a secret of mine.[3:08:47] Tim Ferriss: And she was one of maybe 2 or 3 people who knew that I'd been sexually abused when I was a kid by a babysitter's son from 2 to 4 roughly in and routinely all the time kind of thing. And, yeah, like, what you're envisioning is is is in is is what happens. So it was not good. And that had been compartmentalized and locked away for my whole life. I was like, that's in the past.[3:09:16] Tim Ferriss: We're focused on moving forward, and, nothing to be fixed, Nothing to fix, and that was my my perspective on things. It turned out It wasn't quite that simple. Right? And so I had done a lot of work, a lot of therapy, used psychedelic assist therapies as well, in, which once again are not all upside potential. There are some significant risks.[3:09:47] Tim Ferriss: But I had come a long way. And my plan had always been to wait until my parents passed because I didn't want them to blame themselves for this and then to write a book. And there was something though at the time when I was having dinner with my girlfriend in. It was dissatisfying about that plan. It there's something about it that bothered me, and I couldn't quite put a finger on it.[3:10:10] Tim Ferriss: And I was talking to her about it, in. And she said that that's gonna take a long time. She's like, have you ever thought about how many people are going to pass away or die or suffer between now and when you publish that book. And I thought about it, and it was at that dinner that I decided to at least record a podcast covering this terrain. I was not at all convinced that I wanted to publish it.[3:10:42] Tim Ferriss: I I I was terrified of publishing it in also because it meant opening myself up to a lot of conversations or maybe just hurtful commentary online. Who knows? Like, people are there are a lot of idiots out there and a lot of otherwise fine people who are idiots on the Internet. So I was very hesitant. Ultimately decided I I didn't wanna do it as a 1 man show.[3:11:08] Tim Ferriss: I didn't want to make it a monologue, so in. I asked my friend Debbie Millman who had been on my podcast. She's an amazing graphic designer and teacher, in, but she had unexpectedly on my podcast based on some of my questions. For the first time publicly told her story about being sexually abused. In.[3:11:29] Tim Ferriss: And so I had leaned on her in years after that in private. And I asked her if she'd be willing to have conversation with me about our perspective journeys and what it felt like, what it looked like, what helped, didn't help what worked, what didn't, to provide at the very least a glimmer of hope for people who in. We're keeping some of these dark secrets or contending with them, not knowing what to do with them. And we had that conversation, and I sat on it. I sat on it.[3:12:03] Tim Ferriss: I sat on it, and then I put it out and decided in advance that I would not look at any social media for at least several weeks afterwards. If my team saw anything on social media or got emails, I didn't wanna see anything other than positive feedback, which is not my de facto. I I'm usually eager to solicit constructive feedback. In. But in this case, I I knew that my own position was too vulnerable.[3:12:33] Tim Ferriss: I I I didn't want to open up the possibility of of destabilizing myself. And I put it out, and man. I think it's the most important podcast I've ever put up, so I kinda felt like my job was done from a podcasting perspective after that. In. And it's been incredibly gratifying.[3:13:00] Tim Ferriss: I think it has certainly helped a fair number of people. And it was also really hard because what I didn't anticipate was, I would say, of my really super high performing close male friends. In maybe half reached out to me to tell someone for the first time about their extremely awful graphic firsthand experience of being sexually abused. The percentages were mind blowing. Like, the the actual percentages were super, super, super high, in, which is part of the reason I mentioned earlier, I think it's good to spend a little bit of time in those empty spaces to see, you know, am I in a positive energetic sense pursuing something good, or am I running away from demons whipping my back?[3:13:54] Tim Ferriss: And in for a lot of those guys. I'm sure it's true for a lot of women too. Like, they they find medication in Through intense focus and achievement, which is super adaptive in a lot of ways, but it doesn't always have lifetime reliability, and that's the story.[3:14:22] Andrew Huberman: Man. It's impossible to hear the those stories your story without, feeling some substantial emotion. I'm not trying to intellectualize. It's both both of those, aspects of your history that you shared are are huge. In.[3:14:39] Andrew Huberman: They really are. They're obviously huge for you, and and they're huge in terms of the positive impact in the world. I I know this because, in. I have read the comments. Right?[3:14:50] Andrew Huberman: And I and I've talked to people who have listened to those podcasts and read those blogs and, and have similar or maybe different stories of trauma. But I think, as with your work in the psychedelic space, as with your work in, the physical augmentation space, whatever you wanna call it, man. It's apparent that you're willing to be first man in on a lot of things and really may you're sitting alone there in those moments, and, these categories of revealing trauma, in my mind, anyway, so much more substantial in terms of their impact positive impact in the other aspects for our body and psychedelic work, etcetera, is also tremendously impactful, so that's saying a lot. So just wanna say thank you for for your, bravery.[3:15:39] Tim Ferriss: Man. And, Thanks, Andrew.[3:15:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's it's crazy because I think that a lot of people can imagine telling a story or to a close friend or something, but, you know, to put it out into the world. You know? It's like it's huge. Like, you don't know how that's gonna ripple.[3:15:57] Andrew Huberman: And you've been a real pioneer and example for, for me, for for Lax, for other people in revealing things not like that, but different. Yeah. Peter Attia has recently been opening up about some serious challenges that he's had in his in his book. He does that. On podcast, he's been doing it.[3:16:14] Andrew Huberman: So, you know, yet another category, arguably the most important category for, exploration and sharing and, you know, thoughtful bravery. Right? Because you didn't just put it out there in any form. So, in. One thing I do know by experience is there's nothing weirder than being, told thank you for the painful thing that you did.[3:16:34] Andrew Huberman: So I don't wanna push that too far, but I'd be remiss if I didn't because it it really has its impact, and and for doing it again here today because so, yeah, that huge thanks for doing that.[3:16:44] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. My my pleasure. And I'll I'll also say, you know, I got advice from a very, very experienced, psychedelic facilitator at one point who said, take the pain and make it part of your medicine. And the way I think that applies here in is we all experience pain. We all experience suffering.[3:17:11] Tim Ferriss: Many of us have experienced trauma of 1 type or another, in, and that can consume you. I mean, it can consume you, but it's like fire. Right? It can consume you, but you can harness it and use it for different things. And I know for I think it's I I'm not gonna hedge.[3:17:31] Tim Ferriss: I'll say I know for a fact in that there are people I've spoken to who are suicidal. And by the way, I'm not inviting everyone who's listening if you are suicidal to reach out to me because it won't work. I've had to disengage from that because it gets too heavy, right, just to engage 1 on 1 with people who are suicidal. But there are resources in that post I mentioned, the practical thoughts on suicide. In, but let's just talk about closer friends, people you would never suspect in a 1000000 years who are this close to blowing their brains out.[3:18:05] Tim Ferriss: People folks would recognize in some cases. In. The fact that I was also there once is why they listen to me because I have unfortunately, I'm a subject matter expert, man. I have credibility, and that actually is very redeeming. It provides some meaning to the suffering that I experience.[3:18:25] Tim Ferriss: It's like, okay. Here I am for whatever host of reasons I am put in this place and time with this person, in, and they don't trust the input of these other people they're talking to because those people don't know what it's like. But I can look at this person in the eye and be like, oh, I know. And that's just a different thing. So you can in.[3:18:50] Tim Ferriss: You can find a way to transmute that pain into something meaningful, into a gift that hopefully you can share in some way. Not necessarily with the whole wide world, in just 1 person. That's a big deal. 1 person's a big deal. There's a lot out there that is intended for mass consumption that gets front of millions of people.[3:19:13] Tim Ferriss: Doesn't really impact a single person very much. So even if you don't have a podcast, you don't have books, If you have the ability to sit down with 1 person and really make an impact, that's actually more meaningful than most of the crap that gets put out there. So take heart.[3:19:29] Andrew Huberman: In amen to that. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about the roles you see yourself in. You know, I I had this list coming in here of k. You've done the, exploration of the health sphere, you know, self experimentation. You You're you've been an investor.[3:19:50] Andrew Huberman: You are an investor. You're a podcaster. You're you know? I think these are more than titles. I think titles are great, but titles are what we get from other people telling us what we do or deciding what we do.[3:20:06] Andrew Huberman: In. I'm more interested in how you think about yourself, like, your your own role identity, and, You know, I I have to assume you've spent a little bit of time on this. Like, if one were to go through the the the checklist of possible roles[3:20:19] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[3:20:20] Andrew Huberman: Right? Okay. I confess I do this. I think, like okay. Like, I I I think I call I think I checked the box of animal because we're we're animals after all, and we're, a, you know, human You're still[3:20:28] Tim Ferriss: pole dancing? I think you're just pole dancer.[3:20:30] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely not.[3:20:33] Tim Ferriss: Are you still tango dancing? I'm planning on getting back into it.[3:20:37] Andrew Huberman: Great.[3:20:38] Tim Ferriss: And that is that does have some background.[3:20:40] Andrew Huberman: I have Argentine lineage, and I'm embarrassed to say I don't tang know tango, but[3:20:44] Tim Ferriss: my You got the you got the mate in the in the green room, so you're set.[3:20:48] Andrew Huberman: My my, grandparents, tend to go into their eighties, I think. Good. Late eighties. Yeah. Good shape.[3:20:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Ate steak and smoked cigarettes, and, we lived until their nineties.[3:20:59] Tim Ferriss: Times I had a champion.[3:21:00] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. In, but I'm curious about the roles that you see yourself in. Like, you know, role identity to me is so important, in terms of where we see ourselves now and where we see ourselves going forward. And who knows? Maybe you don't have any role identity plan, but, Yeah.[3:21:17] Andrew Huberman: What are some boxes that you see yourself in now that you really strongly identify[3:21:22] Tim Ferriss: Mhmm.[3:21:22] Andrew Huberman: With? And then what are some boxes that, you'd like to check off in going forward.[3:21:28] Tim Ferriss: So current boxes, I would say the 2 that I probably identify with most, Maybe 3, but I'll I'll I'll focus on 2. Experimentalist Mhmm. Which can take a lot of forms, in. That can that can apply to a whole lot of different spheres. So experimentalist and then teacher.[3:21:52] Tim Ferriss: And for the longest time, long, long time. I thought eventually, I would go back and actually be a 9th grade teacher because I feel like that is such a critical window for so many kids where they can either hit an inflection point going a really good direction or they can go in a really bad direction. And I certainly saw that on line Long Island with a lot of my friends, a lot of overdoses, bunch of friends who've died of opiate addiction and various things, and I had some intervention with mentors early on that that sort of flipped the switch on the railroad track and sent me in a different direction. So I thought for a long time, I would go back and be a 9th grade teacher, and my impulse in to experiment leads to enthusiasm for teaching, if that makes any sense. Because I feel like As good as I might be or decent at taking a complex subject, deconstructing it, applying 80 20, putting things in order, in and learning things very quickly, which includes stress testing assumptions in that, sort of assumed progression for skill, like language learning.[3:23:06] Tim Ferriss: There's so many myths in language learning. As an example, If it takes me, say, 6 months to become reasonably competent in field x, I can usually get other people to that same point of confidence in a third of that time. So for me, it's very gratifying to teach, and I view all the books as teaching tools. I'm no Tolstoy. I recognize I'm not the world's greatest writer.[3:23:33] Tim Ferriss: I take the writing seriously. In. I don't have asset. I do many, many, many revisions. Even for cockpunch, it's like 27 revisions for a short story called cockpunch.[3:23:44] Tim Ferriss: So I take it seriously, but I recognize that I'm not the world's greatest wordsmith, but I am looking for outcomes in readers or listeners, and and I view my job as that of teacher. So I'd say experimentalist and teacher are the 2, and those both go a long way in and applies to, say, dog training. You know? Lots ran lots of experiments. Man.[3:24:15] Andrew Huberman: And for those listening, Tim just looked under the table. One thing I should've said at the beginning and I did not is that, this is the first in Huberman Lab Podcast to feature a guest who brought their dog. So we have Molly is here as well, and we're absolutely delighted. There has not been a dog at on the Huberman Lab Podcast since, Costello passed away, and, I'm, you know, practically floating, in in delight that Molly's here today. She's she's amazing.[3:24:45] Andrew Huberman: And you've done an amazing job training her too.[3:24:47] Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Yeah. She's she's laying right next to my feet, licking my hand as I speak.[3:24:52] Andrew Huberman: So good.[3:24:52] Tim Ferriss: And I'd say if I were to expand that by 1, I would probably say explorer, but the exploring goes hand in hand with the experimentation. So that could be geographic exploration. It could be spending time with people who are excellent at anything in any field Mhmm. And seeing where that gingerbread trail leads me. And I think the the the exploration and the experimentation are, for me, bedfellows.[3:25:26] Tim Ferriss: They go together.[3:25:28] Andrew Huberman: What about roles that you would like to explore or potentially see yourself in? I mean, I don't have a magic wand, but if I did as a fellow podcaster, and I consider you a friend. I would say, okay. Like, if I could wand you to the success in Given role that wouldn't be the way it would work, and that wouldn't be as gratifying as having to, figure it all out because that's part of your your machinery, as you just told us, so, yeah, what are some role life roles that you're interested in expanding and, or stepping into that you haven't explored?[3:25:59] Tim Ferriss: I'd say more in more artists, more artistry, especially in the visual sense because I wanting to be a comic book penciler for a really long time, got paid as an illustrator, towards the end of high school and during college, so I illustrated books and magazines and so on. Then I just dropped it. I dropped it when I graduated because that was kid stuff, and it was time to get serious and be an adult. And I just cold turkey to stop all of it. And so the skills have atrophied a lot, but There's still there's still a bit in there.[3:26:28] Andrew Huberman: I've seen some posts on Instagram that were Yeah. Quite good.[3:26:32] Tim Ferriss: So I'm still messing around. Yeah. I'm still messing around. And especially when I have some structure, in. I do well, so I'd I'd like to pursue that.[3:26:38] Tim Ferriss: I would like to experiment with animation. So I don't know if animator would be the right label because I most likely would not be doing the animation myself, but playing a role in visual art would be one. Father will be another one Mhmm. Eventually. And, try not to be attached to it, but We all play games of various types, and if we get really good at certain games that are socially rewarded, then you make money doing a podcast or investing or whatever it might be, but when my when when when the sort of ramp of my learning starts to flatten out a bit, I tend to get bored of those games.[3:27:23] Tim Ferriss: And I think that in. Certainly, one of the biggest adventures must be parenthood. So at some point, in. I think father would be on there. And I should say, this is very judgmental need to say, but I think there's a big difference between wanting to man.[3:27:44] Tim Ferriss: Wanting to be a parent and wanting to have kids. I'm very cautious about saying I wanna have kids because it doesn't automatically imply you wanna be a good parent, in Which is also why I thought it was very important for me to spend a lot of time training Molly. In[3:28:00] Andrew Huberman: Lot of learning there. Right?[3:28:01] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It's a seems like, alright. Am I gonna do the heavy lifting and the hard work? Recognizing that kids are not in deferred dogs, but I do think there are actually a lot of similarities, in terms of Just predictive ability. If you see someone who has dogs that are terribly trained, look at their kids.[3:28:23] Tim Ferriss: You might see some similarity.[3:28:24] Andrew Huberman: My my good friend, my good friend, I'll out him here, who's a MDP issue. He's their chair of ophthalmology at Stanford. Jeff Goldberg, once asked him if he has any pets, and he said that he and his wife had 3 children as preparation for having a dog. That's hilarious.[3:28:41] Tim Ferriss: There's a quote also from a book called Don't Shoot the Dog, which is terrible title, but excellent book written by Karen Pryor who was a an aquatic mammal trainer, so she's training dolphins and whales and so on, which don't respond to negative reinforcement. You can't really hit them with a rolled up newspaper if they don't do what you want. And there's a quote in that book in Which is something along the lines of I can't remember the attribution to another trainer, and it was people should not be allowed to have children until they've successfully trained chicken because also chickens, like, they they just don't have the brain power to respond to, a much negative reinforcement, so you have to coax them to do what you want them to do with positive reinforcement. In, and, I mean, operating classical conditioning, it's kinda same same across the board. Whether you're, like, the CIA trying to train cockroaches to flip lights, which is not making that one up, by the way, or training a will or training a cat or training a human.[3:29:42] Tim Ferriss: Training sounds bad. Cultivating.[3:29:44] Andrew Huberman: In. Mhmm.[3:29:45] Tim Ferriss: A wonderful human. Yeah. Then, I think there's a lot to be learned across the board. So I've successfully proven to myself that I can keep the dog alive and happy[3:29:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And train up another happy nervous system.[3:29:57] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[3:29:58] Andrew Huberman: You know? Curate another nervous system. That's a big deal. Oh, yeah.[3:30:01] Tim Ferriss: Well, she's also, like, my external nervous system, so we we sort of work in tandem. I pay a lot of attention to how she relates to different people. Mhmm. Yeah.[3:30:10] Andrew Huberman: I saw earlier today, I mean, as someone who is the owner of a Bulldog mastiff who knew one command, which was wait, which is the which is the by default, the easiest thing to train a bulldog because it when when you by the way, folks, if you stop a bulldog on the street to scratch them and they look delighted, they might like you, but chances are they're just really relieved that they get to stop. So[3:30:33] Tim Ferriss: Yeah.[3:30:33] Andrew Huberman: And, Costello, he had a forebrain, and he he was smart about what he needed to be smart about. But Molly is exceptional. Like, she knows where she needs to be, and she's super connected to you. And she knows a ton of commands. It was ridiculous.[3:30:46] Andrew Huberman: Our staff was, like, delighting in the number of things that Tim could get her to do just by looking at her.[3:30:50] Tim Ferriss: Man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's, she's also quite calm out of the box, in, which helps.[3:30:59] Tim Ferriss: Although it makes it harder in some respects to train because she doesn't have much food drive.[3:31:03] Andrew Huberman: If you those Maui Nui sticks, we would[3:31:05] Tim Ferriss: jump in Maui Nui sticks. Yeah. She loves the Maui Nui a Venison Sticks, but she well, okay. I'll get I'll give I'll say 2 things. So first is if your dog has a spaz about food, that's actually great news.[3:31:17] Tim Ferriss: It will make your dog very easy to train in some respects. Read don't shoot the dog. It's it's excellent. And there's some others I could recommend. I had a woman named, Susan Garrett on my podcast.[3:31:30] Tim Ferriss: So I wanted an objective measure a of successful dog training, and competitors have objective measures. So she was in a dog agility champion for many years, which has a lot of metrics. So, anyway, I had her on for people who are interested, but the the the tip that I got from 1 dog train her early on because I was trying to train Molly, and I was using just some of her kibble. I'd, like, put some kibble in a bag and carried around. And she was like, what are you doing?[3:31:56] Tim Ferriss: And I said, what do you mean what am I doing? She's like, is that kibble? I'm like, yeah. It's kibble. And she goes she's like, hey, pal.[3:32:03] Tim Ferriss: She's like, you're at a crowded bar. You got a tip of twenties. Nice. To get your dog's attention, you take your puppy to the dog park. It's like squirrels, other dogs, grass, piss on the pavement, whatever it happens to be.[3:32:13] Tim Ferriss: You have to have good treats. So if your dog isn't responding, chances are maybe you're trying to tip with singles.[3:32:18] Andrew Huberman: I love it. I love it. Well, thank you for sharing the roles you see yourself in and the ones that you'd like to step into more. I certainly feel I have the jurisdiction to say that You are an exceptional experimentalist and a phenomenal teacher. We've seen this across so many you're welcome, and and I'm not just speaking for myself.[3:32:39] Andrew Huberman: I'm speaking for so many other people as well, and we've seen this across so many domains. It's like blogging, podcasting, book writing, in stage lecturing, being a guest on a podcast, you know, and on and on. And, in terms of the roles that you want to expand into more, I in. Can't wait to see the illustrations that that emerge. Yeah.[3:33:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Please do, grow that flame because I I'm excited for what comes out. Cock a punch being, just the first of them.[3:33:09] Tim Ferriss: Leading the charge.[3:33:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And, you know, in. I can say because I know, because I have 1 and because I, I have observed many, kids and friends, ma'am, who are fathers. You're gonna be an exceptional father. I'm finna Absolutely confident of that.[3:33:28] Tim Ferriss: Excellent. Yeah. I appreciate that.[3:33:31] Andrew Huberman: In, and I wanna say thanks for taking the time to talk with me today. I've been looking forward to this so much. My team knows this. Wait. We were sort of buzzing like, Yeah.[3:33:39] Andrew Huberman: We've had some heavy hitters on this podcast. You know? We only look to the top 1% in field, and they're, you know, incredibly credentialed by whatever standards we happen to be exploring, and they have to be filled people that I really wanna talk to. So, I have so much respect for what you do and the way you do it. You've certainly inspired me.[3:34:03] Andrew Huberman: This podcast would not exist. I don't think the genre of podcasting would exist and look the way that it does had you not made the decision to start podcasting. And, in anticipation of this episode, I did put out ping on Twitter for questions, and there were many, many of them, that may well do a q and a sometime, maybe not. Who knows? But, you know, one of the questions that really stood out to me was, you know, how does Tim feel about all these other people coming into all the spaces that he's worked and doing, successful work that builds off so much of what he's done?[3:34:34] Andrew Huberman: And, in. I'll let you answer, but for me, I can say that, I've been positively inspired and built so much of what we've been doing here and, in, and what I think about based on the ways that you've podcasted and communicate with the public and maintain your stance and integrity in the way that you interact with people, it's really inspiring, and you've always been so gracious to me and, so humble and so giving. And, and at the same time, I know there's a fierce guy in there who likes to get it done. So Once again, thanks for being first man in. Thanks for taking on all the roles that you have and that you are and that you will, and Thanks for being a giver.[3:35:12] Andrew Huberman: We all benefit.[3:35:13] Tim Ferriss: Thanks, Andrew. I really appreciate you saying all that, and I want people to just get after it, take things seriously, have fun, and be really, really good. So watching, for instance, what you've done, which has been so spectacular, so well executed, makes me super happy. And I don't view anyone as competition, in the podcasting world, for instance, in the book world. I don't view it that way either, and I just hope that people keep experimenting, pushing the envelope.[3:35:53] Tim Ferriss: And if people aren't, say, getting better over time, if people aren't following who are substantially better than me in all of these ways, in, then I would be super disappointed. So every time I see someone doing something really impressive or doing something I never would have thought of, I get so extremely excited. I I find it really fun to watch. So appreciate you also just getting out there and hard charging and taking your podcast seriously as you do. I mean, I I've seen the notes.[3:36:23] Tim Ferriss: I've seen the setup. I've met the team. It's it's very inspiring for me also. It makes me wanna dust off my cleats and get back on the field.[3:36:32] Andrew Huberman: So Oh, man. You've never left the field, and you've had a hand in it all. So thank you so much, and Hope you'll come back and visit us again here.[3:36:41] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I hope so. It's been a real pleasure. I've been looking forward to this for a long time as well, in, and I appreciate you inviting me on.
