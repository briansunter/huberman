I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the first in a series with doctor Andy Galpin. Doctor Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength, Speed, endurance, hypertrophy, and various other aspects of fitness, exercise, and sports performance. Across the 6 episode series, doctor Andy Galvin pulls from his expertise working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercisers and teaches us the mechanisms, logic, and specific protocols for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that I mentioned a moment ago, from strength to endurance, hypertrophy, and everything in between.[0:00:57] Andrew Huberman: We get really far into details, but at all times, paying attention to the macroscopic issues. That is how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed or one that combines all of those. We also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximize recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations. During today's episode, doctor Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness and more generally, how to think about fitness so that we can best achieve Our fitness, exercise, and performance goals, doctor, professor Andy Galpin. Super excited to have you here.[0:01:32] Andrew Huberman: You're such an immense treasure trove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise. I'm curious, however. So many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, But most people are not. Many people exercise regularly.[0:01:55] Andrew Huberman: Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that. They're overtraining. They're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask, how fit are we?[0:02:09] Andrew Huberman: With the word fit, of course, being a very broad encompassing word, you know, could encompass endurance, certainly does, strength, the ability to run fast even if for short distances. It might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy trying to balance one's musculature To offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, etcetera, how should I or anyone else for that matter think about their level of fitness? You know, I know my resting heart rate, but what do I do in terms of really assessing whether or not I'm as fit as I could be and should be both for sake of health and performance. And here, I'm asking you the question not as an athlete, but as somebody who's been pretty consistent as an exerciser. But If we were to throw our arms around this question of how do we assess our fitness, what would be, sort of the different levels of assessment that we should think about And do[0:03:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: When it comes to exercise, people generally have 2 major goals in mind. Goal number 1 is achieving some sort of appearance. Right. This is, I wanna be big or I wanna not be too big or I wanna be lean. Something.[0:03:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? It doesn't matter what that goal is, but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody. They wanna look a certain way or not look a certain way. The other one is functionality. So I wanna be able to perform a certain way.[0:03:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now again, that definition differs per person. So I wanna be better at strength. I wanna be better at mobility. I wanna be able to, have energy throughout the day. Whatever it is.[0:03:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's some sort of appeal to aesthetic, and there's some sort of appeal to functionality. So within both of those categories, we want to be in a position where We can understand where do I need to go with my exercise training so that I can be as fit and as healthy and Achieve these goals that I want now, as well as be in a position where I can maintain them for a long period of time. So this blends both immediate goals. So say you're just interested in squatting a lot of weight. Say you're interested in running, 5 k time the best you want.[0:04:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: It doesn't matter. It blends that with the ability the the desire to have a long wellness span, to be fit throughout life, to achieve all those things for as long as possible. So then the question kinda comes back to saying, how do I know which area I need to focus on the most? And why am I not achieving these goals? Or how can I get there more effectively?[0:04:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: And if we look at the big picture, we have to understand that there are several major components to physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories. And to achieve that, there are handful of components that have to happen to be able to hit those goals. Now there are infinite methods. So the saying we actually use here a lot is The methods are many, but the concepts are few. So what I'd love to do today is over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then cover a whole bunch of different methods, and we could do that for hours.[0:05:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: But we'll cover a number of them for various goals.[0:05:05] Andrew Huberman: So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience and not into exercise science is because of this thing, neuroplasticity, the nervous system's ability to adapt. But the more time I spend with you and the more I learn from you, I realize that many, if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt. When we're talking about physical exercise, there are incredible adaptations that, of course, involve the nervous system, but also Involve muscle and connective tissue and so many other cell types and tissues. That said, when we talk about fitness, What are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness? And later, I know we're gonna get into how Different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations, but what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise.[0:06:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: There there are many reasons why one should exercise, and we could perhaps cover that later in our Physiological adaptations can be bucketed really into 9 areas. So the very first one is what I call skill or technique. So just learning to move better, more efficiently With a specific position and timing and sequence or whatever that is, this could be running more effectively. This could be practicing a skill like Shooting a a ball or an implement, swinging a golf club, anything like that. I call that skill development.[0:06:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: The second one is speed. Is simply moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration. K. That's very similar to the next one, which is power, and power is Speed multiplied by force. The next one then, of course, on top of that is force or strength.[0:06:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that those are really Synonymous terms. Right? How effectively can you move something? Now this is often confused, strength rather, as muscular endurance. So what I mean by that is Strength truly is a marker of how what's the maximum thing you can move or it's the maximum amount of force you can produce one time.[0:07:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not how many repetitions in a row you can do. That's actually another one of our annotations called muscular endurance. Alright? So That is typically under the order of, like, say, 5 to 25, maybe 50 repetitions. Think of a classic, How many push ups can you do in a row?[0:07:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: How many sit ups can you do in a minute? Like, things like that are muscular endurance. Muscular endurance tends to be localized. So this is, you know, specific to just say your triceps and your and your deltoids. It's not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker or anything like that.[0:07:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's strength, number 4. Number 5 is muscle hypertrophy, and this is the first time now we're talking about, an appearance Rather than a functional outcome. So, you know, moving better, moving faster, moving heavier are, indicators of how well you can move. This is the first one that's just simply how big is your muscle, and that's muscle perch for your muscle size. After that is muscular endurance.[0:08:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement. So think of how many push ups in a row you can do, how many sit ups in a you can do things that are typically in, like, 5 to 50 repetition sort of range, and it is often or what is almost always Local muscle. So what I mean by that is, it is I don't a push up test is is really how many reps that your triceps and PECs and and deltoids can do. It is not a cardiovascular endurance. It is not a global physiological endurance.[0:08:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's specific to typically 1 or a few muscle groups at a time. This is why you have to do multiple tests for for sort of every group there. After that, now we've moved into number 7, which is what I call anaerobic capacity. This is more synonymous with maximum heart rate. And now we're actually looking at rather than a single movement or muscle group, it is a total physiological, limitation.[0:09:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it is, the maximum amount of work you can do in, say, 30 to 45 seconds, maybe even up to a 120 seconds of all out work. Think of your classic interval type of stuff here. So how much work can you do at a maximum rate where you're gonna enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue? The next past that is maximal aerobic capacity, and this is probably something like in the 8 to 15 minute range where you're going to reach Probably both, a maximum heart rate as well as a true VO two max, which we'll we'll talk a lot more about what that is, later. So that is is, different from the previous one where you can't reach this in a matter of seconds.[0:09:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: It simply takes Multiple minutes to get to a position to where your VO two max is actually going to be, sufficiently challenged or an indicator there. And then the last 1, number 9, is what I call long duration. And this is just your ability to sustain submaximal work for a long period of time with no breaks, No reduction whatsoever. This is often called steady state training or a lot of people just think of this when they think of, quote, unquote, cardio. But your ability to continue movement without any breaks or change or drop, is the last and final adaptation.[0:10:15] Andrew Huberman: And if we're long distance steady state, I'm guessing it exceeds 15 minutes because, the previous one was 8 to 15 minutes or so. What sort of, rate Time ranges are we talking about in terms of this, long duration?[0:10:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, that's actually wonderful. You're gonna be anything past 15 minutes. So really, if you look at a a kind of a minimum number there is Generally, 20 minutes of what we're looking for, but a a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes. But anything past that would still be Limited by your long duration endurance, so your ability to sustain work over time.[0:10:48] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So given that there are 9 different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types. Is there any one global test or assessment that people can take or do that allows them to determine what level of ability of fitness they have In each and every one of these 9 different categories.[0:11:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: There are probably dozens or more tests that you can do for each one of those 9 categories. And what I would actually like to do is walk you through my favorites for each and giving you both the scientific gold standard. So if you have the ability, unlimited resources, what should you go do? As well as some that are are equipment free, that are cost free, things that anyone can do across the world. In addition to that, I wanna walk you through what those numbers should be, how do you identify if you're really poor in something or if you're great.[0:11:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then if you aren't as good, maybe in a category and you wanna get better at Exactly what to do in terms of protocols, for how to achieve optimal results in each of those steps.[0:11:49] Andrew Huberman: So I noticed in your list of the 9 different adaptations to exercise That you did not mention fat loss or health promoting benefits, which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise. Was there a specific reason that you did not mention those?[0:12:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely. It's because those things are actually not specific training styles. They are byproducts of these 9. So what I mean by that is if you understand how fat loss occurs, Which we can certainly talk about. You'll realize some of these 9 protocols are effective for fat loss and some are not.[0:12:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: General health is the same thing. When we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective, then the rationale for what to train for is going to determine itself. So what I mean is looking at things like in order to be healthy, you have to have sufficient strength. You have to have cardiovascular fitness. You have to have sufficient muscle and etcetera.[0:12:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Therefore, training for one's health is determined by those restrictions. So for you, Andrew, you may need to do more strength training to be healthy, where me, because I'm strong already, way stronger than you, I may not need to do as much strength training. So our quote, unquote health based protocols are based on our current status or limitations in physical fitness among these 9 areas. So what I would like to do today is to cover a brief history of exercise science, and the reason is it's going to explain a lot About why people are not getting the goals in their exercise programs that they want, as well as gives you very specific direction About what to do instead.[0:13:27] Andrew Huberman: I can't wait to hear all the things that I'm doing incorrectly and to have you help me remedy that. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from doctor Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's cast.[0:13:52] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is Momentous. Momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentous For several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations.[0:14:10] Andrew Huberman: If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, You can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, momentous supplements ship internationally, and this is, of important because we realized that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast, In particular, supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery, you can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, so that's livemomentous.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT.[0:14:50] Andrew Huberman: LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains exact ratios of the electrolyte Sodium, magnesium, and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve cells, neurons in particular, requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake.[0:15:22] Andrew Huberman: But what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet that is not a lot of processed foods, which, Of course, it's a good thing. Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. LMNT contains a science backed ratio Of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element, that's l m n t.com/huberman to get a free LMNT sample pack with your Purchase. Again, that's drink element, l m n t, .com/huberman to claim a free sample pack.[0:16:01] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover for about the last 8 months, And it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios A so called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward.[0:16:29] Andrew Huberman: I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in terms of core body temperature, and waking up involves A 1 to 3 degree increase in core body temperature. With 8 Sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment To be 1 temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning, each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep And have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman and check out their pod 3 cover save $150 at checkout. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.[0:17:16] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's 8 Sleep .com/huberman to save $150 at checkout. Before we get into how the history of exercise science informs The mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes. I'm curious as to whether or not you have any favorite 1 or 2 studies that Point to a sort of naturally occurring, example of how people can become very fit in one area and not another. Know, I'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apparently have terrific endurance, but at least to my eye, don't look like they are particularly strong. I'm also familiar with seeing individuals that are very, very strong, particularly on social media, but that don't look like they could walk up a flight of stairs much less run a mile.[0:18:00] Andrew Huberman: You have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way?[0:18:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a lot to hap to discuss here, but I'll answer it really clear. If you look across the literature, and this is actually back to as early as the mid 19 fifties. In fact, it actually goes back to previous to that, to the Harvard fatigue lab, 1927 to 1947 area. People actually were advocating at that point a combination of strength training and endurance.[0:18:26] Andrew Huberman: In the 19 twenties.[0:18:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Way back then. In fact, it actually goes prior to that, the late 18 eighties. There's scientific evidence back then. It became more well developed in in the mid 19 fifties and sixties. In fact, there was, the initial stages of what's called the exercises medicine movement, which is the movement now.[0:18:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: But the initial stages of that actually route back to the 19 fifties. And I could actually go into that whole discussion and and the story of, how that all came about. But that's the health is wealth, mantra that came from the 19 fifties, from the scientific community then. All those those data points are going to suggest you need a combination of some sort of Broad strength training and broad endurance. Now if you have a specific goal 5 months from now, you wanna compete in a race or hit a a certain physique thing, that's Fine to focus on one area of training.[0:19:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Certainly, if you're an athlete, that's different. But if you wanna maximize health and and overall functionality throughout time, it needs to be nomination. And to really, really highlight this, I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I've done. One of them we actually did in Stockholm, Sweden. So I did this at the Karolinska Institute, which you probably are aware of.[0:19:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology. Generally, it started there. It was called something different back then, but, really, our entire field came out of Stockholm and the Karolinska Institute. And we work with a whole bunch of cross country skiers, that were in their eighties nineties. And so they were competitive skiers in the 19 forties and fifties, and they had been skiing competitively for That entire duration.[0:19:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing. So these are 80 to 90 year olds living alone and healthy, and we long endurance individuals. What do they look like? When we brought them in the lab, which is by the way amazing to do a v o two max test on a 92 year old, especially in a language that they don't speak. You're in a you can imagine you're doing this in the hospital.[0:20:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? And you're running people Through this is a cycling test, and so for a v o two max test, you have a mask on your face. You're hooked up to a metabolic cart, so we can collect all the gases that are coming out of your mouth. And you're you're chanting these people on, and basically every minute the workload gets harder and harder and harder until you can't complete it. And we're doing this in a in a cardiology center, and the cardiologists are usually waiting for their heart rate to get, like, slightly elevated, and they stop them because they're, You know, 85, 86 years old.[0:20:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: And not only we not stopping them, but we are screaming in their ears. It's like, go go go.[0:20:59] Andrew Huberman: In Swedish or English?[0:21:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: In in English. Right? Then that the translator but it doesn't take a lot of translation when someone's screaming at your face, like go go go. So we ran them through a whole bunch of VO two max tests, And we did the same thing for those folks back, here here in America. And what was, incredibly clear from that study Was the v o two max, you can think about these numbers, and this is what's called relative.[0:21:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in the relative terms are, milliliters per kilogram per minute. And so a standard number is about 18, is what we call the line of independence. So if your VO two max is below 18 milliliters per kilogram per minute, it's very hard for you to live by yourself. So your fitness is so low, you probably are going to need to have somebody living with you, or you'll need to be in some sort of assisted living home. So if you are in, like, The VO two max of 20 or 21 or 22, you're not below that line of independence, but you're on that threshold.[0:21:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so what we found was our folks here in America, The group average was right around that number. So they were living at home by definition. We picked them to be people living by themselves in their eighties, not in a living room. But they didn't have any bandwidth. So if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness, they were gonna drop below that line and would probably have to go to some sort of assisted living situation.[0:22:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: The folks in Stockholm, the the cross country skiers, the group average was most closer to, like, 35 to 38 Milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now that number is about the VO two max you would find for a normal college male. And so these folks that were literally 80 or 90, if the, you know, the joke, if a saber tooth tiger ran in the room or or whatever and it chased it down, And we all had to run to see who didn't get eaten alive. The the college men would probably have gotten eaten before the the 90 year olds. And in one case, we had a 92 year old individual, and I think his VO two max was 38, which was, in our estimation, a world record.[0:22:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: The highest VO two max for somebody over the age of 90.[0:22:56] Andrew Huberman: May may I ask what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody, very fit like these, older Swedish cross country skiers. They if somebody has a, this let's say their number is 35 milliliters per kilogram In this, v o two max test but since most of us don't have access to that kind of equipment, but that we can measure our pulse rate[0:23:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:23:20] Andrew Huberman: What was a typical resting heart rate resting pulse rate?[0:23:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sub 60.[0:23:24] Andrew Huberman: Sub 60.[0:23:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I mean, typically, that's a good number to go off of for anybody regardless of age. Anytime I see somebody above that, I'm I'm gonna start asking questions. Certainly above you know, you'll see in the literature, people will say 60 to 80 is normal, and I I don't agree with that at all. If you're up, if your resting heart rate is 75 beats per minute, there's either something going on or you're not fit.[0:23:45] Andrew Huberman: How much cross country skiing were they doing on average in the previous let's say, if we take the previous 20 years since they've been long time cross country skiers divide that by 20 years.[0:23:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:23:57] Andrew Huberman: On average, are these people cross country skiing 5 hours a day, 2 hours a day, an hour a day?[0:24:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. That's actually a good question. I don't remember. It's been many years, but they were not doing it every single day, and that the volume would not have shocked you. It was the consistency over 50 years that got them there.[0:24:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now, obviously, these people were again world champions and Olympic gold medalist in 19 forties fifties, so they were elite. They just continued consistently over time. But it wasn't a a a shocking amount of physical fitness. They also didn't go out of their way to train hard. They were busy chopping wood.[0:24:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: They were busy doing number of other things, and then they just happen to do some of these races and ski a long way. But it wasn't a a crazy amount to where you're like, oh, that's great, But I could never hit that number. It was something much more reasonable.[0:24:43] Andrew Huberman: So is the takeaway to be consistent about getting cardiovascular exercise, and we can define[0:24:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:24:49] Andrew Huberman: What consistent means in terms of days per week a little bit later, and I I know we will. Yeah. What are some other examples? I love these examples of, from the real world.[0:24:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: So here here's the downside though. So I only told you about their VO two max. What I didn't tell you about is their leg strength and functionality. And that part was no more superior than it was their counterparts who were not exercisers. So what that showed really, really clearly, and many other studies have been done since then that look at the classic what we call lifelong endurance exercisers.[0:25:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: You will see in general their VO two max, their cardiovascular function, their resting heart rate, their blood pressure. It will be, markedly healthier than focusing on exercise. It is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronic disease management. No doubt about it. However, it is not sufficient for overall global health because it does almost nothing for leg strength, For any other marker of health which we can talk about what are the things that are actually going to predict mortality, morbidity the most.[0:25:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that was a a big a big smashing indication that's like, hey. This is great. However, you're leaving things on the table for your overall health. Now one could argue they're 80, and they they're doing pretty well, but they weren't doing as well in these areas. And so A study we did later actually as a follow-up was looking at monozygous winds.[0:26:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is actually interesting being a scientist. This is a classic example of one of my graduate students Who'd been in my lab for probably 3 or 4 years, and she was in our single fiber physiology lab, and she's now can you imagine she's in she's isolating individual Muscle fibers from an athlete, 1 by 1 with the tweezer. And she's going to do several 1,000 individual cells. Right? So she's you're down there for hours and and Things happen down there.[0:26:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: You kinda lose your mind. And and she was just kind of going on one day with one of my colleagues and just talking, and she's like, oh, yeah. My uncle is really, really fit and Something or other, and then oh, yeah. He's a twin. And I was like, oh, is he a monozygous?[0:26:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: And she's like, yeah.[0:26:53] Andrew Huberman: For those that don't know, monozygous are identical twins. Yeah.[0:26:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: What's interesting? So you basically have what I'm setting up here is is this the perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous identical twins mean The they have exact same DNA. So an egg was fertilized split, and then 2 humans grew out of that with the exact same DNA. And so now we can start to answer the question.[0:27:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, yeah. Okay. What about maybe these cross country skiers? Maybe they were just genetic freaks. Maybe it didn't matter.[0:27:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's like, some people have, Well, genetics are always a component to it, but how much? Well, now we have a scenario lining up where it's like, wait a minute. You have monozygous twins. So we have a replica of a human being, exact same DNA. The only differences that we would see in their physiology now would be due to lifestyle circumstances.[0:27:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Interesting. So Monozygous twin on your dad and uncle. Right? Uh-huh. Great.[0:27:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Do they exercise? Well, one of them does. He's a lifelong endurance exercise. Runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman, all these things. What about the other one?[0:27:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Nope. He doesn't exercise at all. And And at that point, like, I wanted to kill my graduate student because I'm like, you've been in my lab for 3 years or more probably, And you've never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exercise you could ever create. And like Jesus, the the the look on her face when my colleague and I were staring at her, she's just like, oh my god. So I'm like, call them right now.[0:28:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're coming in the lab. They'll fly them in from Chicago. I don't care what we have to do, like, we're getting them in. And so I wanted to actually going back to the model that was first developed by the Harvard GLAAD. One thing that's interesting about that community is they started off with the concept of trying to examine human performance through a holistic lens.[0:28:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so it was the Antithesis of looking at, either organ by organ. So we're going to only look at the cardiovascular system. We're only going to look at skeletal muscle, and then we're saying we're looking at this entire picture. And so that model we wanted to carry through when these twins, and I said, alright. I wanna bring them in the lab, but I'm not just going to look at 1 system.[0:28:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: I want to do everything. So we took Stool samples, we took blood, we did vertical jump tests, we did maximum strength tests, we did, MRIs of muscle mass, we did, VO two max test. We did efficiency stuff. We we did genetic testing. We did an IQ test.[0:29:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: We did psychological battery. We wanna look at everything to figure out all these things what differ between the twins. And if so, The 2nd key question there is, by how much? So can I improve my VO two max? Sure.[0:29:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Everyone knows that, but how much? Can it change by 5%, 80%, like, where is the number? And so putting some quantification on this was very important. And so, again, we had another example of a classic Endurance only training paradigm compared to a a non x. So this is a a person who's I think he's a truck driver by vocation, which is I think he actually drove for a potato chip company, is even funnier.[0:29:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: The the endurance athlete actually was great because like any endurance people, he had a he had physical books Of all of his training mileage for the last 35 years, and we could we just went through them. And we calculated the total amount of miles he ran, his averages, his heart rates per time. We had this unbelievable thing, like, what races he was in. He had the documentation. He was just totally nuts.[0:30:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Like, something that endurance people are, like, shaking their head right now going, oh, yeah. I got that[0:30:09] Andrew Huberman: And everyone else Endurance folks are pretty nerdy.[0:30:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. They're super nerdy. Right? So it's great because now we could validate as close as one could To actually how much you ran and and things like that. So they had about a 35 year discord.[0:30:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: They both exercised up through high school. About 18, they stopped doing it. By the time they run them in the lab, they're in their mid So it's about 35 years of difference. And when we ran them through the testing, if you look at the the measures that were similar to the Sweden study, It was almost identical. The the the exercising twin was significantly better at things like a lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO two max.[0:30:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Any of those markers, as predicted were were much better. What was very interesting though was the things that were in the middle. First of all, Their total amount of muscle mass was almost identical, like, to the gram. Within the margin of error of a DEXA scan could possibly ever be. The non exerciser though was a little bit fatter.[0:31:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat or non lean tissue, really. Same story, Joe. So okay. Like, no one's surprised there that the exercise was a little bit leaner even though it didn't change full amount of muscle mass at all. When we looked at some of the more functional tests, we looked at things like muscle quality.[0:31:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound. You can kind of think about this as How much fat is inside the tissue, which is sometimes an advantage for endurance athlete to have a little bit more of an what are called intramuscular triglycerides because it's a fuel directly in the tissue. But in general, the exercise or the, the muscle quality was not in favor of the exercise. If you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength, it favored the the non exerciser. So now again, we have the same finding we saw in our Sweden study, but in identical twins.[0:32:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so it really, really highlighted the fact that If you want to move forward with optimal health, simply picking 1 silo is not gonna get you there.[0:32:09] Andrew Huberman: One silo meaning just running, just cycling.[0:32:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[0:32:13] Andrew Huberman: Does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump higher or win an arm wrestling, Competition, not that that's a vital thing to be able to do, but just in terms of measuring strength, you know, it's our isometric strength. Was the nonexercising twin stronger or at least as strong as they're exercising?[0:32:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yes. Particularly in grip strength. Yep. And any of the measures, like the vertical jump, leg extension power, and a number of things, they often favor the non exerciser, Which you're still a little bit of a chicken and egg. You don't know if necessarily the endurance training reduced that other twin's strength or it doesn't even really matter per se.[0:32:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think The highlight of it is, can you change some of these metrics of the Ultomax? Yeah. Not even close. These things are very responsive Regardless of your genetics, your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly. Even the non exerciser was a pretty healthy guy.[0:33:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: They they were in a good spine. Mid fifties, doesn't exercise, doesn't really pay attention to his diet at all, and he was in a pretty good shape. However, If you wanna actually move progress and move forward, high functionality, you have to do something besides Just run. Right? Just distance run.[0:33:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now I could say the same thing for strength training. That alone, because I don't wanna make this seem like I'm saying endurance exercises. It worked. In both case in both these studies, those folks were, much better off in metrics that are incredibly important to mortality. How How long you're going to live?[0:33:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: V o two max, etcetera. It's just not gonna get there in terms of strength. We took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well, which is very So what I mean is there's generally 2 types of muscle fibers, fast twitch and slow twitch. And one of the things that is a hallmark of aging is a selective reduction in fast twitch fibers. And that's because it's difficult to activate them unless you're doing high force activities.[0:34:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna activate slow twitch fibers doing almost any activity of daily living. And so they stay around. Fast twitch fibers, unless you're doing something by force or going not be used, and they're not gonna be kept around. And that's a problem because when you look at things like the need for leg strength through aging, the ability to catch yourself from a fall. These things are incredibly important.[0:34:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you don't have fasted fibers, you don't have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time, and you don't have the eccentric strength to stop the fall from happening. And so if you look across in the aging literature, they're they're very clear about the importance of maintaining strength and and fast twitch fibers over time. So We know that this is an important distinction here overall. And people will often talk about, okay, how much of that, is genetically determined? Can I change my fiber type?[0:34:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: And the answer there is is resoundingly yes. And can I change it with exercise? And the answer is absolutely you can. And the next question is, how much? So now, again, we're gonna see an order of magnitude.[0:35:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: In general, without going too far down, an area that maybe we could save for for later, each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage of fast twitch and slow twitch. For example, your calf. If you look at your soleus, which is kind of the smaller one that goes in the back, that's generally mostly slow twitch. Typically, 80% or so slow twitch. The gastroc, which is the other one right next to it.[0:35:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you were to point your toe next to your face and that part that kind of flexes out in the middle, pops out, that's your gastroc. That is almost The inverse. So it's generally 80% fast twitch, maybe 20% slow twitch. Generally, anything anti postural or postural rather anti gravity, spinal erectors. Things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day are going to be slow twitch, and things like your hamstrings which are for explosion are gonna be fast twitch.[0:35:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, we biopsy the quad in these individuals. And in that muscle, it's generally about 5050, fast twitch, slow twitch, as a is a really broad number. Well, one of the things we found was in the non exerciser, it was almost textbook what you would predict. It was about 50% or so slow twitch, a little bit of percentage of fast twitch, and then about 20% of what are these called hybrid fibers, which are a hallmark of that activity. Alright.[0:36:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. In the exerciser, it was about 95% slow twitch. And so it's extremely clear. Again, I don't know if maybe their set point was a little bit higher towards that and the non exerciser D, you know, devolve down to his place or the other one, but it doesn't matter. I mean, you're going from 40% slow twitch in one case to 95% slow twitch in another case.[0:36:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: It shows you that the the the limits of physiological adaptation are darn near boundless given enough exposure. In this case, 35 years of extremely consistent training, and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin with the exact same DNA.[0:37:01] Andrew Huberman: Those are 2 beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality. Has the opposite experiment been done or observed where somebody just weight lifted or just sprinted For a number of years, I don't know that there's a identical twin, control. That's a little[0:37:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: I wish we had a third twin.[0:37:26] Andrew Huberman: Too too much to ask for. Right? Triplets. Okay. So triplets out there, if you're exercising in different ways or people who have triplets, maybe you assign 1 kid to be a runner, 1[0:37:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: kid to[0:37:35] Andrew Huberman: be a weightlifter, and the other one to be sedentary. Please don't do Experiments like that. But the expectation as I understand it would be that the Person that sprints or that does heavy squats, explosive work, would then have more fast twitch muscle fibers in their quad, And their nonexercising counterpart would have fewer. That that would make sense. But what happens if you assess the The endurance level in somebody who's just done strength training or just sprinted.[0:38:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. So we don't have those data specifically. There's we're actually just starting to have studies come out on lifelong strength patterns. And there's actually a very good reason for this, which is a whole story we can get into. But the the quick answer is we don't have a lot of people who've been lifting weights for 30 or plus years.[0:38:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: We have a whole swath of people who've been doing endurance training for that long.[0:38:31] Andrew Huberman: Is that because fewer people have been weight training, or the weight trainers all dead?[0:38:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: You gotta go back to the 1953, 1954. You had 2 major things happen that changed the entire course of exercise physiology and exercise science, and really exercise as we know it. It's important to understand the history of our field. A lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and can't do. As an example, we, questions like momentum.[0:38:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Should I use momentum or or that's cheating, right, or it doesn't work, it compromises my results. It's actually totally untrue. There are excellent reasons when you should use momentum when you lift. There are reasons when you should not. It is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercise repetition, sometimes very slow and controlled is better.[0:39:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: Any question I get in fact, I'm very infamous for always responding with it depends. The reason I say it depends is It depends on the goal. When you're training for speed or power or muscular endurance, the answer to some of these very common question differs. What people fail to realize is they think they're asking the right question because they don't understand this history, what's been planted in your brain subconsciously, is driving that question, and it's not necessarily the right one. So if we walk through that a little bit, you'll see what that field has led you.[0:39:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why you think certain things matter When they actually don't or maybe your assumptions are incorrect, and then exactly what to do about them.[0:39:58] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic, and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens Once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals, and the probiotics are especially important to me.[0:40:28] Andrew Huberman: Athletic greens also contains adaptogens, which are critical for recovering from stress, from exercise, from work, or just general life. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com /huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2. Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim the special offer.[0:40:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in 1953, 1954, you had Roger Bannister Breaking the 4 minute mile, so sub 4 minute file. And then you also had sir Edmund Hillary and then his trip at Norge, summit Everest In the same, basically, 2 year span. That exact same year after that was a formation of what's called the American College of Sports Medicine. Now that is still around today. It is the preeminent group for this exercise as medicine.[0:41:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're interested in things like exercise for obesity prevention, for cancer treatment, For for things like that, it's not really sports medicine. It's more for a clinical exercise. That's the place to go, American College of Sports Medicine. So we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercise and start swimming and cycling and running. And then you have a launch people coming off of the back of the Harvard fatigue lab.[0:41:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the fatigue lab actually shut down in 1947. So you have these people interested in Physical fitness, but nowhere to go. Well, all those people left the Harvard Fatigue Lab and started their own labs at other places. So you've launched the careers of people like, Dave Kostel and and and and John Hlazy, and some of these very famous exercise physiologists. And they start building laboratories, and we start for the first time ever Studying the science of exercise.[0:42:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: So years go by and these people happen. The 19 sixties, the 19 seventies is what we call the runner's boom. So people start If you in fact, if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marathons, it explodes through these 2 decades spans. Right? Because it's like the, We could do these endurance feats.[0:42:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Notice both those feats were endurance. Right? Running short term as well as going over there. No one has thought anything about strength training, And here's why. In the late 18 eighties, there was a very famous, physician named, George Winship, I think was his name, who was a big proponent of strength training.[0:42:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, he died in, like, in the age of 50 something of a heart attack. And that terrified people of strength training for 70 years because they're like, woah. Woah. Woah. That stuff will kill you.[0:42:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because he was a doctor. He was trying he was running around the country doing these exhibitions and reporting it, and then he died.[0:42:52] Andrew Huberman: It's sort of like Atkins 100%. Dying. Although some people say he died of a heart attack, other people said he fell through the ice into cold water. That's debated. But the fact that a a heavy proponent Of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly[0:43:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:43:08] Andrew Huberman: Not good for business.[0:43:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So now the little Storm is brewing. 19 forties, and I'm going back a little bit, but bear with me for a second. There's a guy named, Peter Karpovich, and he's scientists out of Springfield, like the decorated physical education PE, like, that's a legendary place, Springville College. And he is anti strength training for a lot of the same reasons. His entire career talked about note to this.[0:43:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: He's the one that launched these ideas that strength training will make you lose flexibility. It will be bad for kids. Like, all these things that we know now are clearly not true. He's proponent of these things. And there's a show that happened, in his at Springfield College, and a guy named Bob York, and if you York Barbell Mhmm.[0:43:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's still around today. Is going around the country and and putting on his exhibitions. They come to Springfield, and it's sort of like a a new aged, Like social media thing where it's like, the students know what's about to happen. Because Karpovich shows up to this event, and everyone knows he hates strength training. And everyone's like waiting for it to end just to see what he's gonna say.[0:44:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this whole exhibition goes on, and these people are doing now you gotta remember back in the time, like, bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strength, strong man. It's like all The same thing. There's no differentiation yet. And it finishes and Karpovich stands up and, like, the crowd goes silent. And he just asks 1 question.[0:44:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: He just points to one of the guys and says, scratch your back. And now he's just assuming and waiting for the guy to be like, and not be able to put his hand behind his head. And I think he pointed to John Gimmick, who's like a famous bodybuilder, and he reached back and scratched his back. No problem. And then they proceeded to grab 2 dumbbells.[0:44:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think they were 50 pound dumbbells and do a back flip standing back flip with Waltony Chan. They start doing the splits on stage, and they start going performing all kinds of physical function test, and and Karpovitch is stunned. He's like, holy shit. He has nothing to say. He leaves there, and his whole life has changed.[0:45:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: All these things he was claiming We're shown in his face to be false. He does a 1 80 on his career. He starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding immediately There are no detriments to strength training in terms of, like, global health. Right? Of course, you can do it wrong and things like that.[0:45:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, Here comes a whole bunch of benefits. So through the 19 fifties, while this thing's going on with the endurance folks, no one's still strength training Because there's no there's no record to see. There's no American College of Sports Medicine. There's no societies. There's no science.[0:45:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're not sure it's safe. And meanwhile, Karpovich is just hammering study after study after study showing you it's safe, it's safe, it's safe, but it hasn't picked up yet. And then everything changed in 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He came out with a trifold.[0:45:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: He hits you with pumping iron, which I know you know that movie. Right? Pumping[0:45:51] Andrew Huberman: iron? Movie even for those not interested in bodybuilding. It's a very interesting movie because it really gives a window into not just him, but the way in which weight training started to show up As a regular practice, you know, I when I was growing up, the only people who weight trained were people preparing for football.[0:46:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[0:46:09] Andrew Huberman: Bodybuilders who basically didn't exist in the town where I grew up. And the only people who did yoga were, like, yogis doing bikram. But now you drive through any major American city or European city, and there is yoga studios. There's gyms with free weights.[0:46:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:46:26] Andrew Huberman: Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible, I think, for for Initiating that that shift.[0:46:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. He because he hit think about it. He hit us with pumping iron, Conan, and then the Terminator. Almost in back to back, like, very close within years. So you've got this whole cascade of the seventies of people running, cycling, and swimming.[0:46:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now science is starting to come out that it's not dangerous and maybe actually some benefit, and then boom. Not only is it not bad for you, It can make you into a real world superhero. I mean, think about the psychology of a of a child growing up watching somebody like Conan. Think about what Batman looked like in the 19 fifties or sixties. Right?[0:47:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then boom. I can look like that. Now not everyone wants to look like Arnold, but you see, like, you see the power that can land in people. No one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transform like You could maybe be born like that, but no chance. That's within the grasp of all of you.[0:47:22] Andrew Huberman: When I was a kid growing up, one of my favorite books was the Guinness Book of World Records.[0:47:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:47:26] Andrew Huberman: I still have images in my mind of the the, coldest animal, you know, the Yeah. Sure. The longest lifespan, etcetera. You know? And there was a Picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and you know what his record was?[0:47:39] Andrew Huberman: It said perfectly developed man.[0:47:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[0:47:42] Andrew Huberman: Which is, as you point out, that isn't the physique that most though. But it really I it did inspire this this shift. The other thing about resistance training that I think, Has a certain allure for some people, men and women, is that it's one of the few forms of exercise That because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscle that occurs during the training, the so called pump Yep. It gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what your Results will be[0:48:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: 100%. When you[0:48:12] Andrew Huberman: run and you're gasping for air, you don't get this you aren't experiencing what it's like to be faster than you are that day.[0:48:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's correct.[0:48:18] Andrew Huberman: But when you weight train, you get An aesthetic picture into how your functionality and aesthetic will change. It disappears a few hours later Sure. As the the so called pump sub subsides. But it's a very, interesting form of exercise in that way. It's almost as if you go in to learn a language, and during the process of learning for brief moments, you're actually and then it gets taken away.[0:48:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It sort of puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you. Yeah. This is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training might have taken off the way that it did. Yeah.[0:48:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: I mean, it's like if you got paid every hour on the hour when you're working. And then at the end of the day, like, they take the money back, but you still, like as time clock is going on in your day. You're looking up and you're just seeing your while you're watching your bank account grow in real life. Like, you can see why it's so addicting to those folks. So to finish the story here with going back to your actual question to answer it.[0:49:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is happening in the late seventies, early eighties. And so now, Joe Weeter, All these gyms, they're exploding because people wanna look like that. Or if they have they realize they have a chance to change how they physically look. That had never been a reality before.[0:49:18] Andrew Huberman: Mostly men at that point, I'm I'm[0:49:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: guessing exclusively. Mhmm. Yep. For a large number of reasons, cultural acceptance, etcetera. Even with endurance stuff, you could get fitter and run faster, and that's better.[0:49:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it wasn't going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat. Now you can change how you look, which is so incredibly addicting. In fact, there's a a very famous quote. I think it's actually Joe Weider who said, Show me 1 man who wants to be strong, and I'll show you 10 who wanna look strong. Right?[0:49:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's like, that's very, very powerful. Right? There's there's a whole, like, The whole there's tons of this history I can go into, which is sort of explaining to you. But now you're now you're in the the mid eighties, and you have what I call my generation. So So you have my generation who fall in love with strength training in the 18 in the in 19 eighties nineties, but there's really no scientific field for it.[0:50:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not really come about yet. The science of endurance and exercise physiology is now humming along at a massive rate because these people came up in the seventies and eighties, and they're 5, 10, 15 years in their career, they're producing. They're gen they're generating graduate students. They're starting their own labs, and exercise physiology still to this day is 80% endurance. Steady state stuff almost exclusively.[0:50:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, now, Mike, my generation, you love, you love sports. You love lifting. You all have all these things. And now what we see happen is the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training.[0:50:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, that's in that's on TV. He's on sports center in the mid 19 nineties lifting weights. And we go back actually to the late 19 seventies, and I'm I'm not sure if you're a football fan. But any football fan will recognize the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 19 seventies and eighties Change how football's played? Well, the reason is because they started strength training, and they started doing it with a guy named Boyd Upley, who is the founder of the NSCA.[0:50:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the National Strength Conditioning Association is formed in the late 19 seventies as well. So just like ACSM was developed the year after those 2 events happened, 1978, the year after Arnold comes out, boom, NSCA is formed, and now you have a scientific organization dedicated to strength and conditioning. You've got NFL strength conditioning coaches that are starting to come on board. You've got scientists that are starting to come into laps, and strength additionally becomes a scientific field. Well, everything swings now from an exercise perspective into bodybuilding.[0:51:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so almost all of the things, in fact, we were Sort of talking before, I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you, and I could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things that you think are absolute standards or guaranteed about training. I'm supposed to do this. I'm never supposed to do that. For instance. For instance, is it okay to train a muscle group On back to back days, most people are at home thinking, no.[0:51:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're not supposed to train a muscle group.[0:51:54] Andrew Huberman: It needs to recover.[0:51:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that's total nonsense. Right? Other things like Body parts split training. Right? Training 1 muscle group per day.[0:52:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Other things like cardio, endurance training influencing, will it ruin my gains from my left? All of these things are on at a, base of assumptions that come from bodybuilding. Now that's a fantastic world, but because everything started in the 8 19 seventies as bodybuilding, in terms of, basically, strength training was that. Weightlifting and powerlifting were not at all around. Right?[0:52:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: They were, but nobody cared. Again, show me someone who wants to be strong. I'll show you 10 who wanna look strong. The physique thing just dominated, and we're we're not getting out of that yet. We're not all the way out of it.[0:52:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're starting to though because here's why. People started to realize This this bodybuilding thing is fantastic. I can change my physique. I'm getting better. But, damn, these workouts take an hour and a half, 2 hours.[0:52:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I'm gonna spend that whole time on 1 or 2 body parts, which means I'm gonna have to live 6 days a week. And I'm gonna have to do that consistently. Right. Now all of a sudden, boom, 2 hours on my on my elbow flexors. Damn.[0:53:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: My elbow is starting to hurt.[0:53:05] Andrew Huberman: And yet, my understanding is that It doesn't really require 2 hours a day Not at all. Training in order to get benefits even just for hypertrophy.[0:53:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. But but, a lot of the times you're gonna have to get some amount of time in because you're spending so much isolation. So we've gone away from training movement, Running is a movement. Cycling is a movement. Training my biceps is a muscle or muscle group.[0:53:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Training my hamstrings are a muscle group. That's not a human movement. So we've done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises from movement based prescription to now muscle group based training. So when you're isolating muscle groups, that means a whole chunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day. So what happens if you're doing, say, legs on Monday, And you miss Monday because you're on a flight.[0:53:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now your legs have to wait a whole another week. Right? That's there's solution to that, but this has just become problematic. People start getting beat ups. People start realizing, I actually don't feel that great.[0:54:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm not super fit. I'm sweating just walking up the stairs. I'm out of breath. Why? Because all that training, you've done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness.[0:54:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: You've done nothing to improve, heart rate, oxygenation, blood flow. And so that paradigm swing way too hard into the exercising, especially lifting weights, is single joint, Often machine, often slow, often high volume isolation stuff. And that left a giant opening of people going, wait a minute. What if you could get in the gym? I could promise you the same or better results in under 30 minutes.[0:54:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: And in fact, you also feel better. You'll lose more weight. And that opened up group exercise classes, kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type of stuff, circuit training. Because you can come in, You won't get so beat up because the volume's lower. The time is much lower.[0:54:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: You get multiple adaptations at the same time. Great. The problem with that though, fast forward 10 years, is it started burying people because you've now deemphasized movement quality, And you've overemphasized scores. Right? So this is a classic example.[0:55:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you go and you watch pumping iron, you'll see or anybody go you'll see if they're doing a bicep curl. They don't even really pay attention to the rep range. They don't really pay attention to the load. They are looking at their muscle. They're trying to figure out how do I get that thing to fire.[0:55:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're squeezing, they're flexing, they're posing. At the end of every set, they're trying to figure out, am I getting enough pump? It is exclusively founded on exercise quality. The rep brains the numbers almost irrelevant. When you go to the other model, exercise technique, it doesn't matter.[0:55:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just get the most amount of weight up or the amount of reps or the fastest time, etcetera, etcetera. High intensity.[0:55:43] Andrew Huberman: CrossFit. I've walked past some CrossFit series. I've done 2 CrossFit[0:55:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: courses. So you said it's CrossFit. I didn't.[0:55:48] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I don't know. I I enjoyed them. I definitely, felt like I was working hard. I Oh, you were? I observed a lot of people in very close proximity, doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping, that's where you kick your legs, folks say, you know, sort of like bucking and, kipping type pull ups.[0:56:04] Andrew Huberman: No. I I enjoyed it. It wasn't for me for the long term, but it did seem that there was, a lot of ballistic movement in close proximity to other people. So the hazard to me seemed more about that than the actual movement.[0:56:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, again, the the point I'm setting up here is that was actually a really brilliant solution for a lot of the problems the classic bodybuilding hypertrophy introduced. So it got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements, which are more effective, generally better. It got people doing things fast and explosive. That's more athletic. That is more important for longevity.[0:56:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: It solved a lot of the problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. The issue they went with Is they just push the pace on score rather than quality. They push the pace on how many people can be in here at the same time. So now you're doing higher risk movements, Higher intensity, higher fatigue, and with a total not that they don't care about technique, but it's not the thing that they're most concerned about.[0:57:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's getting the number and the thing done. They solve the time issue though. You can get tremendous results in 3 days a week under 45 minutes each session, etcetera. Burn people out though way too much high intensity way too often, and the other problem, safety concerns, all kinds of orthopedic issues, and other stuff.[0:57:21] Andrew Huberman: Can I, interrupt you for a moment and just ask a question as we go through this arc of the history of why endurance training predominated or Strength training or bodybuilding type training or CrossFit type training, because I think this is fascinating? I know we're about to arrive at where we are today[0:57:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:57:37] Andrew Huberman: And what the future looks like for for people and what they should focus on and do. At what point, if any, do you think resistance training started to become adopted by Women. You know, there was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger. There was, Linda Hamilton in the Terminator.[0:57:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:57:56] Andrew Huberman: There are some impressive, physiques, certainly, on female actresses and, athletes. Mhmm. The Williams sisters, you know, very impressive, musculature and physics, and, of course, their tennis playing speaks for itself. Has that happened yet? I mean, what I mean is, Do you think since you work with both men and women Yep.[0:58:19] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that most women understand that weight training, Done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them, maybe even especially for them in terms of, offsetting bone density loss and things of that sort. Are we still waiting for the the, popular, stimulus for getting, you know, 80% of of young women thinking, I wanna Lift weights.[0:58:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Hard for me to answer because I'm not, like, I'm not a woman. Right? Now I have a daughter. She's 4, so we'll we'll see.[0:58:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: What I can say is is I've probably worked with I don't know how many professional athletes in total. A lot. I've worked with them probably 14 professional sports. I've worked with, Cy Young winners, MVPs, like the whole all all the credentials. Right?[0:59:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: I bet 35, 40% of the athletes I've worked with are female. So I've worked with Olympic gold medalist. I've worked with bronze medalist. In in multiple sports, I've worked With, the most decorated power lifter, you know, of all time. So in a number of these areas, fighters, world championship, all these things.[0:59:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: For me, I I feel like that verse has already happened. My students. If you look at my classroom, don't know what the numbers are, but there is no small number of females in exercise science and exercise physiology. If you look at our laboratories, that's one thing you will see. There are very few female Exercise scientists.[0:59:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: There are very few, female strength conditioning coaches, but that number is is is coming down at a at a Astronomical rate. You you have, people that are being hired, in every sport. You you pick the NFL, you pick Major League Baseball. Every every few months, we're hearing 1st female hired for this, 1st female hired for that. The Yankees, Rachel Rachel Belkovich, fantastic.[1:00:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: You know yeah.[1:00:06] Andrew Huberman: She's Rachel's been out to my lab. She's terrific.[1:00:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's she's fantastic. I mean, she's now being hired as, I think she's a hitting coach now, Actual sport coach.[1:00:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: She she's gonna be a jam. Like, this is her goal. She's a terminator. So that that's already happening, and my students that are coming through our Program are getting placed in these roles. They haven't gotten through yet a lot in terms of being an actual scientist, but they're getting there.[1:00:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sports scientists in the NBA ring hired females in terms like big data collection. Sports science and tech will cover, you know, in another discussion. But I think it's happening whether or not the the cultural and social I can't speak to that end of the equation. What I can speak to though is, one of the things I think is is most fun coming forward scientifically is, you know, a number of years ago, NIA came back late, Came through with their mandates of saying it's no longer acceptable to exclude women from scientific research. Right?[1:01:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because we just did that for decades.[1:01:02] Andrew Huberman: Well, what happened, just to fill this in because I think it's worth noting is that for many years, studies even on rodents[1:01:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:01:11] Andrew Huberman: We're mainly carried out on male rodents because the assumption and the assumption turned out to be wrong, but the assumption was that The physiology of female rodents because they don't have a menstrual cycle. It's not 28 days. They have an estrous cycle. It's 4 days. They were, different type of cycle.[1:01:27] Andrew Huberman: That that would somehow disrupt the data. Turns out that's entirely wrong. Now it's actually required. When you sit on a grant study panel, which are the people that evaluate grants, you they ask. They literally say, Did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable?[1:01:42] Andrew Huberman: Here, we're not talking about sex as the verb. We're talking about sex as, biological sex. And, if you don't say yes, that's a strong hit against the grant. And if you you say yes, then it checks off that box. So it's now required The both male and female rodents and humans be studied in a given study unless the study is specifically geared toward understanding that only exists in one, Yeah.[1:02:02] Andrew Huberman: One or the other population,[1:02:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: such as studies.[1:02:04] Andrew Huberman: Menopause, for instance. Yeah. Menstrual cycle, andropause, for instance.[1:02:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:02:09] Andrew Huberman: But, now this is extremely important. I'm excited to hear that,[1:02:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: So where where I was gonna go with that is actually so that was step 1, Which is cool. You gotta include them. What we haven't gotten to yet, but I I've seen more and more grant applications come through for this. It's just the funding hasn't hit yet, which is It's one thing to in to let women be in the same studies. That's great.[1:02:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's another thing though to start performing high performance research, Specifically for female questions. That has not happened yet, and that's just like a funding issue. Right? We haven't gotten money. People aren't aren't supporting that.[1:02:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: We don't get a lot of financial support for sport science, But we can't track down the money out of something go me going, I wanna do a study in female athletes. So it answers female athlete questions. These won't help men. These are questions specific to the female. That's the next step.[1:02:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? That's where we gotta get to so we can say, maybe we should do things differently, around training and recovery or or we shouldn't or it doesn't matter. There there's some there's a handful of not lower quality, but like some studies. I don't love them yet. There just needs to be a ton of work.[1:03:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Birth control is a very good example. Right? The the information for women at female athletes or even just like hard exercises. You don't have to be a competitive athlete. Around what is birth control doing?[1:03:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: What types? How should I manage that? What conversations should I be having with my doctor? Almost nothing. Like, women have nothing to go on for high performance stuff.[1:03:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what if I'm trying to compete in an event or or run a race? How like, all those types of questions should be answered. Normative value, normative data, performance Testing. Like, it's just not there on the female. So that's an area I I think, like, if somebody really wanted to make a change that the scientists wanna do it.[1:03:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: I know. I I've talked to so many in our field that We'd really love to explore it, because it's getting there. The, the the like I said, the coaching side is getting there. They're seeing it. They're hiring these people.[1:03:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm seeing it in my students.[1:04:03] Andrew Huberman: You know, my my[1:04:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: followings is not all men. Like, it's a very large percentage of females, and all I do is post about exercise science. You know, like, this is all I do.[1:04:10] Andrew Huberman: So Well, this podcast is, very we know very clearly the audience, is 50% women, 50% men[1:04:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's right.[1:04:17] Andrew Huberman: Which is great.[1:04:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: So just to jump back on our history discussion and to finish that point of where we're at now and where I think we're going to go or should go. So we walk through The bodybuilding kinda running everything and people walking into a gym anytime they lift weights, they're they're making all their choices based on the assumption that maximizing muscle size is the goal. And clearly, that's not the case. There are other adaptations you may be after. So we talked about how that had problems, then we talked about how some of these Other forms of exercise fill those gaps, and then what problems those things introduce.[1:04:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, I think we're actually at a point where that pendulum is kinda Slowly shifting into the middle. What I mean by that is, if you wanna maximize muscle strength, we look towards the power lifting community. If you wanna maximize muscle power, we're gonna look to the weightlifting community. If you wanna look for muscular endurance or well roundedness, maybe we look into the CrossFit communities and some of these obstacle course races or functionality things. So what we can do now is generate protocols that get us the exact adaptations we want And not ones we don't want, because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and choose Optimal protocols are combinations for them.[1:05:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: So somebody simply wants to get healthy, like we talked about when we listed the 9 adaptations, and I mentioned health wasn't one of them. That's because what determines your health versus what determines my optimal health differs. So if I need more hypertrophy, I can look towards bodybuilding concepts. But if I have enough Or maybe for personal reasons, I decide I have too much or I don't wanna add anymore. Then I can say, hey.[1:05:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: How can I get stronger without getting bigger? And boom, I look towards power lifting concepts. How can I get more powerful? How can I get faster? But I don't, you know, again, wanna lose fat.[1:06:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great. Or if I want changes. So we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from, that have expertise in specific adaptations, and develop ourselves perfect protocols, based on that information.[1:06:15] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health and well-being Can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy.[1:06:52] Andrew Huberman: They have a personalized platform that lets you see What your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels Into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So with the understanding in mind as to how we all, myself included, arrived at Such lopsided fitness, too much endurance, not enough strength, too much strength, not enough endurance. It's really hard to imagine anyone's perfect in this regard.[1:07:34] Andrew Huberman: Can you walk us through the 9 different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us a way to assess Our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those 9.[1:07:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. The very first one we wanna talk about is is movement skill. Now Set aside sport specific, so I'm not gonna give you an assessment for optimal golf technique swing. Is this really about human movements so that you stay injury free, And you can continue to train for as long as possible. So what are the minimum requirements?[1:08:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now if you can have access to a highly qualified physical therapist or movement specialist, That's the best route. Right? Go to them, have them, identify all of your movement patterns, overhead pressing, squatting, Running, all these things, that's your gold standard. If you wanna do it yourself though, here's a very simple 4 step solution. So the way that I it teaches is I go joint by joint.[1:08:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so I I think of this just as the major ones. Your shoulder, your elbow, your low back, hip, knee, and ankle. Okay. Now what you can do is do a representative movement for you. So if you bench a lot, use the bench.[1:08:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you do pull ups, use a pull up. If you squat, do that. I would recommend doing an upper body press, an upper body pull, A lower body press and lower body pull. An example would be a push up, a pull up or a bent row, a squat, and then a dead lift. That would be a very, very well rounded approach.[1:09:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: What you're going to do is do that movement, and I and I would record it for yourself And and record a frontal view and a side view. Probably do 3 to 10 repetitions per angle. Okay? Slow and uncontrolled. You don't need any body weight.[1:09:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: What you wanna do is move, and you wanna look for 4 key things at every joint. Alright. So I can imagine I'm doing a squat. I'm gonna do a squat, and I'm gonna focus on just my ankle. And I'm gonna look for these 4 things of the ankle.[1:09:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then in I'm gonna go back and watch my knee and look for the same 4 things, the knee, to the hip, etcetera. Alright? So what are these 4 things? Number 1 is you wanna look for symmetry. So symmetry is front to back, left to right, and, your right limb and your left limb.[1:09:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright? And so what we wanna look for are, if they aren't moving perfectly, that's fine. But you wanna see is 1 moving further ahead than the other one. Is 1, turning to the side, one's not. Is 1 fidgeting and And twitching around differently.[1:09:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wanna look just to check to see and make sure that they're stable. That's 1. Number 2, you wanna look for stability. So key indicators here are things like if you're if you can't control a a squat, a controlled squat where your knees don't start shaking. Like, that would be an instability issue.[1:10:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: So can you do the movement slow? Can you pause at the bottom? Maybe 3 seconds, maybe 5 seconds or 10. You should have complete control of that movement and all of these joints. Are your hips sliding to one side when you stand up?[1:10:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is 1 elbow Closer to your body when you're benching, and the other one's more flared out. These are the things I'm talking about. Right? I'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not. You're simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities.[1:10:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. So again, as you're pushing up, does 1 elbow start flipping and twitching and going all over the place? The third one is what I call awareness. So, there are a lot of movement technique issues that are simply people don't know. And so you'll watch them squat.[1:10:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: I do this in my classes all the time. I'll have a 100 kids out there squatting, and you'll see some horrible squat technique. And then when you just tell them, Hey. Did you realize your heels were supposed to be on the ground at all times when you squat? Like, oh, okay.[1:11:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: And they can correct it. It's not actually a movement flaw. It was just simply an awareness. I didn't know, then I actually didn't realize that that was happening in that position. So we want all of our joints to be going through a general full range of motion, which is number 4.[1:11:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the ankles, during like a squat. Your knee should be able to go as far over your toes possible while maintaining good position, your feet flat on the floor, your, You know, 3 points of contact, your whole foot foot, and you're not compromising another joint. So that's all you're going to look for, those 4 things, symmetry, Stability, awareness, and range of motion through each joint, through each movement. It sounds Difficult and time consuming, it's really not. Right?[1:11:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can generally kinda clear these things in 1 or 2 repetitions in a couple of seconds. And what you're really going to look for, there's lots of Scoring schemes, you can, you know, test that your physical therapist will sort you. I just look for absolutely terrible, I can't do it at all, minor flaw, or pretty close to good. That that's really all I'm looking for. So my scoring system is 0130 is like you're not going to do this exercise because you're at a very high acute risk.[1:12:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: You might get hurt on rep 1 tomorrow. Number 1, like a score of 1 is, there's a minor flaw here. We can probably do it, but we need to be cautious of load and volume. The other one is maybe it's perfect, maybe it's not, but Go ahead and sort of do it on a reasonable protocol, you'll be fine. So that's generally, what you would need to do is a cost free method of identifying good movement technique Within any of the things that that you[1:12:37] Andrew Huberman: would do. What about speed?[1:12:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually don't think this is one most people should test. If you're a high performance athlete, we can run a 40 yard dash or we can do, some different things with a velocity transducer on a barbell, if you're a weightlifter or something. For most people, pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration or kind of the 2 ways we break it down. It's not it's just generally not that necessary to test.[1:13:02] Andrew Huberman: What about number 3, power, which I believe before you told me was speed times force.[1:13:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the reason why I don't worry too much about Speed is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test, and a power test is easier to do, as well as easier to train for for most people. So The the cost free version here is a simple broad jump. So this is stand, with, you know, normal position, Jump out as far in front of you as you possibly can and measure the distance between where you started and the back of your heel where it lands. A Super basic number to look for there is your height. So you should be able to broad jump how tall you are.[1:13:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're 5 foot 5, you should hit 5 foot 5, 6 foot 5, etcetera. It's not perfect. That's gonna ratchet down a little bit about 15% for females. They just simply don't have the power in general That men have, and so you're gonna wanna bring that down a little bit. But that's a it's a very crude number.[1:13:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you were to look at, like, a high performance NFL player, If they're 6 feet tall, they're gonna be jumping like 9 to 10 to 11 feet. If you can jump your body height, we're not looking for optimization in this particular test. You are looking for red flags. If you can jump your body height, you're gonna be just fine.[1:14:13] Andrew Huberman: That's incredibly straightforward, and yet I have 1 question. Yeah. I'm assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to before I jump. I can swing my arms from back to front as Harder with as much momentum, as I can muster. And when I land, you said I'm gonna take the measure from where the back My heels.[1:14:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: You wanna measure the distance you actually covered. So to clarify, there's no running approach here. There's no, steps into it. You're gonna stand Still, yeah, you can swing, bounce as much as you'd like to do. You're gonna projectile off.[1:14:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're gonna measure the distance from the tip of your toe. So, basically, stand behind the line, And then the furthest point back where you land. So basically, the worst possible score, not the best possible, because your feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably gonna be a little bit farther. Now, technically, if you fall backwards and your hand touches the ground, we mark that number.[1:15:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: But in this case, Just use the furthest point back of your back heel and go from there.[1:15:10] Andrew Huberman: I'll be drawing it tomorrow morning.[1:15:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now if you have Access to a little bit more technology or you just really wanna know a better number. A a classic vertical jump, is is a good starting place. You can actually do this in a simple cost free way. You can just measure 2 of your hands, put them together so that both of your, middle fingers are touching. Overlap them and put them directly over your head.[1:15:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: K? And then you kinda wanna reach up as high as you can get, and you mark that on the wall. My brother and I used to do this all the time. We would take a highlighter. The the yellow ones and color as much as we can on our fingertips touch the wall so that the highlighter would stay in the wall.[1:15:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you'd actually go back to my house and from my childhood, you'll see these markers all over our our house.[1:15:51] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure her parents were thrilled.[1:15:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. My dad didn't care. Single that he didn't care. It's just like whatever you guys do whatever you want. So you wanna measure that.[1:15:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then, of course, you're gonna jump with those 2 hands and touch As high as you can up, and you're gonna measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual height that you jump there. Now the reason you're doing it 2 handed, by the way, is Because if you do one handed, you can actually reach pretty high by offsetting your shoulders. And now you're getting into differences of, you know, who has more shoulder mobility? Who has ability to kinda get up there? A 2 foot stand or a 2 handed standard approach is there, same thing.[1:16:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: No running approach here. You can dip, you can drive, you can and do all those things. You can swing your arms, but you're gonna be a 2 handed touch is a is a general way to do that. And you wanna look for a number of something like 24 inches or higher. If you're past the age of 50, that number can come down a little bit to closer to 20.[1:16:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: And again, for females, it's gonna be ratcheted down about 15% everywhere you want to go. If you're a a middle aged female, and you're jumping 20 inches, You're you're in a pretty good spot. You're gonna be looking really nice there. So now if you can do that on a force plate, that's even better. So these are very, basically, scales that will go out to multiple digits, sometimes 5 to 9 digits past 0.[1:17:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: And you're gonna stand on these things, you do the exact same test. These are very interesting because they'll tell you not only how high you jump, but they'll tell you how much force you put in the ground. They can also tell you how long it took you, and this is called your rate of force development, As well as impulse and speed and a bunch of other stuff, which are are important to help you understand where on the power spectrum You need to be. So you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell. So a very classic thing to do would be, let's say you're gonna do a squat, and you're gonna put this, device on the barbell.[1:17:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: And you and that's gonna measure the speed which the barbell moves. And you're gonna do that at 40% of your 1 repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70, 89, new up to 100. And that allows you to create what's called a force velocity curve. And you can start to see at what point when you start loading things heavy, do you start slowing down too much? And that'll tell you what part of the force velocity curve that you wanna train to optimize your power.[1:18:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why that's important? A lot of people will do things like when I'm training for power, how heavy should I lift? Well, the general answer people say is 30% of your one rep max, but that's actually not true at all. What's most optimal for power development, which we'll discuss more much later, is depending on where your flawed in the force velocity curve. So if you have access to technology like that, that can give you a lot more insight and information.[1:18:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: If not, do the broad jump test Or the highlighter on your fingertips and jump and touch the wall test.[1:18:33] Andrew Huberman: At Andy Yalpin's house.[1:18:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Hey. Just you know what? Come along. There's already The walls are already messed up. Just go ahead and come up to Washington, and we'll do it.[1:18:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fantastic.[1:18:43] Andrew Huberman: What about strength?[1:18:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So strength is really important. You need to measure this in a in multiple areas, and we'll start off with grip strength. Okay. So you can do this in 2 ways.[1:18:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can buy a hand grip dynamometer. Now these are anywhere between 20 to $100 anywhere. This is actually used to be, Like, when I was in school, like, 100 of dollars. And now you can literally buy them on any website for $25. So my last recommendation is technically that's not cost free.[1:19:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: I know your whole thing about the cost free protocols, but $25. I'm calling that basically cost free. You can bring that in a Tesla, and that's just a little device you're gonna squeeze and you're gonna do and I would do your right hand and your left hand. You wanna look for asymmetries there. But you wanna look for something like Typically, those are they're gonna give you a value in kilograms.[1:19:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: And, you wanna look for something like a minimum score here of 40 kilograms. Ideally, you're up past 60 would be a really good spot to be in. You wanna make sure that there's no less than 10% variation between your left and right hand. Your your nondominant hand actually shouldn't be that much weaker in this test. So what you'll actually see a lot of times is the nondominant can be oftentimes stronger, because the dominant hand is more for movement precision, writing, things like that.[1:19:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you want them to be close. If you are a male and you under 40 kilograms on a hand grip dynamometer. Like, we're we're gonna need to train that. If you're a female, it's not that much lower, but about 35 Kilograms is the cutoff point. If you're above 55, we can add it to your training, but I'm not worried about leaving it out of your training.[1:20:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're a female, if it's above 50, that's Maya sort of cut off of where we wanna go. So that's a fairly cheap one. Another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang. So you can hold on to any bar. Ideally, one that is Thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it.[1:20:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you don't wanna be using a a giant fat grip. You're gonna have a false reading here. So something like Going to the gym and jumping on any pull up bar or or pull up rack, and you wanna hang. And this is a simple time test. So In general, we we should be able to hang for a minimum of 30 seconds is what we're what we're looking for.[1:20:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: 30 to kinda 50 seconds is my, like, Good, but we could probably get better here. If you're cruising above 60 seconds, I'm generally pretty happy. This is actually a good example of when females tend to be better. Grip strength in women is tends to be strong, and they can hang for quite a long time. So, those those standards don't really change that much, for women.[1:21:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now if you are exceptionally large, this thing doesn't scale perfectly. You know? If you're 240 pounds and even if you're lean, it's just hard The to hang and hold 240 pounds. Conversely, if you're a 145 5 pounds, even if you're unhealthy, you're gonna be able to hang for a long time. It's just not that much weight to carry.[1:21:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: So Just rough numbers to start off with. So that's grip strength.[1:21:32] Andrew Huberman: What about strength elsewhere in the body?[1:21:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: The primary ones, you you can do an upper body strength test if you would like, although it's not technically something we do very often. Happy to do it. 1 or max bench press or something like that. That's great. The more what I'm generally more interested in is a leg extension test.[1:21:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: And the reason I like this is a back squat is better. A barbell back squat is, Look. That's my, like, that's my jam. That's my life. Right?[1:21:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's just very technically demanding, and it it's challenging. You need spotters. You need comfort. A lot goes into this. For so for the average person, a leg extension test is fairly standardized.[1:22:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't have to worry about technique, and people can just get into it and go. And so what you wanna look for there is is, a couple of standards you wanna hit. Again, a very simple answer here is body weight. You do a leg extension with your body weight?[1:22:22] Andrew Huberman: How 1 repetition?[1:22:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: One repetition.[1:22:24] Andrew Huberman: I can answer that right now.[1:22:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Can you?[1:22:26] Andrew Huberman: No. You can't? No. I can hack squat a reasonable amount of weight, but, I was on the leg extension this morning, and I it was a Nautilus machine, and I certainly could not Like, extension my body weight.[1:22:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Let me let me clear up for you. Were you doing a single leg? No. So bilateral, you can't like extension your body weight?[1:22:43] Andrew Huberman: No. But certainly can hamstring curl my body weight.[1:22:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, okay. So we maybe have some, deficiencies in our quads that we need to go after. But that that's a pretty good number you wanna be at. If you go up an age past age 40, every decade, that can come down about 10%, And you'll still be in a pretty good slot. So if you're 50 years old and you're a £170, if you can do 160, you're in a pretty good sort of spot.[1:23:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then you could just, again, take it down about 10% every decade after 40. But prior to 40, there's really no change in strength. Leg extension their body weight.[1:23:21] Andrew Huberman: Noted. I look forward to our discussion a bit later, talking about how to build strength.[1:23:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Any of these strength tests, they don't have to be done to a technical true one rep max. You can use what are called repetition, conversion equation. So put on a load that you think is kind of close to your maximum, and just do it for as many reps as you can. As long as it's under 5 reps total, you can then actually go online and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere, and it will tell you, okay.[1:23:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: You did Three repetitions at £200. Your 1 rep max is probably 215 or whatever. So there's estimate equations. So If you don't wanna spend the time or you're not truly comfortable, like, absolutely going to your true one rep max, just get to a a number that's fairly close And do as many as you can, and then go online. Again, 1 rep max estimator equations are everywhere.[1:24:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you get past 5 repetitions or so, The accuracy of those equations starts going down. So don't put on something and go ahead 12 reps of it, and then try to figure out what your one REMAX. It'll get close. You start moving past that, you're just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy. So I wanna make sure whether you're doing the leg extension test or a front squat test, you don't technically have to do an absolute One rep max.[1:24:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: If neither of those are an option, another one I like a lot here is simply a front squat or goblet squat hold. So you're gonna hold a weight in front of your chest whether a kettlebell is is great here, a dumbbell is fine here. And you wanna hold about half of your body weight. Go all the way to the bottom position and try to hold that for about 45 seconds. So it's it's a pretty good indicator of, Number 1, your position.[1:25:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low back stability. So it's a very different indicator, then say the leg extension test, but it's it's a really nice one. So it doesn't require many moving parts. It's more difficult than leg extension, but it's It's quite a bit more functional, and it's gonna give you insight into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps.[1:25:20] Andrew Huberman: So 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat Yep. And then returning to a standing position.[1:25:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. And if you can't do the return, I actually I'm not that worried. But as long as you can hold that good position without a technical breakdown that 45 seconds, that's a really good spot. As an intro, I want a third of your body weight for 30 seconds.[1:25:40] Andrew Huberman: Terrific. I plan to attempt all of those strength tests Very soon. What about hypertrophy?[1:25:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. Actually, before we get into that, I wanna jump back really quickly. It's important to add a couple of caveats to the strength training stuff. So there's 2 that I wanna do. Number 1, these are assuming you are technically proficient.[1:25:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I don't want you to do any exercise to exhaustion Or to maximum strength if you're not comfortable with your technique. So adjust these accordingly. If you're not comfortable with the front do the leg extension. If you're not uncomfortable with that, do something different. So we never want to utilize maximum testing if it's gonna come with a consequence of of serious acute injury.[1:26:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's the most important flag. The second one is your warm up protocol will have a huge Effect on your actual results. And so whenever you do these tests, especially if you're gonna do a test and then a test again down the line, you wanna make sure that that warm up protocol is standardized. Now again, the NSCA, and I can we can I can give you resources, has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm up protocol prior to 1 REMAX testing? We can go there and you can look that stuff up.[1:26:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: We can add that to show notes or something.[1:26:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I think, when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general, If we could touch into the, the best warm up protocol. I know I have mine, and I'm I'm certain it's gonna be suboptimal based on everything. Maybe[1:27:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: that's called the problem.[1:27:04] Andrew Huberman: Conversation we've ever had where I learned the things I'm doing incorrectly, but I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me.[1:27:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not incorrectly so much as it is, like, suboptimal.[1:27:13] Andrew Huberman: That's a very kind way of telling me it's incorrect. Thank you. What about hypertrophy? So the thing[1:27:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: you wanna pay attention to here is You have the aesthetic, portion of hypertrophy. That's entirely up to you. There is no rationale. You can decide what you feel like looks good or doesn't look good. That's irrelevant.[1:27:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: There is a sufficient amount you need to have where below that is detrimental to your health regardless of your outcomes. And so the best way to do this is a couple of ways. Any sort of body composition test can do this. So whether this is a, a scan, like a DEXA scan, which is a gold standard, Or other, ways of biological, biological impedance or otherwise. So there's a ton of different tests you can get that are pretty close.[1:27:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. So What you wanna pay attention to when you get like a DEXIS scan is a number called FFMI. And so that stands for fat free mass index. So you can look at again any number of online calculators. These are all standard.[1:28:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it doesn't actually matter where you pull them up. You don't have to worry about looking it up and whether or not it's right or not or something. And so that's gonna actually tell you if you have sufficient muscle math. And so a number you wanna look for, in general is something like if you're a man, your FFMI should be something like Twenty or higher. If you're a woman, you wanna look for something like 18.[1:28:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that those are the targets. If you get past, like, 24, 25 for a man, That's a lot of muscle mass assuming you're reasonably lean. Now if your FFMI is, like, 24, 25, but your body fat is, like, 40%, You're actually just a very, very large individual. You're not, like, you're not in a gray spot. So when we say these sort of numbers, it's the assumption that you're probably sub 30% Body fat, for a man in sub 35 for a woman.[1:28:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So those the numbers, there are online calculators. All you really need to know is your total body weight, Your body fat percentage and then your height. You can enter those three numbers, and then they'll tell you your FFMI score, and it'll correct for an adjusted value. And most of those will actually tell you the grading rubric. And then it's a good, average, bad, etcetera.[1:29:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: But those are the numbers we look at. If you are as a man Sub 17. As a woman's sub 15, now we're in an area of of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle. And some of our later discussions will talk about why that matters.[1:29:32] Andrew Huberman: So that's not, sub 17% body fat. This is specifically the FFMLI.[1:29:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's correct. Yep.[1:29:38] Andrew Huberman: What about muscular endurance? Is this where you're gonna tell me I need to do wall sits?[1:29:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is really nice. You can do any number of tests here. A a standard plank is a good testament of the of muscular endurance. So can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds? Can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds?[1:29:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Pretty easy. If you're able to do a push up. So if you can't, that sort of tells you, Lon, it's actually interesting. If you can't do a single push up, that's not a muscular endurance issue. That's actually now a strength issue because that's a one rep max problem.[1:30:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we want to be able to do again, for a general male, we should have no problem doing 25 plus consecutive push ups.[1:30:19] Andrew Huberman: I apologize for interrupting you, but as long as we're talking about push ups You just mentioned form. Are we talking chest touching the ground, elbows breaking right angles? What is a proper push up according to Your laboratory.[1:30:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Unless you have a very specific reason to limit range of motion, I want all my testing done through a full joint range of motion. This is different for the person. So it's individualized to them. But in general, for a push up, this would be a full complete lockout of the elbows on the top And a full chest touch or close to it at the ground. You can do it different.[1:30:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: It doesn't really matter, but just keep a standard from your pretest, your posttest if you're trying to mark progress. Okay. But for us, unless we have a very specific reason, we're going full range of motion for all of these tests.[1:31:04] Andrew Huberman: So 25 Push ups[1:31:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: for a male is is a standard, and even something like 10 is a number we're looking for. Again, it's kinda minimum categories, for an upper body muscular endurance.[1:31:16] Andrew Huberman: And not to get too down in the weeds, but, I have observed other people, of course, never myself. No. I'm kidding. But Observe other people pausing at, maybe at repetition 15, catching their breath and then continuing, or you, say continue like a like a like a[1:31:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: That would be a failed test.[1:31:32] Andrew Huberman: So no pauses. Correct. Just up, down, up, down, and trying to hit at least 10, but ideally 25 or[1:31:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: I learned this lesson in one of our studies, probably 9 years ago. Well, we didn't clarify that, and so we actually had an individual. He wasn't there's no he wasn't being nefarious. He just figured out, If I do a couple, take a quick break and do a cup he, like, quadrupled his post test results from his pretest result Because he figured out that little hack in there. So you wanna standardize it.[1:32:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not that I'm against or have some sort of strong belief. It's just Trying to keep protocol standardized, and which means any break, failed test.[1:32:08] Andrew Huberman: So 10 to 25 push ups minimum for males. About for females?[1:32:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'll clarify. If it's sub ten for a man, that's again in your, like, very severe red flag problem. We really, really like to see a number above 25. Okay. That that's where we're ranking.[1:32:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Anything between 10 and 25 is, like, yeah, but not severe.[1:32:30] Andrew Huberman: It means they have work to do.[1:32:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: We have work to do.[1:32:32] Andrew Huberman: And for and for females?[1:32:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: For a female, you're gonna scale that sort of back. So a female, the answer could be as little as 0. Right? So you're gonna see that. Can you do a full, position.[1:32:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: If they're in that position, we're generally not going to do a muscular endurance test from the knees. We we already know the answer is ears here. We'll actually default to another test, which I'll talk about in a second here. So for those those folks, any that's gonna scale down a little bit. Right?[1:32:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: So basically, you're looking 15 is that marker, like 25 was for the male, where I wanna see above 15. And if I do, we're good. Anything between 5 to 15 is a number of, like, okay. If you're sub 5, like, we we generally have some problems. And if that is different between 1 and 0, then, Like, now we 0 is is is a problem, so we should be able to do that.[1:33:17] Andrew Huberman: So if a female cannot do 10 full push ups.[1:33:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Ten foot push ups is hard for a female depending on size.[1:33:26] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Let's say a female can't do 5 full push ups. You said rather than go to a knees down version[1:33:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:33:32] Andrew Huberman: What would you do to assess their muscular endurance, and would you then also encourage them to work on their strength?[1:33:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, absolutely. So again, if if they can't do they can do anything less than 3, you're gonna be a strength. In fact, if you wanna look at Muscular dress in general. So this is a bit of a off topic, but I promise I'll keep it short, and I'll come right back. When I was a doctoral student, I had, 2 lab mates.[1:33:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: 1 of them was a runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. And the one was a male, and he was basically like a straight pro. Like, he lifts weights, doesn't do any other sort of training. That's like a very classic not training program, but kinda train. And they were Sort of bantering back and forth for a while, and basically, she was saying you're so unfit, you can't run it all.[1:34:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: And he's saying you're so weak, you can't do a pull up. And so they challenged each other to a competition. They said at the end of the year, The girl is going to do 26 pull ups, and the guy had to run a marathon, so 26 miles. So that was the thing. And then there was some sort of Consequence for whoever sort of failed it.[1:34:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the guy quickly tried to figure out how the hell am I gonna run 26 miles when I have not run a mile in, like, many, many, many years. So he just started running, you know, 3 miles, 4 miles, whatever. She well, of course, they both of them ran immediately to me. Right? And then she was like, how the hell?[1:34:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can't do a pull up. And I was like, great. And I gave her a very specific maximal strength protocol. And she was like, woah. I wanna go to the assisted pull up machine And work on doing, like, sets of 25 because I've gotta get my muscular endurance up.[1:35:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I tried to explain to her, your muscular endurance is irrelevant if you can't do one. It's never going to matter. She did the muscular endurance protocol, the entire thing, didn't listen to me. The end of the year came, she still produced exactly 0 pull ups. So point is, if you look at muscular endurance, where is it, strengthened, where is it actually muscular endurance?[1:35:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: The general sort of number that you're looking for It's under, like, 80%. Right? That's gonna tell you is this a muscular endurance problem, or is this an absolute strength problem?[1:35:31] Andrew Huberman: Under 80% of the one repetition maximum.[1:35:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Yep. So what I mean by that is this. In fact, this actually isn't your question. The other way to assess muscular endurance is take the exact strength test you did From the the talk 5 minutes ago, what which one did you do?[1:35:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Load that to 75%, and then do that for as many repetitions as you can. And that is a tremendous barometer, of muscular neurons. So if you are able to do 200 pounds on your leg extension test, put 75% on that, and you got as many reps as you can. You wanna look for more than 8 repetitions. If you are below 8 repetitions, then we have a muscular endurance problem.[1:36:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. If it if it is higher than that, if you got 15 or 20, then we know we have probably some problems in your peak strength Or the test itself. So that is a good 8 to 12 sort of number is where you wanna be looking at, for there.[1:36:23] Andrew Huberman: What about anaerobic capacity?[1:36:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: This one's more challenging. You either have to go to a laboratory and do something like a wind gate test. So this is a 32nd maximal, test where you're gonna see how much work can you possibly do, in that 30 seconds. If you don't have a loud assessor laboratory, you can you can do this on any any protocol you want. You this could be sprinting.[1:36:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: This can be on a, like an air bike. This could be on a rower. Anything like that. Anything where you can exert maximum effort, and you don't have to worry about technical problems. So I generally don't like to do things like a kettlebell swing or something like that.[1:37:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's just too many other variables. You need to be able to go as hard as possibly can knowing you're going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue. Now in the lab, we often use what's called a Bosco protocol, and you're gonna stand on a force plate. You're gonna do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can, as high as you can for 60 seconds, and you're absolutely destroyed by, like, 2nd 45. So we either use that Wingate protocol or that Bosco protocol.[1:37:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you want though, again, take any of those other places, 30 seconds or so, up to 45 seconds, up to a minute if you want. It doesn't really matter. And you just mark down the distance you cover. That's all you we don't really have standards for these things because it's gonna be different. How far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill is just gonna be so different than Sprinting in the field or on, the assault bike or whatever.[1:37:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, what you really wanna worry about there is can you complete it? And then how awful do you feel afterwards? So what what you really wanna think about here is not those protocols, but this. You wanna think about, can you get close to your predicted maximum heart rate? So the the number we throw out is 220 minus your age.[1:38:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're 50 years old, 2 20 minus 50, you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate of around 1 70 beats per minute. Now that number is extremely generic. If you don't get there, that doesn't have any indication of your fitness. If you get higher, that doesn't mean you're any more fit. It's just a rough number.[1:38:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: So here's what I'm what I want you to do. In this case, your heart rate recovery is the better metric. So I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate and then test your heart rate recovery. And what you should be looking for there is about half a beat, recovery per second. So you're gonna get up to a place where you reach, like, absolute terrible exhaustion.[1:38:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. Maximum fatigue, test your heart rate, and then count. Right? Have a timer gone. Within 60 seconds, You should have again at half a beat per second.[1:39:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: You should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute within the next, the next minute. So 2 minute recovery, it should begin half that, so 60 beats. Those are rough numbers to go by, and your 3 minute recovery is again half of that again. So That is the closest way. If your heart rate recovery is worse than that, then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity or your cardiovascular capacity.[1:39:27] Andrew Huberman: I love it. What about number 8, maximal heart rate? Because what you just described sounds a lot like maximal heart rate.[1:39:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is your VO two max. So the gold standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done. So we can actually run a a v o two max test where you put a mask on, collect all your gases, and run you to there. And there's a very specific protocol for, completion of a a true maximum test. And any any scientist will know that.[1:39:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you don't have access to that, you can do a couple of tests. One of them is called, a 12 minute Cooper's test. This is simply time. You're gonna run for 12 minutes as far as you can, and you're gonna record the distance you cover. Again, you can go online to any, Any number of of calculators enter that distance in, and that will tell you your proximal your estimated VO two max.[1:40:14] Andrew Huberman: So that's a 12 minute sprint?[1:40:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: 12 minute sprint. Maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes.[1:40:19] Andrew Huberman: Keeping a steady pace the whole time or going[1:40:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: you want. The goal is to get maximum distance covered in in 12 minutes. So that's anywhere between a mile to 2 plus miles, depending on how fit you are. But you just do that Cooper 12 minute test.[1:40:36] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[1:40:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: I told you. Alright. So if you remember, a robot capacity is 8 to 12 sort of minutes where you're gonna see a real true test of that v o two max. You simply can't get that, in under a few minutes. So it is a is a that if you want, you can do a little gentler version of that.[1:40:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there are a number of submaximal tests. There in fact, there is a 1 mile walk test you can do. So again, all you're going to do is in this case, you have to have Some sort of either a stopwatch or ideally, a heart rate monitor. And all you have to do is this is a Rockport 1 mile submaximal test. So you're gonna walk a mile, Record the time, record your heart rate at the end, enter those in, and those will give you, again, estimates of your BSMAC.[1:41:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: So That's the the like, oh my gosh. I can't run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can, or I don't wanna do it. Or, we have a lot of these, in our executive program, it's like, my knee hurts too bad. I've got back pain when I run or whatever. Can I okay?[1:41:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: And you do the walk test, and it's pretty accurate if you do it correctly. So Technically, all you have to actually do is measure your heart rate on your you know, and I can count 60 seconds, but it's just easier to work. With everyone's watches and stuff now, just wear a heart rate monitor, Plug in those numbers. And again, those are all standard, calculations. So anywhere you find those, you don't have to worry about the source.[1:41:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you just enter your stuff in, and they're gonna be running out the same equation.[1:41:59] Andrew Huberman: I like the idea of the 12 minute run. I'm gonna give it a shot.[1:42:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what we did for for years, we did a 1 mile version of this, and, there's just a lot more science on the Cooper 12 minute Cooper test. So we did that. It's pretty good, and it is not even remotely close to fun.[1:42:15] Andrew Huberman: It sounds like fun for other reasons.[1:42:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it is.[1:42:20] Andrew Huberman: It it Fun in the sense that it reveals a lot. Yep. Powerful. Potent.[1:42:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Super. There's no hiding. You can hide with a leg extension test. It doesn't hurt that pat. But you you cannot feel anything but the 12 minute run as far as you can test.[1:42:36] Andrew Huberman: So these are really actually psych Psychiatric diagnostic tests.[1:42:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: They they are.[1:42:41] Andrew Huberman: Of sorts. Sure. Number 9, long duration steady state Yep. Exercise. I think of this as AKA endurance, but as you mentioned before, there are other forms of endurance.[1:42:53] Andrew Huberman: So long duration steady state exercise.[1:42:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. So You really wanna think about this as not a standard number. This is you should maintain consistent work output for over 20 plus minutes. K. On this one, I want you to just pick something that it was in your lifestyle.[1:43:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: So is there a loop around your house that you can do. Is there some protocol that you you like to use before? And you're simply going to test your ability. Can you maintain work without stopping? That's all it needs to be.[1:43:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now ideally, I personally like to throw a little twist in here, which is can you do this with nasal breathing only? That's when I feel really good. If you can go 30 straight minutes without needing to take a break, walking doesn't really cut it unless you're very, very unfit. In which case, if walking 30 minutes without a break is a challenge, okay, like, there. But if you can, I want you moving at a non walking pace?[1:43:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't care what zone this is. 2, 3, 4, 5. I don't care. Show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes of work with no breaks, no intervals, no downtime, and again, ideally, breathing through your nose only.[1:44:00] Andrew Huberman: I love this list, but it worries me a bit. Not because any one of these tests It's necessarily that overwhelming, but because I'm unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests. Yeah. For instance, do I separate them so I'm doing 1 test like long duration output on one day and I'm doing strength on another day? Those seem pretty obvious to me, but Are there ones that one can combine on different days?[1:44:26] Andrew Huberman: How much time should one give oneself in between these tests? And how often should one do an assessment? Just as we don't wanna necessarily evaluate body weight changes by getting on the scale 3 times a day, maybe once a day at the same time each day is More practical, how often should we be assessing our fitness for each and every one of these?[1:44:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, the way that I would say this is you want to pick the one that is the worst And do that more frequently. So if, for example, you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic, if you can bench press double your body weight, I don't need to test your bench very often for the average person. You're not a power lifter, like, maybe once a year or so. Maybe not even that. We just don't need to get there.[1:45:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: However, if we then test your your v o two max, and in your 12 minutes, you cover a total of a half a mile, then, like, we might wanna test that every month. Right. And so we're gonna let our priorities emphasize which one we're going to do more often. I would recommend doing this full battery once a year.[1:45:27] Andrew Huberman: Full battery mean the entire list on one day.[1:45:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: The entire not on one day, but within a week. So you could take a week. Now you could do these technically all in 2 days. 3 day split here is probably best. So if you were to just say, hey, this is like testing week.[1:45:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually love this for beginning of the year, whenever it is that you sort of change your training. But I think once a year, just like once a year, you should probably go to a physician and get full blood work, a full, you know, heart scan and and everything like that. And then if maybe you had a heart issue, they'll come back and attest you more frequently. Whatever the case is. Right?[1:46:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: You should probably run through this. And you're going to be thinking, yeah, but I don't wanna, like, give up on my exercise routine that week. Well, I promise you, you're not going to finish this week and think, I didn't do very much work this week. It's it's gonna feel great, and then you're gonna have a very nice barometer of exactly where you need to change and and prioritize your training for the next Quarter, half a year, or wherever you wanna go. If you wanna actually do this every 6 months, that's really we end up actually doing this quite honestly, like, more like every 6 months as a general, test.[1:46:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's a really good way to do. But if if minimum of if you're arguing with me, give me once a year you wanna do this. So Which order to do them in? The non fatiguing test you can do whenever. So this is the the body composition scan, the FFMI, the body fat composition.[1:46:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: All this stuff can be done However, I generally like to do that though as your very first activity. The reason is we know that acute exercise Can heavily influence things like body composition measurements because of inflammation, water storage, etcetera. So it's easiest to just sort of get that off of a 48 hour rest. You wanna make sure you don't do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test, and probably 48 hours before that. So just start yourself off with that.[1:47:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your movement test can be the same thing. You don't want to try to do a assessment of how well you're squatting if you're incredibly sore from your Your brutal squatting test. So tend to do those things when you're the most fresh. Then what you wanna do is any skill or maximum strength Our power goes at the very beginning of the day, and any fatiguing thing happens at the end. And so you could easily do this.[1:47:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. I'm going to do my power test, my broad jump. Great. You're not gonna be fatigued at all from that. And on the same day since I'm already pretty warmed up, Now I'm gonna roll right into my leg strength test.[1:47:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: And since I'm really warmed up, I'm gonna do my leg muscular endurance test right there. This is a very common strategy we use. We do our 1 rep max leg extension, 5 minutes, 7 minutes, whatever we need to do, come back, load it to 75%, do as many reps as you can. Boom. You could roll right into then your upper body test or your grip strength test or anything else that you wanna do there.[1:48:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is there a little bit of influence? Yeah. But really for most people, it's not that bad. What we impose, I mean, if you do a leg strength test Coming back and doing an upper body strength test afterwards, it's not that big a deal. Give yourself 15.[1:48:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Give yourself 20 minutes. Keep it plenty of time. So you can knock out your strength testing and muscular endurance testing all in one day. That could be you could do your performance, your skill Diagnostic, your power jump test, your strength, and your muscular endurance, and all that stuff is knocked out. You're gonna have to come back on a separate day And do your anaerobic test.[1:48:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is 30 seconds maximum endurance, things like that. You could though if you wanted, do that after your long duration test. Your long duration test, again, is just gonna function as like a a big warm up, or you could flip those things, or you could do them on separate days. You're gonna have to do your VO two access on its own day for the most part. Unless you wanted to do again your movement or your body composition sort of before those things.[1:49:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you really have the ability to kind of mix and match. Ideally, this most realistically probably takes 3 days. If you wanna separate them into 4 or 5, The more separation you do, the better data you're gonna get. It's just a question of, like, how how pedantic are you really trying to get here? And are you willing to lose 5% To then save a whole day, then you can do sort of these things in multiple stacks.[1:49:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's that's how I would break up.[1:49:33] Andrew Huberman: So what I'm hearing is better to do it than to not do it.[1:49:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most definitely.[1:49:38] Andrew Huberman: And be rational. Don't, don't try and do your strength output late in the day when you're fatigued. You know, if you're gonna combine some of the, steady state endurance and, maximal heart rate, fine. Understand there might be a slight deficit there, but Test it the same way each time, and what you're really looking for is improvement.[1:49:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. And you could also do the heart rate recovery under any of the modalities. So you could do the heart rate recovery, after your VO2 max as well. So you finish that thing, and then just, you know, again, do the same test for up to 3 minutes.[1:50:08] Andrew Huberman: These are fantastic tools. I'm Almost tempted to say that I'm willing to post my numbers, but that actually violates the sort of core principle that I think we're getting at here, which is that It's highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board. I mean, certainly, there will be individuals that are. But based on everything we talked about earlier, Specificity of training and, how extensively somebody's been training a certain way will, without question, Lopside them, if you will Yeah. Toward being better in some of these assessments and less good in others, and that's just simply the way that these adaptations work.[1:50:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. And it's not you don't need to be optimal in all these areas to be quote, unquote, optimal health from this perspective. You just wanna make sure, again, there's no severe performance anchors. This is what we call them. Right?[1:50:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: The we wouldn't want any of these severe constraints because you're going to get limited Buy that thing. And so what you wanna do is move that up to just sufficient or concerning. Right? And get it away from that. If you do that, that thing's not gonna catch you.[1:51:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna be able to continue to pursue pursue optimization in in any of the one things that you have a specific passion for, Which is generally what moves people. Right? You you train, so that you feel better. You train because you know there are all these benefits to it, and and, Jeez. This audience probably could list hundreds of them.[1:51:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: But you also train because you generally like to get better at something. A lot of us, like, have something. And so you wanna make sure that you're not going, hey. I know you're good at endurance, but you really shouldn't train anymore. We don't want that message.[1:51:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not at all. I want you to love your training. We just wanna make sure that you're not loving that so much that you're not taking some blinders off and missing another area, which would actually, Again, you pull that performance anchor, this whole ship sails faster with less effort and less friction.[1:51:59] Andrew Huberman: What I love about this is also that as you've described it, it's not just for athletes or people that are super into fitness. It's also for people that just Want to be healthy and want aesthetic changes, and that's why they're exercising, which I think accounts for a fairly large percentage of people out there.[1:52:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:52:15] Andrew Huberman: So so So I think, what you described is incredibly well structured, incredibly clear, and incredibly actionable. So, I wanna thank you for that. I'm serious about my willingness to do this and, at least share those numbers with you. And I think for most people that are seeking what you listed off before, aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity, it's clear that all 9 of these are going to be important.[1:52:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:52:42] Andrew Huberman: In some regard or another.[1:52:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So before we close out, I wanna go back and finish off, the metrics for v o two max, because I don't actually think I gave you numbers on that. So in general for men, a minimum number we wanna look at here is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute, and for women, that'd be about 30. So we we can actually push, a lot higher on those things. In reality, I wanna see men above 50.[1:53:05] Andrew Huberman: If I could just interrupt you for a second. When you say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters of what specifically?[1:53:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So what actually those metrics mean is, the first 1 milliliters is oxygen, so it's amount of oxygen. Kilograms is body weight, so it's how much oxygen can you bring in per kilogram of body weight Per minute. So it is a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration. In fact, the way that you calculate it, is you multiply your cardiac output by what's called your a v o two difference.[1:53:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your cardiac output is your heart rate times your stroke volume. So how much, blood you're pumping out per pump is your stroke volume. How many times you're pumping or you're beating, you multiply that by your a v o two difference. Your a v o two difference is artery minus vein difference. So it's the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your vein, which is gonna tell you how much you took up in your capillaries in your muscles.[1:54:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you take those 2 factors, multiply them together, and there's your VO two max.[1:54:05] Andrew Huberman: You know, as you were describing that, I imagine you getting to an fMRI machine and Seeing that equation lighting up in your brain because clearly it's committed to memory very well. Thank you for that Yeah. Clear description.[1:54:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. So to finish those numbers, I really truly wanna see some a man above 50, and I'm not even really stoked until I get above 55. In fact, it's sort of funny. Dave Costal, whose lab I did my PhD in, he was retired by the time, but he he's again one of these legendary figures in exercise physiology, started in the seventies. He would always say there's no human used to be below 60, which I was always like, damn.[1:54:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, that's really actually pretty hard to get to.[1:54:42] Andrew Huberman: Was he was he Oh, yeah.[1:54:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: He's still actually setting world records, like, in these last couple of years. And it's like, all the master's record for swimming and and cycling and stuff. So he was a super, super fit guy. So he was always above 60. He's probably, like, 50 something now, even though he's, you know, 80 or whatever.[1:55:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: 80 years old.[1:55:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. With the VO two max of 50[1:55:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: He's probably really not 50. He's probably but he's probably going to remember that earlier in the we talked about, I have the 92 year old Mhmm. By the VO two max of 38. Dave's probably gonna break that record when he gets there. I'm sure.[1:55:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm sure I get in fact, I guarantee you he has that number in his brain. I haven't talked to him in 15 years. But I guarantee you that number is in his brain, and he's probably training for it.[1:55:23] Andrew Huberman: I love it, and I love it because it proves that exercise pays off. Oh, yeah. It's one of the few things in life where there's a direct relationship[1:55:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:55:32] Andrew Huberman: Between work and outcome.[1:55:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. That's as Henry Rollins described in his wonderful essay, if You're familiar with that? Oh my gosh. Well, you're a punk rock guy. You know Henry, I'm sure.[1:55:42] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I certainly know who he is, and I know his his work. An incredible one page,[1:55:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: paper is sort of something to do with the iron. And he basically describes that as, like, this is the one thing where it's truth. Like, it is the most true thing you'll ever do, which is I love for that.[1:56:00] Andrew Huberman: It's almost like a principle of nature. 100%.[1:56:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So with with the women, I really wanna see women. If I wanna see men above 55, I really wanna see women above 50, as a target. And if you like, you're there, I'm pretty good. So you can do the math on then the middle ground of what's like okay, but we need to work on it.[1:56:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, if you look across the literature At different athletes, you're gonna see, like, the the really high level endurance folks. You know, they may pass 70 or 80. In fact, there was talk a few years ago of a guy breaking a 100. That was like an 18 or 19 year old, but I actually don't think it was ever fully confirmed or repeated. But certainly, you'll see plenty of people like 95, in those extremes.[1:56:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you look at other sports like football basketball, they're probably going to be in the 55, 65 sort of range. So if you as an average person are 55, that that's a really good marker to be in. If you get even close to that, You're in a good spot. I'm I'm sorry if I let you down, Dave.[1:56:58] Andrew Huberman: No. I just love how as you're describing this average person, you're looking at me with just a little bit of sympathy. Like like, if you If you reach the standard of average, Andrew, listen. You're giving me prompts all over the place to try and, improve my metrics, whatever they happen to be, and I think that's one of the great Values of getting objective numbers Yeah. Even if they have to be measured by some of these back of the envelope techniques[1:57:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:57:19] Andrew Huberman: That, you know, I guess We always teach people in the laboratory, right, that a tool can be, not extremely precise, but as long as it's reliable, course. There is still value there. I mean, of course, you'd love to have the most precise and most reliable tool, but if you can't, then at least go for a reliable tool and measure For consistency[1:57:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. For the real world reliability beats validity. It's as much as we can. For a lot of things we're talking about, especially for using it as a metric of did I get better? As long as that tool is reliable, body composition, just all these things have inherent error in them.[1:57:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger. But as you mentioned, having standardization within the testing protocol, is gonna allow you to measure progress, and that's gonna tell you sort of where you're at. Now that we sort of covered all the these areas of adaptation, we walked through the history, and we walked through a a bunch of the explanations for why people are Or maybe not getting the results that they wanna get through their training. The way I would like to go with the rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step make sure I cover very specific protocols for if you have run through this testing and identified an area of weakness. So maybe You've sort of been lifting a lot because you like lifting, and you maybe realize that your cardiovascular fitness or your heart rate recovery is not where it really should be.[1:58:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or the opposite, like we've talked about. Maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work, and your strength isn't there. Your movement quality is not there. So you've identified a problem. How do I specifically solve it?[1:58:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: What are the evidence based, and, most effective protocols that I could put myself in for each one of these categories, and I think that would give people a lot of take home value, but it's gonna take us some time to cover. So it's it's gonna have to come across over multiple conversations, between you and I.[1:59:05] Andrew Huberman: Great. Well, I'm looking forward to each and all of those conversations. And, I want to add just 1 more metric To our discussion today, which is really just my way of saying thank you, because if there were a metric for Amount of useful information per sentence spoke, you would be at the upper level of that metric. You have This amazing ability to provide so much knowledge in a clear and concise and today listed out Format that is both interesting, grounded in science, and actionable. So on behalf of everyone listening and certainly for myself as well, I just wanna Thank you.[1:59:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, I appreciate the compliments, and, I'm looking forward to the next conversation, jumping right into speed, strength, And Iperch retraining and and were the evidence based, and best practices for protocols in those areas.[1:59:57] Andrew Huberman: If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
