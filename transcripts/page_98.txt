Kronikle AI - Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #94 - TranscriptFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #94 - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing fitness. Fitness, of course, is vitally important for cardiovascular health, for strength, for endurance, for lifespan, for health span. I can't think of anyone out there that wouldn't want to have Healthy hormonal function, healthy cardiovascular function, to live a long time and to feel vital, that is to have a long health span as well as a long lifespan.[0:00:36] Andrew Huberman: Fitness and fitness protocols are tremendously powerful for developing all of that. However, despite there being an enormous amount of information out They're on the Internet and in books and elsewhere. It can be a bit overwhelming. So today's episode is really designed to synthesize science based tools That we've covered on the podcast, some with expert guests like doctor Andy Galpin or doctor Peter Attia, or world renowned movement specialist, Ido Portal, Or physiotherapist and strength and conditioning coach, Jeff Cavalier. We've had all of them as guests on the podcast, and each and every one of them provided A wealth of knowledge in terms of the various things that you can do to optimize very specific or multiple aspects of fitness.[0:01:17] Andrew Huberman: Today, we're gonna do something a little bit different than usual. Typically, on the Huberman Lab Podcast, I offer mechanism upfront or first. And then we talk about protocols that you can use that really lean on those science and science based mechanisms. Today, I'm going to describe a specific protocol that serves as a general template that anyone, in fact, everyone can use in order to maximize All aspects of fitness, so that includes endurance, strength, flexibility, hypertrophy, aesthetic changes, etcetera. However, This general framework can also be modified that is customized to your particular needs.[0:01:53] Andrew Huberman: So if you're somebody who really wants to build more strength or bigger muscles, You can change the protocol and the overall program according to that, and I'll talk about very specific ways to do that. Or if you're somebody who really just wants to maintain strength, you wanna build endurance. We'll talk about that. And, of course, we will cover real life issues such as, should you train if you are sleep Pride. What about food?[0:02:14] Andrew Huberman: When should you eat? What if you haven't eaten and you're hungry? Should you still train? Etcetera, etcetera. We're going to cover all of that, again, in the context of this, what I would call, foundational template of fitness.[0:02:24] Andrew Huberman: And this foundational template of fitness is something that I personally use. In fact, I've used it for over 3 decades. It's hard Believe that I'm that old, but I just recently turned 47, and I still use this basic protocol or template across the week and modify it According to what my particular goals are that year, that month, even that day, because I, like you, live in the real world, and sometimes I've been traveling or I miss a workout. Yes. It does happen.[0:02:51] Andrew Huberman: Or life isn't organized in exactly the way that I need to in order to have everything go according to the protocol that's on paper. So we're gonna discuss real world issues and how to work with the real world issues in order to get the most out of your fitness program. And, again, The end of today's program, I can assure you, you will have a template protocol that you can build up from, build Out, change, and modify, and that will really serve your fitness goals according to the science and what peer reviewed studies and the experts that appeared on this podcast and Their podcast really tell us is best and optimal for our fitness. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast has now launched a premium channel. I wanna be very clear that the Huberman Lab Podcast will continue to be released every Monday at zero cost to consumer, and there will be no change in the format of these podcasts.[0:03:38] Andrew Huberman: The premium channel is a response to the many questions we get about specific topics, and it will allow me to really drill deep into specific answers related to those topics. So once a month, I'm going to host an ask me anything, so called AMA, where you can ask me anything about specific topics covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast, and I will answer those questions. Those, of course, will be recorded. There will also be other premium content available to premium subscribers such as transcripts and short videos of new tools and unique tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you wanna check out the premium channel, you can go to hubermanlab.com slash premium.[0:04:12] Andrew Huberman: There's a $10 a month charge or $100 per year, and I should mention that a large portion of the proceeds from the Hubrium Lab premium channel will go to support scientific research That develops the very sorts of tools that we talk about on the Huberman Lab Podcast. The rest of the support for the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium channel will go to supporting the regular Huberman Lab Podcast. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. Before we dive into today's content about fitness and fitness protocols, I wanna tell you about a brand new study that is very exciting and, frankly, very unusual. This is a study that was published out of the University of Houston Examining a, what I would call, a micro exercise or a micro movement.[0:04:52] Andrew Huberman: It's a very small movement of a very small Portion of your body, in fact, just 1% of your musculature, that when it's performed continuously while seated has, At least what they report are very dramatic positive changes in terms of blood sugar utilization and metabolism. So the title of this study is a potent physiological method to magnify and sustain solious oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation. This study was published in Eye Science. And as I mentioned earlier, it is getting a lot of attention, and it's Very unusual. Without going into all the details of this study, let me just briefly give you a little bit of the background.[0:05:34] Andrew Huberman: First of all, you have a muscle called the soleus. The soleus muscle Is a more or less wide, flat muscle that sits beneath what most people think of as their calf, although it's part of the calf muscle. The other portion of the calf is called the gastrocnemius. The soleus sits below that. Now the soleus muscle is a unique muscle because it's largely slow twitch Muscle fibers, it's designed to be used continuously over and over again for stabilizing your body when you're standing upright, for walking.[0:06:01] Andrew Huberman: This is a muscle that's designed to contract over and over and over again. In fact, you could walk all day on this muscle, and most likely, it would not get sore. And you probably done that, it did not get sore. In contrast, a muscle like your bicep or your tricep, if I were to have you perform hundreds or thousands of repetitions even with a very light weight, You know, 1 pound weight or a 2 pound weight. Eventually, it would fatigue.[0:06:26] Andrew Huberman: You would feel a sort of a burn there. It's a very unusual set Set of muscles to use repeatedly. But the soleus is an unusual muscle in that it really is designed to be used continuously. Now this study was focused on how people who Sit a lot of the day and don't have the opportunity for a lot of physical movement or maybe who don't even exercise at all can improve their metabolism and glucose Utilization. Without going into a deep dive about glucose utilization, because we've done the deep dive on this podcast, on episodes such as metabolism, etcetera, you can those up at huberandlab.com.[0:06:57] Andrew Huberman: They're all time stamped and available there. Anytime you eat, your blood sugar goes up to some extent. So your blood glucose, as it's called, goes up some extent. And then insulin is a hormone that's used to essentially chaperone and sequester and use that blood glucose. Or it's, Basically, the idea is you don't want blood glucose to go too high.[0:07:16] Andrew Huberman: Hyperinsulinemia is something associated with blood glucose that's too high because insulin goes up to essentially match the level of blood glucose. Don't also don't wanna be hypoglycemic. You don't wanna have blood sugar that's too low, and insulin is involved in both regulating peaks and troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose. So we can basically say, and this is very simple, but we can basically say that you don't want blood glucose to be elevated Too much or for too long, that's not good. In fact, people who have diabetes because they don't make insulin people who have type 1 diabetes do not make insulin at all.[0:07:48] Andrew Huberman: Their blood glucose has is So high that they actually have to take insulin in order to regulate it. Otherwise, their blood glucose can go so high that it can damage cells and damage organs. It can even kill people. People who have type 2 diabetes are so called insulin insensitive. They make insulin, but the receptors to insulin are not sensitive to it.[0:08:06] Andrew Huberman: And so they make more insulin than normally would be made, And blood glucose isn't regulated properly, etcetera, etcetera. The take home message about blood glucose is that you want your blood glucose levels go up when you eat, but not too high, and you don't want them to stay elevated for too long. This study looked at how people who are largely sedentary or at least sitting can Increase the utilization, the clearance of glucose from the bloodstream after eating, and they also looked at overall metabolism For people, get this, that we're using just that 1% of muscle, the soleus, by doing what they call a soleus push up. So the soleus push up can be described very simply as If you're sitting down with your knee bent at approximately right angle, like a square corner, and pushing Up or I should say lifting your heel while pushing down on your toe and contracting the calf muscle as it were, and then lowering the heel, and then in Lifting that heel again, lowering the heel, lifting the heel again. Each one of those is what they call a soleus push up.[0:09:08] Andrew Huberman: This Study had people continuously do soleus push ups, and they looked at things like blood glucose utilization. They looked at metabolism and so on. A couple of important things about this study before I tell you what they discovered, which was frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard to believe, and yet I believe the data. The data look, to be Collected quite, quite well, and there are a lot of statistics. And the study looks to be quite thorough.[0:09:33] Andrew Huberman: First of all, they used an equal number of male and female Subjects, there were wide range of body mass indices. Okay? So this wasn't just super fit people or people that were purely sedentary and not fit. They used a wide variety of ages, time of day, the people who tended to walk a lot or not walk a lot. They measured Changes in metabolism and blood glucose utilization in people that had done these soleus push ups while seated in the laboratory.[0:09:58] Andrew Huberman: And I must say they had them do these soleus push ups for quite a long Aisle continuously. So they had them do it for as long as 270 minutes total throughout the day. So if you divide that, that's 4 and a half hours. You might say, well, 4 and a half hours of lifting the heel and putting the heel down, lifting the heel, putting the heel down. That's a lot.[0:10:15] Andrew Huberman: But they didn't always do it continuously. They had some breaks in there. So this is the sort of thing that you could imagine you or other people could do while seated, while doing Zooms, or, while on calls, or maybe even while eating, doing that sort of thing. Although, I'm not suggesting that you constantly be focusing on soleus push ups throughout your life. The point is that people who did these soleus push ups Experienced dramatic improvements in blood sugar regulation and in metabolism despite the fact that the soleus is just 1% of the total musculature.[0:10:47] Andrew Huberman: Here, I'm gonna read from the abstract about what they found. People who did these soleus push ups, despite Being a tiny muscle and using very little local energy. In fact, they measured muscle glycogen, the burn or essentially the The utilization of fuel within the muscle, and there was very little utilization of fuel within the soleus itself. And that's because the soleus has this unique property of needing to basically Keep you going all day, walking all day, or moving all day. What they saw was a large magnitude, for example, 52% Less postprandial, that's after a meal, glucose excursion.[0:11:25] Andrew Huberman: So 52% less increase in blood glucose and 60%, six zero less hyperinsulinemia, so reduced levels of insulin. They also miraculously Observe that despite this being, again, a a small muscle, 1% of the total muscle mass, so very small oxidative use, They saw big improvements in systemic metabolic regulation. So this is interesting, and I think something that we should at least know about. I'm not aware that anyone's replicated this study yet. I know there's a ton of excitement about this study in the popular press.[0:11:59] Andrew Huberman: And if the data turn out to hold up, which I'd like to imagine they will, I can understand why there's so much excitement. What this means is that if you're somebody who cares about blood glucose regulation, you want to keep your metabolism running, Please don't stop exercising the other ways that you exercise. But if you're somebody who wants to maximize your health, doing these soleus push ups Fairly continuously while seated is going to be beneficial. And in addition to that, I know that there are going to be people out there For instance, might be injured, or you're traveling and you're stuck on a plane, or you're in the classroom and you're forced to study all day or take notes all day. You're just not getting enough opportunity to get those steps that you wanna take whether or not it's 10,000 or fewer or more getting enough steps or movement.[0:12:43] Andrew Huberman: Maybe don't have time to get out and do your run, or maybe you're also running, weight lifting, and doing yoga classes, and things of that sort, but you want to further improve Your fitness, at least in terms of your metabolic health, this seems like a terrific, very low investment way to do it, certainly zero cost. It does take a little bit of attention, so you have to divert your attention from other things you're doing to make sure that you're still doing these soleus push ups. I'm sure that many of you are gonna have a lot of detailed questions such as, How high did they lift the heel, and did they contract the muscle very hard or not? Couple of things about that, they did not have subjects really contract the muscle hard. They did measure the angle of Heel raise, and it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees, so you'd they didn't have to go way, way up on their tippy toes or things of that sort.[0:13:25] Andrew Huberman: In any event, 270 minutes, 4 and a half hours of doing these, Solius push ups is a lot, but by my read of the data And the rather significant or, I should say, very significant effects that they observed on blood glucose regulation and metabolism, etcetera, Seems to me that doing less would still be beneficial and that you don't necessarily have to do the full 270 minutes in order to get the benefits that they observed. More about this study includes the fact that the benefits they observed were very long Lasting as long as 2 hours after a meal, they could still see this improved blood glucose utilization. I don't know because I wasn't able to find it in the methods whether or not they were doing the soleus push ups While they were consuming, blood sugar in this study, the point being that if you're somebody who cares about their fitness, this study is interesting Because what it means is that, again, if you are forced to be immobile or sitting longer than you would like, feel stuck in a meeting or Zooms or class or on a plane, etcetera, Or if you're simply trying to add a bit more fitness and metabolic health to your overall regimen, Solely as push ups, at least to me, seem like a very low investment, simple zero cost tool to improve your metabolic health.[0:14:36] Andrew Huberman: For those of you that wanna peruse the study in more detail, We will provide a link to this paper published in Iscience in the show note caption. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of Today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is InsideTracker.[0:15:01] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. Now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason The many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood Tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about hormones, blood lipids, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes understanding All of that very easy and even better points to specific directives. That is things you can do in terms of your lifestyle, your nutrition, supplementation, etcetera, In order to bring those numbers related to metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, etcetera, into the ranges that are optimal for you, your immediate, and long term health.[0:15:46] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are The absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.[0:16:10] Andrew Huberman: Now I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. ROKA understands this and has designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses to be worn in any number of different conditions and for you to still be able to see with Crystal clarity. Now I wear eyeglasses at night when I work or when I drive, and I wear sunglasses during the day. I don't wear sunglasses when I get my morning sunlight viewing, a Practice that I'm absolutely religious about every single morning. But throughout the day, I'll wear sunglasses when I drive or if I'm headed into bright sunlight to protect my eyes.[0:16:42] Andrew Huberman: ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses are terrific because they were designed for performance. So they were designed for things like cycling and running. So they won't slip off your face if they get sweaty. They're Extremely lightweight. In fact, most of the time, I can't even remember that they're on my face.[0:16:55] Andrew Huberman: They're so lightweight. However, they also can be worn anywhere, to work, to dinner, etcetera. Have a terrific aesthetics. Unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there, you can only find in designs that really make people look like a cyborg. ROKA makes the cyborg versions.[0:17:07] Andrew Huberman: Some people like those, but they Also make versions of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with frames that you can wear out to dinner, to work, etcetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, go to roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's Roka, roka.com, Enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs.[0:17:35] Andrew Huberman: Now sleep is the fundamental layer that is the most important aspect of mental health, physical health, and performance. I've said that before on this podcast, I'm gonna be saying it over and over again. If you're sleeping well, everything else is better. And if you're not sleeping well, everything else gets far worse. So sleep is vital, and sleeping on the correct mattress is absolutely vital.[0:17:53] Andrew Huberman: Helix understands this, and they have a brief quiz that you can take. So you simply go to their website. You take this quiz. It asks you questions Such as, do you tend to run hot or cold during the night? Do you tend to sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?[0:18:04] Andrew Huberman: Or maybe you don't know. And they match you to a mattress that's ideal for your particular sleep needs. For me that was the Dusk Mattress, d u s k. I've been sleeping on a Dusk Mattress for well over a year now, and it's the best sleep I've ever had. If you'd to try a Helix mattress, you can go to helix sleep.com/huberman.[0:18:20] Andrew Huberman: Take that brief 2 minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress for your sleep needs. You'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders and 2 free pillows. Again, if you're interested, you go to helix sleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off 2 free pillows. The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous supplements. To find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, livemomentous.com/huberman.[0:18:45] Andrew Huberman: And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/ Huberman. Let's talk about fitness, and let's talk about how you can develop the optimal fitness protocols for you. So that includes what to do each day of the week and your fitness protocol across the week and indeed across the month and the year and even year to year. When we had doctor Andy Galpin on the podcast, he said something very important that we want to keep in mind today, which is concepts are few, methods are many.[0:19:15] Andrew Huberman: That is, there are an Infinite number of different programs and exercises and set and rep schemes and different runs and burpees and push ups, etcetera, etcetera that one can follow. However, There are really just a few basic concepts or principles of muscle physiology, of cardiovascular function, of connective tissue function that provide or set the basis for the adaptations that we call fitness or that lead to fitness. So I'm gonna list those off now. We can talk about a fitness protocol that's really aimed mainly toward developing skill. That's 1.[0:19:51] Andrew Huberman: Or Speed, that's another, or power, which is speed times strength, or specifically strength, or hypertrophy, growth of muscles, Or endurance, such as muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is, for instance, your ability to stay in a plank position Or to do a wall sit, you know, to sit on an invisible chair against a wall. Or other forms of endurance like Near pure anaerobic endurance, so a 1 minute sprint or less or a 1 minute all out cycling on this sort of thing or endurance that occurs in the kind of 3 to 12 minute total duration range. So that might be Sprints or high intensity interval type training. It could be a all out swim.[0:20:39] Andrew Huberman: It could be all out row. That's another form of endurance. Taps into different fuel systems, Different aspects of muscle physiology, etcetera. And then endurance that lasts 30 minutes or more, which is typically what people think about when they think about endurance, of course, the other forms of endurance matter. So we've got skill, speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, Anaerobic endurance, what I would call 3 to 12 minute endurance, although it goes by other names as well, and 30 minutes or more endurance type Exercise and adaptations.[0:21:12] Andrew Huberman: Each and every one of these requires different principles, different concepts in order to improve, say your muscular strength or your hypertrophy or both. However, there's a general theme that sits beneath all adaptations leading to fitness. And that's what we're really gonna set down as the base layer, the foundation of everything we talk about today. And that's that we need To think about what are the modifiable variables. Again, I'm borrowing directly from the episode with doctor Andy Galpin.[0:21:43] Andrew Huberman: He was the one that said modifiable variables Or the key thing to think about, what are you going to modify? What are you going to change in order to increase 1 or some of the various things I listed off before, Skill speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, etcetera, etcetera. And some of the key concepts that emerge from that or that we need to think about progressive overload. Normally, when people hear about progressive overload, they think about adding more weight to a bar or picking up heavier dumbbells, but that could also be Progressive overload in the context of running up a hill of steeper incline or running a little bit faster or a little bit further and so on and so forth. Now as I promised earlier, today, we are not going to drill into each and every one of the mechanisms that underlie the different adaptations that are going to develop speed and strength and endurance, etcetera, Because that was covered in the podcast with doctor Andy Galpin and the other podcast with experts that I mentioned earlier.[0:22:35] Andrew Huberman: And we, again, will provide links to those podcasts if you wanna drill into those mechanisms. Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to start with a program that essentially is designed for you to maximize all aspects of fitness To the extent that you can simultaneously maximize all aspects of fitness, but then to change or modify that protocol So that if you want to build up more, for instance, strength and you want to just hold on to the endurance you have, you don't want to build endurance, at least not in that week or that month, You can do that. Or if you wanna improve your endurance while maintaining your strength, you can do that, and so on and so forth. Most people, I do believe, would like a combination of strength and endurance and flexibility and maybe even hypertrophy, particularly for certain muscle groups that maybe are not as well developed as other muscle groups. They want to bring balance to their physique, both for sake of aesthetics, and for sake of health, and for sake of, You know, general functioning to maybe even to eliminate pain.[0:23:36] Andrew Huberman: The protocol that I'm going to describe really works as a foundational template for that as well. So let's drill into that foundational protocol. And I'll keep referring to it as the foundational protocol, not because it's the one that I use, although it is the one that I use. And not because it's the one that we're talking about today, although it's the one we're talking about today, but because we need some general framework from which to build out The more specific protocols that we'll get into in a bit more detail later. So in this foundational protocol for fitness, what you'll notice is that on any one given day, You're gonna focus on one particular aspect of fitness.[0:24:09] Andrew Huberman: Maybe it's endurance, maybe it's strength, maybe it's hypertrophy. In Particular, it might be hypertrophy for a particular muscle group or muscle groups. That said, across the entire week, it's designed to bring fitness and different forms of fitness to all aspects of your body. So this particular protocol begins on Sunday, although That's simply the day that I happen to begin the protocol. And, again, this protocol is not important because it's the one that I follow.[0:24:37] Andrew Huberman: I follow it because it is important. In other words, it's a protocol that's really gleaned from the scientific literature and the experts that is for you. So this fitness protocol is really about you. I just may refer to it as the one that I follow, simply for ease of communication. And for me, my week begins on Sunday, so I do my very best to get A workout in on Sunday.[0:24:58] Andrew Huberman: And for me, that workout is that of a endurance workout. It's designed to Either maintain or increase my endurance, and the endurance type that I'm referring to is endurance of 30 minutes or more. In fact, For me, the goal is always to get either 60 to 75 minutes of jogging. So this would be So called zone 2 cardio. People probably have heard of zone 2 cardio, but if you haven't, that's okay.[0:25:24] Andrew Huberman: Zone 2 cardio is something that you could measure with a heart rate monitor or other device, but you don't need to. Zone 2 cardio is the kind of cardiovascular exercise in which you're pushing yourself to move such that you're breathing faster than normal. Your heart is beating faster than normal. However, you are still able to sustain a conversation. But if you were to push yourself any harder, that is move faster or go up a steeper incline at the same rate you happen to be at any one moment, You would lose that ability to speak.[0:25:57] Andrew Huberman: You wouldn't be able to complete sentences. You would be out of breath, or you'd have to pause mid sentence. Now near impossible even with a heart rate monitor to stay exactly in zone 2 unless you're very, very skilled at that. So I don't obsess over that. And in fact, I don't wear a heart rate monitor when I do this exercise.[0:26:13] Andrew Huberman: But for me, the goal is to head out on Sunday and get 60 to 75 minutes of jogging in zone 2. Now, of course, I like to jog, but that doesn't mean that you have to jog. You could replace jogging with rowing on a rowing machine or maybe even Rowing an actual boat, if you have access to that, or cycling or swimming, something that allows you continuous movement for 60 to 75 minutes At that zone 2 threshold, we talked about earlier. For me, that can include some hills. And when I say hills, they could be very steep hills, but I'll simply Slow my pace down in order to stay in that roughly zone 2 range, or it could be that they are more Low grade hills, and I might, you know, just slow down a little bit, or I might even push myself a tiny bit that day.[0:26:59] Andrew Huberman: But, really, I'm just trying to build that long endurance. I'm trying to build up my capacity or maintain my capacity to go a long distance without fatiguing. Now some days, meaning some Sundays, Since I tend to do this almost always on Sunday, although there are exceptions, instead of doing the 60 to 75 minute jog, what I'll do is I will head out for A long hike that could be 2 and a half hours or 3 hours or maybe even a 4 or 5 hour hike. Sometimes it's very long. And I'll do that sometimes simply to mix up The routine.[0:27:30] Andrew Huberman: Because sometimes jogging and jogging the same routes gets boring to me. I do enjoy running. That's something I've been doing for a very long time. But Sometimes it just gets a little bit, tedious, and I wanna do something different. Also, sometimes I wanna be social on Sundays.[0:27:45] Andrew Huberman: I wanna head out On a hike with my partner, or I want to meet up with friends and hike with them. And so taking a long hike on Sunday is something that also could be Social. And then I don't have to worry about also getting in my workout when heading out on a hike with my partner or going out to meet with friends or things of that sort. I will say that there's a specific tool or a specific change that you can make to this Sunday Day long endurance or at least what I consider long for me. I mean, it's by no means a marathon or an Ironman, but, this long endurance training.[0:28:18] Andrew Huberman: And that's the use of a weight vest. So something that I've really started utilizing more recently, and by more recently, I really mean within the last year or so, Is I purchased one of these weight vests that, can be anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds. What I use in the weight vest is is irrelevant, but it certainly Changes the level of effort required when taking a hike or even a walk. Now there's an additional benefit of the weight vest, which is that if you are going Out for a hike or even for a walk for social reasons and you're with somebody that's not quite at the same fitness level that you are, frankly, it's a little bit rude to just keep Walking ahead of them and running back or running ahead and running back. You know, oftentimes, you really wanna spend time with the person, and you don't want them to feel as if they're holding you up.[0:29:00] Andrew Huberman: And so the weight vest is a terrific way To get some additional work, then as you'll find if you wear a weight vest, it is additional work on, say, a shorter hike. So maybe the person you're with Only has time for an hour long hike or maybe they just don't have the fitness to do a 2 hour or 3 hour hike. So I'll throw on the weight vest, and I'll head out for a walk with them or a hike with them, or sometimes I'll go out on a long hike with a weight vest myself. So, again, the point of this, for me, Sunday, although it could fall on any day for you, Workout is really to build up that long form endurance, and this fits well with what doctor Andy Galpin and doctor Peter Attia referred to as The real need to get in some long endurance type work at some point or even multiple points throughout the week. For me, This long Sunday jog of 60 to 75 minutes or long Sunday hike or waited walk or waited hike really accomplishes that goal.[0:29:54] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes leads to a little bit of soreness, particularly in my calves. Or if I'm wearing the weight vest, sometimes my my midsection We'll get sore because I'm trying to remain upright. So I think it also builds up some muscular endurance, not just cardiovascular endurance. But, again, throughout the entire time that I'm jogging or hiking, what I'm trying to get to is a place where I can feel that my pulse rate is definitely elevated, But it's not so elevated that I have to stop because I'm out of breath. And because I know some people out there might be really neurotic about this sort of thing.[0:30:27] Andrew Huberman: If you have to stop because you're out of breath, that doesn't mean that you blew the workout, that, you know, you aren't getting endurance. Of course, you're getting benefits from it. So I'm not absolutely neurotic about always staying exactly in that heart rate zone. I might stop and have a conversation for a moment if it's a longer hike. Although I really try and keep moving, and I try and push myself just a little bit further than where I'm exceedingly comfortable.[0:30:48] Andrew Huberman: And so for me, doing this long Sunday hike Or jog really provides a foundation, a base for endurance that then the other endurance workouts that I'll describe later and that take place later in the week can build on. Now as I mentioned earlier, we will get back to the mechanisms that this taps into and why this is so useful. There are multiple benefits to doing these kinds of Endurance type workouts and zone 2 cardio. But by putting it at the start of my week, again, my week starts on Sunday, I'm sure that regardless of how the rest of the week goes, that I got my endurance training in. And, of course, I'm going to want to and I will do endurance training other days during the week.[0:31:28] Andrew Huberman: But if something comes up or I happen to get sick or I'm really behind in terms of work and I can't get other workouts in, This Sunday long jog or hike really provides that fundamental, I can honestly say, foundation For cardiovascular fitness and endurance that I can hang my hat on and say, okay. I've got that 1 in the bag, and I can then look to other days of the week to focus on Other aspects of fitness. Now a really important point to make about this Sunday endurance workout is that allows you To check off a box, and that box is 75 or so minutes of zone 2 cardio. Because as you may have heard, Either in this podcast or from others out there like doctor Peter Attia, getting a 180 to 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week has enormous positive effects On longevity and enormous positive effects on general health, again, in terms of cardiovascular function, but also Metabolic fuel utilization, also in terms of your musculature and your ability to use your body over long distances for long periods The time. So while it doesn't complete all 180 to 200 minutes per week, it certainly gets you a good distance, pun intended, toward that goal.[0:32:41] Andrew Huberman: Now I want to acknowledge that some people might be starting a fitness program, and so 60 to 75 minutes of jogging might be too long or a 3 hour weighted Vested hike or some people might even do what's called a ruck like you wear a rucksack, that might be too much. In which case, certainly, Start with less and go on flat ground and go at the rate that allows you to get into zone 2, but that is not excessively difficult for you. And then as you build up Fitness, you can add time or you can add weight through a weight vest. Or if you don't want to buy a weight vest or can't afford 1, There's a simple solution to that. I actually have a good anecdote about that.[0:33:16] Andrew Huberman: One time I was, heading out for a hike with a friend of mine. He was a former SEAL team operator. I'll never forget this, And he said, oh, yeah. I'll bring you, I'll bring you a sack. And I thought he meant, like, a sack lunch, like he was gonna bring lunch.[0:33:27] Andrew Huberman: And I showed up, and he busy gave me a backpack that was loaded with a bunch of stuff, and the backpack weighed about £40, and then we took a hike. So, I was thinking lunch. He was thinking weighted backpack. And a weighted backpack or even just any kind of Strong sack that you can put over your shoulders or even carry in your arms, it's going to work exceedingly well to build in some extra requirement for effort. So you certainly don't have to purchase a weight vest in order to, in order to get the benefits of bringing additional weight along with you on these long cardiovascular events.[0:33:57] Andrew Huberman: But, again, build up over time. You can add time. You can add weight. And that's also a really nice feature of adding weight, which is at some point, your schedule might be such or you just don't really want to keep Adding more and more and more time on this long endurance Sunday, in this case, workout. In that case, add weight.[0:34:18] Andrew Huberman: You can also as you build up fitness, you can add speed to it. Your zone 2, and what zone 2 is won't shift, but what work is required from you in order to get Into zone 2 will shift. That is as you get more and more fit, you'll have to move faster and or bring more weight in order to stay in zone 2, and that We'll simply tell you that you are indeed improving your endurance. Okay. So then Monday rolls around, and I, like most everyone else out there, I work on Monday.[0:34:43] Andrew Huberman: I get right into my emails and preparation for podcasts and running my laboratory, etcetera. However, I make sure that at some point on Monday, And for me, that some point is typically and ideally early in the morning, so 7 AM or so. I train my legs on Monday. So that includes quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. Why do I do that workout on Monday, and what is that workout designed to do?[0:35:07] Andrew Huberman: Well, that workout is really designed to make sure that I'm either maintaining or building strength in my legs. And this is not simply for aesthetic reasons. This is not Simply to grow bigger calves or grow bigger quadriceps and hamstrings. Although it can accomplish that as well depending on how you train. We'll talk about details of training.[0:35:27] Andrew Huberman: Reason for training legs on Monday is several fold. First of all, they are the largest muscle groups of the body. And by training your legs on Monday, it sets in motion A large number of metabolic processes that carry you some distance even through the whole week in terms of elevating metabolism, in terms of amplifying certain hormonal events in your body, etcetera, that are really beneficial. In addition to that, I'm of the belief that the legs are the foundation of the body and provided you can train legs safely, That training legs is vitally important, not just for strength of the legs, but also for strength of your entire body. Again, some of that is through systemic hormonal effects.[0:36:13] Andrew Huberman: Testosterone, although certainly testosterone, But also things like growth hormone, you get increases in all sorts of so called anabolic hormones that even if you're somebody who's not trying to increase muscle size because I realize a lot of people are not trying to do that. These are hormones that shift your metabolism and your overall tendon Strength and ligament strength and overall musculature into what I would call a strong foundation. So for me, Monday is leg workout. It also just feels good to The leg workout out of the way early in the week, and it accomplishes another goal, which is that I sometimes will take 1 or 2 days off of a leg workout because they can be very intense, and they are large muscle groups. And I'll explain what I do on the off days.[0:36:54] Andrew Huberman: They're not pure off days. They actually include some recovery type training or even some all out training. But by training legs on Monday, I'm able to get what I consider the hardest Strength and hypertrophy workout out of the way, and, again, set all those positive physiological effects in motion for the entire week. The other thing is that no workout exists in isolation. What you do one day is going to be determined by what you did the previous day.[0:37:20] Andrew Huberman: And even though the previous day, I may have taken a 3 hour weight vest at hike, never are my legs so sore from that long, slow endurance work because it is long and slow, then I'm unable to train legs. Contrast that with a, say, high intensity interval training workout, which comes later in the week, And my legs might be sore. In fact, they might not even be recovered such that I'm able to do a real leg work. And when I say real workout, I'll Describe what that means in a moment. So legs come on Monday, and I think that for those of you that are using or interested in using resistance training, I suggest getting your leg workout done early in the week.[0:37:57] Andrew Huberman: And for those of you that have heard the, the phrase, you know, don't skip leg day, I will go a step further and say, don't skip leg day. In fact, make leg day your 1st day of strength and hypertrophy training. Put it on Monday. Okay. So now that we're talking about resistance training, the question is gonna come about sets and reps and all of that business.[0:38:14] Andrew Huberman: That was covered in a lot of detail on the podcast with doctor Andy Galpin, and I'm going to get into some of that detail now. But I'm going to wait until I describe the entire set of workouts for the week before I go into even more detail Because there's a way of what's called periodizing, that is changing the sets and reps, etcetera, across the week and, Indeed, from month to month, that's really optimal. But I don't want to make it seem as if all of that just pertains to the leg workout. It actually pertains to all of the resistance Training. So I'll just give you a couple of teasers about the key principles of resistance training that I think are Almost universally, if not universally, then generally accepted in the strength training and physiology community.[0:39:01] Andrew Huberman: And Then later, I'll get back to some of the overarching principles that apply to all strength and hypertrophy workouts across the week, including the ones for the torso, the arms, etcetera. Okay. So legs fall on Monday. I should say that leg workouts, like all resistance training workouts for me consist of about again, I'm not neurotically attached to this, but about 10 minutes of warming up And then about 50, five zero, to 60 minutes of real work. Now, of course, some of that is going to be rest between sets.[0:39:33] Andrew Huberman: But by real work, I mean, really hard work, not necessarily to failure. We'll talk about failure in a little bit. But hard work where I'm struggling to complete the final repetitions, if not Going to to failure to to continue to move the weight repetitions. And, again, the entire work portion of that workout is about 50 to 60 minutes. Why?[0:39:53] Andrew Huberman: Well, past 60 minutes, you start getting increases in cortisol that really impede recovery. And I personally am somebody that does not recover very well from high intensity exercise. I realized that within the literature, it is Believed, and I think generally accepted, that when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy or strength increases, it impacts the Nervous system, it also causes things like protein synthesis, etcetera. There are a number of different forms of adaptation that occur to give you muscle strength and size changes. And these days, people talk a lot about needing to stimulate muscle growth or muscle strength at least every 48 hours.[0:40:33] Andrew Huberman: But I can tell you that I recover out there slowly, and I benefit from working the same muscle group about twice per week with longer, Or I should say more days of rest in between those workouts. So if I train legs on Monday, believe it or not, I'm only training legs on Monday. I do not have a 2nd leg workout during the week. However, on Friday, I do a high intensity interval training session that serves 2 purposes. 1 is it serves the purpose of triggering a certain type of endurance and getting my heart rate Very, very high.[0:41:09] Andrew Huberman: And in addition to that, because of the way I do that workout, it acts as a sort of supplement or a more moderate intensity Workout for quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves, such that I, at least, never lose strength and, in fact, Generally, build strength from 1 leg workout to the next provided I'm doing things correctly. So what I'm not referring to Is the kind of classic, you know, super high intensity training once per week and then not actually training that muscle group again. For me, it's really training each muscle group twice per week, once directly and then once indirectly, either during another weight training workout or during a Cardiovascular, I should say, endurance training workout. So, again, legs on Monday, the workout is 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warm up. I generally pick 2 exercises Per muscle group.[0:41:58] Andrew Huberman: So, again, I'm doing calves, I'm doing quadriceps, and I'm doing hamstrings. You should pick the exercises that work For you, so that's why I'm actually not going to share which exercises I use. I'll give you a a couple suggestions about the ones I do use. But, really, exercise selection, as doctor Andy Galpin pointed out, is a very important variable. And the key thing to emphasize for that variable is that you need to be able to perform the movement safely.[0:42:22] Andrew Huberman: So I know there's a huge debate out there, and people love to argue about whether or not one can squat or deadlift for long periods of time or should or should not. Some people say you absolutely should. I personally do not squat and do not deadlift. I've actually never done much squatting or deadlifting. And I know some people out there are probably Rolling their eyes or switching the channel at this point.[0:42:43] Andrew Huberman: But I can say that for me, I've been able to Achieve the strength and hypertrophy goals that I've been seeking doing things like leg extensions and hack squats, Or for hamstrings, doing things like leg curls and glute ham raises, or for calves, doing standing and seated calf raises, and so on. I think a key principle that Everyone should pay attention to is one that was taught to me by an excellent strength coach years ago, and I still use this, and at least it works for me. For each muscle group, try and find an exercise in which you get that muscle into a weighted stretch position. So this would be, for instance, the standing calf raise. You know, down at the bottom, it's weighted, and you're in a in a deep stretch provided you're doing the, the movement correctly.[0:43:26] Andrew Huberman: As well as another exercise where you're getting contraction in the shortened position of the muscle. So for the hamstrings, that would be the leg curl. For, the calves, it would be a seated calf raise. Or for the quadriceps, The, the leg extension is you know, if the machine is designed right and you're doing it correctly, the peak contraction is largely going to occur at the at the leg's Extended position. But then another exercise for each muscle group that puts the muscle into more of a stretched or at least a Larger range of motion or compound type movement, but ideally, where there's some stretch there.[0:44:01] Andrew Huberman: So I guess I will tell you what exercise I Exercise I do for the quadriceps is gonna be leg extensions and hack squats. I use hack squats because I don't do free bar squats for safety reasons, and I like the hack squat machine. I'll do leg curls and glute ham raises for hamstrings, and I'll do standing calf raises and c calf raises for the calves. Again, those are the movements that I use because I can perform Form them safely in the repetition ranges and with the weights that are required for me to either maintain or build leg strength and calf strength. But you might decide that for you, dead lifts are absolutely essential and terrific, or squats, free bar squats are absolutely terrific, or front, you know, front squats.[0:44:38] Andrew Huberman: I'm not here to tell you which exercises to do or not do. I am telling you that it's probably wise to at least consider Doing at least 2 exercises per muscle group, probably 3 maximum, if you ask me, if you're doing your entire legs and calves in one day. But to think about doing 1 exercise where the muscles brought into that shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls or leg extensions or seated calf raise, and then another exercise for each muscle group where there's more of a elongation and maybe even a stretch on the muscle group. In fact, that's a principle that you'll hear me talk about later when I talk Training other muscle groups for strength and hypertrophy. So now you know approximately how long to train.[0:45:17] Andrew Huberman: You might be somebody who can get away with training for an hour and a half, and that won't impede your recovery. For me, that really starts to impede my recovery. Also, if I'm staying on task, that 60 minute limit really works well for me. Do I occasionally train for 75 minutes? Yes.[0:45:33] Andrew Huberman: Because if I'm waiting for a piece of equipment, sometimes I have to just wait Longer, so that happens, but I really try and keep the total duration of the workout shorter. How many sets and reps and rest intervals? Well, that was covered by doctor Andy Galpin as well. Without getting into the total science, here's a brief summary of how to structure that. It's pretty clear that if you're going to do Lower repetitions and heavier weights that you're going to want to do a bit more volume.[0:46:03] Andrew Huberman: I know that this Spits in the face of what a lot of people think. But so if you're gonna do 5 sets of 5, and I would consider 5 repetitions low low repetition range, heavier weight. And if you're going to train with higher repetitions, you can do fewer sets. That certainly works for me. I generally follow a program where for about a month, so 3 to 4 weeks, I will do all my resistance training in the repetition range of About 4 to 8 repetitions, so that's rather heavy.[0:46:33] Andrew Huberman: A few more sets, so it might be anywhere from 3 to 4 sets Per exercise, again, still just 2 exercises, and longer rest between sets, anywhere from 2 minutes to maybe even 4 minutes if it's really heavy leg work. And then for the next month, switch to repetition range that's closer to 8 to 12, maybe even 15 repetitions per set, but do fewer sets overall. So maybe just 2 to 3 sets per exercise. Again, just 2 exercises per muscle group, typically. And shorten the rest between sets so that it's more in the 92nd, maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets, but typically 90 seconds to about 2 minutes or two and a half minutes.[0:47:16] Andrew Huberman: So, basically, it's 1 month heavier, the next month slightly lighter. Although, I wouldn't say light. I would say moderate Weight and moderate rep range. That tends to work well for me. It also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion, again, with doctor Andy Galpin, that for hypertrophy, you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from 5 to 30, three zero reps.[0:47:39] Andrew Huberman: But He emphasized changing the repetition ranges in order to offset boredom. Frankly, I like to train heavier. I enjoy training in the 4 to 8 rep range. However, I noticed that if I do that for more than 4 weeks in a row and I don't switch over to training in the 8 to 12, maybe in 15 repetition range for about a month, Well, then I can't make continuous progress. I start to actually lose ground.[0:48:00] Andrew Huberman: But by switching back and forth, I actually can Make continuous progress at least across the year. So I hope that that principle or I should say that protocol, was communicated clearly. It works very well, I assure you, does that mean that I never get 10 repetitions on a week when I'm, supposed to train in the 4 to 8 repetition range? No. Occasionally, I'll venture up into the repetition range.[0:48:24] Andrew Huberman: But I really try and cluster that low repetition work for about a month, again, across all workouts and all exercises, and the Slightly higher, I would even say moderate repetition work across to the next month. One thing that you'll notice since we are talking about total fitness programming is that during the month Where you are doing moderate repetitions, you'll notice that your endurance work will actually be facilitated. And I do not think that's a coincidence. In fact, it's not a coincidence. It's because when you are training very heavy or in the heavier range, Lower repetitions, etcetera.[0:48:59] Andrew Huberman: You're tapping into different processes in those muscles. So when you head out for that long Sunday hike or as you'll soon hear, Whereas on Friday, you're gonna do high intensity interval training. What you'll notice is during certain months of weight training, when you're training more heavy, those Workouts will feel, literally, will feel different than they will during the months when you're doing moderate repetition work. I I'm not a competitive athlete. I'm not running races or triathlons like some of my friends.[0:49:26] Andrew Huberman: I'm very impressed by them. I'm really just trying to get overall cardiovascular fitness, overall strength, Overall, hypertrophy where I need it, maintain muscle size, and etcetera in muscle groups where I'm just trying to maintain. That's really my goal. So I'm not trying to optimize any of these workouts for any one performance feature. But in a little bit, we'll talk about how you can change Various aspects that is variables of these protocols in order to say, for instance, really emphasize hypertrophy or really emphasize endurance.[0:49:56] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So with I would call a standard endurance workout done on Sunday. And I say standard because most people when they hear endurance, they think of the ability to endure, to continue, in a repeated Movement or exercise over some period of time. With that workout done on Sunday and then with the leg workout done on Monday, you can feel really good about how you're heading into the week. However, after training legs on Monday, I experienced that doing cardiovascular workouts the next day is either inefficient or at least doesn't really allow me to completely recover from my leg workout.[0:50:30] Andrew Huberman: Now I realize that some people are going to immediately scoff at that. And in fact, There are really beautiful papers out there talking about how one can actually do a fair amount of cardiovascular exercise without interfering with their Strength and speed and hypertrophy improvements and vice versa. In fact, there's a terrific review that was mentioned On the podcast with doctor Andy Galpin, this is a review that will provide a citation to, and a reference and a link to, which is the review by, Murak and Bagley, which talks about whether or not there's interference between strength and endurance workouts. Really interesting review if you wanna peruse that. But With all that said, I like to take Tuesday as a no endurance, no resistance training day.[0:51:15] Andrew Huberman: But that doesn't mean that I'm not doing anything for my overall health And fitness, on Tuesdays, I do a series of heat cold contrast. In other words, I get really, really warm, and then I get really, really cold. I get really, really warm, and I get really, really cold repeatedly. And the way I do that is by getting into a hot sauna. So for me, that's really hot, but I've built up my heat conditioning.[0:51:39] Andrew Huberman: So please don't do this unless you've built up your, ability to withstand heat. And I'll get in for about 20 minutes, sometimes 15, but usually 20 minutes. Then I get out, and then I will get into an ice bath or A cold water bath that's about 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Again, don't get into water that's so cold that you go in To shock, I'll explain what a good cold, stimulus could be for you and how to determine that. Or if I don't have access to my sauna and my Ice bath.[0:52:11] Andrew Huberman: What I can do if I'm traveling is I will take a hot bath and then alternate with cold shower. Hot bath, cold shower. It's hard to do hot bath, ice Bath, unless you have 2 baths. I don't know any hotel rooms. At least, I've never stayed in one that has 2 baths, although I'm sure they're out there.[0:52:25] Andrew Huberman: But for me, this is Heat cold contrast. And, really, what this day is about is 2 things. First of all, I'm trying to accelerate recovery from the The leg workout I did previously. Also, if you listen to our episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast about deliberate heat exposure or you listen to our episode of the Hubrun Lab podcast about deliberate cold exposure. I talk about some of the benefits of heat and cold, and I get into a lot of details about how you can access You can do baths.[0:52:53] Andrew Huberman: You can do saunas. You can even take hot showers. If you don't have access to any of that, you could even wrap your body from the neck down in Garbage bag plastic garbage bags. Believe it or not, wrestlers used to do this. Put on some sweats and go running.[0:53:04] Andrew Huberman: That will get you warm. Again, be careful not to overheat, and then you can get into a cold shower. So there's a lot of ways depending on your budget and what you have access to. I don't use cryo, these cryotherapy chambers. They're hard to find.[0:53:17] Andrew Huberman: They're expensive. Again, I use sauna and ice bath, and I will do anywhere from 3 to 5 rounds, which is a lot. Anywhere from 3 to 5 rounds of heat for about 20 minutes and cold for about 5 minutes. How cold should the cold be? We covered this in the episode on deliberate cold exposure.[0:53:34] Andrew Huberman: Here's a general rule of thumb. It should be cold enough that you really want to get out, but not so cold that it's unsafe. And that will vary from person to person, so I cannot give you a a simple prescriptive there. Same thing with the heat. Hot enough that you're sweating and that you want to get out, but not so hot you're running the risk of injuring yourself or killing yourself.[0:53:54] Andrew Huberman: And, again, that will vary from person to person. So you have to build up slowly, be careful, and build up empirically. I do that on Tuesdays, again, as a way to accelerate recovery and because it's very clear that there are cardiovascular benefits, maybe even Benefits for the brain related to the cardiovascular benefits because, of course, the brain needs a lot of blood flow and needs a lot of, Nutrients and other things flowing into and out of there, debris out and nutrients and other things into the brain. Heat can help accelerate that or improve that, and so I'm doing that to improve cardiovascular function, improve brain health. And then the cold contrast Provides a sort of accelerator on that or an amplifier, I think is the better way to phrase it, on that process.[0:54:36] Andrew Huberman: Because in the cold, you get vaso Constriction and then in the heat, you get vasodilation, and so you're maximizing that process, which is actually a neural process. Nerves actually innovate the blood vessels and capillaries and and even the arteries in order to allow that constriction and dilation process to occur. So Tuesday is really about recovery, but my recovery day isn't Necessarily about, just laying around and not doing anything. I might still also take some walks that day. Remember, I wanna try and get that 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio across the week.[0:55:06] Andrew Huberman: And sometimes, not often, but sometimes I'll get in a few, minutes or more of walking quickly that day. But, generally, I'm working a lot on Tuesday as I do on Monday, And I'm a little bit tired or maybe even a little bit sore from my leg workout the previous day, Monday, so I try and get that hot cold contrast. There are other benefits to hot and cold contrast. We have a description of the different protocols for hot and for cold and their contrast at our Huberman Lab newsletter. You can find that by to hubermanlab.com.[0:55:35] Andrew Huberman: Go to the newsletter tab under the menu, and you can sign up. You can actually download those protocols very easily without even signing up if you Just wanna access straight off. So Tuesday is really about recovery and about getting some additional cardiovascular benefits from heat cold contrast. One other thing that's built into the rationale for doing a lot of heat and cold on one day as opposed to doing it every day well, in addition to it being a little bit more convenient because, Certainly, some people don't have access to heat and cold, sauna and cold dunks, etcetera, every day, so maybe getting to do that one day is more accessible or feasible. But in addition to that, it's very clear that while there are benefits to doing sauna often, and we talk about this in the deliberate heat episode and The episode with doctor Rhonda Patrick when she was a guest on this podcast.[0:56:20] Andrew Huberman: It's also clear that if you do sauna seldom, that is once a week, but you do a lot of it on one day. So in this case, it's an hour. If it's remember, it's or more. It's 3 to 5 rounds of 20 minutes of sauna followed by about 5 minutes of cold or so. By doing that all on one day, the peer reviewed research that's covered in the episode on deliberate heat, this is a study out of Finland, Showed that you get massive, even 16 fold increases in growth hormone, which are extremely beneficial for metabolism and for recovery.[0:56:50] Andrew Huberman: So these massive increases in growth hormone are seen when you are doing these sessions of sauna that are repeated on the same day, And you're only doing that about once a week, whereas if you do sauna more often, there are certainly benefits to that, but it's time consuming. And you need access to sauna More often than 1 day a week if you're doing it more than 1 day a week. But if you do it 1 day a week and you're doing a lot of sessions within that day, as I've detailed here, You see these massive increases in growth hormone that are not observed if you're doing sauna more often for the other benefits of sauna. Now the effects of cold are many. It's not just vasoconstriction.[0:57:26] Andrew Huberman: But the effects of cold are also counterbalanced by some of the problems with deliberate cold exposure That maybe you've heard about on this podcast and a lot of other podcasts and seem to be a kind of a a buzz theme on Twitter and elsewhere. And the point is this, there are a number of quality studies showing that if you do deliberate cold exposure, in particular ice baths or getting into very cold water, Immediately after an endurance training session or a strength and hypertrophy session, it can indeed yes. It can Disrupt or prevent some of the adaptations that you are seeking with strength and hypertrophy and endurance workouts. Okay. So You heard that right, and I believe that to be true based on now several quality peer reviewed studies.[0:58:13] Andrew Huberman: So by doing your deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday, You're not going to get those effects that is the blocking of hypertrophy or the blocking of strength improvement or the blocking or prevention of improvements and endurance that would occur if you immediately got into the ice bath after a hypertrophy strength or endurance workout. Now the caveat to that is If you are somebody who likes to do cold showers, I am not aware of any data that says that cold showers cannot be performed strength, hypertrophy, or endurance workout, cold showers are different than submersion up to the neck In an ice bath or another cold body of water for a number of different reasons. In fact, they tap into different aspects of the nervous entirely. We don't have time to go into that now. It's covered in the episode on deliberate cold exposure.[0:59:02] Andrew Huberman: But the simple point is by doing your heat and cold contrast Or hey. Listen. If you're somebody who doesn't have access to sauna or you don't like hot baths and you just do some deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday, you are doing that Separate from your strength and hypertrophy and endurance workouts such that it will not impede the benefits of those workouts. Okay. So long endurance on Sunday, Leg resistance training on Monday, and on Tuesday, heat cold contrast.[0:59:28] Andrew Huberman: That brings us to Wednesday. And On Wednesday, we get back to a resistance training workout. And the resistance training workout that I emphasize on Wednesday is 1 in which you train your torso. Yes. Literally, your torso.[0:59:42] Andrew Huberman: I know this is counter to the so called bro science or bro splits. I don't know who originated that Term. It's a terrible term. It, essentially, alienates anyone who's not a bro or considers themselves a bro. But in any case, this is not about training chest or back or shoulders.[0:59:59] Andrew Huberman: In fact, it's really about strengthening the muscles of this torso of course, includes the chest and the shoulders and the back. And I'm sure, as I say this, a number of people out there who are obsessed with hypertrophy and muscle growth and filling out their shirts or whatever It may be or thinking, oh, no. You know, this is just kind of all around fitness, but, no. The point is on Wednesday, you train your torso, And that's going to involve some pushing, so that's good. For you, that might include some training of things like bench presses or incline presses, as well as Shoulder presses or lateral raises, things for the shoulders as well as for the back.[1:00:34] Andrew Huberman: Some pulling exercises. These could be bent over rows or chin ups or pull ups. Again, there are enormous number of exercise for Each and every one of these muscle groups. Now I believe there's a clear benefit to training all these muscle groups together on the same day. Because much in the same way that training legs all on one day can lead to these systemic effects because they're large muscle groups working both the pushing muscles and the pulling muscles of the torso on one day, least in the context of this program, it's very time efficient and tends to wick out into a number of different dimensions of health At least I'm interested in and I think a lot of other people are interested in.[1:01:09] Andrew Huberman: What are those? Well, let's think again. I want to be strong in not just my legs, but my upper body. I also may want may want to engage some hypertrophy, to grow certain muscle groups in order to create a sense of balance. That could be for aesthetic reasons, but also for balancing Strength and for health of the and the integrity of the joints, etcetera.[1:01:26] Andrew Huberman: And in addition to that, by training a bunch of different muscle groups together, You have the opportunity to get the more systemic hormonal effects and metabolic effects that occur when you're not just training 1 muscle group that one muscle group, but rather training a bunch of muscle groups together. So Wednesday, I train torso, and I do that in push pull fashion just for, kind of time efficiency. Sometimes that means doing a pushing exercise and then a pulling exercise. Sometimes it might even mean doing a set of pushing and then a set of pulling and going back and forth. However, If you're in a gym, in a particular crowded gym, please don't be one of those people that colonizes multiple pieces of equipment and says, I'm working there.[1:02:04] Andrew Huberman: I'm working there. And, you know, that can be quite a dance, and it can be hard To orchestrate a workout like that. So sometimes it will be, you know, starting off with a set of shoulder presses and then doing all, you know, all your sets of those, and then moving to your chin ups, and then Moving perhaps back to shoulders and realizing, someone's on the machine that I wanted or using the equipment that I wanted, so I'll just finish up the pulling. I'll finish up the back work and then going to the push. I don't obsess over the alternation in any kind of strict way.[1:02:31] Andrew Huberman: I really just try and get the muscles of the torso trained. And, again, it's 2 exercises per muscle group, And one of those exercises is going to be something where there's I realize this isn't physiologically accurate, but a shortening of the muscle or where they At the end of the movement, the muscle is under maximal contraction. I could throw out some names of exercises just for for purpose of of understanding. So this would be, You know, like cable crossovers for the chest that the, the peak contraction is at the end, whereas, something like an incline press, there's more of a Stretch provided is done over a full range of motion at the beginning of the movement. So, again, something where there's a stretch and something where there's a peak contraction.[1:03:08] Andrew Huberman: For the shoulders, it's a little bit harder to do, although there are ways to do that. And Jeff Cavalier has excellent workouts available zero cost on YouTube. He also has programs on his athleanx.com site, but certainly has a lot of excellent protocols on his YouTube and Instagram. But on YouTube, you can put in His name and any muscle group that you wanna train, he has some terrific videos describing exercise choice And other features of exercise parameters, again, a peak contraction or shortening of the muscle peak contraction exercise a stretching exercise. And so for the back, one might say, okay.[1:03:46] Andrew Huberman: A seated row or a bent over row or a Dumbbell row where the elbow is brought behind the torso for a peak contraction movement. And then for more of a stretching movement, might be something like a A chin up or a pull up. And as I say this, I understand that stretching and peak contraction aren't the exact terms that one would use if they were a physio Therapist or strength and conditioning coach. But I think for the typical person who's trying to generate strength and hypertrophy in those muscles or maintain Strength and hypertrophy in those muscles, this kind of nomenclature way of describing it at least should be, clear and and even efficient. And just to remind you, as with the leg workout, the total duration of the torso workout is going to be 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warm up.[1:04:31] Andrew Huberman: The The sets and repetitions are going to be dictated in the same way that I described earlier. So for about a month, it's going to be More sets, so anywhere from 3 to 5 sets in the lower repetition range, so 4 to 8 rep repetitions. So that's gonna be heavier weights And longer rest, as I described earlier, the rest intervals. And then for the next month, it's going to be moderate repetitions, fewer sets, the same way I described earlier. And if you want more details on all of that, you can find that in the newsletter related to the optimal or foundational fitness protocol that you can access at hubermanlab.com.[1:05:06] Andrew Huberman: One thing I should note about the Wednesday torso workout is that I am a big believer in training. The what I believe is the highly, Avoided or at least overlooked, but vitally important aspect of total body stability, strength, and safety, really, safety, which is the neck. I realize a lot of people don't want a large neck, and I totally understand for aesthetic reasons why they don't want that. It's kind of interesting, actually, if you think about it, that people who have a large neck are often told They have no neck. People say, that guy has no neck, or they have no neck when, in fact, they're referring to the fact that they have a very large neck.[1:05:39] Andrew Huberman: I don't know how to be. Someone you put in the comments why that is. How come when people have a big neck, they refer to it as no neck? So why do I train the neck? I train the neck for a couple of reasons.[1:05:48] Andrew Huberman: One is years ago, I had an accident where I actually fell off a roof, and I'd been training my neck at that time, for a sport that I was involved in, and I walked away from it with a sore neck, but not a broken neck. And I thought, wow. It's really great that I have, Been training my neck. In addition to that, I was once in a car accident where I was parked. I just bought the car.[1:06:09] Andrew Huberman: It's my 1st new car purchase. Parked in that car with my mother and my grandfather in the back seat at the red light, and someone rammed into us at full speed. Now fortunately, none of us hurt. We were all, rattled. And once again, I was very sore in my back and in my neck, but I think one of the reasons why I was able to essentially walk away from that.[1:06:31] Andrew Huberman: I didn't have any, sustained damage was because I trained my neck. But I started training my neck for sport, and I continue to train my neck because I noticed when I don't train my neck, I start getting shoulder issues. And if you talk to an excellent physiologist like doctor Kelly Starrett of The Ready State has a excellent channel. You can find him on all the social media and standard channels where you talk to. Anyone out there who really understands The strength of the torso and the upper body and even the back, what you learn is that, of course, being the upper portion of the spine, Stabilizing your neck is very important.[1:07:05] Andrew Huberman: Now training the neck can be a little bit detailed and specific and even dangerous if you do it wrong. Again, Jeff Cavalier has a terrific set of videos on training the neck properly. I know a lot of people out there might think neck bridges, and I used to do neck bridges. I Occasionally still sneak in a neck bridge here or there. Although, I don't recommend it because in discussions with Jeff, he will tell you, and it's true, that the disks eventually go, And you can run into serious issues from doing bridges, and it doesn't happen gradually.[1:07:32] Andrew Huberman: So you can't notice it happening. It just happens suddenly. So I might occasionally do A neck bridge. But in general, I'll train neck by wrapping a plate in a towel so that I don't end up with an imprint of the the weight value on my head or face, And then moving the neck from side to side or front or back. And, again, ref we'll provide a link to those videos.[1:07:50] Andrew Huberman: It's a terrific set of videos how to train your neck properly and safely. So even if you're not trying to grow your neck, you definitely want to make sure that you use some lightweights to make sure that your neck is Stable and upright. I say stable and upright because it's very clear that for reasons related to texting and staring down at computers And related to weak neck relative to the rest of the muscles that stabilize the spine, a lot of people, their default stance or their default posture Is with chin forward, and that's not good. Not only is it aesthetically not good, but it also can create all sorts of issues related to back pain and headaches and things of sort. This is a real thing.[1:08:29] Andrew Huberman: Training your neck allows you to stand upright, sit upright. I even believe that it allows you to do things like public speaking or have conversations with people on the street a way where you are front facing as opposed to looking down. So Wednesday is torso and neck, and then comes Thursday, and that means another Cardiovascular exercise session, although it's a brief one. Unlike the endurance training on Sunday, the cardiovascular session on Thursday and, again, for me, it falls on Thursday, but for you, it could fall on a different day depending on when you started this protocol, is going to be about, again, about 35 minutes of, for me, running, although it could be rowing or it could be cycling, it could be something of that sort. The goal of this workout is what's important.[1:09:16] Andrew Huberman: The goal of this workout is to tap into remember that long list that we talked about earlier where you've got skill and speed and power and strength and hypertrophy, etcetera, forms of endurance is to get into that range of endurance where your heart rate is elevated quite a bit more than zone 2, But they you're not really going all out sprint. So what that means for me is warming up for about 5 to 10 minutes. That could be jogging, a little bit of light THENX might even be hopping on a stationary bike, although, to be honest, I loathe the stationary bike. And then setting a timer and doing about 30, but Ideally, 35 minutes of what I call 75 to 80% of all out. Okay?[1:09:56] Andrew Huberman: Now I realize this Spits in the face of all you heart rate monitor wearing, super techie exercise types. But when I think of all out sprint, I think of 100%. And what is that? In my mind, that's somebody is chasing me with a needle full of poison, and I am sprinting away at maximal speed. That for me is a 100%.[1:10:19] Andrew Huberman: So after a brief warm up, what I'm going to do is go out, typically outside, although sometimes has to be on a treadmill if I'm traveling. And move, run for about 30 to 35 minutes at about 75 or 80% of that all out. What that means is that I'm striving to keep a steady pace, but in reality, I don't. I sometimes have to stop at a stoplight. There are cars.[1:10:42] Andrew Huberman: Please don't run into traffic just to maintain that speed and that timing. That would be terribly antagonistic to, In particular, lifespan. That running tends to be running in which I'm breathing hard, so I'm not able to restrict myself to purely nasal breathing. And I should have mentioned earlier, On the Sunday, long ruck or weighted hike or jog. If I'm alone, I try and do pure nasal breathing.[1:11:08] Andrew Huberman: If I'm with other people or I'm talking, obviously, I'm not gonna do pure nasal breathing because I'm talking. Although, I am sure that sometimes they wish I was doing pure nasal breathing. That Thursday workout accomplishes a number of things. First of all, it really gets my heart rate up, and it improves multiple aspects of endurance. Because as you recall earlier, The different bins of endurance that include muscular endurance, anaerobic, that 3 to 12 minute range and then 30 minutes or longer, none of them really precisely match what's accomplished in this 35 minute or so cardiovascular session where I'm pushing hard, but not all out.[1:11:44] Andrew Huberman: But that's exactly the reason to do it, which is that it taps into multiple fuel systems for the muscle and multiple aspects of the heart and capillaries and arteries and veins that are involved in generating that movement. So it really cuts a broad swath into multiple categories of endurance. And, also, just keep in mind what this foundational or optimal fitness protocol is really designed to do. In my mind, A foundational fitness protocol is one that leaves you or has you in a state where if you need to walk really far and carry a bunch of weight, you can do it. If you need to lift a heavy object with your legs, you can do it.[1:12:20] Andrew Huberman: If you need to run really fast for 2 minutes, You can do it. And if you need to run a little bit further, like, maybe in 10 minutes, for whatever reason, you can do that. So it's a really kind of all around fitness This program and that 35 minute run, again, could be swapped with a 35 minute or sometimes if you only have access to a stationary bike, you could do that. I suppose if you didn't have access to any equipment and running is not your thing, one thing that I have done, especially if I've been stuck in a hotel because I arrived late someplace and I really wanna get this workout in, could do the dreaded burpee. I know there are a lot of opinions out there.[1:12:56] Andrew Huberman: Some people think burpees are downright dangerous. Other people love burpees. You could do that. Or you could do Really fast but full jumping jacks. I know that's a little PE class.[1:13:07] Andrew Huberman: Right? Physical education class ish. But sometimes if I need to get the workout in, what I'll do in a hotel if I've arrived late, in particular day of travel, is I will find the stairwell the fire stairwell. I'll make sure, by the way, that I can get back into the building because I've been locked in those stairwells before, and I will simply walk really fast up the stairwell as many flights of stairs as there are, or maybe even jog it. Not quite sprint, but they run up those stairs over and over and over again in order to get that 35 minutes of 75 to 80% of max output Cardiovascular work done.[1:13:38] Andrew Huberman: And if I'm really just restricted to my hotel room, I'll just do jumping jacks for 30, 35 minutes, sometimes while watching something on TV. And believe me, if you're doing full jumping jacks, like really extending your legs, really getting arms overhead, and really doing the full movement, By the time you hit 5 or 6 minutes, you are going to be sweating and your your heart rate is really going to be up. I also sometimes will travel with a jump rope. I always Try and travel with a jump rope and skip rope, much to the dismay of the people who are housed below me in the hotel room. Skipping rope, I should mention, can Be a very effective way of getting cardiovascular training while you're on the road.[1:14:12] Andrew Huberman: But in all seriousness, if you're in a hotel room or an apartment And you can't really jump high and you're very good at jumping rope, what you'll find is it's not gonna get you into that higher elevated heart rate Zone. Okay. It can be great for zone 2 type training, but if you're really good at skipping rope, and I wouldn't say I'm really good at it, but I've done enough skipping rope that I can just kinda cruise and talk, and it it's more zone 2 ish. Even feels like walking at times. Now you can do double unders where you're, you know, really jumping and and putting the rope under you twice each time or crossovers, etcetera, depending on your skill level.[1:14:42] Andrew Huberman: But, again, if you're in an apartment or you're in a hotel, that's gonna be harder to do. And because there's some skill involved, sometimes you're stopping more often than you're continuing. By the way, and I I just have to mention this, a really terrific Instagram channel is Anna Skips. This is a teacher, a science teacher, or I believe it's a math maths, As they say in the UK, because she's in the UK, maths teacher. I don't know Anna, but I know she skips because she has this amazing Instagram channel called Anna Skips.[1:15:08] Andrew Huberman: And what's really cool about her Instagram is she shows you her progression from not being able to skip rope at all to the absolutely incredible types of, that she's doing each morning while getting sunlight, which, of course, is a essential health protocol. So check out Anna Skips on Instagram. Really inspiring and, made me wanna Get better at skipping rope. I'm still working at it. Okay.[1:15:28] Andrew Huberman: So with that Thursday cardiovascular, let's call it endurance, but cardiovascular training Workout done around rolls Friday. And on Friday, I'm going to do another cardiovascular training session. And I alluded to this earlier, but this cardiovascular training session is also designed to tap into some of the ability of Hard I should say high intensity interval training to tap into strength and hypertrophy increases for the legs. Because remember, we train legs on Monday, and what the science tells us Is that protein synthesis in a muscle group can be stimulated about every 42 to 72 hours, and so we've had Tuesday Off, Wednesday off, and Thursday off. And you don't wanna lose progress that you made from that terrific Monday leg workout.[1:16:21] Andrew Huberman: But in order to make sure that you can do the other things that follow in this program and pick back up on Monday with another leg workout, At least for me with my recovery abilities and my work schedule, I'm not gonna do an entire other leg workout because it's going to set the whole thing Out of whack, that is I won't be able to consistently do the same workouts on the same days of each week. Now with that said, a little bit later, I'll explain what happens if you have to miss a workout and how you can combine days, etcetera. But I really strive to get certain workouts done on certain days consistently, least as best I can. So Friday is high intensity interval training, and that can take a variety of different forms. For me, the ideal thing to do for me again, You could do something completely different.[1:17:03] Andrew Huberman: Exercise choice, again, should be governed by what you can do safely so you don't injure yourself And that you can perform effectively, and that gets you or provides you the stimulus that you want. And what I'm trying to do on Friday is get my Heart rate way, way up. Talked about this in the episode with doctor Andy Galpin. In addition to the benefits of getting a 180 to 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week Minimum, it's a really good idea to get up to that max or near max heart rate at least once a week, and you're not gonna do that for very long periods of time. You're not gonna do that for 30 minutes.[1:17:35] Andrew Huberman: You can't sprint all out for 30 minutes unless you're Steve Prefontaine. If you haven't seen the movies Without Limits or Prefontaine, you should absolutely see those. He was able to, you know, go out and run 12 laps what seemed to be an all out Sprint. We're close to it. Incredible.[1:17:51] Andrew Huberman: But most people are not going to do that, or gonna be carried away on a stretcher if they try. These high intensity interval training, for me, ideally, would be on so called assault bike or aerodyne bikes. So these are bikes that have the fan, Which, might seem like, oh, you know, it just cools you off. But actually, there's a lot of resistance there. So what I'll I will typically do is a 20 to 32nd all out sprint using arms and legs, and then 10 seconds rest, and then repeat.[1:18:19] Andrew Huberman: All out sprint for 20 or 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. And I'll do that for anywhere from 8 to 12 rounds, which, trust me, even if you start out a little bit less or I should say not all out intensity or effort, By time you hit the 5th or 6th one, you will be certainly headed into, if not near your maximum heart rate. Now what is your maximum heart rate? Do you need a heart rate monitor? No.[1:18:44] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like using that sort of thing, great. But, again, Andy Galpin beautifully supplied us with the information. He said, if you take the number 220 and you subtract your age, that for most people, most is going to be your maximum heart rate. Although for certain people who are very fit or certain ages, that's not going to apply. So it's a little bit too crude to measure, but it's a good starting place and you can look up other information or see that podcast episode.[1:19:08] Andrew Huberman: We provide a link to it in the show note captions if you wanna get more details Now I don't want to die, and please don't die. Right? If you're not in good cardiovascular health, do not just jump right into this fitness protocol. But I wanna get to the point where I really feel like I could not pedal any faster or pull any faster on the on the Assault bike, the Airdyne bike, or if I'm Doing this workout in a place or at a time or because I choose to not use a bike or a rower, because you could also use a rower, I will simply do sprint jog Intervals. I will sprint for 20 or 30 seconds, then jog for 10 seconds.[1:19:50] Andrew Huberman: Sprint for 20 or 30 seconds and then jog for for 10 seconds and just repeat. Used to have a big field next to my laboratory, my old laboratory, and I used to bring my bulldog, Costello, out there. He was really good at the 1st sprint part, and then he would just lie Down and watch. He didn't even do the jog part. I would just go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, panting like a bulldog nonstop, barely able to recover before sprinting again.[1:20:11] Andrew Huberman: And the basis of this workout, again, is several hope. First of all, it's to get the heart rate really high up towards maximum heart rate At least once a week, so you accomplish that this Friday. Also, if you are sprinting and then jogging or you are really pushing hard on an salt bite or an air dine bike We're using a, for instance, a skier or the skier machine or any number of different cardiovascular, training tools. You are going to get activation of the legs, of course, not to the same degree as you would with squats deadlifts or leg extensions and leg curls, that's simply not the case. But you're going to trigger strength and hypertrophy and other types of in those muscle groups.[1:20:52] Andrew Huberman: So this for me also represents the 2nd leg workout of the week where I'm not touching any weights. One important point that I don't think I've heard mentioned anywhere else, but that I hope to have doctor Kelly Starrett on the podcast to discuss and that I've discussed with him, 1 on 1, which is be careful with all out sprints or all out anything cardiovascular exercise. You can get injured doing those. So for instance, if you go out and you just sprint across a field all out 20 or 30 seconds and then walk back and can do it again and again, Don't be surprised if the next day you have some sciatica or even some pelvic floor pain. I don't recommend going all out On any movement that you can't perform with perfect form.[1:21:35] Andrew Huberman: Okay? So for me, I really try and stay away from All out sprints, I'll sprint at about 95% of what I can do because I find if I go all out sprint, I don't know what the reason is, but it might be an over of a limb or something like that. I'm not a sprinter. I'm not a sprinting coach. I do hope to get Stu McMillan on here or, Dan Pfaff.[1:21:54] Andrew Huberman: They were excellent Sprinting coaches, at some point, they're world class sprinting coaches, but I'm not a pro sprinter. I'm not even a amateur sprinter. I'm a, fitness sprinter. So the Airdyne or Assault bike or the rower is really a safer option for me. And if I'm Running or I'm doing some sort of movement where I'm unconstrained, really, in terms of how far my stride is.[1:22:15] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I'm obviously constrained by the musculature. I'm really careful to not Overextend or do something like that. And the only way to do that is to not go all out. So, again, the goal for this Friday workout is to really get the heart rate high, do high intensity interval training. There are number of different ways you could do that.[1:22:29] Andrew Huberman: You can look up HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find the one that's best for you, and really pick something that's safe that you can do consistently. And I believe that ideally will also trigger a bit of either strength and hypertrophy and speed, power, maintenance, or even give you a little bit of a stimulus So that by time you roll around to that leg workout on, again, on Monday, you've got a little bit of an additional boost to your leg strength, hypertrophy, Speed and power. So we've covered Sunday through Friday, and then Saturday rolls around. And Saturday is when You train arms, calves, and neck. So this may sound as if you're training a bunch of small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks, and calves.[1:23:11] Andrew Huberman: And that's true, but I should mention that you are also training your torso a second time, and you're doing it indirectly or sometimes not indirectly. Why do I say this? Well, keep in mind, again, that for strength and hypertrophy, you're going for that once about every 48 to 72 hours. You wanna stimulate that. On Wednesday is when you trained your torso.[1:23:33] Andrew Huberman: Right? Chest, shoulders, back, and neck. You've had Thursday to rest, Friday to rest. I know a lot of people are going to want to emphasize those body parts, and they're gonna think, oh, you have to train it twice a week. But if you have Modest recovery ability or low recovery ability, such as I do, and you're doing these other cardiovascular training sessions, etcetera, Well, then on Saturday is when you will train arms, calves, and neck directly.[1:23:59] Andrew Huberman: But included in that remember, 2 exercises per muscle group, 1 with a peak contraction, 1 with Somewhat of a stretch in there. Included in that, I suggest doing some sort of dip movement, which I think it was Pavel Satsulan said the dip is Synonymous with or at least similar to an upper body squat. Excuse me, Pawel, if I got that wrong. Maybe it wasn't you that said that, but, big admirer of his work. And, Certainly, the dip is a great exercise to hit multiple muscle groups.[1:24:26] Andrew Huberman: It chest, shoulders, and triceps, maybe even some back to some extent depending on how you do So doing some dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength, hypertrophy, etcetera, in The chest and shoulders and including some sort of pulling movement for the bicep like a chin up or palms facing Movement pulling up from to the bar, especially if it's a close grip type movement. But even if it's a wide grip type movement will, of course, Trigger strength and hypertrophy, maintenance or improvements in the biceps, but will also trigger strength hypertrophy in That lats in the back. Okay? So Saturday is this arm workout that I'll just give an example of a potential workout Where you might do a few more exercise, and maybe not just 2, but maybe 3 to make sure you get the torso indirect stimulation. So what would this look like?[1:25:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, this might be your sort of classic Dumbbell curls for the bicep and maybe incline curl for the bicep because it has more of a stretch, so on an incline bench. And then you might Finish with 2 sets of chin ups. So palms facing your chin ups or 3 sets of chin ups depending on whether or not you're in a heavier load month or a or a more moderate weight month. Again, activating the biceps muscles because arms day, but also activating strength and hypertrophy in the lats or at least maintaining it so that Because you're not training those torso muscles again until Wednesday, you're not allowing the hypertrophy and strength gains that you generated on Wednesday to atrophy, to disappear. Then thinking about triceps, it might be some sort of triceps isolation or peak contraction movement.[1:26:05] Andrew Huberman: So that could be tricep kickback or some Overhead extension would be more of a stretch type movement than a kickback, but then also doing regular old dips. You might even start with dips, which again are going to activate those torso muscles and the triceps. And then calf work in the same way that you did on Monday. And neck work, again, I am a believer in training neck multiple times per week. And if you are able to finish all of that in 45 or 50 minutes, Great.[1:26:32] Andrew Huberman: Most people will find when you're doing a lot of small muscle groups, it actually takes longer because you have to go around to more exercises. But, again, just adhere to the same principles we talked about before. About 50, 50 to 60 minutes of real work after a warm up with an asterisk next to that that if someone's on the equipment or you can't find the dumbbells you need, etcetera, Then maybe 75 minutes max, but really trying to not extend that workout too long, making sure that you activate the arms Directly, but also activating the torso muscles indirectly. And, again, I won't repeat it this time again, but following the same Weight and repetition and rest interval scheme that we talked about earlier, a bit heavier, lower reps, more sets, And longer rest for about a month and then alternating to more repetitions yet fewer sets. Right?[1:27:22] Andrew Huberman: Shorter rest intervals and do that for about a month. This carries through for all the resistance training workouts regardless of the day of the week. So we completed the total arc across the week, and we can summarize it as saying Sunday is, let's just say, long endurance. Monday is leg resistance training. Tuesday, heat cold contrast.[1:27:41] Andrew Huberman: Wednesday, torso training plus neck. Thursday, I would call it moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, so that 35 minute moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise. Friday, high intensity interval training of sprinting or some variation thereof. And Saturday, arms, calves, neck, and torso indirect work. That's the total structure, but I want to emphasize again, you do not need to start this on Sunday.[1:28:07] Andrew Huberman: That is you could make the long endurance work start on Tuesday and then just Fill in the rest as described before. It's really up to you. There's another important point I want to make, which is that Neither I nor anyone is going to be successful in doing the exact workouts on the exact same days of every week because of travel, work, illness, other demands, etcetera. The thing about the schedule that I like so much that I do believe that will benefit you as well is that you have some flexibility What's the flexibility? Well, let's say you train your typical Sunday workout of endurance, then you train legs on Monday, and then You don't manage to do your heat cold contrast on Tuesday for whatever reason.[1:28:51] Andrew Huberman: Well, you can put it on Wednesday. Just make sure that if you're going to do the cold stimulus that you don't do it too close, not within 4, ideally, 8 hours After the training of torso. But you could do it before, or you could do it just heat and skip the cold that Particular week. Right? Not ideal, but better than not doing anything.[1:29:13] Andrew Huberman: Let's say, for instance, the leg workout was particularly brutal. You don't sleep that well on Monday night or Tuesday night. Well, then should you do the torso workout on Wednesday? Well, I would say, why not move the heat cold contrast to Wednesday and then Push that torso workout to Thursday, and maybe also try and do that 35 minute run on Thursday every once in a while rather than lose the total control of the program and let everything shuffle forward. Here's the basic principle.[1:29:43] Andrew Huberman: I do believe that any one of these workouts, Whether it's for endurance or resistance training, can be shifted either one day forward or one day back. Right? You could delay it by a day or you could accelerate it by a day in order to make sure that you get everything done across the week. In fact, I would say the best way to think about this Foundational fitness program is not from the details up, but from the top down, from the big picture down to the And say to yourself, once a week, you're gonna get some long endurance in. Another day during the week, you're going to make sure that you get a kind of moderate, Faster endurance workout in.[1:30:21] Andrew Huberman: And then one other day during the week, you're gonna get an all out sprint high intensity Cardiovascular exercise workout in. You're gonna get those 3 workouts in somehow. And then in addition to that, you will also do Resistance training for every muscle group in your body, and that means doing your legs hard at least once a week, Your torso hard at least once a week and your arms hard at least once a week. And, of course, you are also paying attention to train your calves, and I do, for reasons I described before, believe that you want to train your neck at least to keep it strong. You may not want to generate hypertrophy there.[1:30:57] Andrew Huberman: People vary in terms of how quickly their Neck grows. Some people grows very, very fast. Other people, for the life of them, they can't get much hypertrophy in their neck. But keeping that neck strong, at least through some very light work to moderate weight work, Very, very important for reasons I stated earlier. If you set out those goals, then the Specific days that you do each workout isn't as critical, but the specific spacing is.[1:31:22] Andrew Huberman: So for instance, you're not going to want to do your high intensity interval training The day after you train your legs, because if you're doing that high intensity interval training correctly, you're going to be taxing your legs and Eating into their recovery, and so you wanna space them out by 2 or 3 days. So I think you'll notice that the point is really to optimize Everything on the whole rather than any one specific aspect of training or adaptation. Now that said, I do realize That some people might be hyper focused on things like strength and hypertrophy and the aesthetics that come with it. A key point about strength hypertrophy and weight training, And this is something that has been covered on multiple podcasts, certainly the one with Jeff Cavalier and with, doctor Andy Galpin and the one that I did on, building muscle Strength and Hypertrophy, the solo episode. And that is the following.[1:32:13] Andrew Huberman: It is the rare individual who has perfectly balanced musculature. Right? Most people can be a bit quad dominant or hamstring dominant or they have Trouble activating their glutes or somebody has a terrible time trying to activate their their chest muscles, but they're very strong in the back, etcetera. It's very clear That we can know that not just based on aesthetics, right, but based on deliberate contractability of those muscles. I don't wanna get into this in too much detail for sake of time, but this is something that has peer reviewed research to support it and was also discussed extensively with Jeff Cavaliere when he was a guest.[1:32:51] Andrew Huberman: And that actually, he's really popularized this notion, and it's absolutely true, which is that if you can Contract a muscle very hard to the point where it almost feels like it's cramping. If you can do that even when there's no weight in your hand or there's no resistance against it, so you're just Using your mind muscle connection to contract that muscle hard and isolate it, chances are you'll be able to generate hypertrophy and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating. So during all resistance training, that mind muscle link is really important, so much so that some people will even try and emphasize contraction of the muscles in between sets, etcetera. I personally because I'm not somebody who, likes a mirror when I workout, And I'm not somebody who, wants to spend time in between sets flexing muscles and etcetera. For whatever reason, I wanna actually rest between sets, and I'm more concerned with performance during sets and really putting my mind into the muscle during the set, I really try and emphasize deep relaxation between sets.[1:33:48] Andrew Huberman: And so here's a a tool that, again, is built out of science, And I should say peer reviewed studies, some of which are being done in my lab, but other labs as well, which is that in between sets, what I really Strive to do is to bring my heart rate down as much as possible, calm myself down as much as possible, and I'll do the so called physiological sigh in order to do that. That's Two inhales through the nose, back to back, and then long full exhale through the mouth. I did it partially there be for sake of time again. So a big deep inhale through the nose, and then sneak in a little bit more on a second inhale to maximally inflate the lungs and the aveoli of the lungs, and then Full exhale of all your air via the mouth to empty your lungs. That's the fastest way that we are aware of to calm your nervous system down.[1:34:34] Andrew Huberman: And, really, in between sets, you can use that to calm yourself down and conserve energy. But then as you move into the weight training set, You really want to ratchet up your focus and attention to the muscles that you're going to be using. Now I'd like to acknowledge that there's a huge range of parameters in terms of how to actually Perform during the set, you can focus on a particular muscle and try and, really isolate from the beginning of the movement. Some people really try and isolate it only during the peak contraction. Some people the negative.[1:35:01] Andrew Huberman: There's speed and cadence. There are again, remember, concepts are few. Methods are many. And if you're interested in the various methods of Eccentrics and concentrics and all the different ways of changing up cadence and so forth during sets. There's an enormous amount of quality information out there, far too much for to get into into detail now.[1:35:20] Andrew Huberman: But what I described, the general principles of how to set your mind, if you will, during the set, you should be focused on the muscles using and or moving the weight. If movement of the weight is more important, you can either focus on moving the weight or challenging muscles. Right? You can either try and isolate muscles and make specific muscles do the work or simply moving the weight. Moving the weight is simp is going to be more geared towards strength improvements, But focusing on the muscle, so called my muscle link, is going to shift that very same set more toward hypertrophy.[1:35:49] Andrew Huberman: I realize I'm painting with a broad brush here, but, nonetheless, This is grounded in the way that the nervous system governs muscular contraction. And while I think most people are familiar with the number of different variables associated with the resistance training, You know, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, etcetera. There are also a tremendous number of very important variables for endurance in any kind of cardiovascular training. And there are a lot of excellent resources out there about that. I think the most important one in fact, I will go on record What I believe to be the most important variable for any endurance or cardiovascular training is that because it's a repetitive movement, That you are able to complete the movement safely, meaning you're not putting your body into range of motion or into positions that can damage joints put you in any kind of compromised state.[1:36:40] Andrew Huberman: And some of you might think, well, that seems kinda silly. But if you've ever set the, for instance, the seat too high on a stationary bike and then done, You know, aerodyne or assault bike type, interval training sprints, if it's set too high and you're over striding as it were, the next day, you can really pay the price in of some back pain or sciatica, and sometimes that pain can extend for for quite a while. So, of course, you don't wanna approach any exercise with so much caution that it's neurotic and preventative, and yet you don't wanna Approach any exercise in any way that's so cavalier, forgive the pun, Jeff, that You're also going to compromise your the integrity of your joints and musculature and connective tissue. Let's talk about some real world practical variables. For instance, let's say you get a poor to terrible night sleep.[1:37:25] Andrew Huberman: Should you train the next day or not? Well, that really depends. I can honestly say I've had some of the best training sessions, resistance training or endurance training sessions after a really poor night sleep, But that's the rare event. More often than not, if I'm not sleeping well, I've had a terrible night sleep, the next day, I will just skip training that day. I know that will shock a number of you out there or perhaps you're already calling me names, weak, etcetera.[1:37:52] Andrew Huberman: But I find that if I've slept It's really poorly or I've had a very stressful event the day before and I don't sleep well. Training the next day sets me up for getting ill, and getting ill sets me up for not being able Training for multiple days. So it is my preference in that case to skip a day and really focus on recovery. And then as I mentioned earlier, slide that workout to the next day. And rarely double that workout Up with another workout, but then just slide the schedule forward by a day.[1:38:21] Andrew Huberman: But I really try and strive that is I really try to double up at least Some workouts later in the week in that case so that I can get back on schedule of starting the 7 day protocol again on the same day. I don't wanna be excessively vague there. What I'm trying to say is I try and adhere to the same schedule. But if I get a poor night sleep, I'll just simply skip the workout the next day, Slide the workout forward. There is one exception to that, and it's an important exception, which is there are times when I've not slept well or I've had some particularly Stressful event the day before and haven't slept well, but I'm able to do so called NSDR, nonsleep deep rest, the next day.[1:39:00] Andrew Huberman: So there have been times when I've only got 3 or 4 hours of sleep the night before, and I'm feeling really behind the ball the next morning. I really wanna get my workout in, so Instead, what I will do is a 10, but ideally, in that case, a 30 or even 60 minutes non sleep deep rest. And there's a 10 minute non sleep deep rest protocol, read by me, but it is a nonspiritual, nonmystical, science Supported non sleep deep rest protocol available on YouTube. You can simply put my name, Huberman, put NSDR and Virtusan, v I r t u s a n, Into YouTube, and you'll find that script. There are other NSDR scripts that you can find now on Spotify and on YouTube.[1:39:41] Andrew Huberman: And if you fall asleep during those non sleep deep breath scripts, That's great. And if you don't, you will also find that it will restore your ability to perform mental and physical work. So there are times when I haven't Gotten as much sleep as I would like or I'm feeling a bit more stressed for whatever reason, and I'll do NSDR, and then I will go train. And that often works Fabulously well for me, and then I don't have to skip a workout entirely just because I didn't get a good night's sleep. A lot of people ask whether or not you should train fasted or fed, and this is a very controversial Shilaria, I personally prefer to do my cardiovascular work not having eaten anything in the previous 3 to 10 hours.[1:40:21] Andrew Huberman: And typically, that's because I wake up and I'll do the cardiovascular training within about an hour of waking up. Sometimes later because my 1st meal generally falls generally, not always, falls around 11 AM. I don't do any kind of formal intermittent fasting, But typically, my meal schedule is somewhere between 11 AM, and my last bite of food is around 8 PM, but I'm not super strict about that. I might eat in, you know, as late as 9 PM, and I might eat something at 10 AM. If I wake up really hungry, I might have something before 11 AM.[1:40:49] Andrew Huberman: I'm not neurotic about it. But In terms of training, I like to train fasted, and that includes the resistance training workouts, and those come early in the day for me. And typically, if I'm going to train legs on Monday, for instance, which is when I train legs, I'll make sure that the night before, I'm ingesting some starch, some carbohydrate, like Rice or pasta or something of that sort to make sure that when I do that morning leg workout, I have enough glycogen in the muscles, etcetera. Again, nutrition is a somewhat controversial area. In fact, it can evoke very strong feelings because I know we've got vegans and we omnivores, and we've got carnivores, and people who are keto.[1:41:24] Andrew Huberman: This isn't really the format for us to get into all of that. I think the rule to follow is Figure out what optimizes your training for your particular training goals. For me, that most often means training fasted and then eating pretty soon after I train. And if it's a High intensity resistance training workout, and frankly, all of my resistance training workouts are pretty high intensity. I'm not going to failure on every set, but At least say about 30% of those sets, I'm going to failure.[1:41:51] Andrew Huberman: And the other sets, I'm working very hard nonetheless. Well, then I eat some starches after I train, and I also ingest some protein in the form of a protein drink or a meal that includes some protein food. But I don't like to eat before I do resistance training or not Or at least not within the hour or 2 before I do resistance training. There are exceptions to that, and I should say that the same basically applies to endurance work. If I'm going to Head out for a run.[1:42:14] Andrew Huberman: Typically, I don't want my belly full of food or any food at all, but there are times where wake up hungry, and I very much need to eat something or I have something scheduled socially like a breakfast, and I'll, have that breakfast. And then an hour or 90 minutes later, I'll do my workout, because I want to make sure that I finish the workout. I, again, am not neurotically attached to training fasted or fed. For me, fasted is preferred. But if I have to train fed, better to train than to not train at all.[1:42:42] Andrew Huberman: We haven't talked so much about flexibility yet, but we did an entire episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast on flexibility. And I encourage you to check out that episode if you're interested in increasing your flexibility. But the basic takeaway from that episode is that if you look at What I like to call the center of mass of the research, that is most of the studies and what the conclusions of most of the quality studies point to. So not the exceptions, but the kind of general rules that have been gleaned over time from multiple labs over multiple decades, etcetera. What you find is that static stretching that is Holding a stretch and, in fact, exhaling and relaxing the midsection and torso and Relaxing into the stretch as opposed to staying full of air and tense, but mentally and physically relaxing into the stretch, But not stretching maximally, that is not extending as far as you possibly can go, but more like 60% or even less, And then holding those static stretches for anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds and then repeating, doing that 2 or 3 times throughout the week for multiple muscle groups.[1:43:48] Andrew Huberman: So it could be your quadriceps, could be for hamstrings, for your lats, there are protocols out there. In fact, we have a newsletter that is focused entirely on protocols for flexibility and stretching. You can that again by going hubermanlab.com. You don't even need to sign up for the newsletter, although we invite you to if you like. But you can simply go there, Scroll down to the flexibility newsletter, and all the protocols are there for each of the muscle groups, etcetera.[1:44:11] Andrew Huberman: But what I typically try and do is some Stretching in the evening because I train in the morning as I'm perhaps getting ready for bed or if the TV is on, which in our house doesn't typically, go on because we don't have a TV. But, of course, there are computers and, you know, people are on their computers, etcetera. Well, I'll try and do some stretching while I do that. I also have a standing desk. So during the day at work, regardless of whether or not I train that morning or not or I'm gonna train in the afternoon, I'll try and do some static stretching for my hamstrings, my quads, My lats, my shoulders, my back really doesn't take much time, and I really try to space that out throughout the week, which if you look at the peer reviewed research, Matches well to what's known to be most effective, which are going to be short repeated sessions ideally every day, but truth told, I fail.[1:44:58] Andrew Huberman: I categorically fail. I was about to think of whether or not I ever stretch every day. I failed to do it every day, but I get about 3 or so stretching sessions per week. And, again, it's just static hold, trying to really relax into the stretch. Now the relax into the stretch is something has been Talked about in martial arts circles, and Pavel Satsulan has an excellent book on stretching.[1:45:19] Andrew Huberman: We can provide a link to that. Talks about this Has a lot to do with relaxation of the nervous system and the way that the nerves innervate muscles and allow for stretch, if you will. Also, the way that the tendons and ligaments are are innervated by nerves. The converse is also true. And here, again, this is a principle that, Pavel has put forth.[1:45:38] Andrew Huberman: I believe he calls it irradiation, meaning irradiating out or emanating out although some people don't like that term, Although some people don't like that term, can facilitate relaxation and stretching through a larger range of motion, so too can Contracting the core, the midsection, or gripping very tightly with the fist can facilitate muscular contraction because of the way that The nervous system heavily, we can even say, overrepresents the fists in the brain. And so how would you apply this to your overall A foundational fitness protocol. Well, it turns out that let's say you're doing, movements that involves, 1 limb moving and then the other. Say it's bicep curls just for sake of example. Turns out that you will actually be stronger in moving that dumbbell With the arm that happens to be moving, if you grip the handle very tightly, but also grip the handle of the opposite dumbbell very tightly.[1:46:42] Andrew Huberman: Now that said, in between sets, I encourage you to do the opposite, to try and completely relax in between sets, combine that with the physiological sigh. And then when the set the next set commences, employ that very strong grip both, again, of the of the weight that's moving and the and the weight that, At that moment, it might be stationary or an isometric position. So the nervous system, of course, is what controls muscles, And that operates in both directions. If you want to relax, try and use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs, and really concentrate on mentally and physically relaxing, in particular, your Core and your fists. And if you want to generate force, and you wanna move a heavy barbell or a dumbbell, you wanna do a chin up with the maximal force, That's when you can employ the opposite, which would be to grip the bar or dumbbell, etcetera, very tightly, and you want to contract your core or even Fill your body with air as they say plug all the leaks, etcetera.[1:47:35] Andrew Huberman: So this gets into kind of form and movement, which is an extensive, near infinite, landscape of discussion, again, that we don't have time to go into. I just want to mention those 2 nervous system related tips because, suppose as a neuroscientist, they appeal to me because they are grounded in fundamental principles of how the nervous system innervates muscle, and I know that they will benefit you the first time you use them and every time. Speaking of grip and nervous system and fitness and longevity, doctor Peter Attia, who's a medical doctor, was a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast and provided an enormous wealth of information on podcast episode. I really encourage you to check it out, when you have time. And, of course, has his own spectacular podcast, The Drive with Peter Attia.[1:48:13] Andrew Huberman: Peter Doctor Atiyah, I should say, often talks about certain movements or exercises that you should perform not just to improve your fitness, but also to touch into or measure How fit you are and how well you are progressing toward a long lifespan and health span. And one of those includes the ability To hang from a bar for a minute or longer. And there are a number of different expectations that one can have of How long they should be able to hang from a bar depending on their age and their fitness level, etcetera. Please check out doctor Atiyah's podcast and his Various social media sites to get more information on that. But what I can tell you is that if you're going to hang from a bar and you wanna hang from that bar as long as possible, which turns out to be a Interesting and important metric of your health, then gripping the bar very tightly will actually help.[1:49:01] Andrew Huberman: Earlier, we talked about whether or not to train if you're sleep deprived And how to recover from what I would say is moderate sleep deprivation by doing NSDR as opposed to total sleep deprivation, like up all night or having a truly miserable night, in which case, I think you should just skip training the next day and slide it forward. Now a similar issue comes up from time to time where People wonder whether or not they should train or not if they are sick. Here, there's all sorts of crazy, gym lore and Sport specific lore. For instance, I used to hear this. When I ran cross country, there was this adage that if the Symptoms were from the neck up, you could still train.[1:49:45] Andrew Huberman: That is if you were really congested and you had a headache, you could still run. Whereas if it was in your chest In your lungs, you couldn't run. I don't think there's any data whatsoever to support whether or not that's true or whether it's it's not true. For myself And because my general goal is to be training and fit over time, but also To include general health in the fitness equation, that is to not be sick or chronically sick, and certainly not to get other people sick. If I have a little tiny sniffle.[1:50:17] Andrew Huberman: Like, I think I might be getting sick. Even then, I'm a little cautious in the sense that I'm not going to do My typical workout, I might stop at about 15 minutes earlier, and I would do that not by, neglecting any body parts or anything of that sort. If it's a weight training workout by By simply reducing the total number of sets, I probably wouldn't do any sets to failure. If I did, I might reduce the total number or percentage of sets to failure from about 30% of sets to maybe closer to 10% of sets, something like that. And if it was endurance work, I might throttle back by 10 or 20 And I will shorten the total duration of the workout.[1:50:54] Andrew Huberman: And I often find that because of the known yes. Peer reviewed known Immune system enhancing effects of exercise, sometimes that alone will allow me to avoid getting sick. But, of course, I'm also careful to get home, take a hot shower, Not stress myself out if I can avoid getting myself stressed out and focus on sleep and SDR, other forms of recovery, good nutrition, etcetera. If, however, I have a real sniffle, a cold, I'm not feeling well, or I think I might be coming down with a flu, I absolutely do not train, and I don't get back into training of any kind until I'm completely recovered. So what I'm basically saying is that, no, I don't believe you should train if you're sick.[1:51:34] Andrew Huberman: And perhaps equally importantly, When you come back from a layoff of any kind whether or not because of illness or for whatever reason, I do believe that because your body is a bit Untrained, it's not ideal to jump right back into maximal training and to take 1, maybe 2 weeks of ramping up the to the full duration and intensity of workouts that then I would continue ongoing for however many cycles I can complete before I hit another sickness or I hit another gap in my schedule due to family obligations or other obligations, etcetera. So we've covered a lot of tools and protocols and variables related to fitness, but we have by no means covered all the available tools and protocols and variables. Before we wrap up, I do want to emphasize 1 tool. It's a very easy in fact, zero cost, very low time commitment tool. And this was one that was provided, again, by doctor Andy Galpin when he was on the Huberman Lab Podcast.[1:52:32] Andrew Huberman: And it's a tool that there's excellent research to support the Effectiveness of, and that I do believe should come at the end of every training session, and that's to do 3 to 5 minutes of deliberately slow breathing. It sounds so simple. 3 to 5 minutes of deliberately slowed breathing. So this could be while you're in the shower or when you arrive at your car. You might sit in your car quietly and do that if you have time or maybe even while you're driving Back to or onto your next destination just to really slow down your breathing, to really look at the recovery period that has to follow each training session and, of course, during which the adaptations, the changes that make you more fit than you were going into the exercise, occur.[1:53:18] Andrew Huberman: And that 3 to 5 minutes of deliberately slowed breathing has been shown in Andy's group and in related experiments, not exactly the same, related experiments in our laboratory and in other laboratories to really so called downshift the nervous system and really set you up for maximal recovery, Rapid recovery and allow you to lean into the next training session with full intensity when that training session eventually arrives. So it's a very simple tool, but a very potent tool for your overall fitness. So thank you for joining me for this discussion of what I'm calling a foundational, Or, yes, we could even get bold and call it an optimal fitness protocol. Although, the word optimal is a tricky one. There's no real optimal fitness protocol.[1:53:59] Andrew Huberman: And today, what I've really tried to focus Is this foundational protocol because it does allow you to check off most, if not all the boxes related to strength, Endurance, hypertrophy, speed, power, flexibility. It will also teach you how to regulate your nervous system Up and down, that is to ramp up and focus, mind muscle link, etcetera, and then quickly calm down physiological sighs, 3 to 5 minute decompress Breathing at the end of training, etcetera. Really, even though I talked about the protocol that I follow and, again, that we will provide as a newsletter at hubermanlab.com, If you wanna look at it in more detail, even though we talked about it in the context of what I do, again, I really want to emphasize that this Protocol and the description of this protocol and all its variables is really for you and for you to tailor to your specific needs. So please Take the protocol into consideration, but do not treat it as holy. Treat it as a starting point from which you can adapt it to your specific fitness needs.[1:55:01] Andrew Huberman: If you're learning from and or enjoying the Huberman Lab Podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
