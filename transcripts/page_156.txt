I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk is one of the most celebrated and accomplished professional skateboarders of all time. For more than 40 years, he has been at the forefront of the sport.[0:00:25] Andrew Huberman: And I don't mean just doing a sport for more than 40 years. I truly mean he has been at the forefront of skateboarding, developing new maneuvers, aka tricks that include incredible feats like the 900, a 900 degree spin in the air, as well as numerous other maneuvers that have really pushed the entire sport forward. He's also completely popularized the sport through his video game and through his ambassadorship for skateboarding. In fact, few, if any, names are synonymous with skateboarding in the general public as Tony Hawk, And he is, oh, so deserved of that title because for more than 40 years, he has shown up as the consummate professional. He is kind.[0:01:04] Andrew Huberman: He is respectful, And he is completely committed to his craft, and that shows up in every aspect of his life. He still, to this day, skateboards daily. And as you'll soon learn, He recently suffered a major injury, a complete break of his femur. That is the bone in his upper leg. And this is what many people would consider a career ending injury.[0:01:26] Andrew Huberman: Not only did Tony come back from that injury, but he went back to the very trick on which he broke his femur and recently completed that trick that is a 540 or so called mitt twist. I mention this because at every level of his life, Tony himself to be somebody with incredible drive, incredible vision, and incredible persistence. And today, we talk about that drive vision and persistence, And we talk about what it takes to set a goal and to continually evolve one's goal and to continually progress as A basically young preteen, as a teenager, as a young adult, as an adult, and well, let's face it. As a 55 year old man, he is now heading A little bit past middle age, although we do hope that he lives forever, Tony Hawk, aka the bird man, really does seem to be superhuman. But as you learn today, he is oh so human in the way that he shares his own experience and shares with you the ways in which we can each and all look at what we do And think about what we want to achieve and put our minds and our bodies to those goals and achieve them.[0:02:31] Andrew Huberman: I confess that today's discussion with Tony Hawk was thrilling one for me to have. I grew up in the sport of skateboarding. So I had met Tony previously, although he doesn't remember it. That was many years ago. In fact, I met his parents.[0:02:44] Andrew Huberman: You'll learn more about that story, during today's episode. But I was aware, of course, of Tony's accomplishments. I was also aware of his Philanthropy. So he has a skate park foundation. I also listened to his podcast with another professional skateboarder, Jason Ellis, Called Hawk versus Wolf.[0:03:00] Andrew Huberman: We provided a link to that podcast in the show note captions as well. But never before have I had the opportunity to sit down and talk to the Tony Hawk and learn from him. So I was absolutely delighted to have this conversation, and it far exceeded my already lofty expectations. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast Separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.[0:03:28] Andrew Huberman: In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, but no sugar. The electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health, physical health, and performance.[0:03:48] Andrew Huberman: Even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think, our energy levels, and our physical performance. Element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration, And it does so by including the 3 electrolytes in the exact ratios they need to be present. I drink Element first thing in the morning when I wake up. I usually mix it with Sixteen to 32 ounces of water. If I'm exercising, I'll drink 1 while I'm exercising, and I tend to drink 1 after exercising as well.[0:04:13] Andrew Huberman: Many people are Scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because, obviously, we don't want to consume sodium in excess. However, for people that have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are consuming Very clean diets, that is consuming not so many processed foods or highly processed foods. Oftentimes, we are not getting enough sodium, magnesium, and potassium, And we can suffer as a consequence. And with Element, simply by mixing water, it tastes delicious. It's very easy to get that proper hydration.[0:04:40] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element.com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase.

Tony Hawk, welcome.[0:05:56] Tony Hawk: Thanks.[0:05:57] Andrew Huberman: I'm particularly thrilled to have this conversation because I've tracked your career for a very long time.[0:06:05] Tony Hawk: Grew up[0:06:05] Andrew Huberman: in the skateboard thing.[0:06:07] Tony Hawk: I I know. Had your poster[0:06:09] Andrew Huberman: on my wall. Oh, thank you. Your your name is synonymous with skateboarding, as you know. I think a question that Probably get asked from time to time, but let's just clarify the data from the outset. Tony Hawk is your real name.[0:06:22] Andrew Huberman: Right?[0:06:22] Tony Hawk: Yes. Anthony Frank Hawk, but I never went by Anthony. My I mean, my parents call me Tony since I could remember. So[0:06:29] Andrew Huberman: It's a fitting name, given the sport and what you do. And we will get into this a little bit later when we talk about family and parenting and parents, but I'll allude to the story now that, when I was 14 years old, your parents took me in.[0:06:44] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:06:45] Andrew Huberman: I slept in your bed.[0:06:46] Tony Hawk: I know. In your home wild.[0:06:48] Andrew Huberman: Not with you in it, but surrounded by your a near infinite number of trophies. And I and I and and, It[0:06:55] Tony Hawk: must have been right after I moved out.[0:06:58] Andrew Huberman: So this would be I was 14 years old. Maybe I'll just tell the story now very briefly. I was 14 years old. I was at a contest at Linda Vista Boys Club. Yeah.[0:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Everyone left. Me and another kid named Billy Waldman, were still there. Your dad said, where where are you going? It was clear that I didn't know where I was going. My life was I was a wayward youth at that time, and so they took me in for, a night, maybe even 2 nights.[0:07:24] Andrew Huberman: Your mom, Nancy, and your dad, Frank, were so gracious, brought me in into your home, took me to dinner. I don't recall[0:07:32] Tony Hawk: does I mean, that tracks. That's yeah. That would that's my dad and my mom together would be doing that.[0:07:37] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Incredible people. And we'll get back to that story later because you and I actually met, the next day in Fallbrook, at your ramp.[0:07:44] Tony Hawk: But Oh, Fallbrook. So it had to have been 88, 89. That's right.[0:07:47] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna say I'm gonna say 89. Okay. And it must have been one of the either NSA or Castle contests Yeah. That your dad was very active in. Well, we'll get back to that, but, I have so many questions that relate to skateboarding to you and really As a neuroscientist to the whole concept of a life of continual progression because whether or not people listening Singing to this and watching this are skateboarders or not, and I imagine that most of them are not, it's absolutely clear that You've been in this game a very long time and that you've somehow managed to continue to progress over and over to come back from Very severe injuries and somehow keep getting better and better.[0:08:32] Andrew Huberman: So the first question I have is about the younger version of you.[0:08:36] Tony Hawk: Mhmm.[0:08:38] Andrew Huberman: Did you have any sort of self-concept? Like, you know, I I wanna be a pro athlete, or I wanna be a skateboarder, or I wanna have a video game named after me. Right? Right. Right.[0:08:50] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. You know, but If you can think back to maybe even pre skateboarding, do you remember what your self-concept was? You know, this notion of, like, I'm I have a a self, and I'm Either similar or different to other kids in some way.[0:09:05] Tony Hawk: When I was young, I was put in a lot of advanced classes, And not that that felt like a badge of honor. It felt more like I was just classified as a nerd. But then I thought, okay. Well, that's my strength, So I'll lean into that, and and I thought that maybe I would be a teacher because I thought, well, I I get all these concepts, and I think I could relate them to Kids or to to my peers, because I helped a lot of my classmates through some some classes. So That's all I really had.[0:09:36] Tony Hawk: I didn't know. And then when I would play sports, I would I would be okay. Mhmm. You know, I wasn't I wasn't terrible, but I wasn't the VIP or the MVP. And so I was just kinda playing basketball, playing, baseball.[0:09:51] Tony Hawk: And then when I found skateboarding, I mean, it was it was pretty obvious that that was what I wanted to do. It was once once I got on a skateboard and realized that I could maneuver it and do things That were unique. And not they're moving the needle or anyone cared, but they were unique in the sense of, like, I didn't I've never seen one do this. And this feels awesome, and so I just wanna do this. And so I didn't think that this is my career.[0:10:20] Tony Hawk: I was 10. So I just thought this is this is my fun this is this is my hobby. This is this is my thing, and I don't wanna play these other sports anymore.[0:10:29] Andrew Huberman: Did you Stop playing all the other sports.[0:10:32] Tony Hawk: I I quit I quit Little League in the middle of the season when my dad had been appointed president of That chapter of Little League. Because he was the coach, he was always very involved in all of his kids. I have 3 siblings, so he was always very supportive, whatever they were doing. And then when I was playing baseball, he became a coach because he had time, and he was doing that. He was he was, you know, almost retired.[0:10:57] Tony Hawk: And then he was such a prominent figure in the little league. They said, oh, you're president now. And so then someone else was coach, and then I was skating, and I was over it.[0:11:08] Andrew Huberman: Did you immediately start skateboarding in the parks on transition as we say, Or were you pushing around in the driveway like most kids?[0:11:15] Tony Hawk: It was I was transportation, and skating was kind of a fad. So I started in 78, roughly, maybe 77 even, and it was kind of a fad. So Kids just had skateboards, and they would they would all cruise around. You know? Like, it was the seventies, so everyone had a bike.[0:11:33] Tony Hawk: Right? And you knew wherever all the kids were because the bikes were in the front lawn. And then at some point, that kinda turned into skating. So everyone had skateboard. They were all, like, shitty You know, JCPenney or Mhmm.[0:11:49] Tony Hawk: Big box store skateboards. No one had really good one. Not in my area. But then at some point, we were just looking at these magazines and people skating and everyone's skating in pools because that was the Dogtown and Z Boys era, and it was like, guys are flying. I wanna like, where do we do that?[0:12:05] Tony Hawk: And then the skatepark opened up in San Diego.[0:12:09] Andrew Huberman: That's Del Mar Skatepark. Skatepark. Okay. Oasis.[0:12:12] Tony Hawk: Oasis skatepark was the first one in our area. Actually, I take that back. Spring Valley was the 1st skatepark. I tried to go there, and I was 9, and you had to be 10. And I remember, like, sitting in the parking lot, looking over the fence, and my dad didn't realize what the because my dad would have Easily lied for me, but he didn't realize there was an age limit.[0:12:33] Tony Hawk: And he said, how old is he? 9? Oh, sorry. He can't come. And then they closed Not long after.[0:12:38] Tony Hawk: So, wha, I never got to Skate Spring Valley.[0:12:41] Andrew Huberman: Because I I think of you as synonymous with Del Mar Skate Ranch.[0:12:45] Tony Hawk: Sure. Well, that was that came later because Oasis skatepark was opened that so this is when I first went, I was, like, 78. A friend of mine was going, and he said, I'm gonna go to the the skate park, so I had to go get you know, it's such a hassle. Like, I had to go get the authorization form. I had to get it notarized by the bank My parents, like, to go there, and then I went and it was that was my epiphany.[0:13:10] Tony Hawk: When I first saw people flying around in person, was like, this is what I'm doing for as long as I could possibly do it because it looked it looked like magic. It really did. It looked like they were flying on magic carpets, and And it spoke to me in the sense of being a daredevil, but also doing it individually, not relying on my team, not, getting getting hassled by a coach, it was just like, oh, I can be part of the scene, but do it my own way. And then, I skated Oasis as much as I could as whenever I get your rides there. And, then my parents moved to North County San Diego when I was in high school, mostly because they were just Chasing kind of real estate deals and, and so I got lucky that Del Mar Skate Ranch was right there.[0:14:04] Tony Hawk: Every other park closed, The Del Mar Skate Ranch remained open. So, I mean, there was a bit of luck to all that, and it was based on geography.[0:14:13] Andrew Huberman: Your dad's involvement is Interesting because I got into skateboarding because, you know, my dad wasn't around that much at that time. A lot of kids get into skateboarding because it doesn't require parent involvement. Was it unusual to have parental involvement at that stage?[0:14:29] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:14:29] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I remember Frank. And, by the way, I remember Frank and Nancy, your parents with with such fondness. Not just because they took me in, but I remember thinking, like, they're They were at times the only point of stability in a landscape of, like, 200 people where, as you know, there could be, like, potential chaos of any kind. Always. And your dad had this way of moving about.[0:14:48] Andrew Huberman: Like, he wasn't afraid I recall that he wasn't afraid to say what he thought. Like, hey. Don't do that. Like, impose some regulation at these contests. And at the same time, it seemed he also understood that this was a sport unlike other sports.[0:15:00] Andrew Huberman: Like, you're not gonna regulate kids like me at the time, or, you're not gonna try and control people. So what was it like to have your dad involved? And the reason I ask is that you're a parent. We'll talk more about parenting. But, also, it seems That he went from saying, okay.[0:15:15] Andrew Huberman: You know, little league, other sports, which is more typical to, okay, this kind of unusual sport, skateboarding, but your mere interest in it was enough to get him excited or motivated enough to take you around to these places. That's pretty special. I mean, that's pretty unique.[0:15:32] Tony Hawk: I mean, and and in that respect, it was great to have his support and and to rely on him for that. The fact that he was always around and that he was in charge of of a lot of the events, that that sucked because because it just marked me, as One being favorited, and spoiled. And and most of my friends, their parents didn't want them skating. So even though they were stoked that my dad had was was doing this kind of thing and giving that kind of support, they still were like, your your dad's here. Like, this is our thing.[0:16:07] Tony Hawk: This is our scene. This is our getaway from our parents. I I didn't really have a choice in the matter. I did I did, at some point, Tell him my my concerns and my, frustrations with it, but he didn't really wanna hear it. You know?[0:16:24] Tony Hawk: He was He was very much steadfast. Like, well, I'm I'm been coming this far. Like, you can we can keep our distance at these events, but people are relying on me to organize And so I just had to suck it up for a while.[0:16:38] Andrew Huberman: Did it push you harder? Like, you know, if you could prove yourself with a skateboarding, then you didn't have to worry about any claims of favoritism. Because ultimately Yeah. You can't fake you can't fake skateboarding. Right?[0:16:48] Andrew Huberman: I mean, there's no deep fake version of skateboarding. No. You know? You either can do it or you can't do it, and it's shown in real time. So, and I suppose back then, I recall you were you're quite a bit Skinny or skinnier?[0:17:04] Tony Hawk: Oh, yeah. Oh, I had I had all kinds of things going against me at the time. Yeah.[0:17:08] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I don't think people realize this unless they've met you in person, but Nowadays, there are few taller skateboarders out there because the sport's grown so much, but you're pretty tall. You're, like, 663. But Okay.[0:17:19] Tony Hawk: I was not when I was When I was that age, I was very small, and kind of concerningly small because By the time I got to be 16, I was still I looked like I was 13. I used to get pulled over. I literally like, I had a car that I bought with my earnings. I had a Honda Civic 1977 CVCC, and I would get pulled over. Then the cops would be like, how how old are you, again?[0:17:49] Tony Hawk: 16. Like, well, you looked like you were 13 back there. And then I shot up around age 17.[0:17:57] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So that's interesting, and we can get back to this when we talk about your almost remarkable levels of ability to recover from physical injuries because, well, I'll just share a little bit of a biological theory here, which is that, you know, there are a lot of people who study longevity, and Perhaps the fastest rate of aging that we ever undergo is puberty. Right? If you think about a kid before puberty, kid after puberty,[0:18:20] Tony Hawk: it's like[0:18:21] Andrew Huberman: different human being psychologically, often physically as well. Some people have a longer arc of puberty than others, and that does seem to correlate with a longer life. And so it's kind of interesting. You know? Some kids hit puberty, and they go through all the markers puberty in, like, 1 summer.[0:18:35] Andrew Huberman: Right. Other kids, it's very, very long, and it sounds like we don't have to talk about when you hit puberty and the other markers, but it sounds like your growth spurt occurred late.[0:18:44] Tony Hawk: Oh,[0:18:44] Andrew Huberman: yeah. That's a terrific marker of a long life, by the way, because what it reflects is the onset of a big burst of growth hormone out of the pituitary and The brain. And if you continue to grow for a long period of time, that indicates you know, it gives you a little bit of the the slope of the line. Does that make sense?[0:19:01] Tony Hawk: Oh, yeah. So Sure.[0:19:02] Andrew Huberman: This this may, have important and fortunate consequences. So at 17, you shot up. Am I correct in remembering, maybe you said it. Maybe somebody else did that you were, forgive me, but so skinny when you were a kid that you actually wore elbow pads as kneepads?[0:19:17] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Yeah.[0:19:18] Andrew Huberman: That's a true that's a true story.[0:19:19] Tony Hawk: For Sure. And and I took inspiration from others that that I identified with, namely Steve Cavallaro, because he was already An established pro when I started to come up in the ranks or even get noticed at all, and he was wearing elbow pads on his knees In this full page picture of him and Winchester doing a backside air, and I was like, that I wanna do that, and he's small. And I feel like that's my goal. Yeah. And Stevie say, like, if he can do it, I can do it.[0:19:48] Tony Hawk: It was just more like, oh, this I identify with that, and and That gives me hope. And[0:19:54] Andrew Huberman: as I recall, Stevie also has a pretty severe scoliosis. Right?[0:19:57] Tony Hawk: Like, at one point scoliosis what he has.[0:19:59] Andrew Huberman: He At one point, he was turned turned pretty pretty tight To the to the right or left, I don't recall which I mean, still incredible skateboarder. Loves Stevie. He's a NorCal guy, so[0:20:07] Tony Hawk: I grew up around that. Whatever he had is from birth, but But it was more that that his size, and I didn't even know he was many not many, but, you know, he's, like, 4 years older than me. So I just was like, oh, there's small guys doing that. I I can do it maybe. But when I got tall, when I went through puberty, suddenly, I had all these tricks, and then suddenly, I had the the strength and the the height that gave me confidence.[0:20:37] Tony Hawk: And so all of a sudden, it was like, oh, I can go way higher now, and I'm comfortable with these tricks, these intricate Board maneuvers and stuff, so that was a huge advantage to me. The the smaller stuff felt different after that, which was harder. Mhmm. But being able to blast 8 feet in the air as opposed to 4 feet in the air was a huge advantage.[0:21:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Isn't that wild when the nervous system knows how to do something, and then your body changes, and you can do the same thing, but with so much more force.[0:21:09] Tony Hawk: Even the bowls look smaller. When I would stand on top of it, I was like, wait. This isn't that big.[0:21:16] Andrew Huberman: It's wild. Well, the reason I ask about this, I think, you know, people listening Generally seem to assume that, you know, if you become a Stanford professor or become a professional skateboarder or you professional soccer player that that You were just fated to become that. Right? And it's clear that it's the confluence of so many different factors. But one of the consistent factors for sure is a sense that you just really love doing it.[0:21:40] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, I can't imagine getting, you know, proficient or Excellent at anything without loving doing it. Right? And so still at this time when you were, let's say, 14, 15, did you Have any concept of, you know, I'm gonna have a pro model. I'm gonna none of that.[0:21:57] Tony Hawk: Well, there was there was none of that to be had. So we didn't have these great aspirations because no one had really done that before. There were you could have some success. Yes. You could have maybe a signature model, but even the top sales of skateboarding then wasn't a career.[0:22:16] Tony Hawk: The prize money was $150 for 1st place, 100 for 2nd, 50 for 3rd.[0:22:23] Andrew Huberman: Couple tanks of gas, some food.[0:22:25] Tony Hawk: Yeah. So let's put it this way. I turned pro when I was 14. By the time I was 15 and a half, and I had a a learner's permit, and I could drive, a scooter. You know?[0:22:39] Tony Hawk: I had $600 in my bank account, And I used that to buy a Honda Express, moped for a year and a half. That was my earnings. It was $600.[0:22:49] Andrew Huberman: So, clearly, money wasn't the, the dopamine hit. It was the it was the actual skateboard.[0:22:54] Tony Hawk: Sure. And that's what I mean, though. There wasn't there was no goal of that because It just didn't exist, so I I didn't care. Like, are you kidding me? I I have my own vehicle at age 15.[0:23:04] Tony Hawk: Like, I was living large. I can get to the skatepark on my own. That was amazing.[0:23:09] Andrew Huberman: To be 14 and be a professional at anything must be, a a trip, so to speak. But what I'm wondering about because I came up when, your early cohort with Pau Peralta. So for those that don't know, so called bones brigade. Mhmm. Right?[0:23:27] Andrew Huberman: I guess it was with total, what, like, 6, 7 guys. There were some that were a little more peripheral than others. There are about 6, 7 core guys, in the various videos. I mean, you guys were famous. Right?[0:23:37] Andrew Huberman: You had posters, on Kids Walls who skateboarded, there was a second or maybe it was a third surge of popularity in skateboarding, because It would sort of surge in general popularity then disappear and come back as it has over decades. It keeps coming and going, to some extent. Did you have a conscious awareness of just how, you know, how much attention was being placed on, you know, photos of you, videos of you? And I'm just wondering about the younger version of you whether or not, You know, you realize what was happening. And the reason I ask is because you've always seemed to me somebody who, through interviews, through videos, through our interactions, And for those who have known you much longer than I have, just very grounded, like not caught up in it.[0:24:23] Andrew Huberman: You know, we've never seen headlines about You kind of just, you know, blowing all your money or, you know, wrecking cars and, you know, destroying your life. I mean, I'm sure you've made mistakes like any of us, but But you seem to have avoided a lot of the pitfalls of, quote, unquote, famous people and celebrities, and yet you were a famous person from a very young age.[0:24:43] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I I well, I think it was that I didn't never I never that was never a goal. And then when I had a sense of it, I was very uncomfortable. I mean, I was happy. I was happy to be successful.[0:24:56] Tony Hawk: I was happy that people recognize me. That that was amazing. Just because I was good at skateboarding, I never imagined something like that. And but I was always very I mean, some people thought that I was sort of almost, like, pompous or arrogant because I wasn't interacting because I was just I was walled up. I was like, I know what to do.[0:25:15] Tony Hawk: I don't know. Gosh.[0:25:16] Andrew Huberman: This is a this is a last words I would ever use to describe you.[0:25:19] Tony Hawk: I think it was just more that that that people would see me like I'd go to a ramp. I didn't know anybody, and I would just start skating, and do all my stuff, and they were like, oh, he doesn't even talk to anyone. And it and it was like, I don't know I don't know what to do.[0:25:31] Andrew Huberman: I don't know how to act. And so you're 14 years old.[0:25:33] Tony Hawk: Right. So Stacy Broke me out of that because I remember one time there was a kid that was just staring at me, like, holding my skateboard. He had my signature model, and he said, go say hi to that guy. What? Are you sure?[0:25:44] Tony Hawk: Like, He wants he wants to interact with you. You know? Just go high five him or anything, and and I learned to sort of break out of my comfort zone by doing that Enough. But my 1st go around I mean, that was that was sort of my first, wave of fame, I'd say, the bones brigade years. And we are so young that we thought this is forever.[0:26:07] Tony Hawk: And so we are definitely careless with our Our money with our actions. And, and at some point, my dad saw that he didn't think it was gonna be long term because no one had had a long term career. Right? So he he, encouraged me to to Invest to get property, like, to to buy a house. That was the that was my saving grace because I definitely was Spending.[0:26:36] Andrew Huberman: On cars and things of that sort?[0:26:38] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Car. Like, kind of a little bit beyond my means. I wasn't really considering all my money was Was 10.99 income, so it wasn't we weren't paying taxes on anything. And at the end of the year, it'd be like, oh, you owe this much.[0:26:49] Tony Hawk: Like, wait. What are you talking about? So, For instance, hey. Do you wanna go to Hawaii? Yeah.[0:26:56] Tony Hawk: Okay. Invite everyone. We're all going to Hawaii. I got well, let's rent a place. Okay.[0:27:02] Tony Hawk: You know? And it was on me because I had the means.[0:27:05] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned Stacy. We should probably clarify for people. Tony's referring to the great Stacy Peralta.[0:27:12] Tony Hawk: Yep. He was he was the one who put me on the bones brigade. When I was still considered sort of a Circus act. Like, you know, my my skating was not really established. The stuff that I was doing was largely made fun of because people thought That what I was doing was just more like a free show.[0:27:32] Andrew Huberman: Can you explain more? So my and let me just tell you that my recollection first recollection of you That I still have that image in my mind would, is the finger flip air.[0:27:41] Tony Hawk: Mhmm.[0:27:42] Andrew Huberman: Right? You know? So for folks that aren't familiar with skateboarding, you know, people Right around on transition or in the street, handrails, stairs, you know, people are probably familiar with all those things. But, skateboards will ride up toward the top of the pool or the ramp, and they'll do something on the so called lip or the That's to ride at the the edge of it, or they'll go above it, like, in the air, but I recall seeing you do the finger flip error. I'd never seen anyone flip a board in the air.[0:28:03] Andrew Huberman: I'd seen people Do varial. So Right. Move it. This is gonna be complicated for people just listening, but just just flip it upside down and then catch it in and finger flip air.[0:28:12] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:28:12] Andrew Huberman: That was I remember that was Jaw drop. Right? It was like So if that was considered circus era or circus, like, then I don't know I don't know what it was being compared to because At the time, we we probably watched that. It was in slow motion as I recall, and we probably watched it three Thousand times. You know, that summer, there's a big group of us that all started skateboarding that summer.[0:28:36] Tony Hawk: I would say kinda just before that in that window is when people were were more giving me flack for what I was doing because I was mostly doing board variation stuff, But I still didn't have the height. The height in terms of the The height in terms of in terms of Yeah. Getting in the air. Yeah. So I was doing all this stuff kinda right at coping level, And so people weren't taking it into consideration or giving it much merit because it was just like, oh, he's doing a little board twist or a board turn.[0:29:06] Tony Hawk: And then when I started to get some height Around the time you saw and started doing those tricks, like, visibly way up high, that's when the the The shift happened in terms of more acceptance, but I was still labeled as a as, like, a trick skater, robot skater. And then you had Christian Hosoi who was all style, is higher than anyone. Anytime he did a trick, it was gonna be so flashy And so amazing.[0:29:36] Andrew Huberman: And rock star personality.[0:29:37] Tony Hawk: And rock star personality. And so in that era, you I mean, it was very divided. It was like, no one liked us both. You know what I mean? It was just so strange to be of that age and of doing something that had never really been established and then something I'm pitted against Another skater, we're just trying to make our way through teen years and and skateboarding, and and, It got it was it was hard.[0:30:08] Tony Hawk: I mean, it was like, I got I got bullied. Mhmm. You know? Yes. I was successful.[0:30:13] Tony Hawk: Yes. I was doing but but I would get I would get, Thrasher Magazine would talk shit about my performance when I would win.[0:30:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I remember that because I was from Northern California, and Thrasher Magazine is a skateboard magazine from Northern California. Actually wrote for them for a while when I was a postdoc to make some extra money, under a different name, folks, but you can try and find those articles. They're out there. And then in Southern California, it was Skateboarder Mag, Transworld, mostly Transworld Skateboarding.[0:30:39] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:30:39] Andrew Huberman: It was[0:30:40] Tony Hawk: it was Transworld Transworld Skateboarding and Thrash Magazine where the[0:30:43] Andrew Huberman: where the the rivals. Right. Yeah. So, yeah, I recall, some of those things that were said. It just is amazing to me, but it brings about a really important lesson, which is, you know, that kid that gets made fun of, If they're determined and they love what they're doing, that's gonna be the kid that blows everyone away later.[0:31:01] Andrew Huberman: And I know this for sure because I'll never forget their do you remember the back to the city contest that were called in San Francisco? So I went to those. They were in the drain fountains in front of city hall. I remember getting there one day, and there was this guy with kinda like Afro like hair Pushing around, he was doing what are called Daffies. He had 2 skateboards.[0:31:17] Andrew Huberman: He was kinda, like, weaving around. And I remember thinking, you know, San Francisco's got its issues now, but back then, it Was rough also Yeah. For different reasons. I remember thinking like, this guy's gonna get beat up. I hung out with the Embarcadero crew.[0:31:29] Andrew Huberman: I was like, this guy's gonna get beat down. Yeah. That guy was Mark Gonzales.[0:31:33] Tony Hawk: Oh, yeah.[0:31:33] Andrew Huberman: So one of the greatest perhaps the greatest street skateboarder, if you can't really define these things greatest and whatnot in skateboarding. But, you know, I remember thinking this guy is just he's a kook, and then I realized who it was. Yeah. And then I realized he was just Like any other kid there at some level. And then a lot of the kids that got teased early on, they stuck with it.[0:31:54] Andrew Huberman: 5 years later, I'm singing them in the magazines. And I think about this with podcasting too. There been some podcasters that have reached out early on and had questions. You know, look at their stuff and, you know, one's initial impression can be like, what are they, what are they doing here? And then you just see them 2 years later or 3 years later, and they're doing amazingly well.[0:32:10] Andrew Huberman: And you're like, this guy or gal is here for good. They're gonna they're probably gonna be top of the game in a few years, so you never count anybody out. When you would go to sleep at night in that era, you, like, laying on the pillow going like, oh my god. People hate me. There's stuff in the magazines.[0:32:24] Andrew Huberman: I gotta push harder. This is hard. Did you talk to your dad about it? I mean, again, it's a lot To bear even as an adult, I can only imagine what it's like to bear as a 15 year old kid.[0:32:35] Tony Hawk: I didn't really have a support group, You know? Or any resource to to voice those concerns. I just knew I wanted to keep getting better. That was it. And so, if anything, if I was worried about those voices, if I was worried about the Whatever take people had on me, I knew I was just gonna go back to the skate park and learn more tricks.[0:33:00] Tony Hawk: And at some point, I had so much of that as a foundation that it was Sort of undeniable that, like, well, he he can do all this stuff, and he doesn't doesn't just do it at his home park. And I think that's probably when the tide turned for me is when when I started to do well at other events, namely Upland pipeline, which was, For the most part, the most frightening pool that we could ride.[0:33:29] Andrew Huberman: The thing was big, but I also recall, like, the the hips as they're called, like,[0:33:42] Tony Hawk: It's pulling your kneepads down.[0:33:43] Andrew Huberman: I didn't know that because from the photos, I wouldn't know that.[0:33:45] Tony Hawk: Oh, it was it was treacherous. It really was. Like, it was and and I Wanted to do well at the event, and I would drive up there every weekend. Like, my friend, Greg Smith was a freestyler, but he lived near Upland. And so I would go Drive Friday after school, straight to Upland, skate at night, skate Saturday all day, skate Sunday, early, and then drive home, because I live in San Diego.[0:34:11] Tony Hawk: And I just made it my mission to to figure that thing out because That was the proving ground for me. I'm a and so if I could skate that, I could go skate anything.[0:34:22] Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, But oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adapt Gins to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one.[0:34:53] Andrew Huberman: I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better, and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer, AG one. If you'd like to try AG one, go to drink agonedot com/huberman to claim a special offer. From now until August 12, 2023, AG one is giving away 10 free travel packs plus a year supply A vitamin d three k two.[0:35:17] Andrew Huberman: Again, if you go to drink a gone.com/huberman, you can claim the special offer of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two. So it's clear you had enormous drive. Let let's talk a little bit about, the process of Trying tricks, the anxiety associated with it. Did you did you and do you have a sort of systematic process? Was it, You know, I'm gonna learn the basics first.[0:35:42] Andrew Huberman: Like, did you say that? Did you say, okay. I'm gonna learn how to do stuff, you know, at coping level, then I'm gonna do a little air, then I'm gonna go bigger, I'm gonna do this, Or, did you just sort of, try what you wanted to try? And, obviously, you weren't haphazard about it. Like, how it seems you're pretty systematic about exploring what's possible and then pushing forward little by little.[0:36:03] Andrew Huberman: But, yeah, maybe you could talk a little bit about how you Have conceptualized. Okay. Tomorrow, I wanna try this.[0:36:11] Tony Hawk: It comes in different forms, but For the most part, I think about how I could combine existing tricks. And would this trick work going into this trick? And could your body position shift, or would it all work in unison? And when I approach a new trick, I I'm say I'm saying more in the last 20 years. My thought process is I have all the pieces to this.[0:36:38] Tony Hawk: I've done every bit of it. I've done the I've done the 1st part of the trick in another form. I've done the 2nd part or the grinding of it or whatever, Usually, in some other basic way, and then the landing is well, the landing is from whatever that is. And if you can throw all those things together And make the timing work, it's gonna work. And I I never I never went at something with some hap hazard approach or Throwing caution to the wind.[0:37:09] Tony Hawk: Like, hope this see what happens. It's always very much like, I know I have all these things. And so I just have to put them together. And, I mean, now things are so technical that my same approach that I'm doing hundreds of times, one of them just works. And it's not because I didn't it's not because I committed to that one.[0:37:28] Tony Hawk: It's because of some tiny fractional adjustment that happened that I didn't even know happened, and it just worked. And, I mean, that kinda is the curse of what tricks are now because there are plenty of moves that I've done over the last 10 years even that I I I only did once because it was too fucking hard to get to, and I didn't learn from that one make. And that that is that's hard to accept because in the past, I was learning tricks to have them in my arsenal that I could just throw them down at a competition or a demo. I've got that in my pocket. These days, like, that trick, for instance, I did a I did a 3 60 shove it, 5 o to fakie.[0:38:10] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Let's let's break that down for you. 360 shove it. So who's gonna take this on? I'll let you take this on.[0:38:14] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I can try it from my knowledge and perspective, but why Alright. Well, what do you what do you[0:38:18] Tony Hawk: talk about? Shove it is Pushing the board with your feet and letting it spin a full 3 60 rotation under your feet and then landing back on it. It's it's a trick that people do on usually on flat ground. I've learned I've learned to do it up on the vert walls. Like, I can do 3 60 shove its kind of in the air, but I'm doing that.[0:38:40] Tony Hawk: I'm doing a 3 60 shove it, and then I'm landing on my truck. Right?[0:38:44] Andrew Huberman: Like the axle between the wheels.[0:38:46] Tony Hawk: Yep. 1 axle in a what we call a five o position, which is basically a wheelie on the truck. So Everything is so precise. I gotta do 3 sixty shove it at exactly a certain spot on the wall. I've gotta catch it so that my truck lands when my foot hits it.[0:38:59] Tony Hawk: I can't push it into the truck because that that screws up my balance. So it has to land on the truck. I have to land with my weight perfectly Set back enough that I can come in backwards because I'm doing this trick, and and I'm I'm gonna come in faking. Right? 360 shove 5 o to coming in forward is is a whole different beast.[0:39:23] Tony Hawk: That that I could probably do that just in a few tries. But the idea that I have to land on this thing, balance on it like a teeter totter, and then reverse my energy and come in fakie. Backward. It's so hard. It's so hard to to get into the right position.[0:39:40] Tony Hawk: So, like, anytime I try it, There's, like, a 1 in 10 chance I'm even gonna get into the position I need, and that's the one I have to commit to. So every time I do it, it's so intense, and it takes so much So much commitment and and so much mind. I don't even know how to explain it. Like, the the That you have shut everything else out except this one moment and this 1 fractional piece that you have to make work, And it I've done it once. And I'd like, I would love to do it again, but I know what it's gonna it's gonna take the same amount of effort.[0:40:21] Tony Hawk: I didn't learn from that one that I made some trick that makes it happen every time. It's all so technical, and there's so many things that can go wrong that I'll accept that, okay, I did it once.[0:40:33] Andrew Huberman: In thinking about the 3 sixty show at 5 o fakie, was that something that you thought of the night Or you decide that day do you ever use visualization? Have you ever had, learning come to you in a dream or find that you try, try, tried something, went to sleep that night, next day, made it, Anything like that?[0:40:50] Tony Hawk: Yes. Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night, and I'll write down something because it was like, oh, there's this trick. Oh, I think I could do that. Yeah. Okay.[0:40:57] Tony Hawk: Let me write it[0:40:58] Andrew Huberman: down. You dream about skateboarding from time to time?[0:41:00] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Well yeah. That has shifted a bit after I got hurt, but, yeah, I used to dream that I can't skate. Like, I'm trying and that it feels like the ramps made a carpet. I can't get the speed.[0:41:12] Tony Hawk: I can't get the timing. And then as I went through this traumatic injury, my Dreams shifted to, wow. I can skate. I can do all my tricks again.[0:41:19] Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting. Yeah. A little, piece of science around the can't, Can't skate piece or when people feel like they're bolted down in a dream or they can't run away[0:41:28] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:41:28] Andrew Huberman: There's this one phase of sleep called rapid eye movement sleep where the brain is very active. The dreams associated with it tend to be very vivid, and at the same time, we are completely paralyzed. And the idea is that no one really knows why, but that it's the case that we're paralyzed to prevent us from acting out our dreams. It's also an interesting neurochemical phenomenon because during these rapid eye movement dreams, they tend to be very intense, but the body can't release adrenaline. So it's almost like its own form of trauma therapy.[0:41:57] Andrew Huberman: It's like you're experiencing this intense thing in your mind, but your body can't react.[0:42:00] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:42:00] Andrew Huberman: And so oftentimes, people, have argued that that's why you feel like you want to move and you can't because you actually can't.[0:42:07] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:42:08] Andrew Huberman: Some people have woken up while still a bit paralyzed in REM. Have you ever had that happen? We wake up[0:42:12] Tony Hawk: and I I but, actually, a couple of my kids have have struggled with that a couple times.[0:42:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. REM interference is called it's not dangerous, and usually people can jolt themselves out, but it's kinda terrifying. So that's interesting. So we'll get to a discussion about the the recent injury and, Thankfully, recovery from the injury, not miraculous because that makes it seem as if it's surprising. Frankly, I'm not surprised that you've recovered, But it is, spectacular, the way you have.[0:42:37] Andrew Huberman: But you're saying that in your dreams before the injury, you would about skateboarding, but you felt like there was a kind of can't do it[0:42:45] Tony Hawk: for me. When I was doing it in my dream, there was always some roadblock That I just I like, why can't I get any speed? Why can't I why can't I snap or do this trick? It's more in the moments where it's Twilight moments where I'm kind of awake and I'm thinking about tricks that everything else falls away, and I can actually focus on What kind of new moves to come up with? An example of that was, recently, I went to the X Games in Japan a few weeks ago, and I was thinking I was gonna go more to show my support And because they had a vert event, there's not a lot of vert events anymore.[0:43:28] Tony Hawk: So if there's a vert event, it's kinda like if you build it, I will come because I wanna show my support. That's that's kind of where my heart is. And they had a best trick event, and I thought, man, maybe I could get in the Trick, is there anything new, though? You know? And I'm still recovering from my leg.[0:43:43] Tony Hawk: And then at some point, I was falling asleep, and I thought, oh, I could do that trick and come in 180. I know I could do that with with my current state and not getting that much speed. So to explain what I was doing is is, Half cab body varial to backside blunt.[0:44:01] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Let we can walk through this half cap. Cab has come up backwards, go 3 60. Right? So half of that would go one[0:44:07] Tony Hawk: of these. As I as I approach the top of the ramp Yep. I body rail. That means I jump around. And then I jump around on my board, and then I make sure that it lands with my Two trucks out and my tail on the coping, which is very precarious.[0:44:22] Tony Hawk: And I've done that and come and fakie these things. Blunt piece. That's the blunt. So I've done that where I where and then you have to you have to use your beat to lift up the board, come and fakie. Right?[0:44:31] Tony Hawk: I've done that I've done that twice. And I thought, well, wonder if there's something I could do like that. And then I realized that if I just keep coming around and I come in Backside direction, that keeps my body spinning, and that might actually be easier. It wasn't, but I figured it out.[0:44:51] Andrew Huberman: I think I saw a clip of this on Instagram.[0:44:52] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I mean, I did it I did the X Games, and I was like it was my last run. It was it was I mean, It didn't move the needle. I got 7th place, but for me, it was a huge moment.[0:45:02] Andrew Huberman: It felt amazing, I bet.[0:45:04] Tony Hawk: Oh, yeah. For sure. I mean and it I was I mean, it was, like, weeks of preparation and and trying to figure this thing out. I made it twice before the event, on my own, alone, on my ramp, but, that's just an example of of, you know, I was I was literally falling asleep, and then all of a sudden, I was like, Half got butter well, backs of blood.[0:45:26] Andrew Huberman: I love it. That liminal state between wakefulness and sleep is such a beautiful state that If one is open to ideas showing up there Yeah. They almost always do.[0:45:36] Tony Hawk: I I tried start trying it the next morning.[0:45:39] Andrew Huberman: Do you ever find that when you're taking walks or in the shower or not thinking about skateboarding.[0:45:45] Tony Hawk: Yeah. It's usually in the in the sort of mundane moments that that I get inspiration. Yeah. Mhmm.[0:45:51] Andrew Huberman: Do you have practices for pure relaxation aside from socialization?[0:45:56] Tony Hawk: I know. I've I was never I think that's something I've been lacking. I I never was good at warming up, stretching, post warm up, or or or relaxing. You know? Meditation, nothing.[0:46:12] Tony Hawk: I just I I go skate in its own. And as I've gotten older, I realized that's not the best technique, but It's worked so far.[0:46:24] Andrew Huberman: It has worked. So for you, it's go. Hopefully, a little bit of warm up if you I[0:46:28] Tony Hawk: have more of of a sort of OCD warm up run that I use to gauge how I'm feeling, but I kinda have to get through that. Mhmm.[0:46:38] Andrew Huberman: Like a surgeon. When a surgeon's about to do a surgery, they don't warm up. They just check off the various boxes of, you know, this is here, that's there, make sure that they're comfortable in their environment, and then They do they do the the life saving work. Yeah.[0:46:52] Tony Hawk: Yeah. My I I'd say my warm up run is is kinda basic tricks, but they give me a sense of how How stiff or how I what I need to adjust for for the rest of the day. So I guess it's not so OCD, but it I definitely feel like I gotta go through that routine. Mhmm.[0:47:09] Andrew Huberman: What feels the best? Like, I I know that making a new trick feels incredible, if you've been at it a long time. Dialing it in so that you can do it again and again is its own form of reward.[0:47:21] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:47:22] Andrew Huberman: But what is the maybe list of 2 or 3 things that just feels so[0:47:27] Tony Hawk: good. Well, that for sure, learning new tricks. Not even that that it's something that I created, but just Doing something that I've never done before. When I first learned varials, backside varials, no one had done backside varials before. They'd only done front side.[0:47:44] Tony Hawk: Anaverial is where you you reach down, grab your board, jump in the air, and then turn it 180 under your feet. It's it's like a shove it, but you're guiding with your hand. I learned that halfway up the pool the the main pool, you know, at Oasis with no one around. And the feeling I got when I rode away was something that I had never experienced, and it is it is literally the buzz that I've been chasing ever since because it was like, I created something.[0:48:10] Andrew Huberman: Varials below coping was the was the button.[0:48:13] Tony Hawk: That was it. It really was. And and if you saw a video of it, you'd be like, that thing? You're like, What can I say? It was it was the 1st time that I thought I thought of it.[0:48:23] Tony Hawk: I I went through all the motions of it. I did the work, And I figured it out, and, you know, no one no one cared. But at some point, I was able to do it 6 feet in the air and do a full 3 60 variable. And so that was the building block, but but that feeling Was like no other. I'd say that, and then just even to to strip everything else away, like, the most basic tricks, Like, a backside ollie is is an a no handed aerial.[0:48:55] Tony Hawk: That used to be what it was called, backside no handed aerial. It feels so good because Even to this day, people people say, how does the board stay on your feet? And I can't even tell you how the board stays on my feet. I just know I know how to maneuver it, and I know how to keep the pressure on it and the friction going. And backset always is like, I think it's like a marvel of physics, and and a clean backside alley to me is feels good as anything.[0:49:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's a beautiful thing to behold. I confess I've never done a legitimate backside at all on vert. On a mini ramp, sure, but not on vert. So I can't relate to the feeling, but I love, Love love the fact that you brought us back to that early variable low coping feeling, and that that marks The essence of what feels so good when you do something else.[0:49:47] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's sort of like a it's a as a neuroscientist, I see it as a chemical stamp. It's like a chemical fingerprint of progress. Right? And I'm also delighted to hear that it still feels that good to do these things.[0:49:59] Andrew Huberman: Because I don't think anyone can have the kind of lifelong progression that you've had, and it's still going, without it. Not just love of the thing, but love of the feeling that it brings when no one's around. Because you said skating your ramp by yourself. So how often are you on your ramp with, know? No one's filming for Instagram.[0:50:18] Andrew Huberman: No nothing for a video. Nothing for a video game. None of that. Maybe there's, you know, maybe other guys around, Gals around. We'll talk about gals too because one of the big shifts in skateboarding since I started is that there's some amazing female skateboarders now.[0:50:32] Andrew Huberman: There's a young lady, in fact, that's been skateboarding at your ramp. Forgive me. I can't remember her name. Is it Reese.[0:50:37] Tony Hawk: Reese. Reese Nelson. Good news. User.[0:50:40] Andrew Huberman: Goodness. Gracious.[0:50:42] Tony Hawk: I know.[0:50:42] Andrew Huberman: She is so[0:50:44] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Good. So good.[0:50:45] Andrew Huberman: So good. So we'll get back to that. But I think that, you know, people Starting any kind of sport or academic career or business or anything, I think people assume that you go from 0 to a100 somehow. And that there are these people that are just selected by genetics or by luck or by some combination of things to just, like, get it and be better than everybody else, but it's clear that you spent a lot of time alone driving someplace to skate the next day or alone at the ramp.[0:51:13] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[0:51:14] Andrew Huberman: Or, So do you ever reflect on that kind of drive, and, you know, what what what that's all about, or is it just So intrinsic to who you are.[0:51:24] Tony Hawk: You're innate. I don't I don't think about it. I just know I have to do it. It's like I mean, I I we can get into it with my injury, but, but but to go back to what you're saying is that you're saying that that people think that, oh, you were chosen for this or genetics, whatever. Have you[0:51:41] Andrew Huberman: saw me see Hawk after all.[0:51:43] Tony Hawk: Me skate Yeah. When I first started skating, there was no way you'd think that I was natural or that I had any future in it. I was all gangly. I was all over the place. I was eating shit left and right.[0:51:53] Tony Hawk: Like, it just it it wasn't I wasn't good. I wasn't. I wasn't a natural. I've seen people that are naturals. Mhmm.[0:52:01] Tony Hawk: And I've seen that how they don't have that drive. They don't have the discipline. And It's not wasted, but it they just don't they don't utilize they don't take advantage of of what they have Naturally. And and for whatever reason, I don't I don't fault anyone for it, but I've seen both sides of it. And I've also seen other skaters who are just driven and who are not really good, kinda sloppy, and become the best.[0:52:29] Tony Hawk: Andrew Reynolds. Oh, yeah? When we put him on our team, He was just like me, super gangly. His board's bouncing around, but he's trying every single trick. And every time he send me a video, It's some new technique that he's figured out, and he didn't really by the untrained eye, he didn't have the skill set for, And then he became the boss.[0:52:53] Tony Hawk: You know what I mean? So I think it's just you you have to you have to give that as much weight as natural too, If not more, I'd say more.[0:53:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I would certainly say more for science and, you know, the people who are in the lab Late at night and early in the morning and drilling away, not not always the smartest. Certainly not the, dumbest, but smart enough to show up When other people are leaving and continue and I think there has to be a little bit of friction internally. I mean, you know, maybe maybe externally also, but Just some friction. Some I'm gonna show you.[0:53:29] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. I my best example of that, and I haven't talked about this Yeah.[0:53:36] Tony Hawk: Because I did it privately, but I I broke my leg doing a mix twist, something that I've done Thousands of times[0:53:44] Andrew Huberman: in 540.[0:53:45] Tony Hawk: 540. Yeah. So it's a it's a one and a half spin in the backside direction, but that Particular grab that you do makes it in a twist because it makes you kinda flip upside down. So it's kind of a one and a half somersault. I it's not my tricks.[0:53:58] Tony Hawk: It's Mike McGill's trick. I learned it not long after he created it in 1984. Been doing it ever since. Mean, I'm talking about 40 years of my twist. Right?[0:54:07] Tony Hawk: I've gotten hurt once or twice, but not bad. Anyway, I fucked around and found out. Did one with no speed last year thinking I could do it like I was still 20 and Got tangled up and and broke my femur. I had a super long recovery. I had a false start.[0:54:27] Tony Hawk: I had a nonunion fracture, which means my bone never connected back to itself, and it kept be pushing itself further away. 2nd surgery in November, and all along in the back of my head is I gotta get back to 5 forties. I have to. And I can't explain why I have to. I hate that it means that much to me, but it it's in here.[0:54:56] Tony Hawk: You know what I mean? It's not it's not a sense of pride. It's not like I have to prove this to anyone. I just have to do it. And last week, I did it.[0:55:06] Tony Hawk: It was so scary, and I prepped for it. I I mean, even down to, like, my diet and I I stopped drinking altogether, and I was like, every time I go to the ramp, I'm just trying 5 forties, like, to get the spin, to get the To get the landing zone with no intention to make yet, just that I had to get there, and then I had to have this heart to heart with my wife that you know, she doesn't wanna see me get hurt. She doesn't wanna see me risking myself at this age anymore. She doesn't wanna live through another traumatic injury with me, And I had to tell her, like, I have to do this. She was gracious and accepting, and that's all I could ask for.[0:55:47] Tony Hawk: It wasn't like she was like, yeah. You gotta go do it. I was like, okay. That's who you are. And so She was there.[0:55:56] Tony Hawk: She was my only spectator.[0:55:59] Andrew Huberman: So good. I confess I've seen a video of this, and my first response was, f yes. And my second response was, that was really high. Like, this is no, you know, Just above coping 540. This isn't even you know, this is a head high 540.[0:56:17] Tony Hawk: I'm not gonna make the same mistake I did last time where I tried it low thinking I just get away with it anymore. So The going high was more of a safety measure, which is ironic. The the the bigger the ramps For me, the safer it is because I have a better landing zone. I have more time in the air to adjust. And even though it looks spectacular and 6 feet in the air, it's just like, no.[0:56:39] Tony Hawk: I need that. I can't skate some 8 foot pool. I have no landing zone. I'm too tall. I'm too I moved too slowly now to do that kind of stuff.[0:56:49] Tony Hawk: So that's why you don't see me, like, in the park events, stuff like that. You know? You're gonna see me on this 14 foot vert ramp because that's my happy place, and that's where I'm safe. But also having my wife there, I just knew I wasn't gonna get hurt in front of her because I would have been in such trouble.[0:57:07] Andrew Huberman: The the emotional support and pressure is Yeah. Is a real thing and in the best ways, not to focus on the Bad aspects of the injury,[0:57:17] Tony Hawk: because There are plenty.[0:57:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That I recall you and I communicated not long after the, Let's say let's call it what it was, the 1st break. And I remember you said to me over text, you said, how long before I'm skateboarding again? And I said, skateboarding as in pushing or skateboarding as in, what you do on Vert. You know?[0:57:37] Andrew Huberman: And you said, what I do on Vert. And I said, Well, it seems you are doing a lot of things. You were doing deliberate cold, deliberate heat, pressure. You do a number of things. I mean, you're not haphazard about Your career and your body and your health, and we'll get into that a little bit later, some of the things that you've enjoyed as beneficial for you.[0:57:55] Andrew Huberman: But, You said, I'm calling it at 2 months. And I said, okay. I believe it. And then I recall that You was it the Oscars or some other award event where you came out about a week later? You came out there.[0:58:09] Andrew Huberman: You walked out this broken femur, And you weren't using any support to walk out, so you clearly ditched whatever support you might have been using, which I think is awesome, by the way. And then pretty soon, I was seeing videos of you dropping in.[0:58:23] Tony Hawk: I'm[0:58:24] Andrew Huberman: seeing videos of you doing kick turns below coping. I'm seeing videos of you at coping, and, you know, We have a friend in common, the skip skateboard and generally photographer Mike Blaback, and I remember texting Mike. I was like, Tony's back already. This is this is superhuman Rates of healing. And I think it is superhuman rates of healing.[0:58:45] Andrew Huberman: Then you mentioned that you damaged, Broke broke the femur again. So did you allow more rest the 2nd time? What was driving you to to get back in it so quickly?[0:58:54] Tony Hawk: The first go around, I just didn't listen to any of the professional advice because I thought, well, I've done I've come this far, and I've always been able to push through broken pelvis, broken elbow, knee surgeries, and I've always been the timeline's always very shortened for me because I just get back out there and I and I get the healing started, but I also I'm comfortable with what people think is extremely risky. But in this instance, I wanna get back out there right away, And not long after the Academy Awards, I was actually walking with a cane at that time, and I dissed the cane just to walk out on stage to present the awards. So that was my big My big coming out moment, but it was kind of forced. And as soon as I walked out to say, they grabbed my cane. I was hobbling in the backstage.[0:59:41] Tony Hawk: But I was I was skating kind of a mini ramp, and and I was already struggling because I couldn't Put my weight on my front foot because my bone still had not connected to itself. So there's a gap in the bone, but there's a there's a nail, what they call it nail or, you know, Big piece of metal that's holding them in place, but I didn't realize how careful I needed to be with that because it was so precarious. And I decided I'm gonna drop in on the mini ramp. Like, I think I'm ready, and and it wasn't the drop in on the mini ramp. It was me getting to the top of the mini ramp and stepping off my board.[1:00:18] Andrew Huberman: It's Always that kind of stuff.[1:00:20] Tony Hawk: But but I just stepped off my board like I would do any other day, but I didn't think I led with my front foot, and I felt the bone move in that moment. I I really I felt it I felt it either twist or get out of place, and I was in total denial for months because I just said, oh, it just it just hurts now. Like, I, you know, I I got this minor setback. And then I finally 8 months into my recovery 7 months into my recovery, I was always in pain. My skating wasn't progressing.[1:00:54] Tony Hawk: I couldn't get speed. And by all measures, I should be back. At least I'd be back to a level that I feel Good about. And I went and got X rays, and they said your bone never connected. You have a nonunion fracture.[1:01:10] Tony Hawk: And and and and every time I skated so my bone's like this. Every time I skated, I was pushing it further away. And so my bone was like this on the last X-ray, and and that was the hard truth.[1:01:22] Andrew Huberman: So for those listening, it's just laterally displaced. Think about a pipe that's Broken in the middle and just one's offset to the other.[1:01:28] Tony Hawk: And and as I keep skating and I I could force my skit like, I kinda learned this hack where I can put 75% of my weight on my back foot and 25% of my front foot and do what I wanted to do, but it wasn't where I thought I'd be. And it just hurt all the time. I mean, it really was like that was my trigger because I I have a pretty High tolerance pain, and it was always her. Like, I I would dread going to the airport knowing I had to walk to a gate, So I knew something was wrong there. I went to a specialist, that deals in nonunion fractures, And he had a very pragmatic, factual approach, and he was like, oh, I would do this.[1:02:10] Tony Hawk: I'm a take that nail out. I'm a take the other hardware out and put it together, and you cannot move for 2 months.[1:02:16] Andrew Huberman: Did you obey that order? I did. Really?[1:02:19] Tony Hawk: Yeah. So what what is chilling. I was not gonna risk that again.[1:02:24] Andrew Huberman: Did you, and do you prioritize things like sleep, nutrition, just, You know, generally and did you emphasize those things while you were recovering from the injury?[1:02:37] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I I I was very disciplined in my diet, In my schedule, in my sleep. Surprisingly, I I was very busy because, I do speaking engagements, And suddenly, my speaking engagements were getting booked left and right. I mean, to the point where I I did a tour through Europe last summer of speaking engagements. So that was sort of that was a silver lining, I guess, to my my idle time, and I leaned into it.[1:03:07] Tony Hawk: You know, I made myself available, and and, it you know, it's good money, and it was it's it's fun to to interact. And, but all through all through that, of course, in the back of my head, I was like, when when can I skate? When can I skate? And then when I finally started skating, It was night and day with my leg. I felt like I could lean forward.[1:03:30] Tony Hawk: Suddenly, I was learning tricks every every session, relearning tricks. So I just I'm just lucky that I got to live in this time of modern medicine.[1:03:41] Andrew Huberman: Was that 2 months the longest you've ever gone without skateboarding, Vert?[1:03:44] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Yeah. Without skating at all.[1:03:48] Andrew Huberman: Not even just pushing around? No. Good for you for obeying doctor's orders. And also Finally. And also good for you for deciding that your rate of recovery is gonna be whatever it is for you.[1:04:00] Andrew Huberman: Because I feel like I'm hearing both things. On the one hand, you listen to the medical professionals. On the other hand, I'm not hearing, oh, you know, I looked at the average rate of recovery from this kind of fracture, this and that. It's it's like it's as if you decided 2 things at once that there are experts who have something to offer me here. I'll follow their advice.[1:04:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And yet I'm the expert at myself. Here, I'm putting myself in your 1st person. Tony is the expert in Tony, and I'm gonna make sure that I come back a 100% Yeah. Or better.[1:04:30] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Not better, but, and I've and I have come to terms with that Because I know that I'm not going to be pushing myself the way that I did before I got hurt anymore. There are some tricks now that are Way more difficult just because whatever. Something changed in my body. And for instance, I can't grab slob.[1:04:50] Tony Hawk: Like, I can't I I can't do it consistently. That used to be my go to route. Could do that anytime over 60 foot gaps, whatever. Like, I could do I just grab I knew where my board was. I knew that was gonna hold on to my feet, and half the time I try to grab that way now, I don't reach it or I grab my foot instead.[1:05:07] Tony Hawk: And I I don't know. I can't make the adjustment to fix it. And so I've just sort of come to terms with, well, that's not the go to grab anymore, And that's okay. Your kids I had a good run.[1:05:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Your your kids' pretty pretty, vast, so there's a lot of other things to reach too. Aside from the 540, which, by the way, congratulations Thank you. Not only is it a 540, but, done at least head high. I've seen it with my own eyes.[1:05:34] Andrew Huberman: And, and under Really great circumstances. Your wife there, just the 2 of you, and after and the trick that broke the femur in[1:05:42] Tony Hawk: the[1:05:42] Andrew Huberman: 1st place. Yeah. So, congratulations on that.[1:05:45] Tony Hawk: Thank you.[1:05:46] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized form that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etcetera, mean, and Behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health.[1:06:32] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APO b and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation.

Are there other things that you you're thinking, you know, can't wait to get back to that? Let's set aside for now.[1:07:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:07:02] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I I I wanna get my hand plants back the way I used to do them. I I have yes. Yeah. So, Invert, like, it's 1 hand in handstand.[1:07:10] Tony Hawk: I can do them now, but I I've[1:07:12] Andrew Huberman: seen you do them recently.[1:07:13] Tony Hawk: Yeah. But but I used They used to be my signature. It was a tuck me amber and flopped all the way back, and and I can't get a hold of my board to pull it all the way back like I used to. If I can get that, I'll feel like that's it. That's that's that was the last milestone.[1:07:31] Andrew Huberman: I'm not here to, diagnose and and treat these, specific, skateboard trick isms, but between your what you said about slob, Aaron, what you're saying about this is crap. Seems like there's something about about getting your your your My front hand around and and just kind of pulling it back back in, behind you. So maybe this is, like, the way that the femur is lining up with your pelvis and maybe some off ramp something or other physical therapy could do.[1:07:56] Tony Hawk: I I am actually working with At Bescore, he is a he is a doctor of physical therapy, and he has helped me immensely through my recovery. And When I'm frustrated with this motion or that's the same grab actually as in the twist. He worked on me before it and was just Contorting my body and my leg into these positions that I don't really even get to when I'm skating just to prepare me for that, and he did, But that's what it took.[1:08:27] Andrew Huberman: It's interesting that we're, talking about skateboarding, and we're also talking about physical therapists. We're talking about nutrition. We're talking about sleep.[1:08:35] Tony Hawk: So growing Like, no. None of that. None of that. Never imagined and never. Never.[1:08:39] Andrew Huberman: And I'm chuckling because, you know, growing up in skateboarding, early on for me, not quite as early as you, but pretty early, 12, and got out of it and Back in yes. I can still do a thing or 2, here and there, but that's not the point. The point is that, you know, the nutrition consisted largely of, You know, fast food or whatever was around, cigarettes and beer were sort of the the energy drinks and, and, supplements of of the times. This has Fortunately changed, but there there was essentially no health promoting tools or aspects to it at all, but that was back then. But then over time, it seems it's evolved.[1:09:19] Andrew Huberman: Like, now I see, I saw a couple posts from Stevie Williams. Like, he's in the gym. Sure.[1:09:24] Tony Hawk: I[1:09:24] Andrew Huberman: think I saw Danny Way early on working with Paul Czech and doing some balance work, neck work because he had broken his neck surfing and things of that sort. So there seems to have been a big shift over the last 15, 20 years where skateboarders are taking good care of their bodies like other athletes, thinking about the resilience of their bodies and also Generally taking better care. Like, a lot of them opt not to drink and do drugs and all those sorts of things. So, I mean, How does it strike you to see the way that skateboarding's evolved towards the option to be much healthier and treat it like a like a serious sport where you're a serious Athlete. A word that, you know, even 15 years ago, 20 years ago, if you called a skateboarder an athlete, some people might even be offended by that.[1:10:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. People in skateboarding. Right?[1:10:07] Tony Hawk: Absolutely. Yeah. Well, to answer your question, in the early days, that was part of the the scene and the culture just because the the it was the antithesis to organize team sports and mainstream culture. And so it was just like, yeah. This is what we do.[1:10:25] Tony Hawk: Fuck it. Who cares? Like, we drink, and we skate, and And everyone it was it was Wild West. Right? But as I never fell into that deeply because I saw how it people's performances, and the skating itself was paramount to me.[1:10:42] Tony Hawk: That is what I wanna focus on. That's what I wanna be good at, And I saw people partying and partying their skills away, so I had at least that forethought. And then as Scanning got more established, popular, more of a career option, Then people started taking it more seriously, especially competitors. I mean and and but there's such a wide swath of of what skateboarding is, And it's a big tent. So to say that it's more organized, yes, it's more organized over here.[1:11:14] Tony Hawk: There's still all these skaters over here partying, hopping fences, Don't care about contests. Don't want sponsors.[1:11:21] Andrew Huberman: Oh, well, like GX 1000. Like, those kids at Bomb Hills in San Francisco. Like, the like But but that That's that's what is[1:11:27] Tony Hawk: is the diversity of it all, and that that's we're all part of this scene. So I I was a competitor. That was that was my Path to success. And so I appreciate that people take it more seriously now and that they do have trainer. They have resources.[1:11:43] Tony Hawk: I mean, they have sponsors that will pay for this kind of stuff. There was no such thing. I mean, we like, at at our biggest skate contest, we were all staying at Stacy Peralta's parents' house the night before, And he would take us out to get spaghetti because he thought carbohydrates was going to give us energy the next day. That was the extent of training In 1983. Right?[1:12:07] Tony Hawk: But nowadays, we're treated like High elite athletes because they are. Like, if you really look at people that are at the top of their field, people like Nyjah Huston. You know what I mean? Like, the dude is a machine. He is he is one of the most precise skaters that we've ever seen or precise athletes This side of Nadia Comaneci.[1:12:32] Tony Hawk: You know? Yes. I'm I'm I'm aging myself, but What I'm saying is, like, this is this is takes hardcore dedication, precision, athleticism, and devotion. And so now they have the resources to back that up and to keep it going longer. I mean, yeah, I'd would I be able to do this now, especially after getting hurt without The help of a doctor of physical training?[1:13:01] Tony Hawk: Probably not. I'd do it on some level, but I wouldn't get to where I am now. And so hey. I think it's awesome. I I you know, I I never I never wanted to covet skateboarding as this thing that no one else, Like a gatekeeper to it.[1:13:15] Tony Hawk: No one else can touch it. I always thought there was something in skateboarding that was magical and that was good for mental health and that was That was required such, required such passion, And I didn't I never understood why it didn't get bigger through those those lean years. I was always like, kids this speaks to kids. Like, it's it's daredevil, And it's active, and it's exciting. And you can do it as a group, but you can do it your own way.[1:13:46] Tony Hawk: And I don't know. All those things, it took a long time for everyone else to figure it out. They definitely figured it out. I mean, nowadays, skaters are the cool kids in school.[1:13:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's in the Olympics. Like, there was always discussion. Would it be it was an exhibition sport in the Olympics at one point? No.[1:14:00] Andrew Huberman: No? No. Oh, I thought it wasn't for maybe it had to run it potentially being an exhibition.[1:14:05] Tony Hawk: There were there was talk about Got it. Got it. But it never did, and and not that I mean, at some point, especially in the late nineties or 2000, Skating was getting appreciated and and kind of reached that threshold of of is it mainstream? Well, It's in it's on McDonald's commercial, so I guess that's pretty mainstream. And so we already had come of age, and it was like, we don't need the Olympics.[1:14:33] Tony Hawk: We're already more popular than a lot of Olympic sports. Right? So why do we need their validation? And then at some point, it became, like, the the the Power dynamic shifted, and it was like, oh, they need our cool factor. We don't need their validation.[1:14:50] Tony Hawk: And it was like, yeah. Okay. You guys want it? Sure. Go ahead.[1:14:54] Tony Hawk: Hold the events. Hold the qualifiers. We'll participate, but We don't need this.[1:15:02] Andrew Huberman: Well, you've been an amazing ambassador for the sport that's Driven so much of that wider acceptance and progression and invitation into different domains, one of the, Things that I definitely wanna talk about is the video game. Right? Because I think that the video game changed a lot of things for the general public in terms of their perception of skateboarding. I mean, what it allowed, of course, is this is obvious, but it allowed Kids that weren't going to, you know, bang up their shins or walk in with a broken wrist or, you know, all skinned up to To do incredible tricks, but in silico on a screen, right, and to and pretend that they are the the pro skateboarder. That's essentially what what video games are about.[1:15:47] Andrew Huberman: And yet when you can see something just like you can imagine it in a dream or while you're falling asleep and you can see something and here in air quotes, do something in a video game, it also is going to inspire a number of kids to go outside and grab a real skateboard and try that or try something like that. So clearly, the video game was a catalyst for what I consider now the the wide acceptance of skateboarding as a sport in all its various forms. Could you just talk for a little bit about the genesis of the video game? Were you into video games prior[1:16:18] Tony Hawk: to[1:16:18] Andrew Huberman: the video game? Were you into technology generally, and and what sort of motivated the interest in the video game? Because it certainly has changed The face of actual skateboarding and the perception of skateboarding.[1:16:31] Tony Hawk: Well, I've I've been into video games since the get go. I mean, I was a kid, you know, Playing Pong, Pac Man, Missile Command, Hubert, you name it, and then getting the home systems, Intellivision, Super NES, Commodore 64. Sega. Sega. Yeah.[1:16:49] Tony Hawk: But but I, and I always love technology. So when I When I finally started making money in the eighties, my first kind of big purchase in terms of that, in in terms of electronics was, Commodore Amiga, which was considered one of the highest end, home computers, you know, alongside Mac, but but more graphic oriented and and more game oriented. And so I was always into that idea that you could do this kind of stuff at home, not just in arcades. And then I got a I got a Call from a PC programmer that wanted to pitch a skate game and had a a crude engine of, Skater that would cruise around, go ring bowls, and stuff like that, and it was all keyboard controlled. It was clunky, but it was something.[1:17:41] Tony Hawk: And the last thing that we had as skating was 720 in the arcade or a skate or die For home systems for a Commodore 64, that was, like, the last thing that had happened for skateboarding, in video games. And so I went with him. I was excited to get like, I got to we got to go to Nintendo and pitch it. We went to Midway. You know?[1:18:04] Tony Hawk: We went to all these different, Console and software manufacturers, and we're just told that this is a bad idea. Skateboarding is not popular. Home video games are barely a thing. Why would anyone want to buy a video game about skateboarding? Someone said those exact words to me, at Midway.[1:18:27] Tony Hawk: And so he got frustrated, and he needed to find a job. And I was I was just kinda free floating. So I said, okay. And he goes, well, I'm I'm gonna I'm not gonna do this, but I feel like you've established yourself at least in the video game world, industry that you're interested in doing something, so maybe if someone does something, they'll call you. And I was like, yeah.[1:18:45] Tony Hawk: Right. Sure. Sure enough, like, a year later, Activision called me, and they said, hey. We heard you wanna do a video game. I said, well, yes.[1:18:53] Tony Hawk: I would love to work on a video game. I'm not a programmer or anything. So we have something we're working on. I would like to show it to you. And so I went up to Activision.[1:19:03] Tony Hawk: They were working on a Skate game, but it was based on an engine of a game that was already released called Apocalypse starring Bruce Willis. So the first version of my game was Bruce Willis on a skateboard With the guns strapped to his back in a desert wasteland doing kick flips. And it was awesome. It was it was truly like, I picked it up, and I got past that visual. And then I started playing it, and and it was intuitive.[1:19:31] Tony Hawk: It the motion felt right. The engine was right, and I was like, this is this is the baseline of something special. I didn't think it was gonna be some big hit. I just thought this is this is gonna be appreciated by skateboarders. And that was my goal the entire, Development process, which was about a year and a half after I signed on.[1:19:53] Tony Hawk: We through that year and a half, we were going back and forth with they would they would FedEx me builds on CDs. I had a modified PlayStation, and I would play it, make notes. And I thought, man, skater's gonna dig this. And that was it. And skating wasn't even that popular.[1:20:07] Tony Hawk: It was Coming to you know, it was starting to get some traction.[1:20:11] Andrew Huberman: What year was this again?[1:20:12] Tony Hawk: Like, 98. Uh-huh. So it was like X Games were starting to come into the fold. People were taking note of what skateboarding had become at that point, and then I thought, this is gonna be cool. Skater's gonna like it.[1:20:25] Tony Hawk: And then, Not long before the release, they called me and they said, hey. We wanna, we wanna offer you a buyout of future royalties for this game, because I think, you know, there's I think people are gonna like it. And I was like, what does that mean? They go, we'll give you a half $1,000,000, and then you don't get royalties going forward, but you get that money up front. And at that time in my life, like, To hear someone say half $1,000,000 seriously sounded like half a $1,000,000,000.[1:20:56] Tony Hawk: Like, no one had ever Talked about numbers that big to me.[1:21:00] Andrew Huberman: Well, also, 98 was a little bit of a of a quiet time for vert skateboarding too. Right?[1:21:05] Tony Hawk: Sure. Yeah. It was all about street racing. Right? Yeah.[1:21:07] Tony Hawk: For vert. Yeah. Luckily, vert skating still was a thing because of inline skating. Because in line skating was huge. Right?[1:21:18] Tony Hawk: Late nineties, and they were all vert. And so we, as skaters, got to sort of ride those coattails it was like, hey. There are programs because everyone's rollerblading.[1:21:28] Andrew Huberman: I forgot about that.[1:21:29] Tony Hawk: That that did. Like and and I have honestly, like, I was the special guest at a couple of inline Rollerblade shows where it was like, this is the team rollerblade live, and special guest, Tony Hawk, the skateboarder. And I was like, hey. Hi. Alright.[1:21:42] Tony Hawk: Dropping in, But it paid the bills. Yep. So to answer to, like, to to from what you're saying, vert skating was It was a thing at least established in the X Games[1:21:55] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:21:56] Tony Hawk: Which was something and enough for us to make a living. So when they offered me this money, I actually was in a pretty good place, in terms of My, I don't know, my options, my my trajectory, and I felt like and I had I had just Bought a new home, and I thought, I'm gonna take a chance and just see what happens. And, like, that was the best Financial decision I ever met[1:22:23] Andrew Huberman: took the equity.[1:22:26] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I just let it ride. I was like, no. I wanna see what happens with this. And As soon as the game was released, it was getting stellar reviews.[1:22:35] Tony Hawk: And then I remember, like, the very next week after it was released, Never stopped saying, okay. We're working on number 2. What do you wanna do? Like, what do you mean? Well, yeah.[1:22:45] Tony Hawk: We're doing SQL. Wait. What? Awesome. And then we end up doing, like, 10.[1:22:52] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Crazy. Amazing. I'm thinking about your decision to not take the cash and to see how it would go. I'm thinking about, your decision to buy a car at 16 and, As a consequence, get pulled over because you looked younger.[1:23:08] Andrew Huberman: I'm thinking about the time when through the graciousness of your parents who me in because I had no money to get back up to Northern California, and they couldn't get ahold of my mom. They took me to your home, but then They took me to where you were living the next day, which was in Fallbrook. You don't remember this, but I do. And I know you've heard this story before, so forgive me because most people listening haven't. But I remember getting driven up to Fallbrook.[1:23:32] Andrew Huberman: You had the ramps in your backyard. I walked in, got introduced to you. You were very gracious, said hello. What's up? Said feel free to push around on the ramps outside.[1:23:40] Andrew Huberman: It was the mini it was a spine ramp.[1:23:42] Tony Hawk: Yep. Yeah.[1:23:43] Andrew Huberman: 2 ramps back to back, folks. Spine. Sorry. Nomenclature. I think Ray Underhill was there.[1:23:50] Tony Hawk: Yeah. He lived there for a while.[1:23:51] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And as I recall, you had, Pretty vast music collection,[1:23:55] Tony Hawk: and[1:23:55] Andrew Huberman: we'll talk about music. Mhmm. But it it also seemed that there was a couple cars in the driveway and whatnot, but It's clear to me based on a number of things and that interaction and what I observed there that either you had someone in your ear, either your dad or your mom or both Or maybe it had been Stacy or maybe it was somebody else who was advising you to make very good financial decisions, like not spend all your money or continue to spend all your money, to invest in things, you know, or maybe it was just instilled in you at a young age. Who knows? I'm asking because I think so many people burn their early success.[1:24:35] Andrew Huberman: You know, what represents lot of wealth for them early on. They burn that where they start making just bad decisions. You explained before why you tended to avoid drugs and alcohol, Certainly, any severe relationship to drugs or alcohol that would keep you from progressing and skateboarding. But, you know, the ability to make really good decisions As a young famous athlete, right, is more rare than it is common even when people have coaches.[1:25:02] Tony Hawk: Mhmm.[1:25:03] Andrew Huberman: So I'm curious, you know, where did that, shrewdness and that prudence come from? And was Frank your dad and maybe Nancy also, you know, advising you all along like, hey. You know, think smart, be smart, because clearly you made some some very smart decisions.[1:25:18] Tony Hawk: He was definitely A guide in it, he he was the first one who said you should probably buy real estate. I was 17, so I didn't even know that was possible, but He cosigned and made it possible. But then after that, I ended up buying that home that you went to, And it was 4 acre property, and we built these ramps on it. And that was amazing and definitely helped Propel my skating to a different level than I ever imagined. But at some point, that was just a drain, And it was a drain financially, and I was living beyond my means.[1:25:57] Tony Hawk: And my income kept dropping because we're talking about not long after that was 91, 92, the slowest days of of skating, and I've got this giant mortgage, and I've got this property and these ramps that I can't afford to upkeep. Can barely afford my water bill at one point. You know? And so what you saw might have seemed stable, but behind the scenes, it was was starting to unravel.[1:26:21] Andrew Huberman: Birdhouse hadn't been started.[1:26:22] Tony Hawk: Birdhouse was started in 92. And when I started Birdhouse, I took the equity from that house To start it because I I didn't I burned through my savings from trying to keep this place going. So I took a 2nd mortgage out on that house. Right? I took my equity out, Started birdhouse, sold the house for what I had taken out, and then, moved to my original place that I've had when I was in high school And just pulled back on expenses.[1:26:53] Tony Hawk: I think that was the that was when I really became shrewd Because I had to. I had a I had a first child. I had an income that was very uncertain, Very fluctuating, and I was just eating Taco Bell and Top Ramen and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and and Not spending anything and and taking every job, like the most random demo requests or We want you to be a consultant on this commercial because I'm too old I'm 24. I'm too old to be the guy skating because it has to be youth. Right?[1:27:29] Tony Hawk: But they're like, well, we wanna see what's possible, so can you come up the day before and show us the ropes? And so I would be the stunt skater That's filling in to to show them the angles and stuff, and then they would go hire Chet Thomas as the young kid, And then I would stand around. I was getting paid. I didn't care.[1:27:45] Andrew Huberman: I think I remember those commercials. It was a cereal commercial or something like that.[1:27:50] Tony Hawk: The cereal commercial was, Chris Miller, Frosted Flakes.[1:27:54] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:27:55] Tony Hawk: And I was Tony the Tiger.[1:27:57] Andrew Huberman: Saw them as skin tight suit. Guys. You, Chet. Because Yeah. Yeah.[1:28:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I throughout the word, Birdhouse, which is your company, but without telling people what is it, skateboard company. I remember, Willie Santos was early on. I remember he's a super nice kid. Used to see him at the contest.[1:28:15] Andrew Huberman: I remember thinking, well, Tony Hawk has his own company. For skateboarders, that was revolutionary.[1:28:19] Tony Hawk: We had a team. You know? Like, Willie Willie was a maestro. Jeremy Klein, legendary street pioneer. Steve Barra, who's kind of a we call it ATV, but street and vert.[1:28:33] Tony Hawk: We had, Ocean Howell, who was, like, our Number 1, amateur. We had Andrew Reynolds, Matt Beach. We had a team. Like, it was full on.[1:28:43] Andrew Huberman: Was it fun to move from Writer to also rider, but team manager, owner.[1:28:50] Tony Hawk: Was it fun? It it was just necessary. Uh-huh. I can't say it was fun. I mean, yeah, it was it was fun because we were still just kinda reckless and Driving you know, 6 of us in a van, driving to skate shops across the country and begging them for $300 So that we could get gas and food and a hotel room and get on our way.[1:29:14] Tony Hawk: I don't know. It just it it But for me, it just felt like a necessity to key to to that was what I had to do to make a brand happen, and so I was willing to do it. And but it was exhausting. Yeah. Because I had to be the I had to be the the coach and the tour manager and the skater.[1:29:39] Tony Hawk: You know, I was putting myself out there on, like, the the worst conditions and just rolling my ankle left and right. And it was and it was all treat, and it was just wasn't my thing. It was it was hard, but I'd I I loved it. It made it happen.[1:29:53] Andrew Huberman: In my mind, I'm thinking you had to be Tony Hawk, the skateboarder, Frank Hawk, the organizer[1:29:59] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[1:29:59] Andrew Huberman: And Stacy Peralta, the Yeah. Because Stacy had been a pro skateboarder. I still think of him as a Yeah. Even though he's filmmaker. Of course.[1:30:06] Andrew Huberman: Right? Skateboarder. Just like I still think of Spike Jones as a skateboarder, BMXer, filmmaker. Seems like you had to integrate all of those. And I mentioned that because I am curious.[1:30:17] Andrew Huberman: I think a lot of people are probably curious. Like, are you the type of person, like, sit back in a chair at night and think like, okay. Like, I'm gonna do this? I mean, are you contemplative, or is it really you just identify what needs to be done this year and over the next 3 years and, know, set your milestones, kinda shorten.[1:30:33] Tony Hawk: I guess now or back then? Back then. Oh, no. Everything was just in the moment. We gotta get here.[1:30:40] Tony Hawk: We gotta get to Dallas by tomorrow. It's like, as soon as this demo's over, get in the van. We're gone. We gotta get a hotel room. You know?[1:30:49] Tony Hawk: It was just stuff like that. It was it was very much but but I I I respected I think I learned to respect, punctuality Because I travel with plenty of skaters that were not and didn't care and show up late and was like, dude. And, like, I don't know these guys. And then when I was in charge, it was like, we're gonna be on time because we have to respect other people's time. And we said we're gonna be here at 3 o'clock.[1:31:15] Tony Hawk: We're gonna be at 3 o'clock. And That's not easy with a skate crew.[1:31:22] Andrew Huberman: No. Mike Blaback, who as you know, is integral to the Huberman Loud podcast. I talk about that. We've got some other guys that came over from DC to as filmers and editors for us, and, you know, they're so punctual and they're so on it. And I noticed you showed up Early today.[1:31:38] Andrew Huberman: Right? Right on time or early, but early by 5 minutes. And that is a distinguishing factor, I think, in any Occupation, but especially in skateboarding, where there's this kind of looseness.[1:31:50] Tony Hawk: Sure.[1:31:50] Andrew Huberman: And so if you do show up on time, it really means a lot. The professionalism that, You know, was instilled in you. It's it's clear the different places where that's showing up. Mentioned the shrewdness about the business decisions. I'm curious about another aspect of that, is maybe a little more cryptic, which is, you know, whether or not it was the CD collection that I saw or your mention of the car.[1:32:12] Andrew Huberman: You're just in video games. It seems that one thing that you've done that a lot of guys that I knew because back then, by the way, it was mostly guys now as we said, or women doing it too, Women and girls, it seems like you have a lot of other hobbies and interests, music and etcetera, but that we never heard about you getting, like, distracted or pulled down those lines. Like, we didn't hear about you going and surfing and getting Hurt surfing so that you couldn't skate or getting really into motorcycles or race racing cars. Right? You know?[1:32:44] Andrew Huberman: Some people went hard left out of Skateboarding into that, like Ken Block, the late Mhmm. Great Ken Block, but that became his main thing. Seems like you you knew that skateboarding was the main frame and stayed with that, and yet you have a lot of other interests.[1:32:59] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I think I I well, with other sports, especially like motocross, I I have this huge respect for motocross. I think it's super exciting. I would love to do it, and I know that I would not Escape unscathed. Like, I would definitely want to learn the tricks, do whips and flips and whatever, and I'm gonna get hurt.[1:33:20] Tony Hawk: And I I don't wanna Risk my skate career for that. So I I I purposely pulled away from that type of thing. The last knee knee surgery I had is because I overshot a jump in mammoth on my snowboard. So that was a lesson. I was like, don't What are you doing?[1:33:39] Andrew Huberman: Just cruise. Why[1:33:40] Tony Hawk: yeah. Stay on the ground. Right. Hit the powder. Right.[1:33:43] Tony Hawk: You know? Free ride with your bros Because I learned my lesson. So so, yeah, you're right. But at the same time, like, I still I still love going surfing and snowboarding. I don't do them as much, obviously.[1:33:55] Tony Hawk: But but those are part of of what I did all growing up, and they're important to me. I did, you know, do a couple of celebrity car races, like a NASCAR race, and, I totaled a car in the Long Beach Grand Prix because this dude ran me into the wall, and it was like, well, that was fun, but I'm not I don't I don't have the bandwidth to get that serious about it.[1:34:21] Andrew Huberman: And now you have a family, of course, too. So[1:34:23] Tony Hawk: Of course. Yeah. I mean and and those things, as fun as they are and as as, I don't know. As sort of auxiliary as as they are, they require a lot of time. I mean, just for instance, that Long Beach Grand Prix, they want you to go stay in Palmdale for, like, a week and a half and train and and figure out how to truly know how to drive and be safe.[1:34:46] Tony Hawk: And it's like, I don't I ain't got time for that.[1:34:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's time you're not skateboarding. Or with your family. Right. Yeah.[1:34:53] Andrew Huberman: Right. Now I feel the same way. If I get pulled away from reading papers and prepping podcasts and reading the latest research and thinking about experiments we could do, then I, more than a couple of days, I started feeling the itch. I have a feeling this stuff is programmed into one's nervous system after a while. Like, you've been skateboarding for so long that if you go a few days, It probably just your system is is[1:35:13] Tony Hawk: Oh, I see. Depriving you over water[1:35:15] Andrew Huberman: or something.[1:35:16] Tony Hawk: Oh, yeah. For sure. I mean, well, just for instance, our ramp is, being torn down on Sunday. Today is Friday. Our ramp is being torn down on Sunday at 10 AM To be moved to Salt Lake City for our big Vert event.[1:35:31] Tony Hawk: I'm going there at 8:30 so I can get a session before it gets torn down.[1:35:36] Andrew Huberman: I love it.[1:35:36] Tony Hawk: On Father's Day. That's my Father's Day. I'm going to work at 8:30 AM on Sunday.[1:35:41] Andrew Huberman: I love it. Speaking of family and lineage, Tell us, about your kids. You got some talented skateboarders in your family besides yourself.[1:35:52] Tony Hawk: I do. Well, I have 4 of my own, and I have 2 stepkids, and, they all skate. My daughter, not so much anymore, but all the boys 5 boys, are all really into it. My oldest son is the most, he's the most prominent because he turned pro, and has, I mean, you know, has his own following, has a name for himself, Riley, and he's 30.[1:36:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He kills it on street. He's a big street skateboarder.[1:36:22] Tony Hawk: He does. Yeah. But they you know, they're they're all good. They're all good skaters in their own ways, and, it's so fun. I mean, I I didn't.[1:36:35] Tony Hawk: Of course, they're surrounded by it their whole life, especially Riley because when he was young, I I didn't really have the means to have childcare or whatever, so I just had to take him with me on tourism and whatnot. He was always around it. So he got good at it by default, but at some point, started to shy away from it because he felt the the pressure in my shadow. And it was like, I don't this isn't fun. I don't people expect me to be super good, or I have to do this stuff.[1:36:59] Tony Hawk: And so he went shied away from it, but then found A bunch of his friends in high school, they they love skating. He's still good at us, so he that he found his crew, and they've all found their crews, completely independent of me. And so when we go on vacation, for instance, We we were last year, we were in, or 2 years ago, we're on the big on Hawaii. They wanna go to the skate parks. I don't wanna go to skate parks.[1:37:25] Tony Hawk: I'm on vacation.[1:37:27] Andrew Huberman: It's also little harsh stuff. It's a great way to get hurt. Right?[1:37:30] Tony Hawk: What's that? Over in Hawaii. Yeah.[1:37:31] Andrew Huberman: It's all weather worn. Oh, yeah.[1:37:32] Tony Hawk: And it's not even my scene, but but then so I go I'm I'm so I'm their chauffeur, and I'm their filmer.[1:37:38] Andrew Huberman: I love it.[1:37:39] Tony Hawk: That's my vacation. But but because they all love it so much. You know what I mean? And it just it it's so cool. Like, I mean, how could I ever ask for more?[1:37:47] Tony Hawk: It's amazing.[1:37:49] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about Frank and Nancy a little bit just because I have this kind of odd connection to your family through those, it's really 2 or 3 day interaction. Change changed my life forever. Meeting you was spectacular as a young skateboarding kid, but also just the idea that someone would literally take me into their home. I mean, they had every reason to not[1:38:08] Tony Hawk: Trust me. First of[1:38:08] Andrew Huberman: all, I was hanging out with Billy Waldman. No explanation needed, but people who knew Billy. I hope he's doing well. I haven't heard anything about him, but I hope he's doing well. But we were wild, But he basically took me into your home.[1:38:19] Andrew Huberman: He and Nancy took me in, you know, fed us, or fed me. I had another friend with me. And, you know, I just have to say, as you're describing your family, I can only imagine what it must have been like Frank and Nancy to see you have your kids, did they get to, live long enough to see, that Riley and your other kids were skateboarders?[1:38:42] Tony Hawk: My dad met Riley, but my dad passed away when Riley was 2. Okay. So he's the only one of my kids that that he met. Yeah. My oldest sibling, had kids, so he met 2 of his other grandkids besides Riley.[1:39:03] Tony Hawk: My mom got to see some of Bradley's success, but, she suffered from, Alzheimer's dementia, and so Things slipped away, but, I I think that, my dad would not believe that skateboarding is in the Olympics. To him, that's that is the top of the mountain Because he was really into other sport. He loved sports. He loved the Olympics. He loved he loved watching football.[1:39:32] Tony Hawk: He loved watching baseball. He loves When the Olympics were on, he just he loved the the competition element and the and the hype of it, and and I think there was part of him that felt like, why isn't skateboarding in this? You know? But he knew that there were so many hurdles to get through and so much more acceptance that needed to happen, and I don't think he imagined whatever happened.[1:39:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He was a special guy. I can still hear his voice. Yeah. He's a very large guy too.[1:39:59] Andrew Huberman: I don't know if I was just smaller then. I definitely was smaller then.[1:40:02] Tony Hawk: No. I mean, he[1:40:03] Andrew Huberman: he had, like, a big Yeah. Presence, and, and I know I've told you this many times before. This is actually how we got reconnected. Sent you a direct message and said, hey. I met your parents.[1:40:12] Andrew Huberman: In fact, they took me into your home, and I'm telling the truth. And you'll know I'm telling the truth because they took me to dinner, and they ordered Black coffee after dinner.[1:40:20] Tony Hawk: Yep.[1:40:20] Andrew Huberman: And, you know, for years, I would order black coffee after dinner. You know, it's as a kid, you're just so impressionable. These really nice people took me in. I was like, wow. This is what a really healthy family looks like.[1:40:29] Andrew Huberman: I I'm grateful to have loving parents. Always did, but, yeah, I didn't have the healthy family structure. For me, it was like, oh my goodness. These people drink black coffee after. This must be what healthy families do.[1:40:39] Andrew Huberman: So by the way, folks, don't drink caffeine within 8 hours of going to sleep. But, Wait.[1:40:44] Tony Hawk: But I still do that.[1:40:46] Andrew Huberman: But well, you you it doesn't seem to be holding you back, individualized. But, Yeah. It's spectacular that this lineage of, you know, Frank to you and and I I mentioned and Nancy because it seems like While she might not have been at the contest and run around setting up tables and doing all that, like, she clearly was supportive as well.[1:41:05] Tony Hawk: Oh oh, she was at a lot of the events too. I mean, they needed all hands on deck when it started getting big, and no one was taking salaries. You know, that was the thing is that people thought like, oh, your dad's, like, Cashing on his he he never took up money for any of that, and he took so much shit. You know what I mean? He just he just loved it.[1:41:22] Andrew Huberman: It was for you. It well, it but for me, it[1:41:25] Tony Hawk: was for me, and it was also for the misfits Mhmm. That I surrounded myself with. And Even though he was he was brash and he was like you know, he was, I don't know. What's the word? He he was foreboding and and intimidating and whatever else.[1:41:43] Tony Hawk: He did it for all those kids that were kinda lost, Like you. I mean, really, like, he he loved that it brought them together, that it gave them a sense of self. It gave them a sense of purpose. He saw that because he he was that. He he really had a rough childhood, and he did everything he could through his adult life to make up for it with his own kids and with the kids that they surrounded themselves with.[1:42:06] Tony Hawk: So that's that's what he loved about it. Of course, he loved seeing me thrive too, But he loved that he created the safe space and this this sense of community. And so my mom my mom was that was her thing was getting people together, Gatherings. You know? Oh, we should all get together.[1:42:24] Tony Hawk: Like, even even my siblings and I, as much as We want to emulate our parents. We don't do it as much that as they did, and we regret that.[1:42:34] Andrew Huberman: Well, there's still time.[1:42:36] Tony Hawk: No. We I mean, we do, but Yeah. It's tricky. We're all in different areas.[1:42:40] Andrew Huberman: Sure. Yeah. The the person that comes to mind when I think about your dad, Now I'm forgetting the movie, but there's this one Clint Eastwood movie where he lives in a neighborhood with where I think it's a bunch of young Hmong.[1:42:52] Tony Hawk: Oh, is it gangsters? El Camino?[1:42:53] Andrew Huberman: El Camino. Yeah. And I just remember like, there's that scene of, like, Clint coming out on his porch and just standing really upright. Yeah. Everything in his Front is front lawn is everything super manicured and just standing there like this immense presence, and that that's how I remember Frank Hawk.[1:43:08] Tony Hawk: Yeah. But he was a total softie. That's the thing. That's that's you know, there there was a it was it was all a front.[1:43:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, he was certainly very gracious. Like[1:43:29] Tony Hawk: That's not some hardass.[1:43:31] Andrew Huberman: Well, there's a tail end to the story too where he actually called my mom, And I think there may have been a statement or two about, hey. This kid's 14. Like, he can't be in Linda Vista Boys Club taking the bus back to Lancaster, etcetera, etcetera.[1:43:43] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[1:43:43] Andrew Huberman: May have been some discussion like that, But then they also paid for me to go home. Oh, yeah. They flew me home. Yeah. So I think I owe you a couple $100 for a Southwest flight or whatever airline it was.[1:43:55] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's it's fun and, I think, important to reminisce about these people because, they aren't just your parents, but they they've Done so much and through you. You know, I I really think that, emotions and stories are really, like, the equivalent of Energy in humans. You know, when people talk about energy, because that gets carried forward. Mhmm. Speaking of which, we share a common love of Some particular music.[1:44:19] Andrew Huberman: Are you somebody who listens to music to sort of, to inspire you, to get amped up, to go skateboard? Is music an important Part of your life? Yeah.[1:44:28] Tony Hawk: Let's put it this way. I I had a I had a playlist for my 540 the other day.[1:44:33] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:44:34] Tony Hawk: Fine tune to that trick and what would get me motivated and hyped to to do it.[1:44:41] Andrew Huberman: You don't have to share with us what's on the playlist unless you you Choose 2.[1:44:45] Tony Hawk: Oh, man.[1:44:45] Andrew Huberman: But was it high energy, low energy?[1:44:47] Tony Hawk: High energy. Well and and some meaningful songs like, new order ceremony and, I see. 9 inch nails getting smaller because that was, a song we used at one of our big skate tours, and it was one of the most high energy sections of the of the show. Gosh. They were so I I I can't go through all of them.[1:45:09] Tony Hawk: I forget. Gang of 4. Wait. Gang of 4 is, shit. I forgot.[1:45:20] Tony Hawk: What is it? Oh, I find that essence rare. Fires up. So I had I had, like, 10 That we're just gonna if any of those played, it's I'm gonna make it, and and I knew that it was about an hour and a half, and That's as long as I'm gonna try it before I'm too tired.[1:45:39] Andrew Huberman: So you're listening in the warehouse, or you're listening in[1:45:41] Tony Hawk: the warehouse? On random. And then, the song that I made it to was, off of that Prodigy album, fat of the lamb, and it's called climatized. It's instrumental. I use it for a birdhouse edit when 411 was the thing.[1:45:56] Tony Hawk: Mhmm.[1:45:57] Andrew Huberman: 41 were these little, like, video newsletter type things. Yeah. Anyway.[1:46:02] Tony Hawk: So when that song came on, I I was feeling it. I made it.[1:46:08] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. I love this because, You know, the neuroscientist in me is immediately gonna say, you know, we have this brain that loves to take in information and discard other information, but paired association is so strong. Yeah. And when you couple that with some sense of reward, like the making of the variable below coping as a Yeah. Yeah.[1:46:27] Andrew Huberman: As early in life We're making the 5 forty f as a comeback to, you know, the injury after the injury.[1:46:35] Tony Hawk: Almost like I I loved all that music, but I was indoctrinated by it through the skate parks because that was the soundtrack to this it was it was punk music. It was Sex Pistols and and 999 and Black Flag and Devo and X and Buzzcocks and, you know, that that was that's what I kept hearing, and that's what I associate with my best of times.[1:46:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's in your nervous system. Yeah. Yeah. There's, a few voices, you know, Rancid and Tim Armstrong and and the other Operation Ivy.[1:47:06] Andrew Huberman: Operation Ivy, Tim's for[1:47:07] Tony Hawk: Soundsystem Soundsystem was on that playlist. It was on the 540 playlist.[1:47:11] Andrew Huberman: Alright. You know? Yeah. Tim will be so happy to hear that, and Matt Freeman, the bass player, and Jesse Michaels is now playing again with Tim, the lead singer of Operation Ivy.[1:47:19] Tony Hawk: Yeah. With their new, their new gig. What's it called?[1:47:22] Andrew Huberman: They had a name, and then they they, they changed it.[1:47:25] Tony Hawk: Oh, okay.[1:47:26] Andrew Huberman: Initially, it was, well, I don't wanna say because they changed it for a reason.[1:47:30] Tony Hawk: But we know we know they're making the music.[1:47:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Which is amazing. Operation Ivy is incredible. My yearbook photo for, think 2 years running was the cover of Operation Ivy because I didn't show up for the yearbook photo. Speaking of which, did you show up for yearbook photos, or did you graduate high school?[1:47:44] Tony Hawk: I graduated high school, but I didn't go to any of the events, prom or any of the auxiliary. I didn't know. I mean, I was I was an outcast. Like, I was not even though I had success in skating, skating wasn't cool, And I was not homies with anyone at school except for 2 other skaters, and we felt very ostracized. So, Nah.[1:48:09] Tony Hawk: Yeah. I did show up for the graduation because because my mom and dad wanted to see it.[1:48:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Likewise. I graduated, but I could tell you more about the curves in the parking lot of my high school than I could about anything that But in a classroom[1:48:19] Tony Hawk: I broke so many sprinkler heads because the sprinkler heads were right next to the curb, and there was a double sided curb. And so if you board slide, because I'd go there early and board slide, and then I'd just, Like, lean too far and break the sprinkler head and never got caught. What high school? Well, I went to a couple. I went to Sarah High School Originally, then I went to, San Dieguito High School, which is in North County, and then I ended up at Torrey Pines.[1:48:43] Tony Hawk: I got so bullied at Santogito that I requested to be transferred because I I couldn't go I couldn't survive there as a skater. I would have to hide my skateboard in the bushes before class and then go find it after school so that people wouldn't target me.[1:48:59] Andrew Huberman: The eighties were rough.[1:49:01] Tony Hawk: It was like a it[1:49:02] Andrew Huberman: was like a John Hughes film.[1:49:03] Tony Hawk: It well, for sure. It was jocks. It was It was jocks versus nerds, and then skaters were, like, not even considered in that realm because they're just gonna get they're gonna get hammered because there were so few of us.[1:49:16] Andrew Huberman: Well, things have changed and not only have things have changed such that skateboarding is far more popular and respected and, You know, at least one mark of that is in the Olympics, although there are other marks of respect, certainly. But a huge evolution that I've observed is when I was Skateboarding as a 14 year old and it you know, into my, close to my twenties and then took some time off for sure. Hardly any girls, hardly any women. There were a few, like Cara Beth Burnside. Mhmm.[1:49:46] Andrew Huberman: They got teased, ridiculed. It was hard on them.[1:49:50] Tony Hawk: Super hard. Yeah. Super hard.[1:49:51] Andrew Huberman: Now largely through Instagram, but some other channels as well, You can see this young girl, Reese skateboarding better than a lot of grown men who have been skateboarding for decades. Oh, yeah.[1:50:05] Tony Hawk: I mean, and[1:50:06] Andrew Huberman: then there are a number of other ones in the, in street skateboarding, and also taking really hard slams. Like you know? So This this is a complete revision of the recent history of skateboarding. So thoughts on that and, On Reese, and there are a few others. Was it is it, Lizzie who[1:50:25] Tony Hawk: Lizzie Monto.[1:50:26] Andrew Huberman: Took a really bad fall Yeah. That was Filmed.[1:50:29] Tony Hawk: Broke their broke the, neck off her femur. Yeah.[1:50:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. These are tough ladies.[1:50:35] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[1:50:35] Andrew Huberman: I mean, they're all[1:50:37] Tony Hawk: Lizzie Lizzie did the loop. She did the full three sixty loop. 1st woman to ever do it. So what do you[1:50:44] Andrew Huberman: think changed, like, that that paved the way? Is it just, you know, a a critical mass Of females doing it, is it that, you know, Sky Brown? You know, you[1:50:54] Tony Hawk: For sure for sure, there were there were the pioneers, people like Cara Beth Burnside, and, there's so many others. Patty Hoffman was one of the one of the first vert skaters too Who were they planted the seed, and and then there were other women that took inspiration. Like, oh, girls can do this. Even though they're largely outnumbered and they get hassled for sure. And then through the street era, people like Alyssa Steemer Mhmm.[1:51:24] Tony Hawk: Who who paved the way for legit street skating. But then Through the years, it it started to become more common, more accepted, which is dumb to say because it's just always been a it should have always been accepted. But the thing that that really tipped the scale was when everything was leading up to the Olympics, there had to be equal divisions in equal disciplines for men and women. And suddenly, there was no question of should we have a should we have a women's event? Like, no.[1:51:56] Tony Hawk: We have to have a women's event because that's how we that's the road to qualifying for this the Olympic stage. And Vans Park series to their credit, they were holding events Simultaneously, not that we're Olympic qualifiers, but just their own, and they said these events are equal across the board, equal prize money, Equal attention. I mean, it was just like that that was just matter of fact, and that shifted a lot. It really did. And now if you go to a skate park, You see plenty of women there.[1:52:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's[1:52:29] Tony Hawk: awesome. Like, literal women, like moms. You know? There's there are Older women that are learning how to skate. It's awesome.[1:52:38] Andrew Huberman: Not that it matters so much, but does anyone claim to be the first Female do 540 on vert. Is that sort of a known thing?[1:52:46] Tony Hawk: That would be Lindsay Adams.[1:52:49] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic.[1:52:50] Tony Hawk: And she did that. I'll tell you how she did that. She was trying it. So she's trying she's trying to make twist. She's married to Travis Pastrana.[1:53:00] Tony Hawk: It's like the, You know? It's like the the elite action sports couple, and she was trying them. She was she was getting pretty close, And then we did a big exhibition in Paris at the, Grand Palais on behalf of Quicksilver. It was a huge event. They put a half pipe up, and we did this giant show.[1:53:25] Tony Hawk: There were thousands of people there, and it was very much unspoken but expected that I was gonna do a 900 at this event. I think it was, wanna say it was 2010 maybe. And, or no. Like, 2009. And And and the organizers were kinda like, okay.[1:53:47] Tony Hawk: So we're gonna do this. And then, you know, at some point, you do a 900. And I was like, I I can't guarantee that ever. Like, every time I've ever made it, it's been pretty spontaneous. I've, you know, I've set out to do it and not I've come up short.[1:54:00] Tony Hawk: I can't guarantee it. I'll try. I'll try. And they they're like, yeah. Yeah.[1:54:05] Tony Hawk: Okay. And so I knew the whole time that they were skating. I was like, okay. Everyone's expecting this. So I kinda went through the motions of of, doing my exhibition tricks, you know, playing the hits, and then started trying 9 hundreds.[1:54:19] Tony Hawk: And at the same time, Lindsay started trying 5 forties because she was feeling that energy. And so it was this sort of Not battle, but definitely, we were we were trading hits. It was like, alright. Here goes. And then, oh, you missed it, and here goes Lindsay.[1:54:35] Tony Hawk: Oh, she missed it. And then I, she almost made one. Like, was riding down, you know, And and then fell at the flat bottom. It was like, oh, and then I made 900, and that was kind of the showstopper. It's It's like that's what they expected, and everyone's going crazy and whatever.[1:54:58] Tony Hawk: People are coming down off the ramp, knee sliding down, and we're saying goodbye to the crowd. And I look up, and Lindsay Puts her tail out. There's still people standing on the ramp, and she puts her tail out. And I was like, I think Lindsay wants to try it again. Here we go.[1:55:12] Tony Hawk: I'm on the mic now. She made it. Love it. She stole the show, like, without question. It was huge.[1:55:21] Tony Hawk: You can look it up on on YouTube. Like, it's there. Lindsay Adams' first first five forty. It was awesome. And then she made it, and we all grabbed her and put her on her shoulders.[1:55:32] Andrew Huberman: That is awesome.[1:55:33] Tony Hawk: It was pretty cool.[1:55:34] Andrew Huberman: That is awesome because these things are like the 4 minute mile as a barrier, then people break that barrier, and then other people break that barrier. It's I mean, I've I've watched enough of skateboarding in recent years to see, you know, like the Sky Brown thing. I mean, she's phenomenal, and I actually saw her family out to dinner Here in Los Angeles and, with her brother, and, her folks are really gracious, really nice. And there again, you know, parents going to the skate park. Well, after all, she's Couldn't drive herself.[1:56:00] Andrew Huberman: I think she's yeah. At that time, she was probably, like, 9. You know? Probably[1:56:04] Tony Hawk: one of the biggest shifts too is that Parents encourage their kids to skate now. Could you imagine that when we were young? Never.[1:56:13] Andrew Huberman: No. There were so many factors telling us not to. It just made us wanna do it more. Sure.[1:56:17] Tony Hawk: But Yeah. Now now kids are like parents are pushing them into it. Get out there. Learn tricks. I was like, wait.[1:56:23] Tony Hawk: That's not what we're supposed to be doing, but It's cool that that pair I think it I think with the the the really cool factor of all that is there are definitely people our age. I'm I'm I'm I'm grouping you into my age category. 47. Alright. Yeah.[1:56:38] Tony Hawk: Close enough. But but that have kids, and and skateboarding was such a special time in our life, And then they're rediscovering it through their kids, and they're skating together. And I think that's just so amazing That someone of our age would be like, you know what? I used to do that. You're into that?[1:56:58] Tony Hawk: Like, let's go. And then you could show your kid how to do a sweeper.[1:57:03] Andrew Huberman: I could probably do that. I don't have kids yet, but when I do, I'll show I intend on being healthy enough and Yeah. To do a sweeper, people can look up sweeper. We don't have to explain it for them, but little layback grind or a sweeper. Yep.[1:57:14] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. Because they won't they wouldn't think to do it.[1:57:16] Tony Hawk: No. And they are doing all these difficult flip tricks, and then that's not my it's not my scene.[1:57:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. What's your go to on a game of skate if you're gonna really, like, take out the younger generation?[1:57:25] Tony Hawk: I can do impossibles pretty, pretty regularly.[1:57:31] Andrew Huberman: On transition? Consistently. I can do[1:57:33] Tony Hawk: them on flat. So this[1:57:34] Andrew Huberman: is where, basically, you scrape the back of the it's an ollie, really, but it wraps around the back foot.[1:57:38] Tony Hawk: Or it wraps over your foot. Yeah. That's kinda my my sneak attack Games Escape. Does Rodney Mullen get credit for that trick still?[1:57:46] Andrew Huberman: Yes. That's Yeah. To Rodney. Are you still in touch with Rodney?[1:57:50] Tony Hawk: Absolutely. Yeah.[1:57:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He's somebody that, Certainly deserves deserves mention in the pioneering of tricks. I think of[1:57:56] Tony Hawk: He's the godfather of modern skateboarding.[1:57:58] Andrew Huberman: I think of Rodney, you, and Mark Gonzales is gone. That's like the they're guys that I'm honored. Drove the, the progression in different Partially overlapping directions that set the template Yeah.[1:58:13] Tony Hawk: For a sense of humor. Finger clips because of Rodney. Like, the first trick you saw me do, I learned that because I saw Rodney do it on the ground, and I thought, Well, I can't do it on the ground, but I have plenty of time in the air to do it.[1:58:24] Andrew Huberman: It's awesome. It's awesome that Stacy put you guys together. We mentioned Bones Brigade, but we didn't really talk about the architecture of it from the perspective of skateboard progression, but it was, kinda like any good band. It seemed like there was really good chemistry Yeah. Interpersonally, but also, that there was Each person had something unique.[1:58:44] Andrew Huberman: You skated the way you did. Mike skated the way he did, Stevie the way he did, and, you know, Rodney and you know?[1:58:49] Tony Hawk: And We respected each other, but we also fed off each other.[1:58:52] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Tommy Guerrero. Yep. Right here. Because growing up in the Bay Area, like[1:58:57] Tony Hawk: Street. Yeah.[1:58:58] Andrew Huberman: In fact, Tommy's getting the hills of San Francisco in those videos makes it look easy. But those hills are are rough, they're dangerous, and they have real life obstacles like moving buses. You'll notice he wasn't stopping his top signs, So that's fantastic. We could reminisce about all these angles, but the the point being that, spending time with People who do similar things or the same thing but do it differently is one of the best ways to progress. This is why I routinely fly to Texas and hang out with Peter Attia, another podcaster, Alex Friedman, just because they do things differently than I do.[1:59:30] Andrew Huberman: Where do you draw Sort of peripheral inspiration from now. Like, I know you, see Jimmy Wilkins at your ramp quite a lot, the phenom Jimmy Wilkins. Yep. It's kind of eerie how good that kid is. What who else are you spending time with besides Reese?[1:59:46] Andrew Huberman: And one of the reasons I asked this is that skateboarding is unique among many sports and that A given session, a gathering, to skateboard will include an enormous year[1:59:56] Tony Hawk: old men and 10 year old girls. Exactly.[1:59:58] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Which is which is incredible. You don't think about soccer, you know, a serious game of soccer between professional soccer players.[2:00:05] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Even that that we're skating together. It's that we are Communicating and influencing each other. I mean, that is, like, the last conversation I have with Reese Was she's talking about, like, are you gonna try to do 540, CN? I go, yeah.[2:00:20] Tony Hawk: I'm kinda working on it. She goes, well, I think because she saw me try 1. She goes, I think you need to pull out a little more, and she was right.[2:00:26] Andrew Huberman: And she's how old again?[2:00:27] Tony Hawk: She's 10. And I and I didn't even consider that because I'm just back in my mode, and I'm not taking into consideration that I don't have the snap that I'd had before I got hurt, and she was I mean, that was one key to me making it. And, you know, to that that it's but it but to me, that's just that's representative skateboarding and the inclusivity of it and the diversity of it Where it's me. I'm 55. There's 30 year old, pros that are at the top of the game.[2:00:58] Tony Hawk: There are 17 year old up and comers, men, women, 10 year old girl that is doing tricks that we've never even thought of or want to do, and it's all part of the the whole mix.[2:01:16] Andrew Huberman: That's really beautiful. I wanna ask you about memorabilia. Not a topic that, I think about much, But I think in a prior conversation of ours, you mentioned something about this. So, you know, there are skateboard collectors. There are people that collect stickers, skateboards.[2:01:34] Andrew Huberman: There's a whole market and world for this. And, in addition to people wanting Selfies with you when they see you. I imagine, there's a long history and continued tradition of people taking a pen, putting your hand, and saying, can you sign this? Right? Because, you are in this, very, small but very, clearly Esteemed group of people where your signature increases the value of things.[2:01:59] Andrew Huberman: So, how does that work, and how does that feel? Like, if a skateboarder who, You know, there are these telltale signs of who is and who isn't. Right? Yes. If they walk up to you and they're like, hey.[2:02:12] Andrew Huberman: Will you sign this? Do you feel good about signing it, or is that something that you refrain from? And and if somebody's just merely a collector, a trader, and they're trying to, Build their portfolio, so to speak. You can probably also sense that. So I'm not trying to put you, in the hot seat here.[2:02:27] Tony Hawk: Well, to answer your question, through the years, I was always open to that, and and I'm happy to, especially when people are skaters or or skate fans and whatnot. In the last 3 years, there has been this new elements of resellers, of people that just go buy Signature stuff, they have nothing to do with skating. They don't care about skateboarding at all. They just want to get my signature on an item and sell it, And they usually do it on eBay or through their own channels. That's fine at some point.[2:03:04] Tony Hawk: Like, a few years ago, I respected the hustle. These guys are they knew that I was gonna be at this event. Okay. They're outside waiting. They've been waiting for hours.[2:03:10] Tony Hawk: I'll I'll sign a couple things. But in recent months even, They have figured out how to get my flight info. Like, some hacked into my my actual airline accounts. Some have, sources at certain airports that get the manifests and they sell the information. I found all this out because I've actually held a couple of them accountable Because I said, look.[2:03:33] Tony Hawk: I'm not gonna sign this until you tell me how you knew I was gonna be here. I have no business here. I'm here to visit family. No one knows I'm coming here. Oh, well, we saw a friend said they saw you at the, Detroit airport.[2:03:44] Tony Hawk: Like, no. They didn't. They wouldn't know where I'm going to anyway. Look why I saw it on Twitter. You didn't see it on Twitter.[2:03:50] Tony Hawk: I'm on Twitter. Tell me the truth. There's a guy from TMZ that gets flight info, and he sells it to us. Okay. Thank you.[2:04:00] Tony Hawk: But that has increased to a point where it's not it's not sustainable. I can't I can't please everyone. The last time I flew out of Chicago, there were about 15 people. 1 guy had a a shopping cart full of skateboards, And they all they all bum rushed me at security before I went through security thinking that I'm gonna sign stuff. I'm like, yes.[2:04:22] Tony Hawk: I can't I can't do I I'm gonna miss my flight, and I can't delineate who like, I I I'm sorry. You guys have, like, sabotaged yourselves. I don't know what to say. Then I went through security, and there were 4 dudes waiting at the gate. They had bought tickets, airline tickets so that it could be past security The they airline tickets, they're not gonna use to chase this.[2:04:46] Tony Hawk: Wow. So I mean, wha. People want my autograph, but it's weird, and it's intrusive, and it's kinda creepy.[2:04:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Just tell them that a neuroscientist told you that You gotta get that slob air right, and if you sign too many autographs that, you're never gonna[2:05:03] Tony Hawk: get that chance to get it back.[2:05:04] Andrew Huberman: You're not gonna get the tuck knee.[2:05:05] Tony Hawk: You're not[2:05:06] Andrew Huberman: you're just not gonna be do the the invert. You're just not gonna get it.[2:05:09] Tony Hawk: So It is a it's just a really weird new thing that has that has popped up. And, other than that and and so the tricky part is when there is a public thing or a public exhibition or whatever to try to figure out who is the true Skate fans who aren't. Usually, they're pretty identifiable, but it it just it it has ruined the experience for people who truly are the grub skating.[2:05:34] Andrew Huberman: Oh, well, thanks for sharing that, and, we won't tell Everyone what the telltale signs are so that these people don't exploit them. The skateboarders, the real fans will know. To worry about whether or not they represent accurately because you just will. On the positive side, something I've been wanting to learn more about from you is Your philanthropic efforts. I think Kevin Rose, Who's in the tech sector Mhmm.[2:06:03] Andrew Huberman: Was the first to mention to me that you've you guys have done some philanthropy together. Yep. And maybe you've done some with Jim Thiebaud as well, the great Jim Thiebaud.[2:06:13] Tony Hawk: Yeah. Well, both both Jim and Kevin were board members. Jim is the current board member of the Skateboard Project.[2:06:20] Andrew Huberman: Tell us about the skateboard project.[2:06:22] Tony Hawk: It's it's it's my nonprofit, and we try to develop Public skate parks in their in underserved areas, but more so by by supporting the community and giving them the resources to do so. So groups that are we'll give them advice. We'll give them funding. We'll give them, our stamp of approval, and that can go a long way. And, to date, we've helped to fund over almost a 1,000 skate parks now and 7 or 800 of which are open.[2:06:55] Tony Hawk: I mean, it's my proudest word for sure, and and it's because I never I never took for granted the fact that I grew up near a skatepark, and that was my home away from home. That was more I found my sense of community, my sense of Identity, my my crew. And so many kids choose to skateboard, but have no support in doing so. And so those skate parks are a lifeline.[2:07:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I can attest. They they absolutely save lives. There's no question. Where can people find out more about Your foundation, we can provide a link, but where See this park.org.[2:07:30] Andrew Huberman: So where does the funding for these parks actually come from?[2:07:33] Tony Hawk: It comes from Donations from supporters, it comes from fundraisers, some corporate. Sometimes funding is is funneled through us for specific regions, like the, we have a built to play project that's in, Michigan and New York, and that's funded by the Ralph C. Wilson Junior Foundation. So they they give us the funding, and then we have to give it to that area. But but it's easy because there's plenty of projects, And now there's an abundance of skate parks in those areas.[2:08:05] Andrew Huberman: I love it. Thank you for doing that, for organizing around that.[2:08:09] Tony Hawk: And I get to get more places to skate.[2:08:14] Andrew Huberman: I'm curious what's in the immediate horizon. Right? These days, you probably have the option To say yes to things and no to things. Yeah. You know, you have a family, you have your skateboard career.[2:08:28] Andrew Huberman: Where do you place your priorities in terms of how to carve up your day or your week? I mean, what would you like to make sure that you do or as much of the hours of your waking day for the next, let's just say, 5 years because and may if you wanna extend that out, you can. But[2:08:44] Tony Hawk: Well, I I wanna be available to my kids first and foremost, and we still have 1 at home for the next 4 years, so, I will make sure that I'm available to her. And In terms of career, I never had great aspirations. Like, I never thought, okay. These are this is what I wanna accomplish. It was always just very More, you know, trick specific oriented.[2:09:10] Tony Hawk: So it was always like, I wanna try this and this and this. I would like to continue skating. I don't know if I'll be able to skate at the level I'm skating right now in 5 years, but I know that I'll still be on the ramp. I may not be doing it in public. Trying to advocate for public skate parks, doing more with the foundation.[2:09:29] Tony Hawk: And whatever I I think I think the way I prioritize my time is What will resonate the furthest and have the best impact on skateboarding in general? I do feel that I've come to a point where, yes, I'm some, unofficial ambassador to skateboarding, and I wanna represent it well. I want I want to Be fair in that skateboarding is all kinds of different things. It's not just X Games or Olympics or or or whatnot. It's It it represents, a true culture, and I want to Project that as much as I can and and make sure that people understand that that's also positive.[2:10:12] Tony Hawk: And, I mean, really, everything that I'm doing now is is just kind of fun. Like, it's for the I would say in the last 5 to 10 years is the 1st time I've truly enjoyed what skateboarding has provided me in terms of opportunity and what it brings to me and and what it means to my family. Like, I have a much better appreciation, understanding for it. And these days, it's just like everything's kinda just gravy. It's just so fun.[2:10:43] Tony Hawk: I can't believe I could still do it for a living. It's crazy. I'm 55 years old, And I truly ride my skateboard as a career. Like, that's nuts, and it wouldn't have it any other way.[2:10:55] Andrew Huberman: Well, it certainly is earned, and, I just wanna say thank you for a number of things. First of all, Thank you for going to the skate park. Thank you for picking this trajectory. Thank you for inspiring me and so many other Young people and old people, older people over so many decades now, both with what you did on a skateboard and off the skateboard, and including Your resilience and determination to push and continue to progress to the point where you were badly injured and then to push through that, come back, At least match what you did previously, and I I would wager that you will exceed your prior skill level going forward. I wanna thank you for your resilience.[2:11:39] Andrew Huberman: I know it comes from an intrinsic drive. Your love of skateboarding, it just absolutely comes through. I share in some of that, of course, Having grown up in it, but not nearly as much as you, but also just your willingness to stretch out into these different areas like the video game thing or, talk about X Games, the Olympics, because that did allow for a lot of growth and lateral movement of skateboarding. And at the same time, just as you said, to bring it right back to the fact that skateboarding isn't one thing. It is not like other sports.[2:12:10] Andrew Huberman: It's its own Sport.[2:12:11] Tony Hawk: Yeah.[2:12:11] Andrew Huberman: And it's its own lifestyle.
