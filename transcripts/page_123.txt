I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks 4th in the 6 episode series on fitness exercise and performance. And today's episode is all about optimal fitness programming. That is how to design a fitness and exercise program that can achieve the goals that you want for Fitness and for sports performance.[0:00:30] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Andy Galpin, great to be back. In previous episodes, you taught us about the various adaptations that occur at the level cells at the level of Oriens, indeed at the level of the entire body that underlie things like improvements in strength and speed, Hypertrophy, aka muscle growth, and the various forms of endurance. And you laid out beautifully the various protocols that one can do In order to achieve each and every one of those adaptations. Today, I'd love for you to teach us how we can combine different protocols To achieve multiple adaptations in parallel, for instance, how to improve endurance and strength, how to achieve some level of hypertrophy, Perhaps directed hypertrophy at specific muscle groups while also maintaining endurance and perhaps improving speed, for instance. And if you would, I'd love for you to tell us how we can combine different protocols and vary those across the week, across the month, across the year So that we can make regular progress, and perhaps even you could give us a window into the ways to make the fastest progress possible.[0:01:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I would love to do that. You know, we've invested a lot of time in the previous episodes covering background and concepts and Detail about the physiology so you understood why you're making the choices you're making and why other choices are less effective. In this discussion, I would actually like to jump maybe more directly to the answer and and right kinda get right into the protocol. So and maybe a little bit less background.[0:01:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're interested in that stuff, I I suppose you have to go backwards a little bit and watch some of those, previous episodes. But I would love to jump into just some samples, some case studies, if you will, and you can kinda walk through different protocols. I know that over the course of my, 11 years as a A college professor and, being in the the public space a little bit, probably the most numerous style of question I have gotten is exactly that. So I I know the rep range for this, or I know the style of training for that adaptation. But how do I put them together?[0:02:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I I would just like to Spend our time today going through those things, and the reason I wanna do it is this. Some people listening at home surely, just love exercise. They're already bought in, and they're gonna train no matter what. And they're interested in just actually being more effective. And so the way that you structure and put your plan together Will, in large part, determine getting more progress for for less effort or actually being able to put the same amount of effort in and Getting results faster.[0:03:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's also some folks probably listening who are like, okay. I exercise. I do what I can. I'm bought into the benefits, and you've talked so elaborately over the the 100 plus episodes you've done about, the various benefits of exercise. But You don't like abs you're kinda doing it because you know it's important, but you're not there.[0:03:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So for those folks, it's sort of like, okay. How can we actually make this thing more effective? So we can make sure you hit the things you have to absolutely have to get for the short and long term benefits, right, to make sure that you're looking the way you wanna look, You're performing physically the way you wanna perform, and then you can do that across your lifespan. So how can we give you all some structure, to where, again, you don't have to turn into an absolute lover of physical fitness, and it doesn't have to take over your life, but you can still get more results For your same time restrictions, whether that be you have 2 days a week or 5 days a week or only certain access to equipment or experience, Whatever the case may be, how can we help those folks as well put together a protocol that will get them closer their goals with less restrictions?[0:04:07] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. And I'm hoping that along the way, you'll also point us to how often to take the fitness assessment For each of the adaptations that you referred to in a previous episode, we will also link to that fitness assessment segment in the show note captions for this episode. Because That fitness assessment for different adaptations, I think, is a really powerful way for people to touch in and see, you know, how much long endurance do they have, how How much, anaerobic capacity do they have? How much strength do they really have? And then perhaps you'd also be willing to throw in a couple of additional ways that we can Assess our level of fitness and progress in this arc of fitness program across the year.[0:04:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Amazing. I can't wait to do that. I I think it is also important before we jump in to acknowledge, a lot of folks may be thinking themselves, I don't really necessarily need a plan. Why do I have to do that? I don't have a certain goal I'm going after.[0:05:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm not running a race anytime soon. I'm not a competitive athlete. I just I go to the gym and I work out, and that's great. Well, I would like to try to convince you that regardless of where you're at, having a plan will achieve those things we just talked about, which is more success in a shorter time frame. There's actually a significant amount of research to support this.[0:05:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Those individuals who go on a specific training plan compared to those who do not will receive better results, Right. Independent of the effectiveness of the program. Right? So we've talked in previous episodes about tons of different styles and strategies. And to reiterate, it really doesn't matter which one you pick.[0:05:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: The fact that you have a plan is always more effective than not having a plan. And so, again, even if you're not planning on competing with something, if you wanna shorten the amount of time you're in the gym, get more results from it, I would strongly encourage to put something together. The 2 largest reasons why people don't get results with their fitness training protocol is number 1, adherence. And then number 2, some sort of progressive overload. Both of those 2 things are challenging to accomplish without a plan.[0:06:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So the reason people don't go to the gym, one of them, and one of the reasons why it takes them so long is because they don't walk in with a very specific Plan. It's sort of like going to the grocery store and figuring out what you're going to buy versus knowing exactly what you're gonna get in your shopping list, grabbing those things, and getting out. You'll notice your time in the grocery store is half The length. You're more productive, and you didn't waste money on extra things.[0:06:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay? So that alone will drive adherence because you're not going to think to yourself, oh, that 90 minute workout I do is actually really just 60. And so now the next time you go to training, you're like, man, I don't have 90 minutes, you realize it's only 60 or or 40 or 30 or 20 or whatever it needs to be. So So that alone will get you there. The 2nd part of that, which is overload.[0:06:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's very difficult to understand and remember, well, the last time I did lat raises, I used, I think, Â£5, and then I think I did, like, 12 well, if you don't have some sort of system of tracking and this can be as simple as a notebook, just writing down what you did before And doing a little bit more the next time. That is going to almost guarantee you success. So having some structure, and this structure can be fairly loose. We're gonna Talk about a bunch of different examples, is something I strongly encourage everyone to utilize for their exercise.[0:07:19] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from doctor Andy Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Momentous.[0:07:41] Andrew Huberman: Momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentous for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, Their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations.[0:08:03] Andrew Huberman: With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentous supplements ship internationally, and this is, of course, important because we realized that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, As well as a number of other things, including exercise recovery, you can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, so that's live momentous.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.[0:08:41] Andrew Huberman: I've been using an 8 Sleep mattress cover for about the last 8 months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in terms of core body temperature, and waking up involves A one to 3 degree increase in core body temperature.[0:09:19] Andrew Huberman: With 8 Sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment To be 1 temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning, each of which Can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman and check out their pod 3 cover and save $150 at checkout. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 Sleep .com/huberman to save $150 at checkout. So what sorts of things should people be thinking about when developing an overall fitness program.[0:09:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: A few minutes ago, we were talking about how 2 of the major reasons people don't get as much out of their training programs as they would like is because of 1, a lack of adherence, and 2, a lack of progressive overload. So the solution to that is constructing a Plan that lives within your realistic limitations. So I would like to walk you through, my 10 step approach to how I design training programs. Now before I do that, I think it is fair and important for the audience to understand that this is simply my approach. I've been doing this a long time.[0:10:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I played college football, and I wrote my own training programs back then. I have and I'm still working with professional athletes and PGA Tour, and the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, as well as a ton of general population folks. So this is a combination of The Evidence Based that we've been talking about in terms of best practices for strength and conditioning as well as just my years of experience. So there are many, many ways one could do this. I'm not even suggesting this is the best.[0:11:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is simply how I do it. This is exactly how I handle it when a new individual comes to me and how I teach my students. So step number 1 is assessing properly and identifying a training goal. Now that's actually sort of funny because we hear that a lot, but a lot of people actually never take that step. Not to call anybody in the room out.[0:11:22] Andrew Huberman: What what's happening here is this morning, Andy, doctor Galpin and I were were training together, and, he was providing amazing tips on form and, set rep cadence and this sort of thing. And he said, so what's your training goal for, the next 12 months, and I paused, and it turned into a very long pause,[0:11:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: because an easy nice way of saying he didn't have an answer.[0:11:44] Andrew Huberman: I didn't have an answer. I I of course, I don't just want to maintain what I've developed in terms of strength and hypertrophy and endurance, but I don't have a clear goal.[0:11:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[0:11:56] Andrew Huberman: So I'm hoping that by the end of today's discussion, I will be on track to a clear set of goals[0:12:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: to transform. I'm not gonna Bored you all here, but really, I can't stress enough how important that step really truly is to getting results. The analogy we use here is if you left your house And you were attempting to get to the grocery store, and you just started driving. And if you drove every Swallow, you would eventually get to a grocery store. And so, yes, that can work.[0:12:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: A better approach is saying, here's where I am. There's where I wanna go. What is the optimal route there? And that's really what you're doing with goals. So it is a boring stuff.[0:12:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is not interesting to hear. I don't have any real hacks or tricks for you, but it is step number 1 on purpose. We have to know exactly where we're going. You can do this in 2 ways. Way number 1 is to just pick something.[0:12:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Arbitrarily decide, I'm gonna run a 5 k, or I've done that before and I wanna improve it by Ten seconds. I wanna lose 10 pounds. You can just pick 1. That's great. Another way is to run through that fitness testing protocol we described, a few episodes before.[0:13:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: And if you do that, you can see which of these areas that maybe you have the largest lagging in or what is the most severe performance anchor is how we refer to it, and And then choose that as your primary angle. So either option, some people come in to to training programs with a very clear goal in mind. They wanna add more muscle or Whatever. Whatever. K.[0:13:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. If you're like, I don't really know. You know, I I just kinda work out or then run the fist fitness testing protocol. You'll see what score is the lowest, Dan, and then you'll maybe make that a priority for the next, say, 3 months.[0:13:37] Andrew Huberman: So the first step is to identify a specific or set of specific training goals.[0:13:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: A really nice tool for helping you set a goal is a system called SMART. Right? Now there's a Little bit of debate on what those acronyms actually stand for, but we'll get close enough. Right? So SMART is often specific, Measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely.[0:14:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So starting off with s specific. In general, the more specific your goal is, the higher likelihood you will have at succeeding in that. M, being measurable, means it needs to be something that you can actually put a metric on. So this can be objective or subjective, But generally, I like to have at least 1 objective measure. So remembering objective is something that is not based on feeling.[0:14:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is not up to you. This could be something simple like your body weight. It could be how much you can bench press, what's your 1 mile time, And whatever is most important to you, it actually doesn't have to be a fitness related goal. For example, if you're using fitness as a way to enhance your sleep, the main metric you may be interested in is, you know, amount of hours sleep slept. It could be something like efficiency or whatever is most interest.[0:14:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: It could be work product it doesn't really matter. So it doesn't have to actually be the the fitness goal. But what is the motivation of why you're doing it? So that's specific, measurable, attainable or or actionable, as is often described, is Something that is within your capability. So attainable a bad example of attainable is something like, my goal is to win more games.[0:15:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: That may not be up to you. The team the other team you're playing, it could influence it, the schedule, etcetera. So attainable should be something that is within your control. Realistic, or relevant to you is something that is again, something realistic that you can achieve. You wouldn't wanna make a goal that is you know, You wanna double your body mass.[0:15:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is not gonna happen. So think about the constraints. How old are you? What's your training experience? How much Time you really have to invest in this, and then pick something that is realistic.[0:15:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then, honestly, my little twist here is take that in minus 10%. Because typically, when people put together training programs, their their goal tends to be quite lofty. And they get some small percentage of the way in, realize they're never going to get there, and And back off. We actually it sort of reminds me of a a classic deception study that we did in in my lab one time where we took people And we had them do this, maximal front raise. Basically, you held a dumbbell out in front of you, for as long as you possibly could.[0:16:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: And The goal here was actually it's a deception study, so we're tricking them. And so we said, okay. We wanna just get normative values to see how long People can hold this front raise, and I think we use something like 5% of their body weight. And so they came in and they did it one time, and we timed them. They didn't get to see the clock, they left.[0:16:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then we said, we gotta come back and repeat it. Right? We gotta do a couple of tries here to get a normal value in cases off whatever. Well, the participants were split up into 4 groups. So group 1 actually was told that their time was 15% lower than that they actually got.[0:16:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Group 2 was 5% lower. Group 3 was 5% higher, and group 4 was 15% higher. So the 2nd time they came in to do it, our graduate student quote, unquote Made a mistake and left the timer in front of them. So the 1st time again they did the exercise, they're just holding it. They don't know have any idea how Among or holding.[0:17:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: The 2nd time, they had a giant iPad set, like, just a little bit off center where they can clearly see it, so they watched the time go by. And of course, what happened was those folks say who did 1 minute, the very first time when they tested. They came back in to do the 2nd time, and they're holding it. And we told them they actually got 45 seconds, when in reality, they had done a minute. So they're holding it and holding it, and they think Think they only did 45 seconds.[0:17:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: By the time they get to, like, 2nd 40, 41, 42, they get past 45, they almost all quit, Like, 47, 48 seconds. Because they wanted to beat their previous score, but then we're like, cool. I beat it, and then they quit early. They were actually not yet to failure, but they were just happy enough to beat what they thought they'd done, and then they quit. The other group on the inverse side, Again, say they got a minute.[0:17:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: We told them they got a minute and 15 seconds. They got to, like, 45 seconds, 50 seconds and started realizing, 30 more seconds to go, and they quit way early because the carrot was way too far out. They realized I'm never gonna get there, so I'm just gonna stop now. Can you guess which group did the best on the post test?[0:18:19] Andrew Huberman: Ones that were just within about 5% of[0:18:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. So they wanted to improve. And so again, say they got a minute the first time. We told them they got a minute 5 or sorry, they got a minute 5 the first time. We We told them they only got a minute.[0:18:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: They actually exceeded that greatly because they wanted the the PR. So, making sure that that goal is properly aligned. It needs to be a little bit scary, a little bit unrealistic. Well, you're gonna have to work for this. If it's too easy, you'll quit.[0:18:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: You won't feel like a challenge. If it's too hard, though, you'll quit early as well. So you wanna make sure it's that reasonable balance of, like, Should I train today or, like, maybe I'll just go to I if I do that, I'm not gonna hit. I gotta I gotta get after it. But not like, oh my god.[0:19:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, there's just no chance So you're so you're gonna so you're gonna walk away early.[0:19:09] Andrew Huberman: That's a fantastic study, I have to say. It's very simple. I think it illustrates a number of important psychological principles about goal setting, motivation, self perception, but also the dopamine system. You know, the the dopamine system is this universal reward system that meaning, it doesn't Only work for food or only work for fitness goals or only work for academic goals or relationship goals. It it is the universal substrate for all of that.[0:19:39] Andrew Huberman: And, I actually think there's some real gems of information in, the study design that you described. So, just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration between our laboratories because[0:19:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Absolutely.[0:19:51] Andrew Huberman: I think it's very important, but it does queue up another question, that, relevant to fitness in particular, which is, what are your thoughts on intermediate goals? So let's say my goal is to drop 2 percentage 2% of body fat from where I am now, a year from now. Mhmm. Roll into the next year From now, about 2% lower on body fat, but maintain my Lean body mass or maybe even increase it. Yep.[0:20:23] Andrew Huberman: How should I assess progress? You know, because the dopamine system Loves a goal. It loves anticipation of a goal, but it responds best if we sort of re up, if you will, our dopamine anytime We get a signal that we are on the right track to that goal, and that signal could be, okay. I did the workout. I just trust that these workouts are going to give me the result I want.[0:20:47] Andrew Huberman: But, of course, we know that when people get a glimmer of the idea or some objective feedback that they're on the right path, That dopamine system really fires and provides motivation for continuing toward the ultimate goal. And, As we've talked about in the, strength, speed, and hypertrophy episode, resistance training, itself has this built into it because of the infusion of blood into the muscles. You actually get a A little window into what you might get in terms of an adaptation simply by by way of the so called pump, whereas endurance type work generally doesn't have that. You don't see yourself get better, drop back, and then adapting to actually get better. But that's actually what you see with weight training.[0:21:27] Andrew Huberman: So given all of that contour of the dopamine system, What sorts of intermediate goals should I set for myself or should somebody set for themselves? And I realize it will probably depend on the ultimate goal. Yeah. But would you say check-in, on progress once every week, every month, 3 months.[0:21:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I can't I don't know if you can tell the look on my face. I love this this question and this topic. I spend so much time on it on my, senior graduate level program design course. I've been fortunate to work with a few athletes where we've had multiple years. And if you can really take the time to step back and go, it's not about optimizing for the next 6 weeks.[0:22:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: And in in this case, it's not the next fight. It is the championship fight that we need to get to in 3 years, or it is the Olympics, which run a quad Program. Right? You're really optimizing for that 4 year. If you can have that foresight and really think about that and then work backwards, You can see some pretty tremendous things.[0:22:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: The the sort of saying that is, like, we gen we tend to overestimate What we can get done in a week and underestimate what can happen in a year. That can be extraordinarily powerful. However, you have to have those metrics Called out ahead of time because you will lose motivation in that short term because you won't see that result immediately. But if you remember, I'm on a path to 4% or 2% or whatever you need to be. Therefore, I only need to be this far right now.[0:22:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: I need to be that far and then that far. It's actually quite clear. And so what we would actually do in that scenario, Not to go, like, so off track here because I I can really go on this stuff, is a cup let let's say it was the year recommendation. You're gonna actually need to go to the last part of smart, which is timely. So part of setting this goal is making sure you understand the time domain responsible, and it's Actually, quite great here because not to go inception on us where we're like list within a list and Rob kills us over here.[0:23:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: But number 1 of this program design thing was assessing your goal. Number 2 is identifying your defender. What I mean by that is what is stopping you from hitting that goal? So you wanna lose 2% body fat in the next year. Okay.[0:23:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. What's gonna stop us? Once we can achieve that, we'll go into more of that in in a second, then you just start walking that 2% backwards. So you might have to go something like this. Look, every time I start working out really hard, I always get hurt.[0:23:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Interesting. Okay. Great. So maybe instead of jumping really hard into an inter high intensity interval training program, Knowing we're likely to hurt something or get burnt out or quit or whatever the the defender is for you, Maybe we invest something right now, which is maybe improving your flexibility or working on movement technique. Whatever's gonna stop you from getting Or maybe we progress slower, so we don't get there.[0:24:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: That will allow us to do the work necessary to hit that goal 12 months from now, not 2 weeks from now, not 2 months from now. Maybe that's not the case. Maybe you're like, no, look. Hey, I move well. I feel like I'm in, like, decent shape.[0:24:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: I've got enough muscle mass on me. We've talked in previous episodes why having insufficient muscle mass is sometimes detrimental for fat loss. So you checked all that boxes. I don't get hurt very often. Alright.[0:24:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I got equipment around. No problem. I've got the time in my schedule, and I have enough muscle. Great. Well, now we maybe just split it up and say, look, we got 12 months, we got 2%.[0:24:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's as simple as doing a half a percent per quarter of the year. And now all we're looking at is that number. Right? I don't have to necessarily get all these things done. I can go quarter, half percent, Half percent, half percent, half percent.[0:25:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna get there. Right? The other scenario that I laid out a 2nd ago, It maybe needs to look like something like this. Quarter 1 is gonna be 0%. Like, woah.[0:25:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. That's right. You may not lose a pound for the next 3 months. We don't care.[0:25:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's not the goal of these 3 months. I know that's the goal this year. That's our major macro cycle goal. We're going to get there. But to get there most effectively, we need to invest in, You know, working more with your chiropractor or whatever the thing is.[0:25:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? That will allow us to then go half a percent Q2 when we can really start training, but we're gonna ramp into it. Q3, we're gonna go another half a percent. And now, we're halfway there. Q4, we've invested So much, you're ready to go.[0:25:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna go hard. We're gonna get that last 1% that last quarter, and we're gonna get there, and you won't be hurt.[0:26:02] Andrew Huberman: So So that makes it very clear, and I can also envision how the precise structure of these intermediate goals would vary depending on What sort of adaptation one is pursuing? And I do remember from our previous episodes, that fat loss itself is not an adaptation. It is a byproduct of other adaptations. So Just wanna make sure that you know that I I was paying attention.[0:26:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's[0:26:23] Andrew Huberman: it's committed to memory.[0:26:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely.[0:26:26] Andrew Huberman: Some goals Such as fat loss are very quantifiable. Yep. And yet they might not be linear. Right? It's it's hard to know you know, the the assumption is if you ingest, you know, x fewer calories than are required per day, then you'll lose x amount of weight some percentage from body fat.[0:26:41] Andrew Huberman: I think, that queues up the idea that we need to build Some flexibility into our Mhmm. Our thinking about these intermediate goals in order to just make sure that dopamine system isn't tethered to exact numbers, you know Mhmm. Because after all, a reduction in 2% body fat, for instance, is really a desire to Achieve a different sort of overall body composition or recomposition. I don't know, by the way, that that's my exact goal. I I think one of my my goals is to be able to run a mile faster, and I'm sort of, haunted by this experience of wanting to run cross country in college and trying to walk on.[0:27:18] Andrew Huberman: We weren't a division one school, but the Threshold for being, considered for the team was you had to run a sub 10 minute 2 mile, which turns out to be very, very fast.[0:27:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's really hard. Yeah.[0:27:29] Andrew Huberman: I didn't I did not Do that. I didn't even come close. Yeah. But, and I don't think that I could reasonably do that now. Have you challenged me?[0:27:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm not I'm not interested in committing to the kind of training required. The sacrifice isn't meaningful enough for me.[0:27:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fair enough, Kate.[0:27:48] Andrew Huberman: But lowering one's, mile, time to run a mile by, I don't know, 10%[0:27:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[0:27:56] Andrew Huberman: Seems like a reasonable goal, across 6 months.[0:27:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure.[0:28:00] Andrew Huberman: Great. So in the case of a goal like that, clearly, there are specific training programs, but this raises the issue of what if I have other goals as well? Mhmm. And at what point do people's Having multiple goals start to set up collisions between goals. How do we know whether or not something is reasonable, not just on its own, but because of the other things that one has, structured into their program.[0:28:23] Andrew Huberman: So being able to reduce a mile time by 10% in 6 months, okay, maybe that's doable, maybe it's not. You can tell me. But also being able to, you know, double the amount that they can, do for, you know, single repetition leg extension for that matter. At the same time, that seems those seem like incompatible goals.[0:28:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So a couple of things. Number 1, The more specific and precise you can be with a single goal, the faster you will get there, generally. So in theory, if you had one thing you wanted to achieve, the best way to go about it is to focus on that. Give it the most priority.[0:29:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: That doesn't mean you can't do anything else along Away, you can, but you would wanna focus on that. The more additional goals you bring in, the more distraction you're creating for that primary goal. Depending on what those goals are, you can actually do them at the same time. Some other combinations are less effective. Think about it like this.[0:29:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: We went through those 9 adaptations, and we went through them in a specific order on purpose. The closer those adaptations are together in that list, The more compatible they are to training each other. The further away, they become more challenging. So just to give a few examples. If you wanted to improve your speed and power, You could basically train those simultaneously.[0:29:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: They would not interfere with each other at all. In fact, since power is speed times force, it would be complementary. If you just walk down the line from there to strength, hey, same thing. If you get faster, that's gonna aid in strength because force is mass times acceleration. So if you improve acceleration, you're contributing to strength.[0:30:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Same thing with power. So speed, power, and strength are generally very complimentary. You can absolutely train all 3 of those goals at the same time and have no issues. Getting into hypertrophy. Now we've got a little bit of distinction.[0:30:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're gonna train strength and hypertrophy, as we talked about in that episode, at the base, those are gonna be complimentary. You add on some muscle, you're gonna get stronger. You start training for strength, that's probably gonna help you out on some muscle mass. As you get to the end of that spectrum, The overlap between the two starts to go away, such that if you truly wanted to maximize strength above everything else, If you continue to train for hypertrophy as well, that's going to take too many resources out of your recovery bin, and you won't be able to do that. The inverse would also be the same.[0:30:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. If you're training to maximize strength, you wouldn't be able to put enough volume on to get sufficient hypertrophy. So If you want to then combine speed with hypertrophy, you're going farther away from each other, which means it's going to be more and more distraction. So the hypertrophy training would cause a ton of fatigue. You wouldn't be able to go at max speed for your speed or power strength, so you're gonna be compromising those results.[0:31:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now Speed training won't compromise your hypertrophy training because it's non fatiguing. Right? And so, boom, here we have a little bit of an interference effect one way, but Probably not the other. Let's move down the spectrum one more time and get into endurance. We won't go through all of these things.[0:31:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: But you you're getting an idea here. Oh, a little bit of a high intensity intervals? Okay. Cool. Now would that compromise my speed, power, or strength?[0:31:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Probably because there's a little bit of residual fatigue. If the volume was low enough, then you'd be fine. All you're worried about there is not necessarily like some sort of cellular mechanism. It's just simple fatigue. It is amount of energy expenditure versus is that compromising my recovery to come back.[0:32:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Would those first 3 or 4 of those, speed, power, strength, Interfere with your ability to elevate your anaerobic capacity? Probably not. Almost surely. In fact, if you look at Any of the literature on endurance training, you will see that speed, power, and strength almost always improve endurance. Right.[0:32:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Endurance training added on top of strength can be detrimental, can have a neutral effect, But generally doesn't help one get stronger by adding additional conditioning. Unless you're so unfit, you can't get through the volume needed In the strength training. Right. One more example here so we don't drag this out too far. In the case of something like I wanna lose fat.[0:32:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, hey. We don't have to worry about interference. It doesn't really matter. If you're fatigued for your hypertrophy session, Not a big deal. We're just trying to get some work done.[0:33:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: If your hypertrophy session fatigued you from your conditioning, it's cool because you got the work done. So you don't have to worry about it so much. So really kinda depends on the actual goal. And what you wanna pay attention to do is actually what are the chances of overlap, which means, like, what are the the Adaptations you get physiologically that crossover from 1 to the other. And then what are the ones that are actually gonna start interfering?[0:33:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, I have in my, In my class, I have this giant matrix chart of interference effect going from adaptations through a whole bunch of systems. Everything from, Like handling pH to lymphatic drainage to bone mineral density, etcetera, you can walk through these whole things and say, which ones actually have a positive effect? Which ones have a massive positive effect? And then which ones actually have a little bit of interference? Perhaps if you guys are nice enough, we could throw that into A a newsletter or something.[0:33:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some some PDF or something to[0:33:55] Andrew Huberman: I think that would be immensely valuable. I think some of that more extensive information And when it's laid out in grid form like that, it's really useful. So Yeah. We should do well, now we've said it. So we we[0:34:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: I didn't say we'd do it. I said perhaps.[0:34:07] Andrew Huberman: I I think it's a great idea. I think it's a terrific idea. The idea that items closer on to each other on the list of those 9 different Tations are going to be easier to achieve in parallel than items further apart. Makes perfect sense. And what I heard was that there's a a few Caveats that might seem minor, but they but they're actually quite important, such as anything that is relatively low intensity and doesn't impede recovery can probably be included as a parallel goal.[0:34:40] Andrew Huberman: So, some speed work in conjunction with some long duration cardio work. And since even though we're talking about number 2 on that list and number 9 on that list[0:34:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: In that case, the long duration endurance, even if it's low intensity, may actually interfere with the speed If the volume gets too high. If you're talking about I went on a 30 minute jog, for most people that that it's totally fine. What we're really talking about here is when the miles start piling up, or the the time really starts getting there in combination with Some of the things the factors we've talked about earlier, which is exercise choice. So more eccentric landing based exercise choices. Running, for example, is more likely to interfere Then cycling.[0:35:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Because you're not landing. Swimming is low impact. So if you're gonna do those things, you can hedge your bets a little bit by Choosing an exercise choice that is less impactful. Again, if we're literally because there's oftentimes confusing here.[0:35:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: It was like, oh, Don't do 10 minutes on the treadmill before you lift. You're gonna cut oh, like, time out. A warm up is fine. We're really talking about probably more than 30 plus minutes At higher than 60% heart rate, like, random number, something like that. Depends on the person, etcetera.[0:35:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it has to be a decent chunk. Again, you can actually fix that by then just consuming calories. You can also fix that by making sure everything else in the hidden invisible stressor bucket is improved. So this is, like, one of our tricks that we'll get into when we get into recovery, is you don't necessarily need to to reduce your training if you just ramp up your recovery.[0:36:13] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is it covers my vitamins, my minerals, and the probiotics are especially important to me.[0:36:43] Andrew Huberman: Athletic greens also contains adaptogens, which are critical for recovering from stressed from exercise, from work, or just general life. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2. Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim the special offer. I'm going to take the liberty of assuming that most people fall into one of either 3 bins in terms of their goals.[0:37:15] Andrew Huberman: Again, most people. Certainly, there are gonna people that lie outside these, bins. I think if you pulled A 100 people or a 100,000 or a 1000000 people as to what their major goals were in working out, they'd say, as you so nicely listed out As before, aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity. But that 1 in 3 really kind of sit higher than most People would like to perhaps even admit they wanna look good, which usually means they want to lose some fat, gain some muscle in specific places. I realize there are folks out there who wanna gain a lot of muscle.[0:37:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Just muscle everywhere. But I think most people would like to have a little more shape here, a little more, muscle there to either balance out their aesthetic or to accentuate certain parts of their physique. And they would probably like to shave off some subcutaneous fat. Although there are those exceptionally lean people out there, and they exist too, I think it would be gain muscle in specific places, lose at and do it in a way that also provides some booth to their health span and longevity.[0:38:22] Andrew Huberman: I would say that that might even be 50% of people out there. Again, I'm taking the liberty of of guesstimating. Another bin I would venture He's interested in getting stronger and putting on more muscle. Certainly, there are a number of people that are interested in doing that, and that could even be more muscle all over or more muscle with some, accentuation to certain areas where they happen to be weaker or less less developed as it were. And then the 3rd bin, the people that really enjoy cardiovascular work.[0:38:54] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I should say the 2nd bin probably Care about their longevity also, but it's not really foremost. Like, yeah, you know, I'm feel great now, and I'll live to, you know, I'll live to be whatever, but I only wanna do it if I get that much muscle. Right? We know these kinds of folks. I mean I,[0:39:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: I yeah.[0:39:10] Andrew Huberman: I don't know[0:39:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: this. In my class every year when I asked, like, why you guys all lift? And, of course, like, I make them put their hand up. I'm like, you guys are in my class. You're gonna put your hand up and let you lift weights.[0:39:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I asked them, like, why do you train? And, like, health is long term health is, like, on the list, and they all, Like, I'm like any of you that selected health are liars. Like, you're 20 to 25, you are not exercising for health. You're exercising because you wanna look A certain way or gets stronger. Once you get past that undergraduate age, though, the actual desire to live longer and better actually becomes pretty real.[0:39:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think that there are people who wanna feel better. They they know that exercise and that the results from exercise can make them feel better. But, yeah, that 2nd bin tends to be more focused on the aesthetic change, It seems we're being strong. And then the 3rd category, I think, are people, I know a lot of folks like this, who really enjoy What are normally considered endurance type activities.[0:40:02] Andrew Huberman: And here, I just wanna highlight again what you so beautifully illustrated in previous episodes that You can gain a lot of endurance even using weights or machines. It just depends on how you use them. Right? Absolutely. It's not about the the exercise, about how you perform them, and etcetera.[0:40:15] Andrew Huberman: And you, Again, beautifully provided all those details as to how to create endurance regardless of equipment standards, etcetera. But that 3rd category seemed to be people who enjoy running, cycling, swimming, hiking, dancing, Activities that they can do for long periods of time that often will involve some sort of, skill that is based on improving motor patterns. So maybe not so much Stride, but, certainly for people that are really love tennis.[0:40:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:40:45] Andrew Huberman: People that, love a sport like golf. Right? Do they wanna be able to not just walk the, You know, they wanna walk the 18 holes. They want they wanna have a great golf swing, etcetera. I'm not a golf player, so forgive me if my nomenclature is off.[0:40:56] Andrew Huberman: So I was for 3rd Yeah. A golfer.[0:40:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the play golf.[0:40:58] Andrew Huberman: Oh, got it. You don't play golf.[0:41:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Golf. You wouldn't call a golf player.[0:41:02] Andrew Huberman: I played miniature golf a few times. That's about it. Although, Stanford does have a beautiful golf course. I'm told I should learn how to play golf.[0:41:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'll come up and play it for you if you want. You come up. I'll play it. I'll tell you how it works. Get me on that course.[0:41:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: See it[0:41:14] Andrew Huberman: from my lab. So category 1, I think, is a significant fraction of people. Yeah. So as we lay out these different, ways to assess goals and as we approach The structure of a of a program as you'll tell us. If we could perhaps touch back to those every once in a while, I again, I'm taking the liberty of assuming that we will we will net about 80 to 90% of people out there.[0:41:40] Andrew Huberman: Again, those categories mean people who want to lose some fat, Maybe build some muscle in specific areas on their body and really wanna be healthy. They wanna feel great, and they wanna have a long health span a k end lifespan. You wanna live a long time feeling great. 2nd category, people wanna build more muscle and strength. Sure.[0:41:58] Andrew Huberman: They don't wanna damage their health, but that's not their main focus. Their main focus is on building muscle and strength. And then that 3rd category of people who really want to do more endurance type work feel great and strong doing it, but not because they can, you know, carry heavy weights while they're doing it, but rather they can feel vital and they can push harder for longer and maybe even translate that to some of the more recreational type activities or sports like tennis and things that are more long duration, playing soccer, maybe even softball or things of that sort.[0:42:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Surfing, swimming, all[0:42:30] Andrew Huberman: of those. 3 categories, maybe we could call those bin a, b, and c for sake of today's discussion. I think, If you're willing to embrace[0:42:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I love it.[0:42:38] Andrew Huberman: I think that will be informative toward our listeners in a way that, simply not assuming what people's, different goals are, might not be able to accomplish. Said differently, hopefully by doing that, people will derive a lot more from the description of the program that you're gonna give us.[0:42:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Love it.[0:42:54] Andrew Huberman: Now I am certain that I wanna let you return to your list of the 5 things that people need to consider when establishing a exercise program.[0:43:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Great. Let's do that. I also do wanna acknowledge a point you've brought up acutely. Exercise doesn't mean just lifting weights.[0:43:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's my background. That's what I spend my time on. So I sort of default to examples in that category, but it doesn't have to be that. You've articulated plenty of other ways where you can get amazing forms of exercise that that have nothing to do with lifting weights. So for those Folks in in was it been c or 3?[0:43:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: I[0:43:29] Andrew Huberman: can't remember. We go. A is gain muscle, lose fat, be healthy, now and forever.[0:43:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[0:43:34] Andrew Huberman: Then b is, Get stronger, gain muscle. Don't damage your health, but not really focus on health in the immediate term. And then Right. BIN c is want to Play or do endurance type activities and quote, unquote feel strong doing it, so have more vigor to be able to do that longer and and maybe with more attention to skill, etcetera, and, of course, also want to improve their health.[0:44:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: What you've effectively done is you've given us 3 different avatars with 3 different goals. Right. So the next step for each person or group is going to be to identify their defenders. But before we get that, we gotta close the loop on this smart thing. So in each case, they have either chosen that goal based on their personal preference, or perhaps they did our our fitness testing Protocol and and realize they need to gain strength.[0:44:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So whether the reason they chose to be in buckets b or a or c Was because of our protocol or is this personal preference? It really doesn't matter. They still wanna go through this process of laying out their goals and And making sure that, again, they are specific. Right? So, let's go through BIN c, which is a great one.[0:44:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wanna have, more energy, and you wanna Feel stronger when you're doing your kite boarding. You wanna feel stronger when you finish your round of tennis, round of golf, Game of tennis. Okay. Great. That's a different strength.[0:44:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely. See, I hear I know what you're saying though. Amazing. So that goal needs to be specific To that. Right?[0:45:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it would be hard to make a goal like, I wanna feel better at the end of my round. Boy, what that depends on too many other factors. A better goal would be something like this. I want to be able to run this Two mile loop that I do around my neighborhood, and I wanna do it and have a lower heart rate at the end. Or I wanna be able to get my heart rate back my heart rate recovery back faster.[0:45:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Amazing. That will that will probably align with you Feeling, quote unquote, stronger with it. Right? So I did the same course, and either I can do it at the same speed and it's not nearly as hard, or I can go faster. Whichever one.[0:45:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: It doesn't matter. But that would be an example of a specific goal. The other buckets you laid out kind of already have specific goals, like, I wanna get stronger. Well, that that's going to be the goal. The other one is going to be, you know, I wanna lose some fat.[0:45:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. That's kind of the goal is sort of implicit in that. It's the other people where you're just like, I don't really care about that. I just wanna be able to surf the great waves and then not feel exhausted Afterwards. Alright.[0:46:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Cool. Well, then you still should pick a metric that is not that activity maybe, because it won't be within your control depending on the waves and Temperature and all this stuff that you can use as a proxy to say, if I were to do something that represented me feeling probably better when I surf, what would that be? It's not perfect, but it would be still as specific as you could get. You still wanna make sure it's measurable. Again, this example might be something like You're gonna go to the pool and time how long it takes you to swim 800 meters or something.[0:46:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? It's attainable, and then you'll set a goal that's realistic And timely. I'm gonna improve by 5% in the next 2 months. Okay. Cool.[0:46:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: That probably falls in the realm, And then you're making the assumption that if you did that, you'll probably feel better when you go out to do your primary activity, which is, say, surf. The reality of it is, every time we work with an actual athlete, that's what we do. At least don't come to us to lift weights. They don't come to us to get stronger. They come to us because they wanna play better, and they wanna stay on the field more.[0:47:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: What we're trying to convince them of is if you do this thing in the gym, Then that should translate into you being better at your sport, recovering faster, being less injured. But it's still just a proxy, and so that's all you're doing with these other nonspecific goals, especially when they're performance based goals. And we didn't package it that way, but that's really what you talked about for bin c there. It is a performance based goal. I wanna be able to perform when I'm in the Field.[0:47:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: In my brain, that's a sport. In your brain, it's when you're at yoga class. It's the same thing. Like, we've said this earlier in our series that if you have a body, you're an I wanna prepare your body such that it can do exactly what you want it to do. You then get to have the choice of what you ask it to do.[0:47:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: You call it a sport. You call it your Saturday hike with your family. I don't really care. It's the same thing. You get control of your body performing the way you want it to perform, And that's what this whole thing is about.[0:48:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. So now that we've covered, I think, as much as we need to regarding assessing and choosing a goal, I wanna get back this idea of identifying your defender. So you really need to think carefully about what is stopping you from hitting those goals. So you're forecasting a little bit. You're also going back into your own personal history.[0:48:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Do you have history of knee pain? Do you have a history of Working too much. Do you have a history of a lot of travel? Do you have a history of getting sick a lot?[0:48:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: What are these things that are happening that are gonna stop you from hitting your goal? A couple of examples I've already laid out, so we don't need to go too much longer here. But in the case of somebody who is in maybe, bin a, Right. Which is wanna lose some fat, maybe gain a little bit of muscle. Okay.[0:48:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: What's stopping you from the strength and conditioning side? Is it the fact that you can't train consistent enough? Is it the fact that when you go to train, you don't know what to do? Is it the fact when you go to train, you train your ass off and you're not getting results? Okay.[0:49:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. All 3 of these different scenarios are going to result in different programs because they have different reasons you're failing. And that is really critical. Instead of just going, I want a fat loss program and picking 1 up off the Internet. It may not actually be addressing The point of failure for you.[0:49:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the sooner you can choose your programs based on why you're failing, The sooner you'll start getting results. You have to run a little bit of a critical analysis there. And it can be, You know, something scientific and it could be a measurement. And it also could just be you thinking about you've tried this in the past and why didn't it work? Wasn't that interesting?[0:49:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Tell me more about why it wasn't interesting. Oh, I just I'm not really into machines, and that's all I had. Okay. Great.[0:49:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or I I loved it. I loved the gym I was at, and I was getting results, but it was so far away. Okay. Interesting. Why did you stop before?[0:50:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why didn't it work? Or if it did work in the past, amazing. Let's go back to something similar, but has your life changed at all? Is there anything different about now than when it worked 3 years ago? Yes, no.[0:50:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: If not, maybe we run it right back. If it is, okay, we're gonna per sort of predict those things. And you wanna work effectively, what I'm saying is throughout this entire 10 step process is going to be, You wanna make sure that there are the nonnegotiables that are in your life that you know are going to be ahead of your fitness program, and you wanna work with those things not against them. Right. Because life will win.[0:50:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: When it comes to your children, when it comes to your job, life is going to win. You're gonna have to give up something. It's gonna take some hard work, but we wanna fight the right battles for most people. Right? Even for our professional athletes.[0:50:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: We We get this all the time. It's just like they have nothing else to do but train. Right? They're like, well, hold on now. They're getting traded.[0:50:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: They have agents to deal with. They may not have a contract. They have A family's but but but I think life will get in the way, I promise. And so you wanna fight the battles that you can win, Not ones that you're going to lose. And so that's really what this game is about.[0:51:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if the battle is, hey, my job is super hectic. Okay. Great. We're gonna come up with a different strategy that's more flexible maybe. I'm still gonna hold you to the fire.[0:51:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm not gonna be easier on you, but We're just not going to try to set up a situation where you have to do this workout Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Because you know your job is on the road and you're the provide all the the, you know, Income for your family and your okay. Whatever the thing is. Right? That's what we really wanna identify.[0:51:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: So when I say identify your defenders, you need to run a little bit of Call analysis on this. And a little bit of a tool I'll use for this, is a modification of another system I stole from Kenny which is what we call the quadrant system. So you can imagine everything in your life goes into 1 of 4 buckets. Alright. Now bucket 1, I'm just gonna call business.[0:52:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: And this is anything to do with your job, income, sort of all those things. Bucket 2 is relationships. So, again, this could be family or love life, like anything that we would call relationships. Social connection, purpose, anything right there. Bucket 3 is your fitness, And bucket 4 is your recovery.[0:52:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: So one of the first steps we take is we walk through this and we say, alright, you have 10 points total. And you get to distribute these 10 points across the 4 areas. So not 10 each, you get 10 total. As we walk through and we say right now, where are you giving your points? And and we could do this right now for you if you'd like, or I could make up a a scenario.[0:52:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Do you wanna do it? Sure. Great. So, Andrew, right now in the last month, if you had 10 points total in those four Categories. Where where would you be distributing the most points?[0:53:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Which category and how many points would that be?[0:53:03] Andrew Huberman: Business, my work.[0:53:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Business, work, jobs, sort of all those things?[0:53:07] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:53:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: And how many out of 10?[0:53:09] Andrew Huberman: Which doesn't, I should say, ever quite feel like work. Running a laboratory and doing, the podcast doesn't ever really feel like work in the traditional sense, but it's career. It's it's work. It's it involves relationships, but it certainly Doesn't enhance my fitness, except of my vocal cords and, and recovery. So, so with those, notes there.[0:53:34] Andrew Huberman: I would say, 4 or 4 to 5. You pick. 5.[0:53:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: 5. Fair. That's the most common number. 5 business 5.[0:53:45] Andrew Huberman: Great. Once again, I'm typical, which makes me happy.[0:53:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You nailed it.[0:53:48] Andrew Huberman: One of the few ways in which I've been accused of being normal. I think five for business.[0:53:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: No kidding. What's the next highest, and what's that score?[0:53:57] Andrew Huberman: I do invest in relationships, I would say. Does it have to be around, Can it be a, a whole integer. Oh, a whole integer.[0:54:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: 2. 2. Alright. We're 7 out of 10 here. So would you say it is fair that you spend roughly 2 a half percent of your it's not necessarily I'm it's energy, time, focus, sort of all these things.[0:54:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Two and a half times as much on your business as you do in your relationships.[0:54:31] Andrew Huberman: It varies depending on what's going on. That, feels a little skewed in the direction of business, So I might want to adjust to a 4:3 ratio there.[0:54:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: May maybe not.[0:54:41] Andrew Huberman: But I am gonna hold to 5 k. 2, business Relationships and then but just for sake of example and because, you know, this is doesn't seem like a Exceedingly precise measure. It can have some slop. Of course. K.[0:54:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Where would you put fitness and recovery?[0:55:02] Andrew Huberman: I definitely put energy into fitness. So I I'm gonna give that also a 2.[0:55:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Which leads[0:55:12] Andrew Huberman: 1 for recovery. Great.[0:55:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: That what you just laid out is, again, the most quintessential Split you could have. In fact, you run this game on everyone, they're gonna come up with basically the same answer, unless they don't work out or or whatever. Right? Okay. So a couple of rules here.[0:55:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Recovery must be at minimum half of your fitness allocation. In your case, 2 to 1. You're fine.[0:55:33] Andrew Huberman: I think you're gonna say it has to be half. Like, it has to be Five out of 10 points. No. Chase, as it doesn't leave much for anything else.[0:55:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: I would like it Yeah. To be minimum 20% of the total, which means 2 out of 10. Mhmm. Now and when I say recovery, I don't simply mean muscle. I mean, you need personal time.[0:55:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: You need meditation. You need, enjoy sleep. You need to go to a concert and get out and see people. And so, like, whatever the things that that give you energy back. Right?[0:56:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some folks, that's personal time. Some folks, that's social time. Whatever that means to you. Right?[0:56:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I actually get a lot of energy from my work. And so it you know, that's why some of these numbers are a little bit you can Always the customer. Cloak the the underlying dynamics. So here's[0:56:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: what we do from this game. We look at that and we say, if that's our split, Andrew, 5, 3, 2, 1.[0:56:20] Andrew Huberman: 5, 2, 2, 1.[0:56:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: 5, 2, 2, 1.[0:56:23] Andrew Huberman: I'd love to be able to put 3 in relationships Just because, but then I need 11 out of,[0:56:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So here's the fun game we play. You're currently at this, and you don't get to add to 11. You have to stay at 10. There your 10 is different than my 10 maybe right, but 10 is 10.[0:56:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're just whatever the maximum you can actually do, it's you. So If we went back to our training goal, whatever that goal was for you, and we went back to our defenders, we would look at this score now and say, is 3 out of 10 fitness was 3. Right?[0:56:54] Andrew Huberman: Fitness is 2. So it's 5, 2, 2, 1.[0:56:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is 2 out of 10 sufficient To hit that training goal in that time frame you described. And let's say you said, I wanna hit a new PR in my mile 6 months from now.[0:57:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. For for simplicity's sake and also because it's largely true, I'm gonna put myself in in, what I referred to as bin a earlier.[0:57:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great.[0:57:16] Andrew Huberman: Right? My BiFAP percentage is is okay. It's it's in the Rain It's[0:57:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: good.[0:57:21] Andrew Huberman: That I would like, but I would, like to bring down a little bit. I'd gain a little bit muscle here and there, keep keep regain some endurance, and certainly certainly, My immediate and long term health are extremely important to me.[0:57:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. So then the question and then my answer may be yes, that this is the optimal split for you. If it is not, then we have to make a choice. We either alter the goal or the timeline to make it realistic, or we alter our quadrant. And then if we're going to alter our quadrant, the next step is critically important.[0:57:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: We need a list of very specific life actions that we're going to take That allows that split to happen. So if you said, for example, I wanna put 3 into relationships. Great. What specific life actions are you going to take to pull 1 from fitness, you can't pull any from recovery, or 1 from business? And and then we don't have to actually answer This is, you know, too personal.[0:58:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: I know you don't like making these things about you because[0:58:21] Andrew Huberman: Right. That's the other reason to do it. And, it is a a diabolical trick to make to insist that these be whole integers. Because I would have done I know. You know, like a 4.5 for business and a 2.5 for relationships.[0:58:32] Andrew Huberman: But, Obviously, you write the rules on this, not me.[0:58:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you would just walk through that list. Okay? And and list could be something like, I promise to Not work after 7 PM, Thursday through Sunday, or or whatever the thing is. Right? I promise I'm I'm gonna Make sure that I don't start work before 8 AM or whatever.[0:58:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? No more trips. Just make those things specific And measurable, not just like I'm gonna work less. That's never gonna go. What is the very specific life action you're going to take?[0:59:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's gonna be alarm that goes off Tuesday night at 4 5 PM. And no matter what we at Barbell Shrugged, we used to have a little shirt that was like d three a t, which is like drop everything and train. Which At 3 PM in the afternoon, no matter what's happening, we dropped everything and trained. Because that was like, when you start a business and you're going, things just run away from you. Right?[0:59:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: And it's just sort of like, man, it's not my company. But those guys are like, we are a strength conditioning company, and we're not training. So we had to just make this hard rule, and it was just like a little thing that came up, and it was easy to say, drop everything and train. 3 o'clock. There you go.[0:59:37] Andrew Huberman: I like this, drop d, e everything a n n blank. Like, it could be drop everything and[0:59:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[0:59:45] Andrew Huberman: You know, pick your favorite.[0:59:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. Drop everything and read.[0:59:48] Andrew Huberman: Pick the relevant. Read yeah. Absolute you know, I really miss reading for pleasure. I would put that under recovery and protect[0:59:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Drop everything and breathe. And breathe. That a lot.[0:59:57] Andrew Huberman: Oh, and breathe, you are saying oh, and breathe. I was saying read.[0:59:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: I said that too.[1:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Because for me, reading is actually is both recovery and relationship, because oftentimes in in my relationships, I've, insist not insisted. I certainly didn't insist. We've had a format of reading the same book in parallel.[1:00:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, great.[1:00:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Not necessarily side by side, but the same book in parallel and then discussing it. It's a Wonderful practice for listening to the same audiobook. Yep.[1:00:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: It works well. You can do drop everything and play. Mhmm. You're just gonna go do something fun. You're gonna play video games.[1:00:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna go play with your kid. You're going to do it and play with your dog. Like, you some it doesn't have to actually be played, but play it to you could signify personal time. Right? It doesn't really matter.[1:00:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm. So yeah. That's it.[1:00:39] Andrew Huberman: I really like to just drop everything in blank, category that you probably shouldn't have more than, what, 2 or 3 of those overall?[1:00:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Pretty much, like, 1 is the 1 to 2 maybe is where you wanna go after that.[1:00:51] Andrew Huberman: So the idea is then to redistribute the numbers on this list, but through a very concrete action and I I like this drop everything in blank because it, speaks to the nonnegotiable aspect of it.[1:01:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Has to be. You it's life will get pushed.[1:01:04] Andrew Huberman: Right. It's not a fine time to. Right? Correct. It's not in next year I'm going to[1:01:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[1:01:09] Andrew Huberman: I love it.[1:01:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. When you make when you when you put those things, those things you might as well just don't even put on your list. Right? It's not gonna happen.[1:01:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You're talking to somebody who loves To rules, because when they are nonnegotiable rules, they provide this incredible organizing force for the brain.[1:01:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:01:27] Andrew Huberman: It it's really a neuroscience thing in my mind The Totally. The and, actually, we did an episode on happiness where you find that once people make a decision, if they eliminate the possibility of other decisions like, literally, the hatch Just close. That is it.[1:01:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Burn the boats. The the the Yeah.[1:01:40] Andrew Huberman: The rates of subjective happiness, immediate and long term happiness over time go way, way up.[1:01:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:01:47] Andrew Huberman: And so I'm convinced that the nervous system doesn't like to keep the valves on these dopamine circuits open. I actually think it diminishes from the reward component. And there Actually, some data on this. Anyway, I don't wanna take us off track. But The[1:01:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: last part of this, what we do then, is we take that quadrant and we take that list, and then you're gonna print it Physically, and you're gonna put it in 2 places. This could actually be on your phone. You don't have to print. You can screenshot. It'd be the background of your phone.[1:02:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: So every time you click on your phone, you immediately see that quadrant. Like, it's a very clear reminder of, like, what are my priorities today? Right? Just a simple little picture. I also like to put it in your place of failure.[1:02:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: So for a lot of people that is, like, on their laptop or right above their workstation. Right? It's like the thing that's going to lose and beat your fitness is your job, typically. Right? Or it's on your TV.[1:02:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's on your Netflix control. No. Sorry, Netflix. No offense. But you know what I mean?[1:02:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, it's whatever the thing is that you fail for. I play too many video games. Great. There. I work too much.[1:02:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great. And you put it there, and you put it also the last component is it has to also be in the hands of somebody who can hold you accountable. Right? Wife, training partner, business partner, whatever.[1:02:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So It's like, hey, Andrew. Like, you promised you were going to do x yourself. Why are you still here? You committed to this, you gotta get out of here. Someone who will, like, Be like, no.[1:03:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. Just drop everything and read. It's 8 o'clock. You're supposed to be reading. You gotta go.[1:03:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna Check back in every week. Check back in it doesn't matter every month. And then you can adjust. It's fine. You can always change the system, but that has to now change.[1:03:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: You gotta print a new one, And now it's a whole new promise you've made to yourself. So you've gotta be able to hold yourself accountable to those things. It's gotta be flexible enough to where it's realistic. It can't be I'm not gonna work after 6 o'clock every day. Maybe it's just 3 days a week.[1:03:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe it's on Saturdays I promise to Work for the 1st 2 hours so I don't work Saturday night. Or whatever or the inverse. I'm not gonna work Saturday you get it. You could come up with a 1000000 examples here. So, that's the system we use to make sure that we have now properly identified where we're going.[1:03:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: We found a road map to that, and now we know exactly how we're going to stay on track. I have to take this opportunity to add 1 more thing to our, drop everything list. And you gave the example of deer, Which is maybe drop everything and read or drop everything and relax or, another example. I have to add a deal, Which is Drop Everything, and this is for you, Lex. Love.[1:04:16] Andrew Huberman: Actually, one of the advantages of having a dog or having children is that, The drop everything and love is, often enforced by the faces of Of the of those that you love, they just show up in whatever space you happen to be in.[1:04:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Especially if you work from home.[1:04:33] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health and well-being Can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy.[1:05:10] Andrew Huberman: They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, What sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you? If you'd like to Try InsideTracker. You can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20%[1:05:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Let's move on to the next one. Shall we? Number 3 here is going to be what I call calendar or sort of time frame. So it's going back a little bit and saying you've Decided on this goal and you've identified the defenders. Now we need to come up with a realistic time frame for how long it's going to take to accomplish that goal.[1:05:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: And when you do that, you need to look at your life schedule. And what I mean by that is, do you have important deadlines coming up? Do you have Holiday, do you have a trip? Do you have travel? Do your children have something coming up?[1:06:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You need to take all that information, and I literally lay out a calendar, And I write all those dates in a physical calendar first. And the reason I'm suggesting this is you wanna work your training backwards around that. As we've been discussing, life will win. If you try to plan a training program that is 5 days a week, 90 minutes today, and all of a sudden you look 2 weeks from now and you realize you've got a grant deadline, and then you've gotta take 2 days to go to Austin. It it's just foolish.[1:06:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're going to fail, and then you're gonna quit. And you're gonna be like, man, again, my training program failed. So you need to figure out what are the nonnegotiables are in that business quadrant And just not be foolish. Alright? So let's imagine you're gonna plot out, say, a 12 week training phase, And you wanna you've decided on this goal.[1:06:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then you look and and you realize in the middle of this 12 week span, week 5 is really Hectic and chaotic. Or you realize that this is a quarter in which something important is due. Maybe we wanna either adjust the Goal or what we really do in this step is going on to actually step number 4, which is choose the number of days Per week, you can exercise, and the length in terms of amount of time, you can truly afford To train. I would rather you underestimate that than overestimate it. So, you can you look at the calendar, you put all these nonnegotiables, the deadlines you Cannot move in the calendar.[1:07:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then you say, look. Based on this, realistically, I can conservatively train 3 days a week For 60 minutes total, and that includes the time I walk into the gym, my warm up, my down regulation breathing at the end, And then me getting back either in the shower and back. Because really now it's maybe 90 minutes by the time you traveled, you transitioned, you picked back up on work, you showered, you ate, Etcetera. That time just runs away from you, and all of a sudden it was a 2 and a half hour thing even though it was a 45 minute workout. So you really need to figure that thing If you're a few weeks in and you realize, oh, actually, I have a little more time than I thought, you can always train more.[1:08:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: You do another thing. You can add it. But what you don't wanna do is set up a program That is requiring you to do certain exercises on one day or certain styles of training on another, And then you constantly miss one of those days. I I thought I could do 4 days a week, but one day a week, something's getting pulled out. That's just gonna keep you off schedule.[1:08:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's gonna make you feel like a failure, and you're gonna run into problems with your training. So schedule 3 If you are sure you can get 3 and if there's an extra day, we can always do other fun stuff. Alright? So that's really step 3 and 4. Figure out your life events over the course of this Time.[1:08:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: How many days a week can you train, then how long in terms of minutes per workout? Notice, we haven't selected a single exercise yet. We haven't worried about how heavy rest intervals, all those modifiable variables. You don't need to pick those later. First, where are we going?[1:09:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: 2nd, how are we going to get there? Which is the quadrant in identifying of defenders. And now the third is, what are the restrictions I need to place on myself In terms of program design based on how often and how long I can work out, that is going to allow you to go back to some of the Previous episodes ago, man, you gave us all kinds of ideas. How do I know which one to choose? This is your answer.[1:09:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're going to choose based upon the limitations of Time and frequency. So if you've already said we're in let's imagine we're in bucket a or bucket c. It doesn't matter. And you go, look, the most I can afford with where I'm at with what's going on in my life is 3 days a week. Well, we automatically know we're gonna have to start training, Choosing a training style that's limited to 3 days a week.[1:09:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Don't even worry about the 4 or 5 day stuff. Those are off the table. And And now we're we so we've placed restrictions. It kinda goes back to that concept of I think it's one of your podcast guest Jocko. Right?[1:10:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is like, hey, structure gives us actually some freedom. So by creating some restrictions here, we're a little more free to go. I only actually have to choose between a and b, Rather than sitting down and going, man, there's all, 20 hours into this exercise podcast thing, there's so many options between And now it's easier to go oh, my only option is a or b. And there we go. So that's number 4.[1:10:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's 3 and 4. At that point, once we're good there, now what you wanna do is go to step number 5, which is actually select your exercises Or your movements. And this can be as simple as selecting like, you know, a kettlebell swing or running or swimming. It could be your entire exercise mode. And what you wanna do with exercise selection here is make sure that you're balancing those exercises across The whole week.[1:10:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not within necessarily every workout. So if you have 4 days a week, 5 days a week, You wanna look at the exercise selection and say, okay, I need to have somewhat of a reasonable balance between movement patterns Our muscle groups or front and back, side to side, however you're thinking of it, just across that week. Right? So again, say we're on a 3 day program And we're in either of the buckets, any of the buckets really. And we say, okay, great.[1:11:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe it's not ideal if all I select is Cycling everyday. That's not a lot of balance. I don't notice any there's no upper body work there. There's no torso work. There's no Other positions.[1:11:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: So maybe I'm gonna really focus on cycling, so I will do only cycling 2 days a week. But that 3rd day, I need to pick something for the other movement areas. And that's gonna make sure you in a reasonable balance. If you have an exercise that you like, great. If you have exercise you have access to.[1:11:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Again, maybe the gym is a giant pain in the ass. And so you could say, look, it's too far away. The closest one is 45 minutes there and back, so maybe I'm gonna restrict myself to only Kettlebell and bands and running because I can do those in my house. Awesome. We've actually created some freedom because we gave ourselves some restriction, And now we just have to figure out how am I going to give some movement patterns somewhat balanced across my 3 days.[1:12:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: So really, when it comes to exercise choice, It is selecting the patterns that you know how to execute, giving yourself against somewhat of a balance between the muscles and the joints And the movement patterns. Making sure that you are specifically targeting any muscle group or movement that you want. So making sure you you wanna improve muscle size in your glutes, you better make sure some of the exercises you're doing at least one day a week, You feel it in your actual glutes, so you can check that box. It doesn't have to be every exercise, it probably shouldn't. It doesn't even have to be every single day.[1:12:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: But make sure it's checked off somewhere on that list. And the last 1 is, is there a strategy in which you can progress it? So if you're like, I'm just gonna do bodyweight exercises. Okay. Great.[1:13:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, how are you gonna progress those? In the case like bodyweight, it's it's really hard to add load. Maybe you can put a weight vest on or something, but then maybe you don't have that or that's an extra thing or that can only go so far. So what's my progression strategy gonna be? Well, in this case, maybe you just Increase the complexity by going from 2 legs, like, say, a body weight squat to a single leg squat, Or you just increase repetitions, or you increase time you're gonna hold it.[1:13:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Whatever. My point is your progression strategy will be based upon the restrictions that You placed, based on availability and and things like that. The last thing I always recommend here in terms of exercise progression, To make sure that you can continue to do these things while lowering your risk of injury, both in the short term and long term, is to progress your exercise complexity in this this fashion. So make sure, number 1, you can do the exercise properly with the systems. So let's imagine a scenario where we're going to try to squat.[1:14:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, give yourself put your hands on a bench Or something like that. Now can you execute that squat perfectly with assistance? So you're holding on to something. Okay. Great.[1:14:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you can't, Then don't progress past that. Don't go now do a barbell back squat if you can't do it correctly when you had assistance. But let's assume most people can do that. Okay. Great.[1:14:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you can move on to the next step, which is can you do it well without assistance? So this would be body weight only. Check. Cool. We're good there.[1:14:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Now you can go ahead and move on. Can you do it well with an added eccentric load? So So in this particular case, if I, if we're learning to squat, we can do it well when I hold on to something. That's great.[1:14:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Now I can do it well with just my body weight. Now, if I put a little bit of weight on, whether it's a kettlebell in the front like a goblet squat or dumbbells to the side or whatever you wanna do, Can I lower and go all the way down and stay in perfect position? If you can do that, great. You're allowed to go to the next step, which is can you hold isometrically?[1:15:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: So can you go all the way down and then hold that bottom position? What you don't wanna do is start adding load or speed or fatigue If you're going down to the bottom position of the movement and you are out of control, we really wanna avoid this. So I want you to show me you can go down and you can lower the weight Under control. You can hold it in that position under control. If we're clear there, now we can add the concentric portion.[1:15:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. You can now go ahead, you can lower it, you can hold that position of most danger, and now you can move up At whatever speed we want. We are all good there. Once you can show me those things, you can add the last 2 steps, which are now speed, if you choose to. And the last 1 which is fatigue.[1:15:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? I would really discourage people from doing exercises to fatigue, Especially with a moderate or high load, unless you can promise me you can do these first 6 steps. If you can, You can basically go hog wild with your training, and your chances of injury are are very low. Again, both acute injury As well as long term injury, which is just sort of like my joints ache and all of a sudden my shoulder hurts and, you know, things like that. That's really what I'm looking for.[1:16:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: And once you're clear there, you can train pretty hard.[1:16:29] Andrew Huberman: I really like this because recently I was showing somebody how to use a in this case, it was a hack Squat Machine. Yeah. I noticed that they were, very timid of getting, into a deep squat position. And they cited a previous knee injury, which has long since healed.[1:16:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[1:16:47] Andrew Huberman: But even with proper foot placement and everything, you just tell they they were getting, ginger about it as they they approach that bottom position. But over time, with pauses at the bottom, They've become very comfortable and now actually are going, you know, well below 90 degrees, angle between, you know, femur and and lower leg. So it It was clear that it wasn't, something range of motion limited or it was just it was a mental thing, but a logical one for them. Now after what you just said, I think a better strategy, that I could have used would have been to have them get into that position, just No weight at all. Maybe nothing on the sled.[1:17:28] Andrew Huberman: And then slowly working up from there as opposed to, doing what, we did in our case, which was to, just convince them that they were much stronger than they they thought they were. It we eventually got there, but I'm realizing that There was far too much, mental anguish involved in that process.[1:17:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. This whole progression, by the way, this can all happen in 1 session. If you could check the boxes like in that example, you may have been fine to jump there. It may have just been a, hey, you're fine here. Get get through it.[1:17:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, okay. This whole progression might take 2 years. I mean, this really depends on your background, if you actually have injury history, your comfort, your confidence, like all these things. So you don't need to worry about rushing through Through that progression, you don't even need to get all the way to the end if you don't want, especially with, you know, speed and things like that. But again, it can happen.[1:18:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: It doesn't have to be like, well, it's a month of this, like, well, no. If they feel great and you can go through 1 to 7 in 5 minutes, then you're good to go.[1:18:20] Andrew Huberman: Number 6.[1:18:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Number 6 now is just order. So you know how many days per week you're gonna work out. You know how long they're going to take. You've selected all the exercises you need to get done. You've balanced that across the week.[1:18:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you just need to put them in order. And the easy answer here is generally, do what's most important 1st in the workout. There is some minor interference effect to some other things there. But re the reality of it is, If you do the priority first, you're probably going to be okay. So whether this priority is a muscle group.[1:18:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in the example, you wanna make sure your glutes get trained. Maybe do it first. If you're trying to maximize your back squat, You may not wanna do a bunch of glute exercises to fatigue first, but that's not the priority we picked. We picked a different one, which is Buckets a, b, and c. Okay.[1:19:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. By doing it first, you told me the priority was to make sure I do something for my glutes. And then I would also like to get my back squat a little bit stronger Or whatever. Okay. Fine.[1:19:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: The same thing could be done for your endurance training. You could do your endurance training before you're lifting. If you understand, that means you might be compromising your lifting quality of the workout a little bit. But you might be fine with that if you say the endurance work is more important right now. Amazing.[1:19:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't know the answer to that though if you hadn't gone through steps 1 through 4. And that's why those things are critical. So it makes what we call chaos management, which is things happen in the moment. I don't know what to do. What should I choose?[1:19:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: That decision becomes really clear because you can always go back to beginning and go, my priority was this. Then, therefore, that's my choice today. So it provides a very simple set of instructions for when the workout gets cut short, when your workout has in a hotel and any number of things that pop up in real life, whether again, you're an athlete or non athlete, either way, life will get in the way at some point. So you need to have rules and a system that says when this happens, I go right back to this, and that's my choice. Done.[1:20:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm moving on. No decision to make here. It's already been determined a week ago, 5 weeks ago. We're off and rolling. So the order again is pretty simple.[1:20:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just put the one that is most important first. Now I know you like to do legs on Monday. That's great. I actually love that too. I I do the same thing generally, because to me, that's almost always the most important thing.[1:20:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: If I miss a bicep workout, I'm probably fine. But I really don't like missing the big movement pattern. So I make sure that those happen on a day that Tend to be more stable for me. Mondays are generally pretty stable. Things get chaotic as the week moves along for me.[1:21:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Others might be the opposite. Right? Others might wanna go, hey, I'm actually gonna keep Monday as my flexible day or off day because I like to get a lot of my work done, get that cleared so I can have oh, sure. Like, working around you, some people love to train on Saturdays because it's their most free, some people hate it. Sure.[1:21:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: You tell me what is the biggest priority, and when are you the most fresh? Monday, Tuesday, it doesn't matter. Depends on your work schedule. Maybe you work the weekends. I don't know.[1:21:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? You decide what day of the week Are you generally the most consistent, the most consistent schedule, and the most consistent energy? And do the thing that is most important on that day. It doesn't matter Monday, Tuesday, day 1, day 3. We were sort of talking about this earlier, but you actually don't even have to do a week schedule.[1:21:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Our brains tend like to go year, month, week. But a lot of folks will even just run this thing in terms of like a 7 or 9 day schedule. In fact, We ran a 9 day training schedule for one of my Major League Baseball players, and he's 8 or so years in his Career, and he's hitting all time PRs in velocity. He's very, very good. And it was a 9 day training cycle, and we ran that for the entire, season.[1:22:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it doesn't have to be a 7 day split, but it tends to work for a lot of people because most people have a fairly is on schedule across the 7 days. So pick the thing that is most important, do it first, and do it on the day of the week that is most consistent for you in terms of schedule and energy.[1:22:29] Andrew Huberman: I really like what you're describing. I should just say that one of the reasons I put legs on Monday is because I tend to get enough sleep on the weekends. I generally get enough sleep during the middle of the week, but oftentimes, things will come up. I can be pretty sure, however, that I've quote unquote caught up on my sleep on the weekends. This notion of catching up on sleep is a little dicey scientifically, but tend to be pretty rested by Monday morning.[1:22:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[1:22:51] Andrew Huberman: And Actually, my week begins on Sunday, and Sundays are when I get my long form cardio. There you go. So those 2 are really nonnegotiable. And the reason that long form cardio is on Sunday is that it can take many different forms. It can take a hike with a a weighted vest.[1:23:06] Andrew Huberman: It can take a The form of a jog, it can be done with other people. It can be family time. It can be time with friends and so on. And that's pretty hard to do during the middle of the week We're pretty hard to ensure, at least for me. I also find that by bookending the week with some nonnegotiable days of training on Sunday, Monday, then if The week gets busy Tuesday, Wednesday, or even sometimes Thursday with travel and things like that.[1:23:30] Andrew Huberman: One can sort of catch up toward the weekend. It's not ideal. I mean, ideally, it's spaced out. But, really, this isn't about what I do. This is really just to underscore the principle you described, which is I have a very clear sense now over, you know, 3 decades or so of training in 3 decades or so of, being involved in academics and science and work of when I tend to be most rested.[1:23:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[1:23:52] Andrew Huberman: When I tend to have some flexibility in my schedule and also when I'm trying to combine fitness with some of my, you know, social engagements, which is actually quite fun. I one Thing I noticed that, the 4 boxes that you mentioned before, work relationships, fitness, and recovery, some of them do have some crossover.[1:24:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: They all do.[1:24:09] Andrew Huberman: You know, a Hike with family or friends is both relationship and fitness and so on. But I love the principle, because anything that can add consistency, as you pointed it out, is going to greatly increase the probability of reaching one's goals. That's sort of an obvious one. But Or in an earlier episode, you also said something that I wrote down and is really still ringing in my mind, especially now, which is that consistency always beats intensity.[1:24:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct. Yep. Absolutely. We used to do a thing, when I was training NFL players for the combine many years ago Where Saturdays were supposed to be the day they came in and we did the most regeneration. So this is when they get body worked on, and we do Hot, cold contrast and sort of all these things.[1:24:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: And our attendance was, like, 1%. Nobody showed up. Right?[1:25:01] Andrew Huberman: For a massage?[1:25:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Nobody showed up.[1:25:03] Andrew Huberman: Wow.[1:25:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Seems right. But remember[1:25:05] Andrew Huberman: I love a good massage.[1:25:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Of course. But remember, you're 18 years old. You're likely to be getting 1,000,000 of dollars handed to you in the next few weeks Or months. And[1:25:15] Andrew Huberman: He's not referring to me, by the way. No. No. I'm actually quite a bit older than 18. And I'm not getting handed 1,000,000 of dollars each week.[1:25:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So I would think that. But and those folks, like, they recover super fast. They've never They had that. And also, like, Friday night?[1:25:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Kind of enticing. And so nothing was there. And the strategy then was, what if we instead of Having a important hard training day on Saturday. We transition and it is only things they wanna do. So we basically identified what are the things in training you love the most, and let's do those Saturdays.[1:25:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: And it turns out for those folks, no surprise here, it was what we call the gun show. So they would come into the gym, and we would literally do nothing but biceps and triceps. They'd just get a pump, and then the deal was though, You come in and literally, what come in is we would pick 3 guys. Say, you, you, and you. You pick your favorite bicep exercise.[1:26:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You pick your favorite one. You pick Favorite one. You 3 over there, you pick your favorite tricep tricep tricep, and we just run a big circuit. Like, this is like, how many reps? I don't know.[1:26:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't care how many set I don't even care. Just, like, pump away. Like, I don't even care. Right? We chose small muscle groups.[1:26:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not really gonna interfere with much. We're training them for the NFL combine, which is like it's not a it's legs performance, basically. Right? So it's like, if If they smash their biceps and triceps on a Saturday, it's not gonna influence what we did on on Monday. So recovery wasn't an issue.[1:26:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Once we finish the gun show though, Now you have to go do your regen stuff. So if you need chiro work, you need physical therapy, whatever you're gonna do. So we would get them in the building With the low hanging fruit, and then we would actually get them do their work. You can do the same thing, and I honestly do the same thing. I tend to do either, if I'm gonna do an upper or lower split, I'm gonna do that stuff either Friday night or Saturday.[1:27:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because it's very difficult for me to do a hard, long workout Friday night. Right? Or even Friday morning for that matter. The same thing Saturday. I wake up and it's now it's like, It's family mode.[1:27:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's kid things. I wanna do stuff. I want man. But I can usually convince myself to be like, alright. Just go in there, go 20 minutes, and get your upper body stuff Alright.[1:27:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can I can walk myself into that mentally? It's harder to walk yourself into your 5 sets of 5 deadlift. It's sort of just like, woah, I ain't got that of me right now. My high intensity interval's the max of I don't have that right now. So I'll either go for my long steady state stuff, which is like, I'm gonna I'm going on the bike, I'm riding down to the beach or coming back nasal only.[1:27:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can get myself to go for a bike ride like that. Oh, whatever. So I picked the thing that I I'm likely to do on the days where Where I'm probably gonna be my weakest, quote unquote, not physically, but motivation wise. I for for a long time, I tried to, like, It just got stuck in a way where my hardest stuff was Friday nights. And I'm just like, why why am I doing this?[1:28:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: I was having, like, a 50% success rate. Just like we were having, like, a no% success Best rate with the NFL guys on Saturday. So you have to be a little bit tough. You have to grind sometimes. You have to, you And over and over when I could move it and go, look, those sessions are going to be things that are easier.[1:28:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: They don't require as much gusto to get up and get them done. I get those things done 90% of the time. Because the worst case, I can be like, alright. We're gonna go do a family thing. Give me 20 minutes.[1:28:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm just gonna run it there and smash the upper body. And you don't need And I need a 20 minute warm up. It's like I can just kinda jump into those things if I had to. If I feel great, then I can still go do something else or I could do more, I can do a longer session. But But you you're you're sort of immune to any situation.[1:28:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, I would book in those is, I guess, is what I'm saying. What's the day you're gonna have the best today and what's the day you generally have the worst? And and put the programs around those situations.[1:29:10] Andrew Huberman: I love the idea of identifying the friction points, the high friction and low friction days. Friction meaning anything that impedes you from training consistently or well. And there are so many factors that ratchet into that sleep, Other social engagements work. You know, Friday night, I also find it tough, to do any kind of training. I do, cardiovascular training.[1:29:31] Andrew Huberman: I do interval type training, on Fridays typically. But there's a lot of, cumulative fatigue and stress that happens across the week. And usually, for a long time, like, gosh, more than a decade now, I've been telling myself that Saturday is the day that I tried to, Reduce my cortisol as much as possible for the week.[1:29:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: There you go.[1:29:50] Andrew Huberman: And then Sunday is the day that I enjoy that low cortisol state, and that That's actually what opened up into the long, slow run. I like she like to think of myself as a bit of a mule during those long runs. I actually have a shirt that has a sloth on it that I wear to remind myself to go slowly on those runs. Not that I ever run that fast, but This is the whole mindset around it is to be a bit of a of a mule just kind of moving through it. And the fatigue factor is more one of, You know, at first, there's just a little bit of boredom, but then I've noticed there's a whole different set of mental scapes that open up under different training types.[1:30:27] Andrew Huberman: And this is maybe something we get into a Little bit in a future episode or discussion. You know, when you train really intensely for short periods of time one way, your mind goes into a particular state. When you do long duration training, you're thinking and and indeed even the way it affects sleep patterns is also very different. I think One of the great futures for neuroscience and exercise science in collaboration is to identify how different patterns of physical movement relate to different patterns of thinking and vice versa. Anyway, something maybe to just, earmark for a future conversation, but there's clearly a relationship there.[1:30:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. Well, when we certainly know of a pretty clear relationship between, even what we would classify as zone 5 exercise and deep sleep.[1:31:09] Andrew Huberman: So zone 5 again being, you're breathing a lot through your mouth because you have to in order to bring up in enough oxygen to offset the acidity created by the The carbon. Exactly.[1:31:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. This is the high heart rate. So so, I mean, if you're gonna look at it and and hit a number, looking for something like 30 plus minutes a week Being in, the top 10% of your heart rate[1:31:32] Andrew Huberman: That impacts deep sleep?[1:31:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is gonna positively impact deep sleep. As long as it's done very far away from deep sleep. So So you don't wanna do that at night. So you want in in in terms of time. So if you hit those numbers earlier in the day, oftentimes that will enhance deep sleep.[1:31:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. I was looking at some papers recently, and the number that that, kind of emerged from those papers was that unless it's low intensity exercise, trying to exercise About 6 hours or more away from your sleep time would be ideal. Now Thank you. That said, for those of you that have They hit the gym or go for a run-in the evening and then are trying to fall asleep 4 to 6 hours later.[1:32:10] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't want that statement to impede your, regular, your regular exercising.[1:32:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. There's there's an easy trick to that. Just finish it with down regulation breathing. So it it that's sort of one of our things that if you because that is a realistic situation. Right?[1:32:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right finish work at 5 or even 6, and then by the time you're a situation. Right?[1:32:24] Andrew Huberman: Right. Finish work at 5 or even 6, and then by the time you're you're training or running or whatever you wanna call it Yep. It's a 7:38. You're home at 9. You're You're eating, and then everyone's like, you can't eat 2 hours before bed.[1:32:35] Andrew Huberman: Pretty soon, you run into a number of different collision points[1:32:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: That make you wonder whether or not you're doing everything wrong or if it's really worth training at all. 100%. I would argue it's better to train than not to train Yep. Provided that you can still get to sleep.[1:32:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: 100%. So you have to walk a little bit of a game. We run this issue with the NBA players. Right. You're playing games at 6 o'clock at night to start.[1:32:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Major League Baseball's a 705, 710 pitch. Right? Right. And also, by the way, we're changing time zones every 5 days. Right.[1:33:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: UFC fighters and, such were usually training twice a day. There is no option to train. Well, I mean, we are training twice a day, always. So We have to come up with strategies for that. And there's other, like, non athlete scenarios, of course, where it's like there is no other option here.[1:33:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Cool. So what we do is a couple of things. Number 1, that Further away you can make it from sleep, the better if possible. We do need to train though around the same time you're going to be playing. That has to happen.[1:33:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the harder and longer we go in the training session, the harder and longer we go in our down regulation post exercise. And that is, in my estimation, the number one lever you can pull that can help. Right? Now if it really does start crushing sleep, You're gonna have to make a critical decision there. In general, it's not a good reason to not exercise.[1:33:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: But maybe you restricted to to only a couple of days a week, you go all the way up in intensity. And the rest of the days, maybe 70%. He stands as kind of a working zone. Awesome. Maybe it's a longer down regulation.[1:34:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe there's other strategies you can do. But yeah. You wanna be careful of, and we've had this situation a number of times where it's sort of just like sleep complaints, sleep complaints, sleep complaints. We run full sleep studies on them in their house. We do the whole thing with absolute rest.[1:34:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: We come in. We do the whole thing. Eye tracking, biomarkers, the whole thing. And it's like, oh, you just need to stop doing intervals at 8 PM.[1:34:32] Andrew Huberman: Right. And I would add to that, another incentive for being able to train with or without Caffeine is that it's very clear that even if you can fall asleep after ingesting caffeine within the preceding hours, that caffeine consumed in the, Gosh, even, you know, 12, but really, you know, 8 to 10 hours, 4 hours prior to bedtime really disrupts the architecture of sleep. So if you critically rely on caffeine in order to train, Whatever your training might be, and you know that sleep is important for recovery, well, then it's pretty obvious where I'm going with this. Yeah. So having that flexibility It's vitally important.[1:35:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. You've probably also covered this, but, you can actually measure that directly. So by eye tracking Patterns? You can actually identify the effects that caffeine has on sleep independent of a sleep time or not.[1:35:19] Andrew Huberman: Right. There are never positive effects.[1:35:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[1:35:22] Andrew Huberman: That said, I am a proponent of caffeine early in the day, and caffeine does have a a lot of, well, it's anti neurodegenerative, and as long as you're not getting anxiety, it it's pro performance, both mental and physical performance. Of course, if you do not need caffeine, if you're one of these mutants that do not need caffeine in order to go about your daily living, with focus and intensity, then by all means, don't start taking caffeine.[1:35:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm not the hugest fan. I am scientifically 100% on board. Personally, it does I don't do well on it.[1:35:53] Andrew Huberman: Well, you seem to ride a little bit more what we would call, you know, sympathetic tone, you know, kind of shifted towards more alert. I tend to be, naturally a bit more like my bulldog, Costello, was a little bit more on the mellow sleepy side. And caffeine just puts me right at that alert but calm, Place, and I I can get away with drinking it at at I wouldn't say ridiculous, but a fair amount of caffeine and remain there. But I do restrict it Until the time right up about 2 PM at the latest is really when I try and drink caffeine. Number 7.[1:36:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. So number 7 and 8 are pretty simple. This is now Choose the intensity and the volume. So we've discussed those at length in the previous episodes. We probably don't have the time to go back over all those details.[1:36:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: So remember the adaptation you're training for, and pick the appropriate rep range, total amount of sets, As well as the intensity to then get the corresponding adaptation. Right? All you have to do is select those things. In terms of progression through a week, the rule of thumb we say for intensity is something around 3% per week. Alright?[1:37:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: For volume, It will depend on what you're doing a little bit, but anytime you cross more than 10% per week, you're going to start running into problems. So I like 5% better. It doesn't need to be as low as 3. You can jump up much more than that. 5 to 7% is better.[1:37:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: So If you are doing, say running because because the numbers make it easy, and you're doing 10 miles per week total. If you were to go up to 11 miles the next week, you great. You're right around 10%. But what you wouldn't wanna do You say I'm running 10 miles this week, and I did maybe 4 Monday, 3, Wednesday, 3, Friday. So 4, 3, and 3, you got your 10.[1:37:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then you wouldn't wanna add a mile every day. So Monday, instead of doing 4, I did 5. Wednesday, instead of doing 3, I did 4. Friday, I started doing 380 for you. What you actually did is you went from 10 to 13, which is a much higher percent jump than the 10% prescribed.[1:37:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So The same thing would be true for lifting weights. The same thing is actually true for calories and trying to add them, etcetera. So, the body tends to not handle those things as well, Jumping more than 10% per week.[1:38:12] Andrew Huberman: So keeping with this idea of increasing progressive overload, being 10% more over some period of time, Am I correct in assuming that I want to identify 1, maybe 2 meaningful variables and progressing that For those variables[1:38:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: So progressive overload can come in the form of any of the modifiable variables. So you could increase the complexity of the movement. You could increase the intensity or the load. You can increase the volume by either more sets, more reps, Or more total exercises in a day.[1:38:46] Andrew Huberman: What about time under tension?[1:38:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could also manipulate how the the tempo of each repetition. You could also manipulate how many times per day you train. So you can manipulate frequency. You can also manipulate rest intervals. So you can progressively load any of these things.[1:39:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Increased intensity, run a little bit faster, complete the same amount of work Slightly faster. Put 5% more on the barbell or the load or the handle or whatever you're gonna do. That's a simple way. If you wanna think about volume, in the case of endurance work is simple, mileage, time, whatever. In the case of lifting, all you have to do is take The amount of repetitions you're doing per set, multiply it by the sets, add that all up.[1:39:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're doing 3 sets of 10, That's 30 repetitions. If you did 3 exercises, you just did 90 repetitions. Put that number down for Monday. Put that number down for Wednesday. Put that number down for Friday.[1:39:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Add that total up. So So say you did 90, 90, 90. You would look and say, my total number of repetitions this week is 270. If I wanna go up 5%, Then I need to go up another 15 or so total repetitions. Great.[1:39:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's all we have to do. That's the increase. You may keep the load exactly the same, Keep the exercises the same chain. Nothing else, but you wanna add 15 more total reps for your week. And you may choose to do that by adding 1 more repetition per set.[1:40:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Close enough. So last week, I did 3 sets of 10. This week, I'm going to 3 sets of 11. It can be as simple as that. Again, it can be complex.[1:40:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: I walked you through. It can be any of the modifiable variables, but the progression I just laid out is fairly simple. And it's honestly the one I recommend for most people just Because it will avoid confusion, and it will avoid people taking massive leaps and volume. So the typical strategy I would recommend here Is increasing load or intensity or a little bit of a combination slowly for about 6 Or so weeks, and then taking what we generally call a deload. So back down to maybe 70%, whatever that number is you've been doing.[1:40:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you did 3 sets of 10, and you worked yourself all the way up to 3 sets of 15. Back that down and maybe we'll do 2 sets of 8 for the week. And then we'll come back the following week and go back and do the highest we've done now. All of a sudden, we're gonna do 4 sets of 12 or or something like that. So If you get these little deloads every depending on what you're doing 4 to 8 weeks or so, you should be in a spot where you can continually progress for a very long time Without either burning out or overloading and and over stressing an injury pattern.[1:41:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the simple way, pick intensity or volume And just go up slightly every week for a short span of time, generally around 6 weeks, and then you come back and and change your strategy if you like.[1:41:40] Andrew Huberman: Because you mentioned sets and repetitions here, just wanted to remind folks that in the episode that we did on strength and hypertrophy, and that also included speed. There was a description of a terrific program for strength, which is the 3 by 5 program or 325 program as it's called, which is to select 3 to 5 exercises performed for 3 to 5 repetitions, 3 to 5 times per week with 3 to 5 minutes rest in between those exercises.[1:42:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: For 3 to 5 sets.[1:42:10] Andrew Huberman: And if I recall correctly, the protocol for Generating hypertrophy muscle growth is to perform a minimum of 10 and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per muscle group per week, and that can be done in a single session per muscle per week. So one could train, for instance, quadriceps One day per week as long as you're getting that volume of sets per week, or it could be divided up across 2 or 3 different sessions for that individual muscle group. Of course, people are going to target all their major muscle groups and hopefully some of them minor muscle groups as well. And And as I recall, the number of repetitions that can generate hypertrophy is quite broad, anywhere from 6 repetitions all the way up to 30 repetitions. But by the end of the set, It should be to failure or close to failure with good form.[1:42:58] Andrew Huberman: Is that correct?[1:42:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. And we would say close to failure, is probably most appropriate. You can actually reach failure maybe on a few of the sets, maybe the end, and probably best to choose That with the exercises that are, safer, not that any exercise is particularly unsafe if you do it appropriately, But you may not want to go to true failure on every set for the more complex, larger, riskier exercises. So, hedge pretty close to failure but not all the way.[1:43:35] Andrew Huberman: And I realized I Forgot to mention rest intervals between sets. It follows that if a large range of repetitions are performed, that a large range of, rest intervals are allowed, meaning they there could be rest intervals between sets of as low as 30 seconds between sets or as high of 2 or 3 minutes depending on the loads that one is using, and that, of course, will scale with the number of repetitions.[1:43:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Excellent. In fact, that sort of leads me into, step number 9 of designing your own training program, which is you've decided our goal, We've worked our calendar out. We figured out how many days per week and how long we're gonna work out in those sessions. We then went and selected our exercises. We Balance them across the movement patterns and the muscle groups that we need so we're not causing excessive stress on the same exact joint or muscle group over time.[1:44:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: We then ordered our exercises based on priority. Alright. Because of that, we have identified our goal. We went back and we selected the volume, Which is the repetitions per set, the total amount of sets, and the load per set that matched the goal that we wanted to get for the adaptation. Now all we have to do is fill in the rest intervals, which reflect back again the goal.[1:44:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: So generally, higher rest intervals, Which means time that you rest between your sets, higher, somewhere to between 2 to 5 minutes For things like speed, power, and strength, perhaps a little bit lower. Although, as you mentioned, it could also stay high for hypertrophy. And then for endurance, you follow the rest interval that reflects the type of endurance training that you'd like to get. That's walked us through 1 through 9, we're almost done. We've put together a pretty nice little protocol.[1:45:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: It should be well rounded. It should be effective. We've also talked about how to progress it from week to week, Keeping it within, again, 4 to 6 weeks, maybe up to 8, before we then take a back off. The very last thing we have to do to make sure this training program is customized to you, your goal, and your situation, which is then going to enhance your likelihood of adherence and consistency, As well as increase the likelihood of effectiveness is we just have to do a little bit of what we call chaos management, which is take a quick moment to think through, This program looks great. But if I had to nitpick it, where are the possible chances of failure?[1:45:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: And you just wanna sort of think about where are where would I predict things would go wrong? And if you anything pops out to you, Try to come up with your solution at the beginning. And this could be a number of things. So maybe you've picked an exercise and you realize, man, I really actually don't like that exercise. Or maybe look at the schedule now that it's laid out in front of you.[1:46:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: You look at your work schedule, and you're like, maybe that's a bit I don't know. It could be any of number of things, but it is a useful exercise to just think through everything realistically. I typically just like it's the adage I teach my graduate students. Before we hit submit, we're gonna sleep. So it's there.[1:46:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's ready. We're gonna take 12 hours. We're gonna wake up the next day and look at it again and go, Are we sure we're good here? Yep. Make adjustments if you need.[1:46:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: If not, if you feel confident, then hit send and cross your fingers.[1:46:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We're referring to submitting the manuscript. It's interesting you say that I have a statement that I always make to people in my lab. They hit submit, and And I always say that you realize you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning. There's going to be an email in your inbox that something was formatted incorrectly, and you're going to spend tomorrow reformatting and submitting again.[1:47:10] Andrew Huberman: So I have also learned that there that every project is actually 2 projects.[1:47:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Trying to not die over here to interrupt[1:47:16] Andrew Huberman: you. Yes.[1:47:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's true. Is it?[1:47:17] Andrew Huberman: I've done this enough times. You know, I've done this, you know, many dozens of times. And then there's also another, truism of of science, which is that, you know, There's the project. There's the scientific question, and then the paper is yet another project. And I actually think this is an analogy that carries over to other other domains of life.[1:47:34] Andrew Huberman: I think that Anytime we take on something, if we want to write a book or we want to get a degree or we wanna, run a fitness program, I think it's worth thinking about those decisions as actually 2 taking on 2 major things, because 1 is the planning and organization around that thing, and the other is the actual performance of the thing. And so I say that because Here, what you just described this, you know, 10 steps to to consider in designing a program. I think some people who are real listmakers and love, the precision and the thoroughness at at and I'm one of these people thinking this is great. I just wanna do Check off each one of these things on the list and figure out the ideal program for me for a given period of time, etcetera. And then other folks might be thinking, Well, that's a lot.[1:48:17] Andrew Huberman: That's just a lot to do. But what I know with certainty is that performing those sorts of, Let's just call them what they are, those tasks of of figuring out what's what, where the defenders are, etcetera, without question, makes everything go so much more smoothly Once you are into the actual, performance, the action of doing Yeah. The exercise program or the book or the podcast or whatever it is that you happen to do. So I'm I'm grateful that you, brought up, both the things that act as conduits for Getting good work done and this notion of defenders and, and bottlenecks. Because if we don't consider those, I would Argue that's a very low probability that anyone will succeed.[1:49:00] Andrew Huberman: But when one does consider those, even just a few of them, I think the probability of success goes way, way up immediately.[1:49:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's actually a very good point. That is a lot of work for a lot of people. And I know when I'm consuming information, It is helpful to hear structure and systems and design. It's also helpful to hear actual real life examples. So maybe The next, thing we can do here is I can just walk you through an entire setup in a in a program, considering folks that are in Bucket a, b, and c.[1:49:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: And maybe I'll I'll save a little bit of the explanation, and we'll eliminate maybe some background. I'll just walk you through what This could look like. Alright. So I created a program which should run about a year, and the idea here is That this could be an evergreen system. So one could check off all the boxes that we've talked about.[1:49:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in general, we wanna have 3 primary goals with exercise. We wanna look a certain way, whatever that means to you. We wanna be able to perform a certain way, Whether that's for life goals like hiking and energy or sport goals or whatever. And then we wanna be able to do that across our lifespan. Okay.[1:50:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: So a program that gives you all the goals we talked about and a program that covers That health combine that we referred to way back in some of our earlier discussions, which as a little bit of a recap is, What are the physical fitness parameters that we know are critical to maintaining both lifespan and wellness span? And as a bit of a reminder, those are things like your grip strength, your leg strength, your total amount of muscle mass, Your actual speed and power so that you can catch yourself from a fall, your v o two max, and your physical fitness. So I want a program that does a little bit of all that. It's similar, actually, and we're kinda crossing barriers between our 3 buckets. So I need to be able to control my fat.[1:51:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: I need to be able to have enough muscle. That muscle needs to have enough function, and I need to be able to maintain range of motion so So that I don't lose flexibility and get hurt, and then I need to have a good VO two max as well as to be able to sustain energy over time. So that was the goal of my progress. Now a couple of other things that we haven't chatted about, which are very important. You have mentioned, I think, Think on a previous podcast about the importance of seeing light?[1:51:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is this something you've covered at one point earlier?[1:51:31] Andrew Huberman: I joke that I'll be, going into the grave, and they'll be shoveling dirt onto me. And I'll be telling people what I'll tell you again now, which is to get 5 to 30 minutes of sunlight viewing As early in the day as possible, ideally from sunlight. That's why it's called sunlight. Or from bright lights of another kind if you cannot get sunlight. And also get that in the evening and then avoid bright lights between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM unless you do shift work, in which case, check out our episode on shift work.[1:51:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Amazing. So So we've got a little bit of a juxtaposition where people are like, I need to work out and do all this training, but then I'm also supposed to be outside. Okay. How do I blend those 2 things in my training program? Cool.[1:52:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I checked that box as well. I built that in. The last thing here is we've talked about structured size. And just in this episode, we've really opened up and do nonstructured exercise, hiking, sports, things like that. Well, one thing that is incredibly clear, and, my colleague and And Tommy Wood at the University of Washington published a fantastic paper very recently on the importance of proprioception In maintaining and staving off late onset dementia and Parkinson's.[1:52:40] Andrew Huberman: Maybe just remind people appropriate receptionist.[1:52:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Absolutely. So there's structured exercise, and that's very important. But then there's also things like balance And coordination, and proprioception meaning you're adjusting the stimuli coming in from the outside world. So the stimuli could be sound, Could be light, could be smell, or in the physical case, the body, it is where you are at in space.[1:53:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I'm feeling like I'm falling to the left, therefore, I need to correct and move back to the So you don't get this with doing things like a hack squat on a machine. You get this typically from being outside. So now you're smelling and seeing things, and you're also not landing with your foot in the exact same position on an even platform. We get this from things like sport. Now I'm not only exercising, but I'm reacting to the outside world.[1:53:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: The ball's going over here. My opponent's going over there. So it's very important in my opinion To have at least 1 session per week of exercise in which you are doing something that challenges proprioception. Right. So how do I fold all of these best practices into 1 training program that's not 200 hours a week, 7 days a week?[1:53:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's what I've laid out to you. Makes sense?[1:53:51] Andrew Huberman: Makes sense.[1:53:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Cool. Let me walk you through it, and then, maybe we'll come back into each individual category, and you can ask questions about them. So the The way that I think is best is to have a goal and have that goal be around 8 to 10 weeks long like we've been talking about. So what I gave you is let's start off with quarter number 1 of the year. So perhaps January through March or so, and it doesn't have to be this one, but just as an example.[1:54:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: You decide your goal is gonna be to put some muscle mass on. We're gonna prioritize adding muscle. K? Now within that, you're gonna be bulking up adding some muscle, but we're also going to be sleeping more. We know we need extra recovery in this session, and we need to go up in calories.[1:54:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now this happens to work nice for a couple of reasons. But in that protocol, Maybe we're gonna do 7 days or 7 sessions a week of physical activity. Doesn't mean 7 days. But maybe those sessions are something like, I will do 1 indoor sport. This could be basketball.[1:54:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Could be any number of things. Right? So I got my sport ticked off in Indoors. Why? I'm I'm January to March.[1:55:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: The weather's probably not great for most of the world, so I'm not gonna do as much outside activity. I'm gonna do weights maybe 3 or 4 times a week, and then maybe 2 days a week, I'll go for a long walk. Okay? Again, we'll come back and I'll explain to you why I made all these individual Those places are up. So you're gonna run that for the Q1.[1:55:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: At the end of this quarter, you're gonna take a deload week. Now this could be fully off. Maybe this is when you schedule a vacation. Maybe this is backing off. Maybe you just keep your walks in and you spend the extra time on your family, or work, or Whatever else we need to do.[1:55:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we've bulked up a little bit. We spent 12 weeks adding some mass. Now we're gonna transition into quarter 2, Which is where we start to actually get lean. This is actually a pretty standard, bodybuilding template, which is you put on some mass first, and then you get lean after that. So now we're gonna get lean from April to June.[1:55:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna bring calories down a little bit. So now we're actually gonna play in a hypocaloric state somewhat. The days tend to get longer, so we're gonna have more time to spend in the sun. So we're gonna shift a little bit from an indoor sport Activity like the example I said earlier was basketball to maybe stand up paddle boarding or some other thing where you're actually getting your sport done. You're reacting.[1:56:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're using proprioception, but now you're getting that sun in there as well because you have a greater opportunity to actually do so, and the weather probably is Is gonna cooperate with you more often than it would in, say, February. You then maybe gonna pick a fitness or an exercise class. You know, any number of of routines where you're with multiple people. And then 2 days a week in addition to that, You're gonna maybe lift some weights. Alright?[1:56:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: So now, we've added some muscle. Now, we've got lean. And all of a sudden, we're actually looking pretty good for the summertime. Interesting. Right?[1:56:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Quarter 3, July to September, we'll transition And we'll try it to get into great cardiovascular shape. So we'll transition more into some high intensity interval type of stuff more frequently. We're gonna maybe stay at maintenance calories now. We spent a little bit of time hyper, then we went hypo, and now we're gonna go back to maintenance and and keep along. We're We're gonna continue to choose some outdoor sports, but maybe you change it up.[1:57:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe you keep the same one. Maybe maybe now we switch it out in the golf or now we pick Pickleball or we play basketball, but now we just do it outside. Any number of things you can do. Right? So maybe even we do a couple.[1:57:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Change it up. You do that twice a week. You're spending more time in the sun now. You're looking outside and you're seeing this great weather, and you're not cooped up in a gym, but you're getting your physical fitness in. That's also going to be aiding in your high intensity or your interval, your conditioning, because you're doing more stuff like that rather than lifting in a gym.[1:57:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: And And then maybe you're actually gonna do some track workouts. Maybe we'll do this on a bike or we'll do some hillsprints outside, any number of things. And then we'll do that maybe twice a week, and then we'll still lift, weights twice a week in our gym. The last quarter then is gonna be October to December, And we're gonna transition there and do more pure cardiovascular fitness. Okay?[1:58:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because we're doing that, we're gonna be working harder. And remember, Cardiovascular training is generally expelling much more calories than lifting. So we're gonna actually go up in calories. We're We're gonna return to that. And that works out kinda well because I don't know if you know or not, but people tend to eat a little more calories from the months of, day, November through December.[1:58:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Holidays and, at least in Northern Hemisphere, colder temperatures. So[1:58:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe even we play with 2 workouts a day here. We're trying to get really in shape. We're trying to improve improve our conditioning and our endurance in multiple areas. We're gonna actually transition back into an indoor sport. So maybe we're gonna do some kickboxing or a jujitsu class or something like that.[1:58:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're We're gonna maybe hit the cardio machine once or twice. Now we're hopping on a Stairmaster, a VersaClimber, more maybe getting an assault bike going, something like that. Maybe hit some machines And do our lifting there. Maybe we had spent the rest of the earlier part of the year on barbells and dumbbells. We'll transition to some machines, and then we'll still try to get outside and walk twice a week.[1:59:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. And we that gets us our outside activity, but it's not necessarily a structured program. So you could hey. We got a 15 minutes where the weather's breaking a little bit, so let's walk, get outside, and get a walk in. Alright?[1:59:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's the overall structure of everything. I would like to actually go back to the beginning now and kinda walk through each one of these things in detail and explain why I chose certain things. I I've kinda given some hints already, but I think it'd be helpful to to walk back to the beginning and start there.[1:59:42] Andrew Huberman: Great. I love the overall structure. I have just a couple of questions. The idea of training mostly for hypertrophy, January through March[1:59:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[1:59:53] Andrew Huberman: Makes sense, followed by Period from April through June, focusing primarily on fat loss.[2:00:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:00:01] Andrew Huberman: And then from July to September, speed and interval type work.[2:00:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:00:06] Andrew Huberman: And then October to December, you put to emphasize endurance type training. I thought for a moment that when we got to October, December, you were going to emphasize strength. And I'm wondering whether or not There's any incentive for training for strength October, December so that when one arrives at the hypertrophy training January through March, we're that much stronger. The idea being then there's more muscle to hold on to as one then tries to lose fat from April through June, and then July through September Is the speed work, or is July through September the speed slash power phase of the program?[2:00:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: The July through September would be more Like your higher heart rate, learning to get all the way up, maximum exertion, and then recovering.[2:00:56] Andrew Huberman: And October to December is long form endurance.[2:00:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Moderate to long form. Right? So it's closer to that aerobic capacity stuff. It is closer to longer duration and moving through that spectrum. You are astute in And pointing out that I didn't have Pure Strength really in there.[2:01:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: You certainly could fold it in, but quite quite Literally, if you spent, 3 months bulking up in January to March, that's gonna bring some strength along the way. So you should be fine there. But you absolutely could alter Any of these variables, if you wanted to emphasize something more than that one. So say you actually felt like you ran the fitness testing, and you identified, actually, your endurance is pretty good, But you're struggling maybe with a little bit of strength and maybe a little bit of lower muscle mass. You could substitute Q3 or Q4 And say one of those quarters will be strength, and then I'll do all of my conditioning in another quarter.[2:01:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: And what you've really done is the programming is still fairly simple. You've just altered the priorities a little bit, and therefore, you've altered the adaptation across the year. And why this is really important, this template is meant to be something you can just run back Year after year after year, and you make a subtle change like that. And now over the course of 5, 10, 20 years, You're going to be in a fantastic spot at the end. So you can make easy adjustments along the way as priorities pop up, as goals pop up, but But you're going to be in a position where everything is there's nothing that's gonna be lagging behind.[2:02:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: You'll be in a good spot. Most of your bases are covered to be pretty lean, Have a good amount of muscle and to be in great shape.[2:02:33] Andrew Huberman: Two other questions. 1, just a quick question For sake of, generating proprioceptive feedback, during the endurance phase, is trail running a good Good option.[2:02:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely.[2:02:46] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thinking back to the days running cross country. It's October, December, your trail running[2:02:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally.[2:02:51] Andrew Huberman: Training for endurance. Okay.[2:02:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: The ground is not super Solid, which is even better in this case. Right? So you're making more choices and trying to not fall on your face.[2:02:59] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. And then you mentioned bulking up, and I just, I wanted to highlight that, there are some folks, myself included, while I'd like to add a little bit of muscle here or there, I'm not interested in overeating to the point where I lay down a lot of body fat stores along with that. I think Sure. A lot of people out there are not necessarily interested in, quote unquote, bulking up. I also my understanding of the the literature, and tell me if I'm wrong, is that, well, There does need to be some sort of caloric surplus[2:03:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:03:32] Andrew Huberman: Above what is required to maintain body weight in order to Build muscle that many people who try and quote unquote bulk up basically just end up expanding the size of their their cheeks and face, along with their limbs and torso. Yeah.[2:03:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: You[2:03:48] Andrew Huberman: know, I'm not trying to poke fun at them, but the idea of of deliberately overeating To the point where a lot of body fat stores come along, I would imagine that would just make the April through June phase that much harder. Correct. And I'm not sure it's Ever been studied directly, but I can't imagine it's all that, excuse me, all that healthy to bring along a lot of adipose tissue, in one's pursuit of of hypertrophy.[2:04:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: You you're absolutely correct. We have not gotten into the nutritional details there. But yeah. Thank you. Good clarification point.[2:04:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: A couple of things. You're not going to be doing this very long. It's 12 weeks. Right. We're not going to be 6[2:04:24] Andrew Huberman: other agencies. Me eat.[2:04:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Number 2, just since we're here, to clarify, The literature is ongoing in this area, and there's actually a handful of studies that I I know are coming soon. But in general, when I say hypercaloric here, I'm referring to an increasing caloric intake above baseline by something like 10 to 15%. So if you normally eat 25 100 calories throughout the day, you might add another 250 to 400. I'm not doubling calories. I don't want you to be stuffing your face, hating food, feeling awful all day, and then putting on half of your weight is fat and half of your weight is is muscle.[2:05:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is just technically hypercholic because you're eating more, Which is an absolute requirement for most people to add muscle. Right? Some folks who have a high percentage of body fat And a low level of fitness training can actually get away with just being either isochloric technically or Or even a little bit lower and still adding some muscle while losing some fat. But for most folks, that's going to be challenging. So you're gonna wanna be in a hypercaloric state.[2:05:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Another reason I put it in here is because remember, people tend to make these extra calorie choices during this part of the year anyways. And so you're sort of playing in the life is why I chose that. Right? It's like, hey. You can't restrict calories all the time.[2:05:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's really, really hard. So maybe if we can put it calorie restriction during the phases of the year, that's a little bit easier. And give you The freedom to have a little bit more calories during the phase of the year when you're probably gonna wanna do that anyways, just make sure you're doing a style of training That supports that. So you're gonna be trying to add muscle when you know you're going to be adding more calories. We're gonna be trying to really push the pace on our conditioning When we know we're going to be eating more calories anyways.[2:06:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so that is actually, in fact, exactly why I chose those goals For those times of the year is because we're we're now playing into life a little bit more. But we, again, certainly do not wanna be eating, to an excess where where it's, causing some of the problems you mentioned. We just need to be eating a little bit more. The last point here is the next phase, April to June, we know we're going hypocaloric. So it's always kinda nice to go, yep.[2:06:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna go on a little bit of a calorie deficit here, but it's really just these few months. And it's okay because I've spent the last 6 months where I wasn't restricting that much, and then one actually where I got to eat a little bit more. And now cool. Not hard for me to convince somebody that to go, we're gonna bring the calories down right now, or in a month, in 2 months, and and it's just gonna be this 12 or 16 or whatever you end up being in there. So those were some of the rationale, that I was thinking of when I decided to do that.[2:07:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: But thank you. That's a very important point in terms of the hypochloric. It's It it's not the dirty bulk. It's it's not the excess that that a lot of folks will do.[2:07:19] Andrew Huberman: And and, just a final point for folks, in the southern hemisphere. Australians and South Americans, we actually have a a a large listenership in the southern hemisphere. Of course, adjust accordingly. Even though the holiday months are still in, you know, November, December, they're, of course, holidays all year long. But many of many of the major holidays Our around November, December, but it's summer down there.[2:07:45] Andrew Huberman: Just adjust accordingly. There's nothing wholly about trying to achieve certain adaptations at certain times of year. It's more about trying to eliminate bottlenecks, defenders, as you mentioned, and it's really about the sequence.[2:07:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if we go back to that Q1, we're gonna try to add some mass for the reasons I just described. Right? It also tends to be pretty motivating. You're gonna start the year off. You're gonna wanna train and get all excited because of your New Year's resolution, and you're gonna see results immediately.[2:08:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: We've talked about this in some of the previous episodes. The nice part about hypertrophy training is you see your muscles growing right now, where The endurance stuff tends to have a little bit more of a delayed gratification. So I'm gonna give you a win early. K? Now We're also gonna be sleeping more because we know and maybe we'll get into this in a future episode that sleep is absolutely critical To recovery and critical to growing muscle mass.[2:08:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're gonna emphasize sleep more during this part of the year, also because the sun is very low. It's harder to sleep for a lot of folks longer when the sun is out for longer, especially if you don't have a perfect blackout current. And so you're just, like, trying to play with the restrictions life gives you And optimize your scenario. So the sun's probably not out very often, and especially depending on where you live, if you're anywhere like, where I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, It's going to be dark and gray and gloomy most of the day, so it's not hard to convince you to go to sleep a little bit more often. So we'll do that.[2:09:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's also again why I chose an indoor sport. That activity, a you're gonna not shoot yourself in the foot. When it's cold and crappy outside is is not that hard to convince yourself to do, so you're gonna be lifting your weights, say, 4 times a week. And then again, getting some outside time in the form of a walk so that you can do it in the middle of work if you have to or or catching 20 minutes You're there. Whatever it needs to be, the chances of you missing that walk are little, and you'll still get Some outside time.[2:09:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can you've talked about the importance of getting sunlight in even if it is overcast, so you can still nail all those boxes, and be in a pretty good spot at the end of that quarter. Okay. So moving on to Q2 then, April to June. A lot of people Wanna look good during the summer months. You're more likely to be outside.[2:10:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're more likely to have your shirt off because it's hot, because you're either on vacation or going to the beach. So let's play into that a little bit. Let's let people look a little bit better, you know, if that's what they determine to be looking better, During the months when they're more likely to have that, you're also more likely to have things like weddings, over the summertime. People don't get married often in the winter, and And so people wanna look good for these events. So let's play into what a lot of people already want, and let's help you get leaner.[2:10:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not a lot of holidays That involve eating during that phase, so you're not gonna feel like you're missing out on a ton of life outside of maybe a a few smaller holidays in that phase. The days are getting longer, and so we're gonna choose to get in the sun more often. We can start getting a tan better. We can start getting ready for summer. And so this is why we exchanged our indoor sport for an outdoor sport.[2:10:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Surfing, hiking, Cycling outside, whatever the thing is you wanna do, there's tons of them. Kiteboarding, like I said, skateboarding. There you go. You know, start skating a little bit, whatever it needs to be. So we do that once a week or so, and then I actually threw in a fitness class here.[2:11:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: And there's a couple of reasons. One, now it's sort of nice to take the pressure programming off. It's also nice to if you've been lifting by yourself, To get in there and lift with somebody else. It's also nice to now have some social interaction. The gamification, the group, the scoring stuff that happens in fitness classes is very, very powerful.[2:11:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: It tends to be somewhat fleeting, So it won't last for a long time for some people, others it does. And so if you pepper this thing in and you know you're gonna you're gonna join this activity class, even if it's not great And the program design isn't perfect, it's fine for 10 weeks. In fact, you may may really, really enjoy it. And also, again, gives you just it gives you something new to think about. Music is on.[2:12:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're out of your house if you're lifting at your house. You're in a different part of the gym. The schedule's a little tighter. So you can't just go workout whenever you want. You gotta sort of show up when the class is going, and you'll probably find that you just love it.[2:12:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: You also get some social interaction. Right? Which is something that's also very important that we haven't really discussed yet if you're out playing basketball by yourself or whatnot. So this is just another thing I'm trying to fold in that still allows you to check off multiple boxes of things that are healthy for you. You've had episodes on the importance of social connection interaction.[2:12:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: We talked about that in the quad breakdown of making sure you have relationship time and things like that. So throwing in a fitness class And just doing honestly something quite different, is pretty fun. But then still keeping 2 days a week where you're doing a Traditional strength training thing, so you have some quality control there. Lastly, you can also then make sure You're hitting any specific movements or muscle groups that are very important to you. So you don't get to control that in your fitness class, But now you can at least do the gym and make sure you hit that muscle group that that you have an interest in it.[2:13:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: So now we're we're feeling pretty good. We're rolling into the summer. We're pretty lean. We're getting out in the sun a lot. We're bringing calories down a little bit, and we probably are feeling pretty happy.[2:13:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're also not burnt out. We've done a lot of fun things, and we've checked a lot of the boxes off for for long term development. We had a combination of specificity With excellent selection. But we also folded in just a little bit of variation, so we don't have to worry about overuse, Andrea, of doing the same machines, the same lift Months months months after months and and slowly wearing down something if our technique isn't perfect. K?[2:13:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So now we're gonna go into our Q3, which is The summer months, basically, up here at least, July to September. We'll transition. It's been a while since we've done some conditioning. Alright. So we may have lost a little cardiorespiratory fitness.[2:14:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: We may have, you know, not feeling great anymore, maybe energy throughout the day, stuff is starting to leak down. So we're gonna get We're gonna push our heart rate high, and we're gonna bring the the calories back up. The summertime, 4th July, Other holidays like this where eating is involved, maybe you're going to sporting events and and things like that. Our sport choices is, you You know, often going to be, outdoors. But in fact, what you'll notice here is is I've ramped the sport choice up to twice a week.[2:14:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: And in fact, I would encourage you to do 2 different types of exercise. And one of the primary reasons for that is to spend more time outside. A challenge we often see with people with exercises going, man, it's so nice outside. I can't go sit in the gym for 45 minutes. Alright.[2:14:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't have that much free time. And then Huberman's over here telling me I need to get direct sunlight more and, like, how am I gonna fit this in? Well, do your exercise outside. Enjoy it. If you live down here like us, you take sunshine for granted.[2:15:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: But a lot of people I know it's like, it's only nice for two and a half months of the year. Get outside. So let's push more of our fitness training to outdoor activities. These sports can be intense or not. Right?[2:15:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: It could be, go out there and swim hard. Get in the ocean. You're gonna do open ocean swimming instead of swimming in the pool indoors or whatever the case may be. So We're gonna give ourselves more of a priority of being outside, looking we've looked pretty good. We're a little tan, and we're enjoying all the benefits of training outside And the lack of structure.[2:15:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Still, we have structure, but not so specific like the machines and the and the weights give us. Maybe even now we're doing some track workouts. So now we can do something like sprint the straightaways, walk the corners, And we don't have to again do our conditioning on the same stair mask or air machine or or wherever we're on. So we're gonna enjoy some stuff like that. We're gonna be athletic.[2:15:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna run. We're gonna move. We haven't talked about that yet. Right? Everything has really been about sort of structured exercise.[2:16:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, now we're gonna do some sprint work. We're gonna get out and see that which is a a really important human quality that I think is important to not lose. It's actually ability to sprint. So we'll do that. And then we'll still make sure we lift twice a week for the same reasons I talked about in the previous phase.[2:16:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we make sure we have some quality control there. We maintain some of the muscle that we built in the quarter before. We don't lose too much strength. There is very good literature to suggest strength maintenance Can be done in as little as 5 sets per week for a very long time, really up to 8 plus weeks, if you do a little bit. So you you're touching it enough to where you're not gonna get really, really weak.[2:16:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: But we what you wouldn't wanna do is go 12 or 16 weeks where you lifted no weights. And maybe you got in great shape, but you're gonna feel very weak after that. So maybe that number could come down to 1 time a week if you really wanted it to. But 1 to 2 days a week where you're lifting the big exercises, the muscle groups, and movements of interest, and you're good to go. Then lastly, we roll into our final quarter, which is October to December, and we're gonna really get in great shape.[2:17:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: The sun is starting to come down. We're rolling into the holidays. Weather's getting worse. We may have other outdoor activities we wanna do like, in my case, you're going on a hunting trip, you have some travel, Conferences, whatever the case may be. And so we're going to choose an indoor sport.[2:17:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: And, I love combat sports. So the example I gave earlier was Like jiu jitsu or, you know, maybe you just transition your basketball to inside or your pickleball comes inside or whatever it happens to be. And you're still gonna have that twice a week. And then maybe instead of the track workout outside, you do that same workout indoors now Back on some sort of machine or something like that. Our weights are actually now down to once a week Because we're really pushing the pace on cardiovascular.[2:17:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're doing once a week to maintain it, to not lose and get too far behind, But we really wanna drink bring up our VO two max. We wanna bring up our efficiency, our cardiac output, and everything like that. And we're still gonna now walk twice a week so that we get something outside. And I talked about why, again, it's nice to have that Flexibility of not having to train outside, because now you gotta warm up and do all those things. You just get out and get a get a walk in.[2:18:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: You still get the outdoor experience. So We run the entire thing, and then you just start back the next year. Ideally, again, at the end of every quarter, You take a week off, whether that is a true full week off, which I am fully in support of. I mean, friends, we're only talking about 4 off weeks a year. That's absolutely fine.[2:18:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or it could even be a slight deload week if you want it to be. So we shouldn't run into too many issues of overuse. We have a lot of variety. We get a lot of movement patterns in because we're mixing in sport With machines and dumbbells, we're mixing in social interaction, we're mixing in the sun, we're mixing in enjoyment, we're mixing in fat loss, strength, hypertrophy, Some cardiovascular endurance, we're mixing in calories in high. We're mixing a little bit of calories low, and we're trying to hit as many of these nose as possible.[2:19:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you also wanted to cut each one of these a little bit short and repeat your fitness testing, at the end of every quarter, you could. I would probably recommend doing it at least once a year, perhaps doing it maybe the 3rd week of December or so. So you run that testing. That's your last week of training, then you get to go on your vacation break. You come back at the beginning of the year.[2:19:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: You've got new goals, new targets, and you go. If you want to repeat it twice a year, do the same sort of thing at the end of June. It's fine. I know I laid these out as quarters, Which is generally 12 weeks with 1 back off week. But if you wanted to make it 9 weeks in a testing week and then a back off for 10 weeks, it's fine.[2:19:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's it's close enough. So The last little thing I wanna say is, let's assume you're doing the 12 weeks, and you're gonna have a back off week at the end of the 12 weeks. I would actually still then recommend having at least 1 back off week halfway through. So it would look like this. 5 weeks Hard, where you're progressing.[2:20:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're going up, up, up, up, up. Every week, you're either increasing volume intensity like we talked about a few minutes ago. Then week 6, deload. Go down to 70% volume and intensity. Come back, go hard for 5 more weeks.[2:20:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: And now week 12 is your true off week where you, again, take the whole thing off. If you do that, You now have 4 weeks a year where you're totally off. You have 4 weeks a year where you're really backing down, and you just have 5 week Segments all year round where you're just gonna push it hard for 5 weeks. You're gonna need a break. You're gonna reset.[2:20:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna transition a little bit. Now as I started this conversation off with, There are many ways you could structure your training program throughout the year and hit those primary goals we talked about of looking fantastic, Feeling amazing and being able to do that your entire life. All I can tell you though is I know this model works. Because we've done this a lot with our clients in our rapid health optimization program. And this spans everything from 25 year old folks who are competing in the Boston Marathon to a lot of individuals who have never exercised before, who maybe have done a little bit of exercise.[2:21:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, it's quite literally All 3 of the buckets you laid out, we've had clients in all of those areas, both men and women, young and old. And we've had a tremendous amount of success transforming our lives using a very similar model to what I just laid out.[2:21:42] Andrew Huberman: I find that overall structure to be immensely informative. And I'll tell you why in the context of a number of examples of Myself, although that's the least important of them, frankly, but examples of family members of mine and friends of mine who've undertaken consistent exercise training programs, but that haven't varied the program so much. And here again, I the person who really loves to swim. They have a low barrier of entry to the pool or to the ocean. They they love being in the water.[2:22:14] Andrew Huberman: I am not one such person. I like being in the water, but I don't motivate to drive to the pool or to bike to the pool or to get into the ocean that often. Once I do it, I enjoy it. But for me, it's running and lifting weights, and it has been for a very long time. I have a family member, a close family member who doesn't really like, quote, unquote exercise, but loves dance and dancing.[2:22:34] Andrew Huberman: Going out dancing, yes, but dance classes Amazing. Particular. Really enjoys it. Loves to be distracted from the fact that she's doing exercise and just really enjoys it, and it actually is a very good dancer despite the fact that she's, related to me. And on and on.[2:22:49] Andrew Huberman: There are many examples, I I think, of of folks that fall into the different bins that we talked about earlier, but that also tend to default towards a given structure of training one way and doing that throughout the year. I can tell you right now that I'm Personally going to modify my schedule according to this, 4 quarters per year. It actually works because I've mostly been on the quarter system in academics for a very long time. I was at a University had a semester system once, but this quarter system is actually the one that we follow academically. So that's one reason why it's a a natural fit for me.[2:23:22] Andrew Huberman: I confess that I typically don't vary up the, proportions of endurance to resistance training. I tend to keep those about 3 and 3 across the week. Three resistance training sessions, 3, let's call them cardio sessions, but each one designed to achieve a different adaptation. And I've Now, alter those even further based on your, recommendations in this episode and previous episodes. But what I have not done Is to really think about deload and to really stick to the structure that I set out to accomplish across the year.[2:24:00] Andrew Huberman: On the topic of deload, for me, the deload has been when I get overwhelmed with work or I've gotten sick. I I don't tend to get sick that often, but every once in a while, I get knocked back with a cold or a flu. Once every 3 or 4 years, I seem to really get hammered with a fever inducing something or other, and then I'm bedridden for a couple days, and then I'm back at it. And I tend to come back rather slowly, and that tends to be my week off. But I'm beginning to wonder whether or not part of the reason I hit those streaks of, you know, being overwhelmed by sickness or by stress is that I have not done a deload period.[2:24:36] Andrew Huberman: So one of the the things that I'm going to immediately implement is a periodic deload according to the the program that you described. And I'm also going to start matching my specific goals for each quarter with time of year. I don't think I've done that, and it's not because I live in California. And by the way, folks, there are temperature variations and amount of light for, across the day variations in California as well. Although they are not as dramatic as they would be near the north Pretty wild.[2:25:02] Andrew Huberman: For instance. Right? But, of course, some of the listeners are at the equator, so they have the opposite issue. In any event, I'm I'm definitely going to do that. I'm going to start incorporating regular deload, periods, and I am going to be very, dedicated, very disciplined about sticking to a program for 3 months devoted mainly to hypertrophy, then a 3 month program devoted to fat loss, then a program devoted to, you know, aerobic output, and then one devoted to endurance.[2:25:34] Andrew Huberman: Although, I I must say it's very tempting for me to do a very specific strength dedicated portion Sure. Because I I don't tend to be particularly strong. I'm not weak, but I'm not particularly strong. So I might I might, consult with you as to how I could, vary endurance and strength. In any event, I love the idea of of a macro structure, and I love the idea of deloads in anticipation of being able to go further in the long run-in terms of results.[2:26:01] Andrew Huberman: I'm hoping this next year, because we're just on the on the cusp of a new year, will be the 1st year in which I don't find myself getting, some bugger virus or whatever it happens to be, from time to time and having to back off on training for that reason. And that prompts a question. And it's something that I want to get into in more detail with you when you describe recovery in an upcoming episode. But couple of quick questions. Maybe there's some short or short ish answers you could provide.[2:26:32] Andrew Huberman: If I'm not feeling well, Like, I really had a poor night's sleep. Maybe just 2 to 4 hours of sleep for whatever reason. Trainer don't train. That's the first question. Second question is, if I'm starting to feel a little bit of a throat tickle, and I'm in that phase of denial.[2:26:50] Andrew Huberman: Like, I don't get sick. I'm not getting sick. And I would I be better off bundling up some hot liquids, getting into bed, sleeping a little bit more, etcetera, and protecting myself against that, or would I be better off training? And if I've and then the third question is, if I've already succumbed to a bug, but it's not a severe bug. I'm I don't have elevated body temperature, so no fever.[2:27:13] Andrew Huberman: I'm not hacking up, but not not productive cough or anything like that. But I'm doing just kind of not well, head cold ish. I'd you know, sort of thing comes to mind, and it's not seasonal allergies. Train or don't train. Leaving aside the point of whether or not, you know, I'm in a position to, you know, get anyone else sick because, obviously, that's a bad idea.[2:27:33] Andrew Huberman: Okay? So, lack of sleep, I would say, 30 to 40% of one's typical sleep the previous night, trainer or no train. Starting to feel like one might be getting ill. And then the 3rd category is, coming back from from being sick. K.[2:27:50] Andrew Huberman: Thanks. And sorry for the extended question, but I wanna make sure there was enough detail there because I think these are 3 common scenarios.[2:27:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: We are going to cover that in the recovery conversation that's next, in detail, and I will give you very specific guidelines, and we'll have a plenty of time to to go into that. The quick answer is It comes back to what phase of training you're in. Now to walk through each scenario, if it is a crummy night of sleep And I am in a phase of training in which we are trying to cause adaptation. I have a lot of space in my schedule, And I'm really using this time to make progress because I know coming up soon, my schedule will change and my Time to train will go down. I'm still training.[2:28:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: I might use a bunch of tricks that we have for feeling better instantaneously. We call these little hacks. These are acute hacks. These are not chronic hacks. I'm gonna push the pace.[2:28:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: If it is really close to a deload week, Say it's Wednesday and I start my deload next week. Or this is not one bad night of sleep. This has been 4 bad nights of sleep in the last 5 days. This has been 6 kinda crummy nights over the course of the last 9. And you're starting to see a larger pattern, and that's a different answer.[2:29:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the question we're going to ask ourselves is, is this acute? Or is this a tendency or actually a chronic thing? If it's acute and we're close, We're gonna train through it. If it's acute and we this is not a phase of training where we're trying to really push, then maybe we we back off a little bit. If it's the opposite though, we need to probably make some changes and give ourselves some recovery.[2:29:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: This may include anything from A moderate training session, maybe I'm gonna go in the sauna and sit through that and then do some breathing drills and some mobility stuff. Alright. Great. Maybe I'm gonna, again, go to the gym and and ride the bike at 50% heart rate. Something restorative like that gives you a little bit energy but doesn't beat you down.[2:30:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's probably where we're learning. If you're feeling sick and you think it's it's coming, I'm probably going to do option 2 as well, which is some sort of restorative Training. So again, this tends to be moderate, could be weights, could be any of the stuff. Maybe you're gonna go out for your swim, but we're not going to push past Probably about 70%. We can absolutely induce immunosuppression with excessive training, and so you may wanna walk out of that.[2:30:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: The last case which was, I think, phase number 3 you said there, which is sort of like, I I got a pretty gnarly cold right now. Am I gonna train? Most of the time for most people, I'm just gonna say, just shut it down. Get out of there. Right?[2:30:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're not gonna be able to get productivity done there, You may be better off either going and sleeping, catching up on work, doing other stuff so that the next time you go to train, you don't feel behind, And we can give a good solid effort for it. So I know other people who will train right through it. I tend to not, to be totally frank. I If I'm feeling kinda junky, I'm I'm really not gonna train. I may actually probably, do some hot hot water immersion.[2:31:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So bath, Jacuzzi, things like that, I I I actually like those better than I like sauna.[2:31:11] Andrew Huberman: If one is ill, or you just like them better than sauna generally?[2:31:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Both, actually.[2:31:15] Andrew Huberman: Oh, my. Yeah. 1st person ever I've ever met or, come on this podcast to say you like Bazza in jacuzzi more than sauna.[2:31:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Absolutely. I may even do some ice. Probably not a ton though, because you you gotta be careful there. That's a big stressor.[2:31:30] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:31:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: And if you're already Over the line, you may be adding a pass there. Or I may I may go sleep. If I'm very if I'm feeling very, very, very sleepy, And sometimes depending on what kind of a bug you get, that can happen. I I will just sleep, and that might be the best choice you have. If that means you kick the cold Half a day earlier than that then you just won in the aggregate.[2:31:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, that those are probably it's a little bit of insight of The algorithm that I'm running with those things.[2:32:01] Andrew Huberman: Those are highly informative answers. Thank you. And I look forward to our discussion about recovery so that we can go into even more depth on how to recover.[2:32:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: The last thing I do wanna say here is kinda going back to our quarter system. The examples I gave with the bulking up losing fat, and then getting into better fitness and cardiovascular fitness at the end, Those were just samples. Friends, please don't take that literally. If you wanna emphasize strength more, Put in some more strength. If you wanna emphasize a different one of our 9 adaptations, great.[2:32:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Do that too. If if you're somebody who Is has a lot of body fat to lose, then maybe put that for 2 consecutive sessions or every other. You can modify them. We've talked about 9 very specific training adaptations as well as in fat loss. I only give you 4, Which is just meant to be a sample that you can roll in or out, but use those priorities to adjust that system according to what is important for you now, 5 years and then 45 years down the line for whatever that may be.[2:33:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you are absolutely free to modify the order, you're absolutely Free to modify the primary outcome and then adjust the specifics within each quarter based upon what is needed to do To optimize that outcome. I think maybe one more tool we can offer people is Maybe giving the individual week a little bit more structure. So the system I laid out is sort of like month by month, and, maybe we can lay out, say, a 3 day a week workout program and a 4 day a week program. That would still hit some the same well rounded adaptations that probably covers maybe not individualized per bucket that we've talked about a, b, and c, but it's gonna cover 75, 80% of what would need to occur in all 3 buckets, and then you can use that last 25% And so, maybe we can jump into that next.[2:34:04] Andrew Huberman: Great. Let's hear it.[2:34:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: The first one I wanna give you is just a basic 3 day split, that again, same idea. It's a well rounded exercise program. I actually wrote this all in an article, that is on xpt's website, so perhaps we can link directly to that. I will just jump you straight to the answer. You can read more about why in details in that article if you'd like.[2:34:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: But, this is day 1, day 2, day 3. You could do these days where you split them up, actually having, say, 24 hours in between, or you could do these Back to back. It doesn't necessarily matter. In this particular case, say day 1, you start off and do a little bit of speed and power, And then you may finish that with a little bit of hypertrophy. Now if you wanna gain more speed and power, you just do more of it.[2:34:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you wanna maybe just do a little bit to touch it and you really wanna gain some muscle, you would do more of an emphasis there. So the template can stay the same, and you would just increase the amount Of either adaptation, the speed and power stuff, or the hypertrophy based on how high it is in your priority list. Those are combined together because as we talked about earlier, they don't necessarily interfere with each other. You would do the speed and power stuff first Because it wouldn't hamper the hypertrophy. If you did the hypertrophy first in that workout, it would probably compromise your speed and power.[2:35:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: In that case, you would actually not be getting out of patients. So day 1, you do that. And that could be a 20 minute workout total or a 2 and a half hour, Up to you. Then you would come back maybe the next day or 2 days later, whatever you'd like to do. In your 2nd day of exercise, You would start off with a a pure strength, protocol, and you would finish that with what I'm calling just a higher heart rate.[2:35:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this could be something like our anaerobic capacity stuff. It could be the aerobic capacity, something where you're getting up to close to high heart rate. It could be those 22nd bursts. It Could be a 92nd brisk, 5 minute, mile repeat. Anything you like.[2:35:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can just sort of plug and play this in. You're getting to a spot now where You've had a little bit of speed, a little bit of strength, a little bit of hypertrophy, and you've touched the high heart rate. So we've checked off most of the boxes already in 2 sessions. Our last session then Would be more of a a steady state, long duration endurance. And so a 3 day week split like that is gonna be a pretty nice setup for the average person.[2:36:22] Andrew Huberman: So So this could be a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. What's happening on the intervening days?[2:36:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally off, If you want it to be. So I set this up as in the best I can give you, Andy, is 3 days. Okay. Great. If you have more, we could certainly improve it.[2:36:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: But this was my worst case scenario. I've got other things in my life. The most I could do for exercise is 3 days a week.[2:36:44] Andrew Huberman: And given that it's 3 days free, how Approximately, how long are each of these workouts going to last?[2:36:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: I would do whole body exercises for almost all that. I would do your full body parts. And I think you could Certainly finish that in 45 minutes of work time. Little bit of time to warm up, some down regulation at the end. You could be in and out of that gym in certainly under 60 minutes.[2:37:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: The Reality of the day is you could probably be out of there under 50 minutes. The total work time could be 30, 35 once you get going.[2:37:12] Andrew Huberman: So that's 3 days. As you pointed out, probably more work per week is going to be better in terms of, maximizing goals of aesthetic goals and, performance enhancing goals and, longevity goals. Right? I mean, the the numbers that I've heard That is that we should all try to get somewhere between a 150 and probably more like a 180 to 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week minimum. But As I recall, you consider zone 2 cardio so low intensity that, just walking around in is you know, qualifies as zone as really zone 1, zone 2 cardio.[2:37:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Not to take us too far off track, but and I guess, actually, useful to differentiate what I consider to be exercise And physical activity. So physical activity is out for a walk. It is Using a walking treadmill in while you're at work. It is, you know, parking farther in the parking lot and taking more steps.[2:38:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: These are all important. And what's clear, you are not going to reach likely optimal health by only exercising hard And then sitting around the other 23 and a half hours today. So it's very, very important whether you wanna do that in the form of zone 1 or zone 2 and hit 30 minutes a day. Various organizations will say things like that. You need to have 30 minutes a day of moderate to low intensity exercise.[2:38:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't really care. You you can combine it like that if you want. What you don't wanna do is just physical activity only, Which is almost always going to be like zone 1 to maybe zone 2. You also don't wanna go the other end of the spectrum, which is again, like, I left hard 3 days a week. And then what do you do the rest of the time?[2:38:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Nothing. That's not optimal either. And so I guess the system I've I've walked you through here or the example rather I walked you through is, you would need to maybe supplant that with being physically active. If you work, say you're a nurse, and And you're on your feet. You're moving up and down.[2:39:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: You you're probably actually covering a decent amount of your physical activity because you might be at 15,000 steps a day. If you're sitting in front of your computer And you do the same 3 day split. You would probably need to go out of your way to make sure you're adding a bunch more steps, and so you might need to add Several hours of walking to hit that 150, 180 minutes a week of physical activity. Because the program I laid out is, You know, if you're doing really 45 minutes, 3 days a week, maybe 60 minutes, at best you've hit 1 80. In term, you know, 60 minutes times 380 week.[2:39:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you might actually need to then throw in maybe some more specific walks. So you could do that in a number of ways. Could be, again, actual structured exercise. It could be simply I'm gonna do a 10 minute walk 3 times a day. It could be the exercise snacks that we talked about In a previous episode.[2:40:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's lots of ways to engage in more physical activity, but to me, those are different Oftentimes in structured exercise.[2:40:12] Andrew Huberman: I think many people will appreciate that you put out there for us a 3 day a week protocol because many people simply don't have more time to exercise. They're putting emphasis on these other, bins in the quadrant, and, you know, frankly, Those other bins are very important as well. So, wonderful that, people can, check off some critical boxes for aesthetics and Performance and longevity with 3 days of work or workouts per week, I should say. What are some other schedules that people can follow if they're willing to dedicate a bit more time toward their fitness?[2:40:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. If you wanted to do another sample of maybe a 4 day week. And, again, to clarify this this is I'm really happy you said that. This is this is a 4 day week of structured exercise. This would not account your Physical activity moving around.[2:41:01] Andrew Huberman: Which everybody should be doing.[2:41:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely. Maybe this is something like day 1, You're gonna do a strength training session, and you'll stay in the 5 to 10 or so repetition range. A little bit of strength, A little bit of hypertrophy, you've checked off a couple of boxes. Probably whole body, so that you get all the body parts covered or close. We're looking at generally multi joint exercises, could be a combination of barbells, free weights, bands, Sheen's, anything like that would be sort of day 1.[2:41:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could come back the very next day or you could wait 24 hours. But the 2nd day of your exercise Would be maybe your long duration. And this is actually sort of similar to how you set it up. It's you do a little bit of the inverse. But what you're kinda saying is I'm probably gonna be a little bit sore from day 1, And I don't have any free body parts that aren't sore.[2:41:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: So instead of trying to do another lift or something, I'm just gonna put in some restorative longer duration stuff. Same exact principles for long duration we just talked about. Could be a swim. Could be any number of things. Could be your sport.[2:42:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Could be you're out. I'm gonna go ride the bike and go for a jog in the sun. What whatever you would like to do. If you're feeling better, Maybe that's a little harder longer. If you're feeling pretty beat up from the day before, maybe that's a little bit shorter and slower.[2:42:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can modify it. Then maybe you take the next day off, That's open. Your 3rd day of exercise is now instead of being that 5 to 10 repetition range for your lift, You do something like 11 to 30 reps range. Also, this could be exchanged for something more like body weight, More muscular endurance type of stuff. So this is a great day, maybe it's yoga.[2:42:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe it is, a gymnastics thing you're working on or any of the many other styles of training that are not, In quote, unquote lifting weights, but they're not just walking and hiking. So, it could be a Pilates or equivalent. Anything like this where you're gonna get some muscular burn in there, Probably not any additional weight outside of body weight, or if it is, it's fairly minimal. You know, 5, 10, sort of 15 pounds. Something like that would be nice.[2:43:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Could also be done in a circuit. So we could hit our high heart rate, and we could hit some muscular endurance In there, group activity class might be nice here. Even maybe something like a spin class or a dance class. All these things could be great, and then maybe you even finish that with 10 minutes of some lightweights to hit the body part you say didn't get. So Maybe you did the dance class and then you finish and you do 10 minutes of upper body sets of 30 to make sure you get, you know, a nice pump there Because your legs probably got some work during the dance class, but your upper body didn't, so you balance the system out a little bit.[2:43:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So all body parts got a little bit of muscular endurance. Your heart rate got really high, came back down, and you sort of checked both of those boxes. Now it's important To remember the hypertrophy episode, doing sets of, say, 15 plus repetitions per set is as effective as doing sets of 5 to 10 or 12 for hypertrophy, gaining muscle. It's not effective though for strength gains. So you wouldn't wanna do this only because you'd really be doing nothing to improve your muscle strength, and you wanna make sure that that box is ticked at least a little bit.[2:44:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then again, you could take the day off after this, or you could roll right into your 4th exercise day, which would be your last exercise session of the week. And you would do something more of like a medium intensity. So this is a little bit higher intensity than our 2nd day. And this could be something like, you know, shadow boxing or hitting a heavy bag. It could be a little bit of higher intensity intervals, but not all the way up.[2:44:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So maybe this is you're gonna do a, a 1 minute on, 1 minute off on the bike, but you're only gonna go to, like, 85, 90% heart rate. And then instead of going off during that 1 minute, you drop it down to 50%. So it would actually look like 30 minutes of straight work, but you would have a little bit of rolling intensity as opposed to staying really nice and record restorative. It's gonna be some work there. And you would finish it with something like 5 to 6 minutes total of max heart rate stuff, Which lines up perfectly with that number you actually created in our our endurance episode of hitting 6 minutes total per week of maximum heart rate Or close.[2:45:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you could wrap that all up kind of into 1 session. You could do those in the inverse order. Thorough warm up, A few minutes, whether you wanna do 32nd bursts or a minute burst or straight 5 minutes, this is a a protocol I like to use a ton on the Assault Bike. It is simply a good warm up. 10 minutes solid warm up.[2:45:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Recover, and then I'm gonna go 5 minutes and cover as much distance as I can in 5 minutes. Brutal. It is brutal, and it's amazing. And you, like, you get a lot done in 5 minutes. 10 minutes on the back of that is a very gradual Bring back to earth there.[2:46:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually in that case, I don't need to do down regulation breathing because I've tens I've spent 10 minutes actually coming way back down, And the last 2 minutes or so of that is very deliberate 5 second inhale through the nose, 5 second exhale Put the nose while I'm barely just moving, and you end up being in a pretty good spot. So that again, time wise, could easily be done in 30 minutes, And you'd be rounded off there. So the nice part about this 4 day a week split as well as the 3 day a week split is it does give you a little bit of flexibility. And so what I mean is maybe Monday, your plan is to do the day 1 lift. And then Any number of things popped up in life.[2:46:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just shift it back to Tuesday rather than saying, like, Monday is leg day, and then all of a sudden something happened, you missed leg day. It's just you're doing these things in order, And you would like to get all 4 done in a 7 day span. But if it doesn't happen, fine. The next day you get to work out, You just go right back into the next workout, and it doesn't matter what day they land on exactly. For the 3 day routine, that works very nice Because the assumption there is you really only have time for 3 workouts a week.[2:47:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so that sort of implicit is there's probably some chaos happening in the Schedule a little bit, and you don't you don't really have the ability to lock in 3 days per week. If that's not the case, you can go. But we're trying to Listen to the pain points that people have with exercise and see if we can give them some solutions for those.[2:47:47] Andrew Huberman: Several things about this program were attractive to me. One of them you just mentioned, which is that by not rigidly attaching Individual workouts, just 2 specific days of the week. 1 in theory could say, okay, was I didn't get that much sleep last night. I don't feel I know that a lot of people say, what what is feel? But I don't feel recovered or, like, I'm gonna get that much out of the the workout tomorrow.[2:48:11] Andrew Huberman: So I'm, or today, so I'm just gonna push it forward today. And the the ability to slide workouts forward or back by a day, I think is incredibly valuable, if for the consistency's sake. I also really like this idea of some of the long duration work coming a day after hitting the strength and bit of hypertrophy work, so this would be the the day 2. One thing that I've experienced over and over is that if I'm very sore in a given muscle group, especially my legs, doing some low intensity cardio, whether or not it's a jog or on the bike, typically for me, it's a jog or even even skipping rope and then walking, skipping rope, and walking Does seem to dissipate the soreness. I'm sure there's a mechanism there has to there's a mechanism for everything, frankly.[2:48:55] Andrew Huberman: Yep. But, I I like that arrangement. And then I also like this idea of, making sure that there's a, workout for muscular endurance. Because I feel like unless I've been stuck without a good gym or I've decided to specifically train body weight exercise, which I did a few years ago, I got really excited about some of Pavel Satsulan's[2:49:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. Work. Great stuff.[2:49:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. His book, The Naked Warrior, which doesn't involve Training naked, although I suppose you could if you wanted. But it was really about no weights, and involved building up to pistol squats and 1 arm push ups and things of that sort. Even I'm doing pull ups on doors, and I've discovered that some door frames are much stronger than others. Uh-huh.[2:49:37] Andrew Huberman: In hotels, I just accidentally, I caused some damage there. But, in any case, muscular endurance, I think, is a really interesting one that I plan to incorporate into my schedule, but That is, I think is one that's often overlooked unless people really have an aversion to weights and, and to machines.[2:49:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're right. It shouldn't be because It's pretty low hanging fruit. You don't need a lot of equipment for it typically. It doesn't hurt that bad. You don't often get that sore out of it, and you're gonna feel a nice wonderful pump So it's a great motor.[2:50:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: And as we discussed many times now, it is quite effective at hypertrophy.[2:50:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I also I don't know if they fit specifically with Musko Endurance. But if you look at the, the physiques, for example, on rock climbers, I mean, they have to me, of course, they have, usually, the experienced climbers have, pretty, remarkable, body compositions. They tend to be lean and lithe and flexible, All those things, that many people aspire to. The other thing is their development always looks exceedingly balanced.[2:50:41] Andrew Huberman: You don't really Tend to see climbers. They're, like, overdeveloped in the torso and underdeveloped in the arms or overdeveloped in the arms despite all the climbing and underdeveloped in, relatively in the other limb limb move that's true for women and men. It's not a a sport that I participate in, but, it seems like what they're doing is essentially muscular endurance training. Yep. Yeah.[2:51:02] Andrew Huberman: So there's there's really something there to to be valued. So that's a 4 day a week schedule with off days or rest days inserted, as needed and then just and continuing. For those that are a bit more committed to their fitness and want to do a, 5 or 6 day a week program, would you recommend just, collapsing some of the off days, paying more attention to recovery, and and cycling through more quickly.[2:51:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Absolutely. You could combine that and just run that Either one of those programs. So you could run that 3 day week program back to back. Do the get that done in 6 days.[2:51:38] Andrew Huberman: So day 1, speed, power, hypertrophy. Day 2, strength, work with elevated heart rate anaerobic capacity in day 3 endurance, and then just and then just cycle through again.[2:51:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You take day 4 off of the week, And then you go back again. So we would be having a 6 days of exercise, one day off, and you'll be getting every one of those adaptations in multiple times a week. That is almost exactly how we would set up a 6 day week program.[2:52:01] Andrew Huberman: Great. I love the the elegance and the simplicity of that and the thoroughness of it because it checks off So many, if not all of the made 9 major adaptations to exercise that we've been talking about these episodes. And I suppose the one thing that I want to Highlight and impose this also as a question is that early in our discussions in a previous episode, you mentioned that so much of what people Think of and apply as it relates to resistance training is borrowed from bodybuilding and hypertrophy training specifically, which Typically involves getting close to failure or failure, sometimes even involving rest pause where you hit failure then set the weight down for a few seconds and repeat these high intensity techniques, you know, accentuating the negative, so called the eccentric, etcetera. In hearing about these protocols of 3 day a week or 4 day a week, 6 day a week. It's very clear to me that if one is not careful to omit that kind of thinking[2:52:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:52:59] Andrew Huberman: And Suddenly is taking their strength work and speed work to failure or is pushing too hard on muscular endurance to the point where you're just grinding out that very last push up on every set, That the amount of soreness and the amount of recovery that results from these workouts might start to cause Progress issues. So one thing that's in the back of my mind is as you've described these programs is that even though some of them are very brief or involve a minimum of time commitment, in particular 3 day week, but also the 4 day week schedule, that there is a a discipline involved in making sure that You stick to the workout that you're supposed to do that day and not, go ham as they say, and just throw in a couple extra sets of of bicep in tricep pushes because you you wanna do that, and you thought you could. Maybe you could get away with that, but you have to come back pretty quickly and do some serious, meaning devoted Speed and power work[2:53:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:53:52] Andrew Huberman: And or strength work. And if you haven't been disciplined about not doing certain forms of exercise, I could see how the whole thing could kind of crash quickly, and one could think, oh, this is just too much work or it's it's it's not for me. Yep. So, this, I suppose, is now where the question comes, which is, what what are some of the key points that people need to keep in mind when they, embrace a program? How rigidly do they need to stay attached to, you know, today's endurance day?[2:54:20] Andrew Huberman: I'm just doing endurance. Today's strength day, I'm just doing strength work. I'm not gonna take things to absolute failure or beyond failure.[2:54:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: I am absolutely happy With anyone modifying any of the sample programs, however, they would like to. My only recommendation for the Question you just posed would be set your program, and then if you're going to make a change, fine. But that is a change to your program. In other words, don't just make decisions every single day and make changes. If you're doing that, you might as well not have a program.[2:54:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: And as we described earlier, there is clear evidence that having a program is better than not, regardless of the effectiveness of the program. And so my general comment to that is, okay, fine. A day or 2, you made some modifications. No problem. We're in a situation now where it's like you're basically changing the workout every day as you go, then we just need to read or write a new program.[2:55:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: We We need to reassess where we're at because we need to have some structure. Look, the reality of it is, I change the programming I'm going to do the day of often Because of any number of situations, I just don't feel like it. I way overestimated today. We talked a little bit in a previous episode about auto regulation, which is a style of Of periodization and program design, which you're adjusting based on how you're actually feeling that day, but with some specific structures. So you're gonna take some measurements that day and So auto regulation is a very, very effective tool.[2:55:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: You just need to make sure that that auto is dialed. In other words, is it because your body actually So you needed something different, or is it because you're now just getting a little bit lazy? Now you're just not feeling like it today. So there's a little bit of an impossible line to draw there. Both scenarios are real, gray area.[2:56:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: A lot is real in the moment, and so you just need to be a little bit aware of having some reality check, Listening to your body, but then also being like, hey, no. I'm talking to you. I'm telling you this is a plan. We're going to do this. And staying Within it, it is going to be challenging to progressively overload, and therefore, Get a higher likelihood of success in your training program if you're just making decisions and changing the program right before you workout.[2:56:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're probably not You're probably going for most people, you're probably going to choose less or off more so than you choose more. Now having said that, there are more than a few clients that have come through our programs where they choose more always. They add a set. They add an exercise. They add in another workout.[2:57:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that can be okay, but we're gonna track various markers on them. And if we see these things consistently going down, We're going to identify whether they are which phase of this overtraining thing we'll talk about next they're actually in. Some phases, I'm okay. Some of them, I'm not. If we're seeing certain things happen physiologically, we're gonna make a conversation.[2:57:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're also then going to really think carefully about Why are you making this choice? Do you feel like the training isn't enough? Okay. Great. Well, let's modify it then.[2:57:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Are you not making progress? Or are there some other reasons why you're doing this? Obviously, I'm not a psychologist or therapist, but there are clearly situations in which folks And dose themselves with far too much exercise for reasons that are not because it's productive to their training or goals. And if such case, We would probably bring in somebody that specializes in those areas to clear that out and and just make sure it's like we're not doing this for, anxiety issues or energy things like if it's I just don't get the programs enough? Okay.[2:58:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. Let's go back. Let's look at our metrics. Let's evaluate our tests and and go over there. But if there's other reasons, then, we may bring in somebody to have that conversation.[2:58:13] Andrew Huberman: Hey. Usually, when I've seen people deviate from programs Because they tend to revert to something that they've done for a long time, it just feels really comfortable to them. Yeah. And it worked. Yep.[2:58:21] Andrew Huberman: It and it was giving them Decent results. So they're skeptical to try something else. Or there is, a phenotype of kind of haphazardness sometimes, especially people get really caffeinated before workout and just wanna throw something in. Then there's a 3rd category, and this is one that I've had to contend with a lot in my life, which is that I really enjoy training with other people when I have the opportunity.[2:58:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:58:41] Andrew Huberman: And day a certain day rolls around where you're supposed to do something and not do other things, and people say, hey. Do you wanna go for a long ocean swim? Or You wanna train and you end up doing some, you know, Kenny Kane, this one's for you. Some ridiculous, you know, 20 wall ball, CrossFit type workout, and I'm not, acclimated for that sort of thing.[2:58:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:58:59] Andrew Huberman: And then it does tend to throw things off, not because no pun intended, Kenny. Because There's no there's nothing wrong with the 20 sets of wall balls if you're that's part of your conditioning.[2:59:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:59:10] Andrew Huberman: But if it's not appropriate for where you are in your schedule, it really can disrupt What you're trying to do Yeah. Even as a as a noncompetitive athlete like myself, the year has been since I've competed in in any athletic program. But The as a noncompetitive athlete, I think there's a a beauty to and a really strong incentive to being disciplined about The program that one follows, as a mentor and professor that I worked with years ago used to say, I come into his office all these ideas and the things I wanna do, and he'd say, let's constrain this walk. And then you you know, the question you always wanna arrive at in a discussion with your students, as you know, is what's the experiment exactly? And then you go and you do that specific experiment.[2:59:52] Andrew Huberman: I think I I view a workout the same way, that there are multiple adaptations, goals, and things that people are trying to achieve. Really knowing why you're there each time and really sticking to that even if it means not training with other people or I always say, well, you can train with me, but I'm not gonna train with you.[3:00:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Selfish.[3:00:10] Andrew Huberman: Right. So that's one way to do it. But really sticking to a schedule is really what allows the Progress to emerge, but that doesn't necessarily mean being antisocial. You can invite people along. But in this case, I'm telling people to be the host, not the guest.[3:00:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: I have a little bit of a rule here. Maybe maybe I should answer your question this way. I actually like doing things totally different occasionally. So I'll do when I'm traveling, I tend to do hotel workouts. What I mean by that is I will go down to the workout room, and I will do a set of 10 to 15 reps Of every single machine in the exact order in which they are laid out.[3:00:45] Andrew Huberman: Woah.[3:00:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just for the sake of fun. Like, just for the sake of, like,[3:00:48] Andrew Huberman: something tarot Card version of Warhol House. Totally. Comes up, I'm gonna make sense of it. Right?[3:00:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just move. Yeah. And those are typically things of, like, I just wanna move a little bit for jet lag and Other sort of purposes. Right? That's often like, I wasn't gonna get to work out today, and so now I'm gonna do something to feel great.[3:01:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't travel that much though, so it's not really throwing my my things off. I also I don't get a lot of free time. And so if I I'm traveling, and I'm seeing someone I haven't seen in many years or for the first time. I mean, we got to train together this week for the 1st time. I'm not gonna burn that opportunity.[3:01:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: My rule is this though, I'm not going to do something that's gonna cost me more than 3 days. So I'm absolutely happy, to to get out there and maybe tomorrow morning or tonight, we we we go do some fun that's off my schedule. I'm I'm in I'm in a 100%. I'm just gonna down regulate a little bit. I'm not gonna maybe do as much as you or as hard as you or whatever.[3:01:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'll do more than I should. But if it cost me tomorrow, it was worth the exchange. I don't have a world record. I'm setting anytime soon. I don't have, I got many years.[3:01:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm happy to give up a couple of days of exercise to be a little sore than I need to be for the exchange of a lifetime memory. And this Stuff is so important to me. This stuff lands like true lifetime memories. Or I I can look back many of my fond memories from my life are are training sessions with friends. Whatever it is, Doing jujitsu with somebody who's a world champion.[3:02:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: We just, like, total total whatever the thing is. Right? You're like, that was really, really cool. Absolutely worth missing 2 days. If it's gonna be more than 3 days though, we're, like, I'm going to be so wrecked, I can't work out for 5 or 6 days, then I'm probably like, alright.[3:02:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's that's kinda nonsense. Unless this is like an opportunity where I'm like, I We can't pass up. You know? So that that's kinda how I think about it. That doesn't happen too often with me though.[3:02:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe once a month. And so I'm like, okay. I'm fine. I lost a day. Yeah.[3:02:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it is it's probably more like once a quarter, but that happens. So I don't really care. So you do wanna balance joy And life. You don't wanna be so rigid about your training program that it ruins and robs his experience. Physical activity should be Fun.[3:03:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your fitness and your training should be something that makes your life better, not some task you have to get done So that 75 years from now, you've hit some metric of who knows what.[3:03:14] Andrew Huberman: Just alone in your room with your training logs. Yeah. No. You want the in all seriousness, I think, you point to the richness of life and, you know, you can draw these boxes like work, relationships, fitness, recovery, but The the boundaries between those boxes are blurry because Of course. And I should say I love training with you.[3:03:31] Andrew Huberman: I greatly enjoyed training with you this morning, not just because I was receiving so many useful tips. In fact, Thank you. It's the 1st time I PR'd in a number of things today. Thanks to your input in the moment. That that's a irreplaceable kind of gift, but mostly it's the gift beginning to train with a colleague and friend.[3:03:46] Andrew Huberman: So, I wanna underscore highlight and put an exclamation mark behind, what you just said. Thank you once again and again for giving us so much interesting, clear, Actionable and at times somewhat counterintuitive information in order to build out an exceptional training program To meet any of, and in some cases, all of the 9 major adaptations that exercise can create toward aesthetic, performance related, and Healthspan, lifespan, aka longevity, goals. It's really a treasure trove of information there. And I look forward to our next discussion about how to best recover from exercise both within the exercise bout And between exercise bouts and in the more macroscopic structure of a week, a month, a year, I can't wait.[3:04:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can't wait either.
