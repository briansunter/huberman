I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Robin Carhart Harris. Doctor Karhart Harris is a distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of the leading researchers in the field of psychedelics and how they change neural circuitry in the brain.[0:00:30] Andrew Huberman: His laboratory is responsible for understanding, for instance, how psilocybin, also sometimes referred to as magic mushrooms, change neural circuitry in the brain such that new ideas and new forms of learning occur. His laboratory is also responsible for carrying out various clinical trials, some of which have demonstrated that appropriate dosages of Psilocybin can alleviate major depression in more than 67% of people that take the drug. Now this is not to say that everybody should take psilocybin, and today's discussion describes both the clinical trials And why treatments with psychedelics, in some cases, work and in some cases, do not work in order to treat major depression, as well as discussions around Psilocybin, Lysergic acid diethylamide, sometimes also referred to as LSD, as well as DMT, and how these change the brain and how those brain changes can relate to changes in mental health as it relates to depression and other psychiatric challenges, as well as how psychedelics are being applied in order to change neural circuitry for sake of Expanding different aspects of the human mind, including creativity, intelligence, and much more. During today's discussion, doctor Carhart Harris teaches us about the history of the study of psychedelics as well as how the legislature, that is the laws surrounding psychedelics, are evolving in the United States and elsewhere for the use of psychedelics to treat psychiatric challenges.[0:01:49] Andrew Huberman: By the end of today's discussion, you will have a thorough understanding of how psychedelics work Both in the short term, during the actual journey or trip. In fact, much of my discussion today with doctor Karhard Harris talks about the different aspects of the psychedelic journey and how those relate to therapeutic outcomes. And, of course, by the end of today's discussion, you will also understand the long term effects of psychedelics, That is how they can actually rewire the brain. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.[0:02:25] Andrew Huberman: In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep Backing capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. One absolutely critical variable to getting excellent sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment.[0:02:47] Andrew Huberman: That is in order to fall and stay deeply asleep at night, your body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and alert, your body temperature has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. There are a lot of ways to control the temperature of your sleeping environment, but one of the best ways is to control the temperature of your actual mattress, the surface that you're sleeping on. With 8 Sleep, you can do this very easily. There's a simple to use app where you can program in the temperature of your mattress across the night.[0:03:14] Andrew Huberman: So you can make it slightly cool at the beginning of the night, getting cooler, putting you into deep sleep, and then rapid eye movement sleep, and all of that in terms of its impact on your sleep can be tracked within the same App. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for more than 2 years now, and it has completely transformed my sleep. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman For their exclusive Memorial Day savings now through June 5, 2023. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman.[0:03:46] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors in terms of your energy levels and your immediate and long term health are your blood glucose or blood sugar levels as they're commonly called. With levels, you can assess how different foods and activities impact your blood glucose levels. When I did this, it taught me several things.[0:04:11] Andrew Huberman: First of all, it taught me that certain foods really spike my blood glucose levels. And while spikes in blood glucose aren't always a bad thing, I was able to assess how certain foods were spiking my blood glucose too much such that I would have Post eating dips in energy levels. And by removing those foods and substituting in other foods, it really evened out my energy levels. So if you're interested in learning more Again, that's levels.link/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.[0:04:47] Andrew Huberman: Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones. Now most people have heard of the so called ketogenic diet, but most people, including myself, are not on the ketogenic diet. That is I and most people eat complex carbohydrates, fruits, and things of that sort in addition to quality proteins, etcetera. It turns out that even if you're not following a ketogenic diet, increasing your blood ketones can still have benefits. So for instance, I use Keton IQ.[0:05:10] Andrew Huberman: Anytime I want to do extended bouts of focused work, preparing for podcasts, research, writing grants, and if I ever want to Exercise, but I don't have time to eat or I don't wanna have my gut full of food. Taking Keton IQ and thereby increasing my blood ketones Allows me to do cognitive work or physical workouts without getting hungry and with plenty of energy and cognitive focus. If you'd like to try Ketone IQ, you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off. Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman. I'm pleased to announce that I will be hosting 2 live events in September of 2023.[0:05:46] Andrew Huberman: The 1st live event will take place in Toronto on September 12th. The 2nd live event will take place in Chicago on September 28th. Both live events will include a lecture and a question and answer period and are entitled the Brain Body Contract, during which I will discuss tools and science related to mental health, physical health, and performance. And I should mention that a lot of that content We'll have absolutely no overlap with content covered previously on the Huberman Lab Podcast or elsewhere.

I hope to see you there. And now for my discussion with doctor Robin Carhart Harris. Doctor Carhart Harris, welcome. I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time.[0:06:36] Andrew Huberman: I certainly have known who you are for quite a while because I place you in this Very small but very special and important category of researchers who has been pioneering the use of psychedelics for the treatment of specific clinical conditions and really, carrying the torch for essentially the entire field. So I wanna start with a voice of gratitude and say thank you for doing this incredibly important work. Could you tell us a little bit about what Psychedelics are in fact, I'm curious as to how the name psychedelic ever came to be, and what you think They potentially reveal about the workings of the brain, and then we'll talk about the clinical applications.[0:07:20] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Sure. Well, even that one is, It's, kinda hot one because, opinions differ on how to define psychedelic. But perhaps a good starting place is to start with the etymology, where did the word come from. And it it was a Brit, Excommunicated, living in in Canada, Humphrey Osmond, who, was due to present a a Paper at a National Academy of Sciences meeting on psychotomimetics, drugs that mimic aspects of psychosis in their action. And certain drugs like mescaline, let's see, 1956, and LSD, were on on the bill, and, he felt dissatisfied with them being under this category of psychotomimetics and felt that the signature psychological effects of these compounds went beyond just mimicking psychotic symptoms.[0:08:23] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And so he wanted to find a more apt term to speak to, in a sense, the principal component of their action. And, he jotted down a few different, possibilities, about a dozen or so, I think. And one of them was Psychedelic actually has started, as an ended up being psychedelic. And, he had a correspondence going on with another Brit also living in the US, Aldous Huxley, where they were playing with some, terms to refer to these compounds. And and, in the end, Osman won with psychedelic, and he had this little Dity of, to fathom hell or so angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic.[0:09:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: That's where you put the disclaimer. And so, what does that mean? It's 2 ancient Greek word psyche means the human mind, or if we're being, actually true to the ancient Greek, it means Soul. And then the other component, means to make clear or to make visible or to make manifest or to reveal. So all of those work.[0:09:46] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And it's, it's a neologism. It's a made up word, but it Does have that ancient Greek origin, and it's speaking to this principle that these compounds reveal aspects of the psyche, of the human mind, the soul that are ordinarily not entirely visible. And so that's the etymology, and it's wonderfully poetic, but I happen to think it's also very accurate. It's, a useful term because it's sort of you might say valence nonspecific. It doesn't say you're gonna have a great time Or that you're gonna go mad.[0:10:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's more that it reveals the psyche, and it could be hellish, but it could be heavenly. And, so that's the etymology and also a bit of the psychology, and sort of, You know, pointing to the phenomenology, the subjective experience, but there's also a pharmacology here. And quite recently, there was put out a consensus statement about psychedelics that's Really referring to what we call the classic psychedelics to say that these are all compounds that work on a particular Receptor in the brain, the serotonin two a receptor, and that's another way that we could define these compounds. I said this one's a little hot because I'm of the view that while the pharmacology is really useful, how the drugs work chemically, You can't avoid the phenomenology. And if we're true to the etymology where the term came from, then We must recognize, and we cannot neglect the subject of experience.[0:11:35] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for that beautiful description of, what brought us to today in terms of using the word psychedelics, and now it's thrown around all the time.[0:11:44] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Too much.[0:11:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Too much. And and I'm guessing, well, Well, not guessing. I'm certain that it's, also used to describe many compounds that don't touch the 5 h two the 5 h t two a, the serotonin two a receptor. So, there is a broader categorization by most people, and, it'll be interesting to see where all the nomenclature and naming goes.[0:12:05] Andrew Huberman: For the time being, I'd love for you to tell us a bit more about this idea that psychedelics, however one defines them, can reveal something about The mind that can't be revealed otherwise, are you talking about the subconscious? I mean, you know, psychologists and Most famously Freud, but also Jung and all also neuroscientists, I think, think about subconscious processing. I think perhaps the most salient example for me that's Outside the realm of of, anything psychedelic would be blindsight. This phenomenon that you take people that are blind but still have some connectivity in their brain and you present them,[0:12:43] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: you[0:12:44] Andrew Huberman: know, a board with a computer screen with different number of dots on each side. And you say, how many dots are on each side of the screen? And they say, what do you mean? I can't see the screen. I'm blind.[0:12:52] Andrew Huberman: He said, well, just guess, and their guess rate is accurate far more than Chance would would predict. Mhmm. So they have so called blindsight, and people have said, well, this is the subconscious revealing itself. There's no psychedelic drug involved, but what you're describing is a pharmacologic induced state That reveals something that normally, should we assume is masked or that we are oblivious to, even though it's expressing itself, what what what does it mean for these drugs to be, you know, revealing something about the workings of the mind that would Not be obvious to us otherwise.[0:13:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. So so the, example of blindsight is interesting, but it's different. Blindsight would be, referring to nonconscious processing, maybe implicit processing. So Stuff going on in the mind, in perception, in a sense that is below the threshold of conscious awareness, but yet is influencing you. So it's sort of it kinda related, but it's different.[0:13:57] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So in in-depth psychology, psychoanalysis, psychodynamic psychology, you know, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and so on. We talk about the unconscious, and there, it's more about the kind of blood and guts of the human condition, the human nature, both the personal unconscious, So things that you might not want to necessarily be conscious of because it's painful. So that that's the repression aspect pushing it out of conscious awareness.[0:14:32] Andrew Huberman: Repressed memories in particular?[0:14:33] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Like, traumatic memories, difficult, relationships. It could be complex trauma, not necessarily just a specific, You know, index trauma, but a series of trauma. And then you have the collective unconscious, which was really Carl Jung's contribution to say that, you know, there's a transpersonal quality to the unconscious. There's aspects about humans, not just this individual human.[0:15:05] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: There's aspects to our our minds, our psyches that are, not fully available to conscious awareness, but can come up in certain states. You know, psychoanalysis went crazy for dreaming as Is there royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious? That was Freud. But, We now know with psychedelics and this was what drew me into the area was discovering literature, that we're speaking to this particular action, the psychedelic action, we're saying that when these drugs, Like LSD, psilocybin found in magic mushrooms. When they're used in in psychotherapy, Material comes up that maybe may have been repressed, that that, is of, you know, therapeutic value, and awareness and insight of this material seems to catalyze the therapeutic process with, You know, strong emotional release, these cathartic experiences, and, and insights, you know, whether they're Insights that are personal, or whether they're transpersonal.[0:16:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But for me, this is really Where the meat of it is with psychedelics and classic psychedelics in particular, the likes of compounds like, LSD and and psilocybin, I would say that if it wasn't for this action by classic psychedelics, We wouldn't be so interested in psychedelics. I I think if we only had compounds like Ketamine, MDMA, cannabis, That is that could be said, broadly speaking, to be psychedelic like. I don't think it necessarily would have captured The world's attention as psychedelics are right now, I I actually think it's a major gap To fill is this principle action of the classic psychedelics. What does what does this mean that I'm referring to? Psyche revealing.[0:17:14] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: What is that? And I suppose where I'm going with this is what is that in terms of the biology as well, what's going on in the brain and the body when people become aware of things that previously they weren't fully aware of.[0:17:32] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to talk about some of the clinical trials that you've been involved with, in particular, looking at psilocybin, The as you mentioned, the principal hallucinatory psychedelic agent in magic mushrooms. I'd like to start with a kind of nuts and bolts question, just so that everyone's on the same page. I've read The papers that you've published and that others have published in this area, and, typically, the dosages used in these trials are 25 milligrams of Psilocybin, and we talk about one recent trial in particular that compared 25 to 10 milligrams to More frequent use of very small amounts, 1 milligram over 3 weeks, for instance. However, When people talk about magic mushrooms, they often talk about gram doses of the mushroom because I'm assuming that They contain milligram dosages of psilocybin. Here, we're not, encouraging, use of any kind.[0:18:33] Andrew Huberman: These are clinical trials. But for, clarity of understanding. What is the conversion typically? Like, 1 gram of magic mushrooms will contain how many Milligrams of psilocybin on average. Because what I what I'm trying to do here is is calibrate people to this Idea of microdosing versus macrodosing, and that's fairly straightforward to do with respect to the clinical trials.[0:18:59] Andrew Huberman: But then in the A lot of the lay discussion around this you hear about heroic doses versus microdoses, and so I think there's a lot of confusion. So, if you would, Educate us on this, idea of what's a microdose, and perhaps also how many milligrams of psilocybin are contained in a Gram of, quote, unquote, magic mushrooms.[0:19:23] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Sure. Well, a microdose is is, neither of these are that simple, but They're fun, it's a fun challenge. But microdose, one definition is that it's a dose of Typically, a classic psychedelic like LSD or psilocybin, that is, that has subperceptible Psychedelic effects. Like, it doesn't put you into a noticeable altered state of consciousness that feels like you're tripping. And, if that was LSD, it looks as though the threshold is around about, Let's see.[0:20:04] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: 10, 11, 12 micrograms. Micrograms. Grams.[0:20:08] Andrew Huberman: Very clear here. Micrograms. So ten So 10 micrograms of LSD, are you saying, will not induce visual hallucinations in most people?[0:20:17] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So it's it's that's Threshold level. That's about the level that that some people who are sensitive could feel it. But if you were to talk to the, microdosing gurus, they might say that that's kind of the ballpark for An LSD dose that you would consider a microdose and then you would take sort of semi regularly. It it's typically something like one day on, one day off, or one day on, 2 days off, this kind of thing. There's different protocols.[0:20:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And, yeah. So, you know, some, like Jim Fadiman, one of the popularizers of microdosing, I think, would say that a true microdose should be subperceptible. You shouldn't feel it. Yet the assumption is it's gonna change you in some way, on a kind of trait level more than a state level, maybe behaviorally. And the typical story goes it will improve well-being, and maybe maybe It could improve certain aspects of cognition, say, related to creative thinking.[0:21:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I emphasize the maybe there because that's another angle with microdosing. We're kind of waiting for some compelling evidence. As things stand right now, I'd say we lack, that compelling evidence. There's some suggestive stuff, but often the Study designs aren't that strong. It's really hard to do a study with microdosing because you need to have permission To give people a microdose that, you know, for practical reasons, they would go home with.[0:22:03] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And, Otherwise, you you're requiring them to be in the lab, say, 3 times a week for x number of weeks to Meet the criteria of a course of microdosing, which might be, you know, 2 or 3 times a week for, say, a month. And that's a hard thing to do in a lab study. It's expensive. You'd need to do that against a Suitable controls or placebo control. And there is a study that's been done in New Zealand, that has some interesting Preliminary data that did I think kinda did the design right, but, it hasn't been published yet.[0:22:49] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I've seen some positive findings presented around improvements in in mood, but it's a bit early to Get too excited about that. Needs to go through peer review and all that. But as things stand, you know, The evidence is pretty thin, and and, you know, we have to be honest about that. We did quite a creative study, with my colleagues at Imperial, the guy leading that Balas, Shigeti, Hungarian chap, did a really creative design, very much his brainchild. He, instructed people to do their own blinding, Their own placebo controlled blinding of their own microdosing.[0:23:33] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So this was a classic citizen science study, like do it yourself science, where they would get their LSD tabs and chop them up, put them into gel capsules, opaque, and have other capsules that are The placebos that they just close empty capsule. And then there was a whole barcode scan technique, So that you you kinda shuffle them up, you know, but they've got the barcode in, the QR code. So you can break the code later on, but once you've shuffled them up, you no longer know which ones had have the the microdose in and which ones are empty.[0:24:09] Andrew Huberman: Was this LSD?[0:24:10] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: This was LSD. He also tried it with mushrooms, but the issues with the mushrooms was people would burp sometimes. They'd belch, and then they'd add this mushroom taste. So then he instructed people to get some, like, nonpsychoactive mushroom material to put in. So it's Really[0:24:27] Andrew Huberman: Not an easy study.[0:24:28] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Not an easy study, and and, it was I love that kind of science. You know? Real Creative, first mover kind of science. And the results were fascinating because, the short story is that the microdosing Didn't, compellingly beat the placebo.[0:24:46] Andrew Huberman: It did not.[0:24:47] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It didn't. And he controlled because he asked. He controlled for expectancy. So people's positive expectancy, which is in a sense the vehicle that carries the placebo response. It's why you have a placebo is that positive expectancy can drive a therapeutic effect to, you know, a large extent.[0:25:09] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So he measured that pretrial and then used it to kinda correct the the response. And how did it work? Those who got a placebo but thought they got a microdose did as well as those who Thought they got a microdose and did get a microdose. So it was the bigger effect. The the majority of the effect was in thinking that you got a microdose.[0:25:35] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So in a sense, it was a victory for the power of the placebo response, and it's created all sorts of controversy. People don't wanna believe it, you know, that kind of thing. But that's the beauty of science, isn't it? That science is not about what you want to believe. That right there is the beauty Science, really.[0:25:54] Andrew Huberman: I love that experiment. Kudos to them. I'm not going to attempt to say his last name[0:26:01] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: correctly. Try. Yeah.[0:26:03] Andrew Huberman: Have you made a mess of it? No. No. I I think you you got it. You were involved in a clinical trial that was published last year Comparing 25 milligrams of, psilocybin to 10 milligrams of psilocybin is a very, to, a A drug called escitalopram?[0:26:24] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Lexapro. Yeah. Lexapro.[0:26:26] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And this 1 milligram over 3 week Dosage. In wanting to discuss the results of that study a bit, and some of the other trials you've done involving psilocybin for depression, the treatment of depression. Could we calibrate ourselves? 25 milligrams of psilocybin is, is that what wouldn't It's gonna be a perceptible dose, presumably, hallucinations and all that.[0:26:51] Andrew Huberman: And is that, what one would find in, I'm guessing here. If I'm accurate, this does not mean that, I have experience here, but, 2 2 grams of of mushrooms.[0:27:01] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Than that, like, we think. Yeah. Sorry. I missed that. No.[0:27:04] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: No. No. I missed that one. Went off on a tangent. But, yeah, 25 milligrams of psilocybin would be we don't know, And and it's important that I say that because I wouldn't want people to hear my answer here and then use it to calibrate their own dosing of mushrooms and get it way off.[0:27:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So it's guesswork, and I would love to see someone do a proper study on it and, you know, look at the psilocybin content in a given mass of psilocybin mushrooms, magic mushrooms. But to my knowledge, that hasn't really been done. Someone like Paul Stamets would, would Give a better answer here, but I I think the percentage within the mushroom mass is some of psilocybin in the mushroom mass And psilocin, which is a metabolite of psilocybin, is something in in the 1% Mhmm. A little bit higher maybe, range.[0:28:04] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So one one gram, 1,000 milligrams of magic mushroom would contain About 10 milligrams of psilocybin. Is that right?[0:28:14] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Broadly speaking. Yeah.[0:28:16] Andrew Huberman: Great. That helps calibrate, and I think, Again, just allows the layperson to understand a bit more of where we're headed with these, psilocybin, trials and and the results. So we don't have to restrict our discussion to just that 1 clinical trial, but, if we include that one and and compare to some of the other trials that you've done, I mean, your laboratory is seeing phenomenal, in my opinion, phenomenal results in the treatment of, otherwise, intractable depression, major depression, which so many people suffer from, from 2, I I suppose there are 2 sessions of using psilocybin in these ranges of 10 to 25 milligrams. Do I have that correct? Yes.[0:29:01] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Could we talk a little bit about what people typically experience during those Sessions that allows this phenomenal transformation of mood and state and trait, as well, and I'm especially interested in whether or not it is the experience during those sessions that is The trigger that's necessary for the the transformation from a depressed to a nondepressed state. Because with the the impulse is to think it is That what one thinks and sees and hallucinates is, and hears is so vital. But, of course, these drugs can create neuro Plasticity changes in our neural wiring, presumably for long periods of time. So what are your thoughts on the the experience itself?[0:29:48] Andrew Huberman: And maybe For those who have not done these compounds before, you could explain a little bit about what's typical for people and what you think is leading to that incredible Positive and pervasive change in mood, state, and trait.[0:30:02] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I would I would say that it's more than impulse that is, leading us To think that the experience is important, it's really data and and converging evidence now. So independent teams, independent Studies are converging on the magnitude of certain kinds of experience Rated, yes, with subjective rating scales is predicting therapeutic outcomes pretty pretty strongly and very reliably. And so that's guiding us. Now could you say, well, maybe those experiences are some kind of epiphenomenon of, say, a central brain action, well, absolutely, but then all experience is an epiphenomenon by that principle, and yet we care about it. You know?[0:30:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And it matters, to us and in our human relations with each other. So I think it does matter to a a human being when they're in a, say, a psilocybin therapy session, and as the drug effects begin to come on and the body starts to feel a little Strange and tingly, and, there's some initial anxiety. And then in their mind's eye, they start to notice patterns and maybe colors, and then maybe those patterns deepen and they're dynamic, And they have this fascinating organic quality.[0:31:29] Andrew Huberman: Are they, patients in your studies typically using A, an eye mask or so they're in the eye mask, so eyes closed.[0:31:37] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[0:31:37] Andrew Huberman: That's why you said mind's eye as opposed to looking out into the[0:31:41] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: that's one of the major differences to psychedelic therapy versus taking a psychedelic because you shut your eyes. You know? And it's a it's a world away from taking a psychedelic, yeah, a a rave or something. You know? In a sense, good luck with that.[0:31:58] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But in psychedelic therapy, yeah, it's it's, you know, settled conditions. There's music playing, and what I'm describing here is very much the default. There's there's actually, You know, very little variability between the different sites that have done this work on these conditions. Typically, it's 2 people. Ideally, mental health professionals, at at least one who's a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist or some other kind of psychotherapist A psychiatric nurse.[0:32:34] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But ideally, 2 who meet those criteria with a individual who's ingested the drug, and music playing throughout, a kind of runway into taking the drug and then throughout, so there's continuity.[0:32:49] Andrew Huberman: Music with lyrics or or without music?[0:32:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Lyrics to begin with, and the music typically is spacious To begin with, and then builds and becomes atmospheric. There might be, I don't know, some tribal drums in the distance or or something as as it develops Well, like the sound of a bird in the distance, you know, a bird's call. And then as it gets into more Stronger drug effects, the music, starts to coax, emotion and very intentionally, you know, strings, for example, would come in. And, It's an inter it would be an interesting experiment and one that we'd love to do, actually, to see whether if you were to pull that out, Whether the the psychedelic experience would be as emotionally intense as as it is in psychedelic therapy when you have music there as a default. And across the board, people should find this remarkable because it kind of is.[0:34:00] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: All of the published studies that are now, you know, having such an impact, on psychiatry and beyond, have music there as a staple component, and we just take it as assumption But it needs to be. I tend to share that assumption, but it's remarkable that it hasn't been tested properly. But it's that and, you know, if you were to run with that And and if you were, you know, had a kind of critical agenda, you would say, well, this is music therapy. You know? Why are you making all this fuss about psychedelics?[0:34:35] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, the it's music that's there in all of these trials with all these fantastic findings. So There is something to that. You know? And, you know, this will tee me up probably to talk about psychedelic therapy being a combination treatment. We have a hyphen between the 2 because I, share the hypothesis, the assumption that should be tested better, There there is a positive interaction between the 2, that there's a synergy between the 2.[0:35:05] Andrew Huberman: That's why it's psychedelic Therapy[0:35:07] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: with[0:35:07] Andrew Huberman: a hyphen, just like cart Hart Harris. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.[0:35:38] Andrew Huberman: Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact Our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to Try athletic greens. You can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, and they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens While you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera, and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:36:19] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's athleticgreens.com Hash Huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d three k two. This is extremely useful to hear because I think most people think, okay, psychedelic whether or not they have experience with psychedelics or not, it's a visual hallucination, some auditory hallucination, some Synesthesia, some visual auditory blending, somatosensation, you know, rubbing a surface and and being able to elicit the, sounds in one's mind, of course, etcetera. But so seldom do we actually hear about the the specifics of these clinical trials in a way that, For instance, points to music as one of the, perhaps, key variables. Now you mentioned that as people enter these psychedelic states, that there's a little bit of initial anxiety. About a year and a half ago, I had a discussion with doctor Matthew Johnson, who's running some psilocybin trials at Johns Hopkins as you know, And he, mentioned, the critical importance, at least in his mind, to This idea of the patient, quote, unquote, letting go or allowing the experience to take them Someplace mentally as opposed to trying to constrain their sensory and cognitive experience.[0:37:38] Andrew Huberman: I'm curious what your reflections are on that on that idea and why it might be so valuable clinically. And this ties back to this earlier discussion we were having about the unconscious or about psychedelics revealing something that's there all the time, but that we don't have access to. You know, it's and, again, I'm I'm struggling to find the right language for this because we don't really have a neural mechanism like, know, top down inhibition or something like that to explain how this, you know, unconscious might be uncorked in the psychedelic experience. But to make it quite simple and direct, How important do you think it really is for the patient to feel like they are, quote, unquote, letting go, And what in the world is letting go in biological terms?[0:38:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think we'll get there in terms of having the neurocoronates of, the mind revealing itself to itself. You know? The, emergence of The unconscious into consciousness or unconscious material into conscious awareness, it's a It's a wonderful challenge.[0:38:49] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's a huge challenge, but it's a challenge to embrace. And letting go Very much is, again, a staple component of how the different teams do this work in terms of encouraging A willingness to let go. And when we started out doing our depression work and and did that first trial, it was the first trial of of a psychedelic in, formally diagnosed depression, you know, where that was the target population, a depressed Population was the 1st modern study to do that. And, we visited Hopkins, our friends there, and and were, mentored on how to do the guiding, Bill Richards, Mary Cosimano. They were just so, brilliant and and, you know, wise in in their, in their guidance to us as to how to do the guiding in our trial.[0:39:55] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And so this phrase of trust, let go, be open, You'll hear a lot. I don't know who fairly it should be attributed to, but I would attribute it to Bill, Bill Richards. Meh. Yeah. Everything's borrowed.[0:40:12] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You probably got it from someone else, but it's such a key principle. It's it's almost like a mantra that you're trying to instill in people trust. Let go. Be open. And those different components where the trust is about therapeutic rapport.[0:40:29] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But again, you know, this goes beyond Just intuition now, we formally measured therapeutic rapport. We do it even with just a Single item, a visual analog scale item, the subjective rating scale item, on the morning of dosing, And we find that it's a it's a significant predictor of the quality of the experience that you have under the drug in in the psychedelic therapy and then the therapeutic outcomes x weeks or months later. It's a very powerful kind of chain of of sort of predictive components there. The trust, Essentially important. And, again, not just intuition, but the data pointing to that.[0:41:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Let go. There's a readiness A readiness to surrender, to let go, to not resist, we do measure that too and see that it's predictive of response. And then the being open is about front to be inquisitive, something that's easier said than done can be terrifying. You know, when you're dealing with a very vulnerable population, it's probably more The rule then the exception that they're carrying some significant adversity, life adversity or frank trauma that they've suffered. And so that message of be open, be willing to confront, and to go there It's really you know, it's really powerful, and that that's how it plays out, and and often there is struggle.[0:42:14] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: There's something going on that is, I don't want to be feeling this. Make it stop. That can be nightmarish at times, but it's very, very strong. And with these big doses that we give, it's, it's very strong. And, actually, a a student, that I've worked with, I think now doing a PhD, Ari Brauer, is working on a fantastic project characterizing the different phases of the psychedelic experience where the early phase is dominated by, negative emotions and and negative, negative eveyanced feelings of anxiety and struggle, and then it's a different story in the latter a half.[0:43:00] Andrew Huberman: Could I ask about that? First of all, I think that's fascinating and important to analyze the different phases. And, again, I'm delighted here because People typically hear about a psychedelic journey, but we never really hear about the the kind of stereotypic components of the beginning, middle, and end of that journey. We know that there's Peak and that there's a kind of a parachuting down and, etcetera. But, when you say that typically there's an anxiety, maybe some Negative valence in the early stage.[0:43:27] Andrew Huberman: Do you mean about the sensations people are experiencing or about some prior event that's being called to mind that they're remembering? Likewise, for the positive phase of the psychedelic, journey or trip, are people do they still call it a trip?[0:43:42] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[0:43:42] Andrew Huberman: Alright. For the, I guess, We'll use Tripp for the psychedelic trip. Are people feeling positive about the experience? Like, like there's been some sort of breakthrough or they're in a In a calmer state, or is it that they tend to be focusing on prior events that were positive? So in other words, Is there a threading through of some, concept that comes to mind for people?[0:44:09] Andrew Huberman: Maybe about an earlier trauma or maybe about a Sense of self or a sense of other forgiveness, you know, it could be any of these things. But, what do we know about the kind of finer details of all that?[0:44:19] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I would say the initial, struggle is more against the general drug effects than pinning it on on something specific. It's more that, you know, normal waking consciousness, we have a sense, generally speaking, if we're well or well enough, A sense of assuredness about what's what. You know? Is the table here and and so on. And, and and we have that assuredness in To an extent about ourselves as well, it might be illusory, but we have it.[0:44:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And what the drug's doing is it's breaking down all of that, and it's scary as hell. You know? And if it's a big dose, it's just like human nature to be to, you know, rage against that a bit, And a bit like dying. You know? I don't want this.[0:45:07] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It feels like I could be dying.[0:45:10] Andrew Huberman: I might lose my mind.[0:45:11] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. That[0:45:12] Andrew Huberman: too. Never come back.[0:45:13] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: 2 of the classics says, oh, but I might, you know, I might know that I've taken a psychedelic, and I might even know a a bit about psychedelics, but I still Fear that I'm gonna go mad, or that I know they you know, generally speaking, these drugs Don't have a high, you know, fertility, risk. I still think I'm gonna die. You know? And it's just it's very palpable, and that and that comes up. So, Yeah.[0:45:49] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: That's that I mean, those are the core fears that, those 2, and very reliably that comes up. And it's really, like, a basic drug action. It's dose dependent, but it's a basic drug action that is forcing something about the nature of the mind and the way it's made up That makes it feel that way. Oh, but it feels like I'm losing my mind, or it feels like I could lose my mind, or that I could go insane, Or that maybe I'm I'm dying here, and this is bad. Yeah.[0:46:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You've talked many times before and have done really wonderful work Looking at the changes in communication between different brain areas while under while people are under the influence of psychedelics, I think the gestalt of those data, correct me if I'm wrong, is that, compared to the nonpsychedelic state that under psychedelic influence, there is far more, let's just call it, interconnectivity or communication, between a brain areas that typically aren't communicating, which probably It's not surprising to people given the the, subjective effects of these of these drugs. What is the evidence that After the psychedelic journey is over, that some or perhaps all of that enhanced communication across brain areas is maintained. And if so, what role do you feel that could play in these incredible positive therapeutic outcomes?[0:47:13] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. So we we've had Some recent findings in in that direction where, yes, it's true. And, you know, the, A picture that says a 1000 words that some people might be familiar with are these 2 circles, A project that we did in collaboration with some researchers where, ordinarily, the communication is going on, within systems, like, other regions of the visual system will be speaking mostly within The visual system, there'll be a kind of cliquish cliquishness or a modularity to the quality of the communication in the brain. And then the cool finding with psilocybin was the first, paper is the the communication. Yes.[0:48:04] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It sort of transcends these modules and becomes much more intermodular, Crossing different, modalities, and that effect correlated with the magnitude of the subjective effects, and then we replicated it with LSD using different methods. And, new paper will come out soon with DMT showing, a similar effect. It's a bit of a debate about what Regions are most implicated, but the general effect of an increase in global functional connectivity is what we call it, or global communication in the brain.[0:48:37] Andrew Huberman: And this is while under the influence[0:48:39] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: of the drug.[0:48:40] Andrew Huberman: Putting people into a brain scanner while they are under the influence of the drug. Is that right? Yes. That itself must be quite an experience given that these scanners are small tubes. You're in a bite bar.[0:48:52] Andrew Huberman: You got a bite bar in your mouth. That's a, quite a quite a study.[0:48:56] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You don't always have a bite bar, at least with the psychedelics. But, yeah, you gotta keep your head still. And, and you have the loud, MR scanner noise going. But because it's regular, There aren't too many surprises, so it's actually surprisingly tolerable.[0:49:15] Andrew Huberman: And you're in a hospital setting, so you're not worried about what would happen if you had a cardiac event. No.[0:49:19] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You got Professionals around and, you know, most people generally tolerate that setting quite well, surprisingly well. But, Yeah. We do all that, and and, yes, we do see that, opening up of the communication across systems in the brain. And, it does speak to kind of intuition about the subjective experience that, you know, different Modalities might be blending with each other.[0:49:45] Andrew Huberman: Is sorry for interrupting, but I have to ask, is it thought that the Activation of the serotonin 2 a receptor is what's responsible for the increased communication between brain areas that Under normal circumstances would not be communicated?[0:50:00] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yes. So there's a few reasons why some modeling work that computational modeling work That first identifies where the 2 a receptor is and then looks at, models its basic effect on neural activity, We'll recapitulate the the or, recreate the effect that we see actually in the data with The scanning. So doing the computational modeling, you can see the same effect by knowing, whether to where the The key receptors are and then making them do a certain thing that we know psychedelics do.[0:50:37] Andrew Huberman: I can imagine 2 possibilities, and I I think it's important to distinguish between these 2. One possibility is that the activation of this serotonin to a receptor leads to increased connectivity And thereby, auditory and visual hallucinations emerge, changed patterns of thinking emerge, etcetera. That's sort of the obvious interpretation, but, the scientist in me has to ask, is it possible that All of that increased connectivity is occurring, and yet that is a distinct phenomenon layered on top of some other effect of the psychedelic drugs impacting Access to the to the unconscious, hallucinations. In other words, is it the increased connectivity that's Leading to the subjective experience, or are those 2 things happening in parallel?[0:51:26] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, they happen in parallel, and they map to each other. But the question of causality, what causes what, is the tricky thing where I I would Suggest that the the the causality is circular, that they influence each other. And, this gets a bit philosophical, but It kinda matters because otherwise, you know, there's a trap that it's easy to fall into, where you're thinking that it's all about the brain action causing the subject of experience, and that's typically what we do in cognitive neuroscience. It's kind of like the sort of first port of call kind of materialist, approach. One can be a materialist, essentially, but still appreciate that circular causality that mind also interacts with brain.[0:52:20] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And it's so hard to pick the 2 apart, and there is a kind of essential dualism where subjective experience is a thing in and of itself, But that's not to divorce it from what's going on on the biological level.[0:52:33] Andrew Huberman: The re the reason I ask is because, As I understand it, nowadays, there's a bit of a movement within the scientific community that studies psychedelics to develop Drugs that can essentially cure or alleviate many of the symptoms of depression or trauma that are built off our understanding of how psychedelics like psilocybin and here, I'll throw MDMA in there. Although classically not a psychedelic, it kinda gets lumped in. We can get back to that later, but that do not produce hallucinations or massive changes in subjective experience. Actually, I think this is what initially got us into conversation on Twitter as I had learned about this paper published out of a group at UC Davis That essentially modifying psychedelics so that they have potential therapeutic application for the treatment of depression, but zero Hallucinogenic properties.[0:53:29] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[0:53:29] Andrew Huberman: And I thought, wow. This is going to be a very controversial thing in the world. Right? Because the history of psychedelics, as you pointed out, has been one of people accessing different modes of thinking, feeling, seeing things, these in Letting go, trust, etcetera, a therapeutic relationship. And here we have, I don't wanna say pharma because it's not really pharma, but we have laboratories who are trying to, tees apart the activation of receptors independent of all that subjective experience in order to essentially treat the same conditions.[0:54:00] Andrew Huberman: I'd love for you to comment on this, where you think it might be going, and, you know, whether or not you think that's the right or the wrong approach, if it has any validity at all.[0:54:11] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It is pharma. It's just smaller pharma, sort of start up pharma.[0:54:14] Andrew Huberman: But Okay. So because pharma would like to have drugs that can cure depression, but don't make people hallucinate. Is that[0:54:19] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Oh, they would, and patients might, and the system would love it because the system is used to it. It's medicine.[0:54:27] Andrew Huberman: Right? And it doesn't give this this, mental imagery of, you know, the summer of love in San Francisco or of of, you know, kaleidoscope eyes. Right? It's it's more, you could imagine the, more to be careful with my wording here. Those who would not be inclined toward that would might might embrace a therapeutic that that is strictly effective at treating depression with no hallucinations.[0:54:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. And it doesn't look like, you know, an individual lying on a sofa crying their out eyes out, About, you know, the life that they've lived, and that deep catharsis being life transforming, Very different from that model. I'm skeptical of it, I for a few reasons. And one is that I I can't see the logic. I can't see the pieces fit in a way that's compelling.[0:55:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And I'm also skeptical because I think it could easily be wishful thinking because of that point that Patients would like it, and the system would like it. And I just you can't you gotta bear that in mind as well. So wouldn't it be convenient, you know, if it were true and you could get the therapeutic action without the psychedelic effects?[0:55:57] Andrew Huberman: On a way, that's a little bit of what microdosing seems to be designed to do. Like you said, take dosages there below that that, perceptual or, You know, awareness of some effect threshold over a longer period of time in an attempt to ping the circuits or twist, you know, alter the circuits, but not hallucinate[0:56:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[0:56:16] Andrew Huberman: Not have a catharsis.[0:56:17] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So if if microdosing can do that And it's subperceptible that microdosing isn't psychedelic action because where's the psychedelic action? When psychedelic, when defined, means psyche revealing, you're not getting that effect. You might be getting the pharmacology. You might be getting some direct Serotonin to a receptor agonism that could be driving a therapeutic response, but you can get that with SSRIs as well. You know?[0:56:46] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And so my point is, what's what's new? Okay. Maybe it's a bit new, and people are now developing direct two way Agonists rather than indirect through a serotonin releaser like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, The SSRIs like Lexapro. You know?[0:57:03] Andrew Huberman: Are there any SSRIs that selectively agonize, which folks, by the way, means Activate in a good way. Ag agony sounds terrible to be those noninformed might think that mean a disrupt, but that can activate The serotonin 2 a receptor, are there any drugs that will do that that are not psychedelic? I'm not aware of any, but then again, I'm not a second from the college.[0:57:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: There are. Paul I mean, are there any that are are licensed and used as medicines in psychiatry? I actually had this debate, Recently on social media, and I couldn't see, I couldn't see a compelling example. I saw 2 a agonists that were used for other things. You have a compound like Glyceride used in in treating Parkinson's, but, actually, it's more of a dopamine agonist.[0:57:53] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Right.[0:57:53] Andrew Huberman: So they're always hitting other things. Right?[0:57:55] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah.[0:57:55] Andrew Huberman: Said tapping other[0:57:56] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: neurodegenerative neurodegenerative through other things. So is there a is there a selective serotonin to a receptor stimulator, an agonist, that it isn't psychedelic, that it's therapeutic in psychiatry, and the answer firmly is no. I haven't seen it yet. Will they develop 1? Well, for patient's sake, I hope so, because it would be great.[0:58:18] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Let's wait and see. If they do, I doubt it will be psychedelic, and I doubt it would have much to do with psychedelic therapy. And it would be much more like the system we're used to of chronic pharmacotherapy, take your drug every day. Let's let's hope they find it and it works for patient's sake. But as things stand right now, I'm a little skeptical.[0:58:46] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Now some of the findings that are being seen that are really exciting, fantastic work being done showing things like Increases in the communication components of neurons, dendritic growth, Spine growth, synaptic spine growth.[0:59:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. By the way, folks, just I'll interrupt for the not necessarily spine, The bone you know, the not the cerebral, column, but, spines are these little, like, little tiny twigs with bulbs on the end of of neurons that are allow for communication points between neurons. So neuroplasticity is often associated with growth of dendrites and spines and so Worth, which is what what Robin's referring to. That that reminds me, and I just wanna make sure that, we close the hatch on the earlier answer because I interrupted you, is the increased connectivity Between or communication between brain areas that's observed while people are under the influence of the psychedelic, Also observed later after the effects of the drug wear off.[0:59:46] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[0:59:46] Andrew Huberman: And then I'll just throw in another question there because we're on to this topic now. To what extent Do we think that neuroplasticity, structural changes in neurons, functional changes in neurons are responsible for that? And how long does that last? Let's say I take let's say I come into your clinic. I'm a I mean, subject in your experiment, I take Come in in the morning, I do my psychedelic journey.[1:00:09] Andrew Huberman: 5 or 6 hours later, I'm parachuting back to reality, as we call it, And then I go home, increased connectivity lasts for how long, and how long are the structural brain changes occurring?[1:00:23] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, you're asking fantastic questions, and and partly because we don't have the answer yet. But we do have some We do have some data, and so we have looked to, first of all, the in a sense, the function plasticity or what we assume it to be or at least the functional Changes, the increase in communication across systems, that increase in global connectivity, functional connectivity. Do we see it after the trip? We know we see it during the trip, pretty well replicated, correlating with intense drug effects. Do we see it after the trip?[1:00:56] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, the answer is we've seen it in 2 different depression cohorts, psilocybin therapy for depression. In one study where we looked the next day, we saw it, a kind of residual, Effect similar to what you see acutely being seen the next day. And then in a subsequent study, we saw it also 3 weeks later. So we've seen it in 2 independent datasets. This decrease in modularity is How we measure it, it's the same thing.[1:01:30] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Essentially, broadly speaking, it's the same thing, an increase in global connectivity, functional connectivity. And, actually, unpublished, we've seen it in healthy volunteers on a correlational level, not on an absolute change level, but if you look at Its relationship to a mental health outcome, and this is an important thing to stress with the depression work. We saw a relationship between the magnitude of that change, the decrease in modularity or increasing global connectivity and the improvement in symptom severity.[1:02:04] Andrew Huberman: So interesting. Yeah. I mean, what I and just to state it a different way. So, what Robin's referring to is when you say modularity. As neuroscientists, we think of the The different modular networks of the brain that you know, the eye talks to a region of the thalamus involved in vision, which talks to the visual cortex, which, You know, eventually, it converges with with auditory information, of course, but there's a separation or modularity of function.[1:02:29] Andrew Huberman: This increased connectivity is cross modular in during the trip, but afterwards as well. And you're saying that that correlates very strongly with the strength of the therapeutic outcome for depression. I mean, the the logical extension of that is that Extreme modularity of brain function is, depressive in some way. Now we don't wanna go too far, but what does that mean, That increasing crosstalk, between different modules of the brain is so strongly correlated with a positive therapeutic outcome.[1:03:03] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: We don't know other than as a relationship. I mean, this is this is the thing, and we need to be a little careful not to run with it too far. I mean, there's some things that it suggests. I think it suggests a more flexible mode of brain functioning. If you're not getting stuck in modules or the modules aren't, Excessively cut off from each other.[1:03:31] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But you see different things with with different presentations. If you were to look at cognition, Sharper cognition is actually associated with more modularity. So it it's a rule that's a little slippery, and we need to be careful with it.[1:03:45] Andrew Huberman: I I I just, again, I'll forgive me for interrupting, but I think of I have friends who are, I would say, are on the spectrum, who are, very linear in their thinking and extremely intelligent in a in the kind of classic sense of being able to Ratchet through hard problems to arrive at a solution. And then I have friends who are, let's just call them what they are, from the creative communities outside of science that, are very expansive. They see connections between many different things, but you sometimes you have to not all of them, but you have to catch their ideas with a butterfly net. And oftentimes, what they're saying doesn't sometimes it just doesn't make any sense. Now they also produce incredible creative works, But to have a conversation with them is anything but a linear experience.[1:04:32] Andrew Huberman: They're not random thought generators, but there's a Nonlinearity or randomness to their processing that's distinct from these other folks that I'm describing as on the spectrum. And, of course, it's a spectrum. There's some a a whole range in between. Yeah. Sounds to me like there is some therapeutic value to being able to move along this continuum From the more linear to the nonlinear.[1:04:55] Andrew Huberman: Is that is that[1:04:57] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: correct? I'm yeah. You're it's resonating what you're saying. It's speaking to my intuition that, You know, you could be very parsey, you know, passing things up, chopping things up like an analytical scientist. Like, I'm doing[1:05:11] Andrew Huberman: a splitter, as we say in science. You're either a lumper or a splitter.[1:05:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yep. Well, you know, the way I'm being very particular about what What when to call something psychedelic? You know? That that kind of parsy analytical way of thinking you would you might associate with a more modular system. You know?[1:05:29] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Whereas the system that's more globally interconnected and open, yeah, might be more flexible and creative and divergent in the associations and so on. So, yes, that's speaking to my intuition to how you you're describing it. And I imagine If you take severe psychopathology, severe mental illness, like a depression, I've always thought that there's something intuitive about the term itself, Like a depression in a landscape, you know, which is a whole Physical depression. A physical depression that it's easy to fall into. And if you do, it's hard to get out of.[1:06:04] Andrew Huberman: So almost, if I understand what you're saying correctly, almost like getting, stuck at one location on this continuum because most people Don't reside at 1 or extreme 1 extreme or the other full time and kinda migrate back and forth between expansive states and more linear states.[1:06:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Like like you do with low mood. You know? If you're healthy in inverted commas, you can feel your low mood, your disappointment, but you can spring back.[1:06:29] Andrew Huberman: But someone with know you can spring back.[1:06:31] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[1:06:32] Andrew Huberman: Right. Whereas the suicidal depressive person or suicidally depressed person, Somehow, at least in my understanding, there there's something about the extreme depressive states and extreme Extreme anxiety states, something my laboratory is a bit more familiar with anxiety, which alters the perception of time such that people feel like that Negative state is going to go on forever or that if it goes away, that it's going to return At random.[1:07:06] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[1:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Kind of a vulnerability to the time domain.[1:07:09] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. That's it. And it it's so tragic, but that that Cognitive bias in depression that it everything's hopeless and and that there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah.[1:07:20] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So, you know, if you were to get stuck in that rut and have that bias, then you're cut off From other things, other sensory, modalities or modules, you know, cut off from the world, cut off from other people, Stuck in your inner rut. And, so, yes, I think we're sharing this intuition that a a decrease in modularity or an opening up of the The system, the brain, could relate to an opening up of the mind that is kind of enduring after the after the psychedelic, dosing session. And yeah. And and the 3rd replication was to see in healthies an improvement in well-being because they're Healthy, we don't look at depression.[1:08:04] Andrew Huberman: So these are people that are healthy walking into the trial? Yeah. Take psilocybin twice?[1:08:09] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, actually, they do, But the first dose is 1 milligram, which they they don't feel. It's a placebo dose.[1:08:16] Andrew Huberman: Quote, micro.[1:08:17] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. We have sticky G on their heads, to measure their brainwaves, during each dose, and 1 milligram, you see no change.[1:08:27] Andrew Huberman: So we I think that you microdosers. No. I'm just kidding. I mean, I think again for microdoses. I've always just been a little bit skeptical based on my conversations with the The scientists actually doing the work was Yeah.[1:08:37] Andrew Huberman: With, with, psychedelics, it seems like the the answer keeps coming back. Do to to 1 or 2, maybe 3, macrodoses in a controlled safe setting.[1:08:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, that's compelling. The evidence for that is compelling, and, that's what's making all the difference right now. And microdosing is just appealing, but, again, you know, science isn't About what we want to believe, it's about what's actually coming through and what seems to hold up, you know, to testing.[1:09:13] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors, which is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now Salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular, to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. And we now know that Even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.[1:09:46] Andrew Huberman: Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. Typically drink LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes, and while I do any kind of physical training and after Physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot. And, certainly, I drink LMNT in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna because that causes quite a lot of If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element, that's l m n t.com/huberman, to claim a free LMNT sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element l m n t.com/huberman.[1:10:26] Andrew Huberman: Would you say that's right? The 1 or 2 or 3 sessions, and how how far apart are those typically spaced in time?[1:10:33] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Typically, 1, 2, 3 weeks, across the sites is the way people are doing the the psychedelic therapy dicing sessions. Two sessions, you know, Hopkins Imperial, NYU. That that's, been a kind of default 2. We we actually use 3 in a current anorexia trial, psilocybin therapy for anorexia.[1:10:57] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: 2 patients left to to To see after, 19 who've gone through the trial, very exciting results there.[1:11:07] Andrew Huberman: You're seeing a alleviation of the The obsessive thought about food in a willingness to consume Like, even healthier amounts of food.[1:11:14] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Even improved The wait, the long follow-up.[1:11:18] Andrew Huberman: So So critical. I when we did an episode on eating disorders, and I learned that, anorexia nervosa, which by the way, folks, the rates of are not increasing. It's been pretty stable through time Despite what's said about social media and, etcetera, but, anorexia nervosa being the most deadly of all psychiatric illnesses, which is a big statement because, you know, manic depression, so called bipolar depression, has a 20 to 30 times the the typical Suicide rate, basically, many anorexic people with anorexia, I think, is how it's now, is what one says, not, anorexics, but people with anorexia, often die. Many of them die.[1:12:02] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. So tragic. So often young people as well, And similarly with suicide in terms of premature death. So the tragedy with psychiatry is is so strong, and and, so it's It's so rewarding to be doing that trial and to be seeing good results. I have to check myself a little bit that, I'm I'm reporting on it in this really promissory way, and, the trial isn't yet publicly released and and published.[1:12:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So, it's still ongoing as well.[1:12:34] Andrew Huberman: But that was 3 3 sessions?[1:12:36] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It is 3 sessions, and I can't say what the dosage is because we still have, There is a blinding component, but there are 3 dosing sessions in there. Let's see now. I think they're 2 weeks apart, And we do the follow-up. Yes.[1:12:55] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to, you know, Close out this, description of the of the journey and the trip by extending past the day when, people actually take the drug into this, what I've Heard described as the integration phase. You know, you have to reintegrate. Right? I mean, all this all this increased connectivity during the session, hallucinations, insights, Anxiety, letting go, maybe revelation, maybe epiphany. Okay.[1:13:21] Andrew Huberman: Great. At what point Is that consolidated? Meaning, are these patients or subjects in studies Having daily conversation with their therapist, are they journaling every day? And, you know, I wanna keep in mind that Most people are not going to be part of a clinical trial. And, of course, here, we're not suggesting what people do or not do, but let's just put it this way.[1:13:46] Andrew Huberman: Were people to, you, psychedelics. What is the way that people can maximize on the neuroplasticity and the brain changes in a positive way in the days weeks afterwards. In other words, how long does this so called integration last? And, you know, What how far can we take this? I mean, I could imagine that, how often one chooses to think about the insights could also have an impact.[1:14:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right? Because, clearly, people went to raves. Clearly, people did psychedelics in the sixties. But we don't have data on those people.[1:14:25] Andrew Huberman: You have access to the understanding of how they're spending their time and the therapeutic outcomes, which We haven't gotten to the numbers yet, but, again, are are incredibly impressive. You know, in upwards of as I understand it, 60% or more People getting, relief from depression.[1:14:41] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. 70.[1:14:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. 70%. Incredible, especially when compared to the typical Antidepressant treatments and and so on. So what is this business of integration? How is it done Properly.[1:14:55] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Gosh. Well, how long does it last as well? A lifetime.[1:15:01] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You know, Life is a journey, like a trip is a a journey, and there's always work to do. You know? As Jack Kornfield says after the ecstasy, the see the laundry. I love that. Yeah.[1:15:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Uh-huh. Yeah. There's there will be other good ones as well. I forget them. But, yeah.[1:15:21] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So the work's ongoing, and and and, the yeah. But this gives you a foot up. It enables people to, do the work more easily, and and that's True. The classic psychedelics is also true, very true of MDMA therapy, for post traumatic stress disorder. It's really giving you a leg up, making it easier to do very, very difficult work going back to a trauma, trying to digest it, process it, Integrate it.[1:15:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So it's it's such an essential component of the treatment model, But one has to be realistic as well. So, you know, by saying our integration lasts a lifetime, well, people delivering a service can't Be there for a lifetime. So, what's the answer there? And, people are Wrestling with that issue right now, and I I think one of the solutions might be that it it's in a sense on you, to a point. You know?[1:16:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The therapeutic team can treat you to a point, and then it becomes what you might call practice. In a similar way, that meditation is a practice. It's something that you have to keep up, and if it slips, then things could slip, and and that's the way it is. Or you have a, another psychedelic treatment. You know?[1:16:52] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So people have even used this term of practice in relation to psychedelics where there's a psychedelic practice. Like, there's, You know, a meditation practice. But I I'm using meditation, intentionally here because I actually think that, Meditative practice, spiritual practice, elements of spiritual practice Could be a very important complement to psychedelic therapy. And I think it's probably doing something similar In terms of promoting an ability to sit with, a Former colleague of mine said it quite well in relation to psychedelic therapy versus chronic pharmacotherapy or, like, SSRIs being on them all the time. So psychedelic therapy allows you to sit with rather than sit on, and I thought that's quite good.[1:17:48] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. So, you know, the meditation, the mindfulness, the ability to, Yes. Be present centered, but also present centered and accepting. So if things come up, you can watch process and then let go.[1:18:06] Andrew Huberman: That holy grail of of mindfulness.[1:18:09] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[1:18:10] Andrew Huberman: You know? You know, awareness without reactivity, respond you know, I I grew up in the Bay Area, and you'd hear this language. Right? And I'm not being disparaging this. I have friends that Or on the board of Esalen and worked down there, you know, and I've gone there, and it's you know?[1:18:26] Andrew Huberman: And yet you hear these terms. Right? Be responsive, not reactive, Which to a neuroscientist is, like, grates on me, which probably just means I have issues, but, and surely, I do. But, you know, it looks like, what does that mean? Right?[1:18:40] Andrew Huberman: It's sort of saying, like, oh, to be the observer, but not be drawn into the experience. You know? And and, again, I don't wanna be overly reductionist, but what what I find so compelling About the emerging data, because it really is data, on psychedelics as treatments For depression and trauma, namely psilocybin and MDMA, is that it really seems to allow people this space that that is so commonly thrown around, you know, giving space between stimulus and reaction. I mean, Viktor Frankl talked about this, but, you know, it's I've been reading a wonderful book called the prince of medicine, good good dates to The Origins of Medicine, very dense book. People have been talking about this stuff and thinking about this stuff for 1000 of years.[1:19:21] Andrew Huberman: Psychedelics seem to give people access to that better version of self, which is remarkable. What's also remarkable, it's Perhaps worth pointing out is that 5 years ago, I never would have been comfortable having this conversation. I would have been afraid to lose my job. Stanford Magazine this week Just published an entire issue about psychedelics with how ketamine works, MDMA, psilocybin, with the appropriate cautionary notes in there, but, clearly, times are Changing. Speaking of which, I know you're doing a trial on first time use of psychedelics.[1:19:57] Andrew Huberman: What inspired that, and what are you observing? And as you tell us that, please give us, a few of the the key contours. What's the dose? How old are these subjects? I'm assuming it's men and women.[1:20:12] Andrew Huberman: Are they suffering from depression or not? Like, kinda what what's the landscape of that study? And I I I realize this is still early days of the study or maybe it's close to completion. It's not yet published, however. Correct?[1:20:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's not it's not published. It's not submitted. It is completed. So this was one of another one of our COVID studies in a sense.[1:20:28] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:20:29] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Meaning COVID hit, and we had to finish the study, And it was hard to finish the study because of COVID. That was true about psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram. Lexapro trial, which is published, New England Journal of Medicine, but the[1:20:44] Andrew Huberman: This was 20 that paper, by the way, folks will provide a link to in the show note captions as well as some of Robin's other, papers. I think the 2022 New England Journal paper is really fabulous, given its The different dosages and the comparison to essentially what is microdosing and the comparison to citalopram. Mhmm.[1:21:03] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. That's interesting that you you link The way we gave small doses of psilocybin to microdosing, we didn't think of it that way. We thought it was just a, a necessary placebo For the big big dose, the 25 milligrams that yeah. And so that we could say to everyone we're giving you psilocybin and not be lying. Yeah.[1:21:24] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: For those who got escitalopram, Lexapro for 6 weeks, they they got a very, very low dose of psilocybin,[1:21:30] Andrew Huberman: but[1:21:30] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: it allowed us to standardize all the psychotherapy and so on. But the the other study that you're referring to, was in healthies healthy volunteers. Middle aged, Average age, I think, was 40, so not your typical student study that, is so often the case in psychology research. You know? All all the undergrads end up volunteering for your study.[1:21:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So this is, more more of an age range, and, also, I think it was an equal proportion of Male and female. All the staff actually were female, which the staff were very proud of. And[1:22:06] Andrew Huberman: Although it produces its own potential confound, right, To have, all one one sex of of of staff.[1:22:14] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Possibly. Yeah. They did a good job in the sense that, We saw significant improvements in well-being at the end of the trial. So let me describe the design. It was a repeated measures design, meaning people come in, you collect your baseline data, and do a brain scan, And you give people, a placebo.[1:22:36] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: We gave people a placebo. And, actually, let me rewind a little bit. Everyone's healthy volunteers, There's middle age never taken a psychedelic in their life. None of them. Entirely, you know, fresh, virgin people Coming in, and, and the plan is to give them their 1st ever psychedelic experience.[1:22:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So that's what we did in this study. But to do it, we have this repeated measures design where they'll first get a placebo. And we have the placebo so that we can Do all the procedures, all the therapy, all the music listening, but not give a whopping dose of psilocybin. We, again, we gave them a placebo dose psilocybin, 1 milligram. We stick e g, headsets on during the experience to record the brain activity, from the scalp, the oscillating electrical activity.[1:23:25] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And we do the MRI scanning Before and after to see deeper into the brain, and we can look at the functional connectivity that we were referring to earlier and also properties of brain anatomy, which we did in this study. So the the short story is that all of the changes that we saw Both psychologically and neurobiologically were seen with the 25 milligrams. It all happened with that big whopping dose. And what did we see? Well, we did see significant improvements in psychological well-being.[1:24:01] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: We saw What I call the in tropic brain effect, which is actually formally quite accurate, we see an increase in the informational complexity of Ongoing brain activity recorded with EEG on the dose of psilocybin. The activity becomes more complex. It's harder to predict across time. It's more informationally rich, and that effect correlates as it does very reliably with the magnitude of the subject effect. So the bigger the trip, the bigger the syntropic brain effect, now pretty well replicated finding.[1:24:40] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But then the m r the MRI, seeing deep into the brain was probably our most exciting result where We didn't just see some functional brain changes, but we've seen some anatomical brain changes as well. And we used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging that looks at the cabling of the brain, the white matter tracks. And we saw a change in major tracks, so we we sort of limited our search space to really thick tracts, really thick fibers. And the fibers that came through as changing were ones that traveled Between the prefrontal cortex and and the thalamus and the striatum, there were 2 tracks, 2 prefrontal tracks that changed, and they changed in the direction of a decrease in axial diffusivity, which, Could be interpreted as tract integrity, where a decrease would be an increase in tract integrity. It is something that you see in the developing brain.[1:25:47] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The axial diffusivity decreases as a brain goes from being a baby To being a adult, axial diffusivity goes down. And then in aging and pathologies of aging, axial diffusivity goes up.[1:26:03] Andrew Huberman: So this is in the opposite direction of of the results you talked about earlier in terms of brain connectivity of A sort of increased communication across areas, if I understand correctly, and I'm perfectly happy to be wrong, by the way, that this decrease in axial, diffusivity is translates to a higher fidelity of communication between the prefrontal cortex And the thalamus and striatum as opposed to less. And your description of this is somewhat like the the, transition from babyhood And childhood to adulthood, speaks to the same where we know that there's a massive calling of connections as opposed to growth of connections. So in other words, as we get older, we get better at doing certain things and less good at doing potentially most everything else. Is that right?[1:26:52] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Ish because the the change was anatomical, and not functional. So the other stuff was is really measuring Communication in in the brain by looking at how the activity fluctuates across time and whether those Fluctuations in activity are synchronous between regions. And if they are, we say they're functionally connected, and we infer that they're talking to each other because they go Up and down in synchrony. But when it comes to the anatomy, we're talking about the just static, you know, material stuff. And, so we're seeing the fibers in a property of the fibers change.[1:27:37] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: At least that's what we think. And recently, we had an independent person come in and reanalyze the data because, you know, one of those things, incredible Finding requires, you know, credible Mhmm. Evidence, really strong evidence. And and And I would say the evidence at the moment is one study, so we need to be cautious on that. But we did reanalyze it and use this, correction Procedure free water correction to be more sure that it was a change in in the actual microstructure rather than something to do with the ex extracellular space, the the water surrounding the fibers, and it came through.[1:28:19] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: In fact, the The change was strengthened by doing this correction step.[1:28:23] Andrew Huberman: So these are are this is neuroplasticity as the consequence of one 1st time session with 25 milligrams of psilocybin.[1:28:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. So we're excited, and and the 2 the 2 different, know, the 2nd analyst coming in, wasn't sure she believed it, and then she, you know, thought this correction technique might kinda kill the result, and then it came through. And And she's like, okay. Now I'm excited too.[1:28:49] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So we'll see. We don't know what it means. What what does it mean functionally? We don't know. How did the people change?[1:28:56] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, psychologically, as I said, well-being improved. We did look at their cognition. We used a a cognitive flexibility paradigm that looks at people's ability to notice a rule change and then flexibly adapt Their behavior based on noticing this rule change, and people improved after the 25 milligrams and didn't significantly improve after the placebo dose. There weren't correlations with the the DTI change, the the cabling change, and the psychological outcomes. But, You know, with these studies in smaller sample sizes, you don't always see those correlations come through.[1:29:38] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So it's something. We don't know what it means, but It's it's a change in brain anatomy that's in the opposite direction to what you see in An aging brain or with pathology of aging, and it's what you see in a healthy brain as it goes from, you know, normal neurodevelopment into adulthood.[1:29:59] Andrew Huberman: Very, very exciting and intriguing, and I appreciate that you highlighted that it's just 1 study. Although from everything you said, it sounds like it's been done with immense rigor, so We will eagerly await the publication of that study and, so we can peruse all the data and and the subsequent studies. I want to hear a bit about the Study that you have been carrying out on the use of psilocybin for the treatment of fibromyalgia. I'm intrigued by fibromyalgia, because because I have a good friend who also I won't reveal who it is. And and, no, it's not me.[1:30:32] Andrew Huberman: This isn't the I have a friend thing who also is a scientist who's, sits at a fairly high position in the National Institutes of Health who, quietly has expressed to me that They are incredibly frustrated with the fact that, the standard medical community has largely ignored fibromyalgia, and that for many years, it was kind of lumped with things like chronic fatigue syndrome and other, so called, again, so called I'm not saying this, but People often refer to these as, oh, it's psychosomatic that's all in your head, which as a neuroscientist, is a ridiculous statement to hear because it's all in your head. Your brain is in your head. After all, your physiology and Your psychology are influencing each other, of course, and and the the world is starting to appreciate that more. But first of all, maybe you could tell people what fibromyalgia is. What inspired you to do a study on fibromyalgia using psilocybin of all things, because that's surprising to me.[1:31:30] Andrew Huberman: And, if you are allowed to or if you have access to the data In mind, share with us a little bit about what you're discovering in that in that study.[1:31:40] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Sure. Yeah. Happy to. So, again, it's psilocybin therapy, And the population is fibromyalgia syndrome. So this is people presenting with a generalized chronic pain.[1:31:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So unlike some other pain disorders where the pain is focused, you can say it's my lower back, which is very common, Chronic lower back pain. This is more generalized. And it and for that reason, it's hard to Sort of know what it is, and and that's why it's been a controversial space in medicine, and it's been yeah. It's had that charge thrown at it that maybe it's psychosomatic. And just to your point, is anything ever, you know, Independent of of the mind anyway.[1:32:25] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But this is actually a fascinating space for how, In a subjective experience, lived experience, and the mind can influence the body because there's some really interesting literature around The etiology, like, the how the pain has come about. In a sense, like, what caused the pain? What's the story there? And ahead of the trial, I would say to my colleagues, let's just be careful Because there is some fascinating literature around things like, a background of trauma and, How, it that can relate to issues related to inflammation and how that can express into things like Fibromyalgia syndrome. I just said, be very careful there because if you go in with an assumption that there's some buried trauma, for example, then there's that whole Other side of psychoanalysis that massively tripped it up around false memory and so on, and so please don't hold Prior assumptions that you're gonna uncover, buried trauma in every case.[1:33:36] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Now the team have treated, I think, 8 People, and it's going it is going very well. Again, I just wanna Be careful with how I describe it to mat you know, to manage expectations and not get too carried away. But, I check-in with the team every week, and, they're still based in London doing the work. And, it's remarkable what I hear about the profound Experiences that people have under the drug. In this study, we only give 1 dose.[1:34:13] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's a very mechanistic study. We actually have the EG cap on In the sessions, like in the healthy volunteer study, but this time now taking into a clinical population.[1:34:25] Andrew Huberman: And, So they're in the eye they're they are wearing an eye mask under the influence of 25 milligrams of psilocybin. Most of them probably have not done psilocybin before, so it's a little bit like the first time study in some sense. They have Fibromyalgia that's debilitating in some way. They they don't they want they don't want it, obviously. And during the session, Are they thinking about their pain?[1:34:55] Andrew Huberman: Are they being told to think about their pain?[1:34:57] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: They're not being told to think about the pain. In in fact, As I understand it, while there is a therapeutic model around acceptance of the pain, it isn't Un unlike some of the PTSD work, you aren't encouraging them to focus on, you know, the index trauma And then, you know, work through it and try and digest it. We don't we don't do that with the pain. So the pain's there, But there isn't an invitation to focus on it. And that's probably one of the differences with classic psychedelic therapy versus MDMA therapy.[1:35:33] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Arguably, MDMA therapy is more like it's a bit closer to traditional talk therapy where there is more dialogue. People are able to talk on MDMA.[1:35:45] Andrew Huberman: In the MDMA trials, do you, know whether or not they used eye masks, or because this seems to be an important distinction between, as you describe, the therapeutic trip versus the trip that one does know, going into the woods and taking, you know, taking psilocybin in the woods or at a party or While staring at a poster or or a or a leaf. Again, I'm not trying to trivialize those experiences. I mean, obviously, they can be profound, but, so I'm told. But, the MDMA trials seem to involve, as you said, more more directed, dialogue, and sometimes even kind of empathic connection between people by their actually looking at one another, You know, the eyes and eye contact being such a key part of, the human, social cognitive connective networks. So do you know if they put eye masks on people during the therapy?[1:36:47] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Sure that they have the eye masks there.[1:36:50] Andrew Huberman: Right. Because a lot of the MDMA, work and I was part of an MDMA trial. It was, as I understand, geared toward developing because it's an empathogen, Empathy toward the self.[1:37:03] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty sure they have the eye masks there, but they probably and it's a great question because you could formally test this. They probably don't use them as much.[1:37:13] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:37:13] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The thing is with the classic psychedelics, if you're looking at your guides, your facilitators, and their faces are melting or whatever. No. No. No.[1:37:21] Andrew Huberman: No. MDMA, you just might really start to feel more connected to it. They might look[1:37:26] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: especially beautiful and you know? Sure. Yeah. And, and, yeah, there's that, fascinating effect of loving, you know, the people that you're with. And so, yeah, I'm I imagine they talk more and use the eye shades less, and it is more interpersonal Rather than, like, intrapersonal or going inside, they do use a fascinating terminology that some people have critiqued, but it it's a very interesting, phenomenon, and and it's this notion of the inner healer.[1:37:57] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: They use that that language a lot. It's been critiqued because it sounds very suggestive. You know? And that's probably one of the vehicles here driving the therapeutic process is suggestion. I think we have to be honest about that.[1:38:13] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But, so when they go inside, that's another term that we use very much in the classic psychedelic therapy work. You go inside. You know? You put the eye shades on, and people are encouraged to go inside. You know?[1:38:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But when they do that, in the MDMA work, Especially, they might be told explicitly and listen to the inner healer, you know, in that kind of language. So you could see how a a cynic or a Skeptic could come in and and see that as some kind of, like, suggestive priming or biasing. I think they they have a point. Skeptics often do, but I I don't think it it's, all of the story. And and just briefly, because it's an interesting point, Speaking to that point a bit, in our psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram trial, we measured pretrial expectancy, And we did it for both conditions.[1:39:10] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So, you know, what kind of improvement do you expect with the Lexapro, the escitalopram at the end of the trial, And what kind of improvement if you go into the psilocybin arm and get a big 2 big doses of psilocybin, what kind of improvement do you think you'll see in that in in that? And, of course, it was a coin flip as to what people went into, and there was no crossover. And what we found was that it was true that we had a, a sample bias. So most people had higher expectations. On average, there were higher expectations for psilocybin and its efficacy or effectiveness versus the SSRI, the Alexa Pro.[1:39:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: However, when we looked at the correlation or the predictive relationship between pretrial expectancy and response, We saw the pretrial expectancy for the escitalopram predicted response to escitalopram across virtually every single measure all these different measures of depression and anxiety and well-being, and and I think none of the scales. I'm pretty sure it was none of about 12 or so mental health, rating scales. Was there a relationship between Pretrial expectancy, even though it was high, it didn't predict pretrial expectancy didn't predict response to the psilocybin therapy. So that was a bit of a, you know, smash on the head for the idea that that Classic psychedelic therapy is some kind of placebo response. And I think it's so important to address that question, because If it doesn't come through as it didn't as it didn't come through, then it it opens up even more intrigue about, well, what is it then If it's not just a placebo response or a super placebo response, like an amplification of the placebo response, then it must be something else, and how intriguing it has a direct therapeutic action.[1:41:18] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It must be something, And we don't yet know what it is. I talked about the the residual, you know, increasing global connectivity. That's one possibility. But the truth is we're we're just scratching the surface.[1:41:33] Andrew Huberman: And yet the therapeutic outcomes are, again, just so Marvelous marvelously impressive. I'm curious as to why as well, there aren't that many labs, but The the laboratories that are focused on classic psychedelics for the treatment of depression and and now, as you mentioned, promising results for anorexia and fibromyalgia as well, although preliminary, Very promising. Why the lack of attention toward, LSD? Is it That the LSD trips are just too long, is it that they are qualitatively different? Are there any data on, non microdoses of LSD.[1:42:14] Andrew Huberman: And here, I wanna be very careful because I I learned through my interactions on social media that this term microdose is, very misleading, and in some cases, can be dangerously misleading because, as you mentioned earlier, the effective Psychedelic dose or, you know, the effective meaning that can induce a a a real trip with hallucinations, etcetera, of LSD is actually in the microgram range. So some people hear microdose, and they think microgram of LSD is a micrograms is a microdose when in fact a macro dose of LSD can be measured in micrograms. Yeah. Right? So this is where, You know, in the absence of scientific training, people can really go go astray, or even in just in the lack of understanding of the metric system.[1:43:02] Andrew Huberman: And since now you're a Yeah. You're a recent, rival to the US. Fortunate for us. Sorry. England's loss is the is the US's gain by, Robin's lab moved from from England to, the United States recently, so score 1 for us.[1:43:19] Andrew Huberman: But why isn't there more use of LSD in these trials?[1:43:24] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I think it it probably is the duration of the trip. It used to be stigma, and it was easier to get your psilocybin study through because others were. They were getting that True. So there was the likes of Franz Wallenweider in Zurich and Switzerland, and then Roland Griffiths coming along and doing the psilocybin work at Hopkins. So you could appeal to that precedence and say, well, they're doing it over there.[1:43:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You know? Can we not do it in in little England? So that's how it worked for us. We did actually go on and and do an LSD study once we'd kind of laid the foundations, for doing this kind of work. And it was a brain imaging study.[1:44:08] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It was a really extensive one, actually, where we use both MRI and another modality called MEG, sort of super EG in a sense. But, you know, why didn't we, why didn't that turn our heads To think, oh, should we not be doing our trials with LSD? It's it it does have something to do with the pragmatics. Like, a Study day with psilocybin is long enough.[1:44:35] Andrew Huberman: So 4 to 6 hour trip?[1:44:37] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. And the FDA asked us to have The people in the lab and until 8 hours post dose, which, personally, I think could be quite Excessive, especially if it's a low dose. You know, if you have that in the placebo condition as well, it becomes, impractical.[1:44:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Scientists are not paid nearly enough to warrant the, there's no such thing as overtime in Yeah. For the graduate students and postdocs.[1:45:04] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. It's often that there's, you know, more junior members that are doing that really hard work.[1:45:09] Andrew Huberman: I it was described very well to me by a a Student when I was a a graduate student said to me, they really can't afford to pay us by the hour because we used to work. He was a electrophysiologist, so he would run Experiments. No joke, folks. 3 to 5 day experiments, sleeping in bouts of 2 hours here or there in a dark room with a bunch of Equipment and, recordings. So these are long, long acute physiological electrophysiological recordings.[1:45:37] Andrew Huberman: So, Yeah. No no scientist does it for the money. I promise you, that there is money in pharma. There is not money in, Personal income, is not lucrative if we're the basic scientist. So, yes, LSD is what, anywhere from 8 to 15 hours, something like that.[1:45:58] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: 15 would be a little long. You'd be a bit worried if you were still tripping at that time, maybe with a really big dose.[1:46:03] Andrew Huberman: Oops. No. Just kidding.[1:46:05] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But, Yeah. 8 hours plus and dose dependent. Yeah. If it's a bigger dose, it's a a longer experience. But, you know, if you're gonna dose at, say, you know, 10 AM in the morning, which is more or less how it often goes, then at 6 PM still feeling the effects, And then how long do you wait now to kinda close things out before they can go home?[1:46:30] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Even with psilocybin, you have people Still at work into the evening, and the staff are always there later, of course, because they gotta pack up. And, Yeah. So these are long days, and it and it it's just it it it's too much. You know?[1:46:45] Andrew Huberman: That that makes sense. You know, practical constraints. I learned from a A recent guest on this podcast, that we recorded with, doctor Satchin Panda, who was a colleague of mine when I was down at the Salk Institute, Is, pioneered a lot of the studies on so called intermittent fasting, that the reason the intermittent, that that the eating period in these Studies in animals and now on humans is 8 hours. The sort of feeding window in these studies is because, the graduate student was going to otherwise lose Their relationship because their significant other says, listen. You can be in the lab for 12 hours.[1:47:17] Andrew Huberman: That meant some hours before the experiment, then 8 hours, and then some hours afterward, but you can't in there longer. And and many people use the 8 hour feeding window as a consequence. So the science, it has to exist and and be carried out in real world Frame.[1:47:30] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It does. Yeah. It does.[1:47:32] Andrew Huberman: MDMA is a little bit, a little bit shorter. Right? It's about a 4 to it's also about 4 to[1:47:38] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: 6 hours. It's kinda similar to psilocybin. Yeah. It is. And, actually, in the MAPS work, they redose after a certain point.[1:47:45] Andrew Huberman: Oh, the boost the booster?[1:47:46] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Have a booster or optional booster. Yeah. So So there is that. And now people are thinking, well, even these psilocybin sessions are long and expensive. And if you have to have 2 staff members there all the time, that's expensive.[1:48:03] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: That's where most of the expense is is in the staffing. So can we abridge the experience, make it shorter, and get away with it, and get get similar kind of therapies outcome. So there's a lot of interest in that direction.[1:48:18] Andrew Huberman: May I ask about, sorry to interrupt, but I wanna make sure I don't forget to ask about combination Psilocybin MDMA therapies. The reason I ask about this is, and here, truly not me, but I know people who, do Self administered, combination psilocybin and MDMA. I think I have this right. I think it's called a hippie flip. There's another one that involves LSD too.[1:48:44] Andrew Huberman: Again, I'm not suggesting people do these kind of drug combinations, but, the way it was described to me was That the psilocybin, because it's so, sometimes can be not a downer, but can have a bit of a kind of a Kind of a murky feel to it, some real deep introspection sometimes in the the darker realms of one's psyche depressive thoughts, etcetera. Not that it necessarily stays that way throughout the trip, but that the MDMA, because it has a very strongly serotonergic, but also dopaminergic. I mean, sorry. This has an amphetamine component, a cocaine like, in fact. If you ever seen someone in the MDMA, their pupils are about the size of of of, quarters, for a reason, they're in in, you know, extremely extreme autonomic arousal compared to a sedative, which by the way would constrict the pupils.[1:49:35] Andrew Huberman: So they describe the use of MDMA to kind of balance out the kind of affect component of it. What are your thoughts on combination psilocybin MDMA? Does this hold any therapeutic potential? This is obviously a backyard chemistry, in the sense that people are or, you know, kind of cowboying this stuff on their own, which, again, I don't Really recommend. I like to see the science go first, but I understand this is how it works in the real world.[1:50:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. What are what are your thoughts on combining Compounds.[1:50:06] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Well, I guess they're cowboying it in recreational context, but also underground therapists Do work with this combo.[1:50:14] Andrew Huberman: That's what I'm referring to. So I'm not talking about people parting with this stuff. I'm talking about there are Thousands now of therapists that offer psychedelic therapies illegally, really, because it's not legal, at least, not in the US to possess or sell, but that are doing this.[1:50:30] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[1:50:30] Andrew Huberman: So that's really why I'm asking.[1:50:31] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, I think there's something to be said for one has to be careful with this as a scientist. But, You know, if they're doing it, are they using some kind of trial and error? The same is true, of course, with the, you know, longer history of psychedelic Plant medicine, Yousef, by plants, we include the fungi as well, so ex in the extended sense plants.[1:50:54] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You know, there will have been trial and error there. It might not be as systematic as the science we do today, but maybe there's been a learning process, and maybe what they do, they've come to because they found it works. So by that principle, I'm interested in that combination and whether it does, offers some advantages, maybe in certain patients. You know? If we one of the buzz terms in medicine these days is precision medicine, A precision medicine and personalized medicine.[1:51:25] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So maybe there are certain cases where, you know, introducing, say, psilocybin after the MDMA or the other way around could offer some advantages. And the differences are interesting. You know? Psilocybin can get you to deep places. Maybe, you know, the kernel of your suffering and and, Major life experiences and complexes that are causally linked to whatever the Pathology that you're presenting with, but it can do it sometimes quite aggressively.[1:52:05] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You know? And if it's, say, Post traumatic stress disorder, it can be overwhelming, and you can fight it. And, really, it's that. It's that, you know, the resistance is really challenged, And they fight back, and the therapeutic breakthrough and the progress isn't happening because you've agitated the defense mechanisms. Whereas what MDMA offers is something arguably more directionally reliable in terms of In terms of the valence, like, it's more directionally positive, generally, in MDMA experience.[1:52:43] Andrew Huberman: Hard to have a bad time on MDMA.[1:52:44] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. To to[1:52:45] Andrew Huberman: be quite blunt. I mean, But one of the concerns I I had, with MDMA, I've never done it I have had not and have not ever done it recreationally. But when it was done in this Therapeutic setting, I realized because there was music on at the beginning, I asked I actually asked them to turn it off because I realized that the, the music was becoming such an attractor to my attention that I suddenly was starting to think about music and my love of music, which was not the focus of the session that I had, Was there, you know, 4? And I'm glad that they did turn the music off because the moment they did, I was able to drop in within the IMAX to this this sort of go inward and address some Certain issues that, at least to me, felt key and productive. So that seems to be the kind of, hazard with MDMA is that, it's such an empathogen That, one could start to you could go down any number of different rabbit holes.[1:53:39] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. But but it's also it's a strength because you well, you know, the classics like psilocybin can take you there very reliably, but Maybe a bit aggressively, MDMA makes it easier to go there, and and that's its strength. And that's why that Marriage of MDMA therapy for PTSD in particular is a is a good combo. It works because You are gonna go there.[1:54:05] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: In a sense, you have to to really make the therapeutic progress. You're gonna have to go back there. But we're we're gonna set it up so that you can go back there and feel, safer, more trusting, and be able to go back there, Whereas you've never otherwise been able to go back there without, you know, dissociating or having, you know, horrible flashbacks and so on. So, that's the strength that it offers. I guess the limitation would be that maybe it doesn't take you as deep as the, classic psychedelics.[1:54:41] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And I tend to think I'm biased on this one that there's a kind of honesty to the classics in that it is it is hell as well as heaven. You know? And that's the psyche. It isn't all roses. You know?[1:54:55] Andrew Huberman: I I I really appreciate that you bring that up because I think that there's such a fear of, so called bad trips. There's such a fear, in non psychedelic states to To avoid the the painful and everything everything we know from trauma and the, treatment of trauma, and we've had several guests on here. My close colleague close, close colleague at Stanford doctor, David Spiegel, our associate chair of psychiatry, is clinical hypnotist, amazing Amazing human being and scientist and clinician is as really just, you know, like, embedded this in my mind that the only way to deal with trauma is to get Right up next to that trauma to the point where some relief is experienced, there is no other real way. And so I really appreciate that you're saying that the Classic psychedelics may offer the the, with a very strong nudge, perhaps, the opportunity to get into the the uncomfortable in a way that, MDMA or some nonclassical psychedelics, perhaps do not. We're talking about time frames or or duration of trips And these different compounds and how they differ and how they're similar, I'd love for you to educate me on DMT some of the work that you're doing with DMT.[1:56:11] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that it's a very brief trip, minutes. People I know who have done this, again, therapeutically, actually, I'll just point to one very exciting, I think, group An initiative which is the Veterans Solutions Initiative, which is a group, this is carried out in Mexico, but in conjunction with laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere who are evaluating the neural changes, and this involves Ibogaine, which is ebogo, which is a very long Duration psychedelic, 22 hours or more followed by a, I think, 1 or 2 doses of DMT. This is for veterans with, to deal with any number of issues. Appears to be working with great success, and I've spoken to several of people who've gone through this. And the way that they described DMT Almost across the board was quote here, I'm just pulling quotes.[1:57:01] Andrew Huberman: Right? Anecdata. The most profound experience of my entire life, even greater than the birth of my children, quote, like being attached to the Shock wave of an atom bomb, quote, there's no way I'm would do another dose because the first one was so unbelievable. Interesting, by the way. I think most of us, including me, would think, why wouldn't you wanna do it again then?[1:57:26] Andrew Huberman: But this idea that that was just beyond anything. So These are significant excuse me. These are significant statements coming from individuals who have existed at the extremes of human experience to begin with. Right? These are, so called tier 1 operators within the special operations who exit and may or may not have trauma, but DMT sounds like a big deal.[1:57:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Short duration, really big deal. What do we know about its chemistry? What do we know about how it's impacting brain networks, and what in the world is going on that people are describing it as, The ways I just mentioned a few moments ago.[1:58:06] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yes. It's a it's a rocket ship. If, If the psilocybin is like a ship leaving port, then, yeah, this is this is a rocket ship into Craziness. Is it 58[1:58:20] Andrew Huberman: is it serotonin 2 a?[1:58:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It it is. Yeah. So it is a classic psychedelic. It's a direct agonist, a direct Stimulator of the serotonin 2 a receptor. It's an order of magnitude less potent than psilocybin, But potency is a funny thing because it's dose dependent.[1:58:41] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So that doesn't mean that the experience with DMT is less than that of psilocybin. It's just that you give more of the drug. But, it has that's matched by its its stickiness for the serotonin to a receptor, which is this kind of golden rule in In psychedelic sciences that it was discovered in the mid 19 eighties, this tight relationship between the affinity or the stickiness or the binding potential of a psychedelic for the 2 a receptor in particular, serotonin 2 a, and its potency. And the stickier the drug, the more potent. So LSD, really sticky, very, very potent.[1:59:16] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You only need those tiny microgram doses. So DMT, by its affinity, is is, a little less potent. But by its effects, when you give a standard dose, it's just in it's It's just wild. And DMT, because there's another compound called 5 methoxy DMT, which is A bit different pharmacologically and subjectively. It's similar in terms of its kinetics.[1:59:45] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's another rocket ship, both compounds, in the wild, so to speak, are, smoked Often, TMT and 5 MEO, people are vaping both actually now. There are vape vape pens that have been Developed, for people to administer administer this, but more traditionally, it's been a smoking thing.[2:00:12] Andrew Huberman: This is clinically, not recreationally Or both?[2:00:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Both now. I mean Okay. You know, underground practitioners are using the vape pens. They like them because People titrate the dosage. They get a feel for what it is to be going into this state so that they feel they can let go and go into it.[2:00:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: But and, actually, I think some of the veterans work might be giving 5 MEO after the Ibogaine. Phenomenologically, if there's a difference between DMT and five MEO, people might put it on five MEO being more of a reliable Ego dissolution experience, less visual and more kind of all round immersion in the greater Whole loss of self identity and just immersion in everything. Yeah. Maybe we could[2:01:05] Andrew Huberman: just talk about ego dissolution for a second because it's such a sticky, interesting idea. I can take a step back as a neuroscientist and, and say, okay. Ego dissolution, this idea that the That, you know, from a very early age, we have a a concept of self and that, you know, I wake up every morning, and I know I'm me and not somebody else. And, Certainly, you do the same, and most most people do the same, I would hope, but that and that there are objects in the world and people in the world beyond us. But Every time we hear about ego dissolution, it sounds like it's a, kind of a temporary, elimination of the of the idea that things stop and, start and stop between us and everything else.[2:01:47] Andrew Huberman: Almost like, You know, in a kind of a here, I'm not trying to sound philosophical or, metaphysical, but there there's sort of the molecular continuity of of life. Right? We're all all just little little bits. Which is true. Which is true.[2:02:01] Andrew Huberman: Right? Not a functional way to go through the day. Mhmm. Right? Because you wanna make a cup of coffee, you don't really wanna get lost in that if your goal is to make a cup of coffee.[2:02:11] Andrew Huberman: But, but, you know, What is the the what is the power of ego dissolution? Is it the idea that we bolt that we, Like, belong, is it a sense of meaning? Yeah. Is it the sense that we're we're not as important as we think, which, of course, could be a wonderfully useful, way to go through life, you know, to to think that we're not as in as in like, we're we are vitally important, but we're not the only thing. Right?[2:02:37] Andrew Huberman: Because I do believe Connection is vital as most people do. What is ego dissolution, and why would this serotonin two way Activation caused that. That's remarkable.[2:02:49] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Great questions. I mean, what what is it? You alluded to it with the start stop, I think, you know, because you could define it by boundaries in a sense what it What isn't me is as valid here as as the, you know, a developing sense of what is Me that a child develops at whatever age. Of the ego dissolution experience rather than just a negative, a thing going away, my sense of self going away is is the positive.[2:03:29] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Oh, now I feel interconnected with other people in the work world at large, and I realize, You know, that there is that molecular continuity, and, actually, that's a ground truth. And, oh, maybe the ego thing is somewhat Illusory or at least the construction of my mind?[2:03:48] Andrew Huberman: And indeed it is. Right? I mean[2:03:49] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, it is. Yes. Yeah. I mean, there's no Transcendentalism about that, it's just like logic.[2:03:56] Andrew Huberman: I think about about it a little bit like family. I mean, we all know what immediate family is, but, you know, of like, forgive me for interrupting myself. I do it all the time anyway. When I teach neuroanatomy, you know, some clever student Always figures out, okay. Well, that's connected to that, and that's connected, but, ultimately, everything in the brain is connected to everything else.[2:04:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's just no way around that. That's a true statement.[2:04:19] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[2:04:20] Andrew Huberman: And so you really just have to decide where you draw the boundaries between[2:04:24] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Where'd you draw the line?[2:04:25] Andrew Huberman: Where what? Where are the modules? What are the module? You could say the brain is just 1 big macro module. Yeah.[2:04:30] Andrew Huberman: And then you also wanna include the body. And now, fortunately, people are starting to embrace this idea that it's not mind body. It's both because the nervous system extends through both, of course. So as, the same could be said of family. Like, we're related.[2:04:45] Andrew Huberman: Right? Not just by virtue of the fact that we're human beings. If we did our genealogical charts, we would find a a convergence at some point.[2:04:52] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[2:04:53] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, You know, this becomes a bit of a game, but then one realizes that where you draw the boundaries And if you draw them at brother, sister, parents, biological parents, etcetera, that's a game too.[2:05:07] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[2:05:08] Andrew Huberman: And so it is just a construct.[2:05:10] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. I mean, it is a fun game. You know? Where do you draw the line and when to pass and when to collapse? Mhmm.[2:05:16] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It it's also a classic consideration in science When[2:05:20] Andrew Huberman: to pass. The lumper versus the splitter.[2:05:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: There you go. It's brilliant. Yeah. It's but you asked this question like, well, why do psychedelics do it? And, There, we think psychedelics do it because the target receptors at least, you know, classic psychedelics do it, And that's important to stress.[2:05:39] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So MDMA doesn't really do it in the same way. Might soften the ego a bit, but, Yeah. That's Well, I debatable.[2:05:47] Andrew Huberman: My experience with, MDMA is that it's such a strong end pathogen Yeah. And and that it can Cause empathy for others.[2:05:57] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah.[2:05:57] Andrew Huberman: Certainly, you could imagine situations where one in the MDMA journey and afterwards says, You know, oh, these these my oppressors, you know, are the people that harmed me. They, and here, I'm not referring to my experience, but, you know, They did the best with what they have. I actually have empathy for them, forgiveness Yeah. But also for oneself, that there's an an a empathy for self. I know I said this earlier.[2:06:20] Andrew Huberman: That is Very hard for most people to access. Perhaps it's not the narcissists out there listening. They'll be like, of course, empathy for self. But everyone else, I think, all the other healthy people, or the healthy people other than narcissists and not picking on narcissists. I have to imagine They suffer too.[2:06:39] Andrew Huberman: In fact, I think that's the root of their narcissism. That empathy for self is not something that comes reflexively for most people. And here, I'm not talking about self love or self respect, but this notion of being able to see the self as, not just deserving of Love and care, but actually holding that in place while in confrontation with something challenging in a way that allows more, not less access to adaptive responses to that challenge. I think that's the way I I kind of conceptualize it.[2:07:10] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, drugs offer a a great they offer great there are great scientific tools For tackling this question, what is ego dissolution, and why do drugs modulate it, and what does that tell you about the brain? You know? Because other drugs like cocaine Releasing more of a a different neurotransmitter, dopamine more than serotonin.[2:07:34] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The opposite is the case with MDMA. It's more of an ego inflator. Right?[2:07:39] Andrew Huberman: Oh, absolutely. People become hyperlinear, hyper, linked to their own desires and wishes, and future outcomes become an obsession. It's the stuff of, kind of American Psycho and the, kind of, cliches and stereotypes of the The the eighties, cocaine culture.[2:07:58] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. We did a study once actually looking at dose dependent relationship with ego inflation on one axis an ego dissolution on the other and saw that it just massively passed or differentiated between cocaine and and psychedelics. It's quite a neat study.[2:08:15] Andrew Huberman: So cocaine makes people's egos super inflated. Yeah.[2:08:18] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And so it doesn't touch dissolution, and the opposite is the case with, With psychedelics,[2:08:23] Andrew Huberman: at least in neuroimaging to to explain how how cocaine does that.[2:08:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: That would be a great study. Yeah. Great idea. We should do that.[2:08:31] Andrew Huberman: I have a sabbatical coming up. I've got 12 months of sabbatical coming up. Yeah. Yeah. That's I wanna I'm I'm gonna show up in your lab.[2:08:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's a[2:08:39] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: really good one. If if it's right to finish the thread on on why psychedelics and ego dissolution, we do know some things or, you know, we have some hypotheses, and it's the The target receptors, the serotonin 2 a receptors that the classic psychedelics hit, are heavily expressed in what these days I like to call recent brain. Because evolutionarily, it's recent brain. It's cortex that humans have more than any other species. If you look at a mapping of cortical expansion from, say, macaque or chimp to human.[2:09:10] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's the very same map that you'll find the 2 a receptors in. So that's the target. It's and and, yeah, it's just easy to think that, oh, well, that could be the egoic brain. You know? And, and the classic psychedelics come in.[2:09:27] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: They kind of they scramble up the activity. That's the entropic brain action. And in terms of, you know, the start stop, the boundaries, in tropic action sort of spreads out the system. It doesn't shut it off. It sort of spreads it out.[2:09:45] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You know? Dissolution. Yeah. And, you know, that You were talking about the headspace as well. Mhmm.[2:09:52] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So that fits. If it's, you know, if it's more capacious, it sort of fits. The the big qualifier with psychedelic therapy that that people rightly bring up is it doesn't last. No. That's the paradox of it, the paradox of ego dissolution.[2:10:12] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So, the ego might go away during the trip, and you have these profound Insights about the molecular continuity and how we're all 1 and interconnected, and then you come down. And however, long later, You know, the ego comes back, but maybe with a vengeance. And sadly, you know, things can go awry when people haven't done the work, Perhaps haven't done the integration work, and maybe ego defenses come back and, you know, and it's not it's not[2:10:43] Andrew Huberman: a pretty picture. How often do you see that in the the trials that you do? What percentage of the the of people coming through What do you think end up with worse than they they were before the the trial?[2:10:59] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's very rare in the trials that we've done. Yeah. But you see defenses come back. So you you do see people relapse. That's more know, if you if you're pushing out to, like, 3 months plus in something like treatment resistant depression, that's more the rule than the exception, sadly.[2:11:20] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: People relapse. If their histories are, you know, histories of chronic depression, then while you might give them a a window of wellness, Sadly, it doesn't last. That's not to say that it it doesn't ever last. It does. And and we have people who are in our first Treatment resistant depression trial.[2:11:38] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: You're well, to my knowledge, today, back at work doing fantastically well. But sadly, The majority of of relapsed to my knowledge.[2:11:48] Andrew Huberman: And need to do more psychedelic journeys?[2:11:51] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, they can't because it's illegal. That's been the really difficult Situation that we've been up against is that we do a trial where all of a sudden this schedule one drug becomes a medicine in the trial or at least an experimental medicine. We give the treatment. It works fantastically well, gives people a remission that they've never really had, for however long, And and then the trial ends, and they're denied that treatment. And worse still, if they were to have that treatment, they would be committing a crime.[2:12:21] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's sort of a sick joke in a way, but that's that's the situation that we've been in.[2:12:26] Andrew Huberman: That's a perfect segue for what I want to talk about Now which is, what is the current state of legality in terms of or the progression towards legality? I'd also like to touch on the role of, let's just say, incoming big pharma. There are a lot of start up companies now trying to capitalize on these Discoveries that you and others have made, you know, the landscape out there is very unclear to me. Maybe I'll just, Call out some silos as I see them, and maybe we can draw some, bridges between them if they exist. At the ground level, not the grassroots, but at the ground level, I look to laboratories like yours, Matthew Johnson's, Roland Griffith's, some laboratories at Stanford, Nolan Williams, laboratories doing studying the effects of psychedelics in human beings, so not animal models, In terms of their clinical application for the treatment of depression, anorexia, I now know fibromyalgia, trauma, let's lump MDMA in there as well, assuming that it all works in an equivalent way at the level of kind of where the legislature is taking things.[2:13:39] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So labs using Government money, philanthropy, etcetera. Then there are the, The sort of the therapists out there that are accessing what we believe are clean sources of MDMA, Psilocybin LSD to do this. They are doing it illegally. This is in the US or, other, Western European countries because, Obviously, it's gonna differ by country, who are administering these things sort of on the basis of what they're reading in these studies that You all are publishing, but also expanding on and experimenting hippie flips and combination drugs and ketamine and etcetera.[2:14:19] Andrew Huberman: But let's say ketamine out right now because it's legal, but there's that. Then there's the, I don't wanna say it's sort of recreational slash open market, Black market. And here I wanna, raise a flag to the fact that, doctor Peter Attia did a terrific podcast on this recently in his own podcast, The Drive. The fact that, Fentanyl lacing with Fentanyl is now showing up in MDMA and psychedelics that are purchased on the street, so serious caution to those getting it from, uncertain sources. And and then you've got pharma.[2:14:55] Andrew Huberman: And then as an umbrella for all of this, you've got The FDA and law enforcement agencies, which currently say this stuff is illegal unless it's being used in a clinical trial, selling it or possessing it Can get you charged with a crime ranging from I don't wanna say because I don't know, but I'm up to felonies. Right? Years in prison. Okay. So Can't take it through airports.[2:15:19] Andrew Huberman: Can't don't get caught with it. Don't buy it. Don't sell it kind of thing. So where are we going from that Picture of the silos. I know things are in clinical trials now.[2:15:31] Andrew Huberman: Most people, including myself, Are not familiar with how the different phases relate to the proximity to legality. Could you just kinda give us the landscape and touch on How long you think it will be before the people that come through your trials could then go get a prescription for psilocybin or potentially buy it without the risk, from a reliable source, one would hope, but without the risk of getting thrown in jail. I used to live in Oakland, California. My understanding and please correct me if I'm wrong, folks. Don't trust this information and get in trouble.[2:16:04] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is Psilocybin is decriminalized in Oakland, but that's not the same as being legal. So what is going on out there?[2:16:13] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Wow. Well, so much.[2:16:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I just asked 55 questions.[2:16:16] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I know.[2:16:16] Andrew Huberman: But, but feel free to answer just a subset of them if you'd like.[2:16:20] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Well, Oakland's a funny one. I I live close to Oakland. There are head shops in Oakland, you know, that might be selling Cannabis and and, you know, cannabis related paraphernalia that is selling mushrooms as well, psilocybin mushrooms That's a fact.[2:16:40] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Openly. Yeah.[2:16:41] Andrew Huberman: That's a fact. I can I can verify that? I haven't purchased them, but I've gone in and kinda checked it out, like, what what's going on here.[2:16:47] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, the police aren't going to prioritize that activity, the purchasing of of those mushrooms as A crime now in Oakland because of the decriminalization. So those headshots shouldn't strictly be selling.[2:17:08] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Well, they shouldn't be selling. They won't have a license to be selling. Licenses don't exist, yet for that here. But, let's see whether they get shut down. They probably will.[2:17:22] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: I don't know. But there's a there's a church, you know, in in Oakland that Sort of, say that, they're they're selling and it's part of sort of religious rights that they're using that church model as a loophole, you know, the way that Native Americans can use peyote and they have a more genuine A case, I think, because there is a history there, that they're trying to kinda piggyback on that. But, anyway, that's that's sort of, you know, close to where we are right now. But, federally, which is really the major inflection point is the FDA, and the licensing of psychedelics as medicines to be legally prescribed across the country, across the US and beyond, That is close because the key, phase so there are different phases of clinical trials, and the key one To know about is phase 3. A phase 3 trials are licensing trials.[2:18:25] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: If they're successful and typically have to do at least 2 successful ones, Show the results to the regulators who are the FDA, the medicine regulators, and say, is this good enough now for you to give me a license so that I can sell, and provide this medicine that we've demonstrated as a medicine. So that work has been done with MDMA therapy for Post traumatic stress disorder, MAPS have led that work and done 2 phase three trials. I think they've already publicly announced that the 2nd trial Had results consistent with the first. We know the results of the first because they're published, and they were remarkably good, Something like 67% remission rates.[2:19:09] Andrew Huberman: And long term, my understanding is some of those remission rates for trauma were years, which is different than what you're describing for psilocybin where people might need ongoing dosing.[2:19:20] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: That's true. Yeah. Yeah.[2:19:22] Andrew Huberman: But, of course, just for trauma in those trials. My understanding is those MDMA trials were not focused on depression.[2:19:28] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yes. Yes. Focused on on the trauma. So that's something because that data is being filed now to my knowledge, like, as we speak, And, they're anticipating a decision maybe this year, with rollout happening as early as next year. I mean, that's sort of best case, I think.[2:19:49] Andrew Huberman: Could I ask you when you say rollout, who's and it's the appropriate, term for MDMA Uh-huh. Because of so called rolling, About 20% of my audience, maybe 50 will will understand that, not funny joke that I made. Who's going to Roll it out. Is this where would one get the m d the the clean source of MDMA, meaning not laced with Fentanyl, not laced with methamphetamine, not undergone any chemical conversion to some other drug, which can happen with extended shelf life, etcetera. Are people going to Go to their psychiatrist to get MDMA, and who's gonna be providing it?[2:20:29] Andrew Huberman: Is it gonna be some big major pharma? This seems like a serious set of issues. Mhmm.[2:20:35] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It is, and I don't have all the answers. I I do know that maps would be providing because they've done the work, and they have set themselves up in a sense to potentially become The provider, whether as a pharma company, which is the big question they're wrestling with at the moment. It's very expensive to become a pharma company.[2:21:00] Andrew Huberman: And yet they probably deserve to make the choice Because they put in so many years of hard work when all of this stuff was considered, like raver culture, party drug, They were the ones that spotted the therapeutic potential. The I mean, we knew there was therapeutic potential based on work going back many decades, but, points to them, and I think that I think, in my opinion, they should have the agency to make those decisions.[2:21:24] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. And it's a remark such a remarkable thing that's been achieved, and I I think they've done it all on philanthropic donations. I think so. Yeah. So there there is this, yeah, big question mark, and the FDA are also asking questions about, To to your question, you know, who who can provide this?[2:21:48] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Because in the phase three work and up until this point has been a MAPS training, a MAPS therapist training, and you have to do this formal, training, in order to to be a practitioner within the trials. But now there's a question from the FDA whether that MAPS training can be the training that a clinician has to have to now be a provider. And when I say rollout, it's like Offering this as a service, essentially. And so where would the referral come from? That's a good question that I'm not 100 on the answer, whether it would have to come from a psychiatrist or whether someone's So the general physician could do that referral, but they will be going to a provider who is licensed and certified and will have done some training.[2:22:45] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: And there will be a consensus on, you know, what constitutes Good enough training to provide. There will also be some stipulations on the basic underlying professionalism of the clinician who provides. So I imagine they'll have to be a mental health professional. I don't think they would have to necessarily be a psychiatrist. There could be a, I think, a clinical psychologist.[2:23:08] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: For all the dosing, I think, without question, there would have to be a physician present or At least within ready access in case of an emergency.[2:23:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Especially with MDMA because of the, propensity for cardiac issues Yeah. Because of the amphetamine properties. And where is, psilocybin in terms of the phase Trials. Is it in phase 2, phase 3?[2:23:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It's in phase 3. There's psilocybin therapy work being done For treatment resistant depression by a company called COMPASS, those trials, which are always multisite, So there's always a bunch of teams or labs in a sense, geographically spread out that are each contributing to data that then gets massed together and is then submitted as part of the phase three trial results. So that's happening with COMPASS right now. It's psilocybin therapy for treatment resistant depression. Those trials have just started, and, I think the earliest estimate that I heard in a in a journalistic article was Because I don't think Compass would say or they wouldn't say publicly something like 2026.[2:24:21] Andrew Huberman: 26. Wow. So MDMA is is ahead of Cilician.[2:24:25] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yes. Quite a few years ahead, and it's more of a not a certainty, but it's Very, very strong position with MDMA, whereas the work's only just begun with with psilocybin in terms of the phase three trials. But then you have this other situation of, like, however many psychedelic research centers there are now across the globe. It was nice to you know, we had the 1st one in London in 2019. 1st one in 2019 is 2023 now, and I don't know how many there are, but So much has happened in such a small space of time.[2:25:04] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yes. But, you know, all these different indications I've been able you about anorexia and fibromyalgia syndrome. Trying to do a a trial, with a colleague of mine At UCSF in methamphetamine use disorder, he's got a trial going on in Parkinson's disease, and chronic lower back pain and Bipolar disorder. I mean, there's so much going on. OCD, almost the full gamut of psychiatric disorders, not schizophrenia, to my knowledge, are being looked at.[2:25:38] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So there's so much ground ground, you know, groundswell of activity, And I think these small investigator led studies, typically, they're small because trials are expensive, are gonna be reporting positive results. I know what we're seeing, and it will be, you know, 4 let's see now. At least 4 trials all with really positive results in very difficult to treat disorders, and that's just us. And I know there's so much elsewhere, addiction disorders as well. You know, Matt Johnson's work, obviously, Michael Bogan shoots.[2:26:15] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So all this compelling groundswell, it's really something, and yet, you know, the system to really make a big breakthrough in terms is, of course, slow, and it's so that can frustrate people, but it it has to it It has to be done properly.[2:26:34] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Else, we we revert back to what happened in the seventies where there was a lot of interest In psychedelics, it's kind of interesting to me. There was a a close juxtaposition of meditation and, kind of behavioral approaches to Self directed state change and psychedelics, and meditation kinda made it through the hatch. I mean, there were some years where it was considered kind of Counterculture, woo, magic carpet, weirdo stuff by Western science. But now, I mean, there are tens of Probably tens of thousands is not an overstatement of quality studies exploring how meditation can provide advantages for the mind and even for mental health.[2:27:17] Andrew Huberman: And psychedelics are now catching up, but they used to be close cousins in the in the cultural framework. But the problem was, I think, psychedelics were viewed as, making people crazy, And, university professors lost their jobs for having discussions like the one that you and I are having right now. And Some people went to jail, but mostly mostly people either left academic institutions or lost their jobs. Whereas now, these are, Some of the these studies of the sort that you are doing and that are taking place at Stanford and Hopkins and elsewhere are, some of the greatest magnetic Netic pull for philanthropy for universities. Donors are very interested in supporting these sorts of Studies because they and their family members and people they know suffer from psychiatric illness for which, the current, big pharma approaches simply have not worked.[2:28:15] Andrew Huberman: So it's sort of interesting to me that what once was seen as, kind of poison is now being viewed as a a potential therapeutic. It's Not just interesting. I think it's it, hopefully, it speaks to the evolution of of the human species. People seem to be coming more open minded about becoming more open minded.[2:28:44] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Yeah. It's, there's so much that's happening so fast. And there's You know, there are elements of it's it's complexifying the space. There's, there is critique. There's been some bad practice This in psychedelic therapy, boundary crossing issues that have caused some scandals.[2:29:04] Andrew Huberman: That's too bad.[2:29:05] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Isn't it?[2:29:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, you know, I think to the gene therapy, right, it just takes 1 bad incident. You know, gene therapy was on a fast track 3 decades ago, and then, sadly, a child died in a gene therapy trial. And it's like, Shut down gene therapy practically for half a decade, and then it slowly started ratcheting up again. Gene therapy broadly defined, and now we're in the age of, you know, potential directed gene therapy using CRISPR and things of that sort, which makes people some people cringe and other people very excited.[2:29:35] Andrew Huberman: If you have Huntington's in your family, CRISPR is, like, the most exciting technology ever because you could potentially eliminate it from your family line Going forward, of course.[2:29:46] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: So I I just really hope that we can be balanced as this all plays out because it It could go similar way given the stigma, given the history that people be very twitchy with with, some isolated incidents. And, you know, I overgeneralize them perhaps. In a sense, shining a light on them, I think, is important. That that has happened recently is important because it really drills home how important It is that this work be done right and and what the necessary safeguards and and, standards should be. Yeah.[2:30:28] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: It won't be it won't be an easy road forwards, but But let's hope you know, we gotta hope that it succeeds because current treatments you know, people talk about the mental health crisis. And To your point earlier about anorexia rates, it's not always actually the case when you look at the, epidemiology. When you look at the data that you see a big inflection in, you know, diagnoses or cases of psychiatric illness. I would say it's more that the treatments Haven't moved. They haven't really progressed.[2:31:04] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: They haven't got any better since 19 fifties, more or less, and and new drugs have been more of the same. So there haven't been any paradigm shifts, and that's why I get a little impassioned when I talk about psychedelic therapy and and that point that This is something different. It's not, you know, a drug every day. It that system is not cutting it. You know, do we really wanna keep on with that system?[2:31:32] Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: Sure. You know, not everyone will want to trip, And that will terrify some people so much that they'll just want to be on that Lexapro or or a non psychedelic psychedelic or whatever. And, Of course, you should be allowed to have those options, of course. And the more options, the better. But I think there is It's great value in really understanding what psychedelic therapy is, and and and I think When you do, you realize that it is a major paradigm challenge on many levels, and and the fact that it's different Might be its its greatest appeal at the moment, I think.[2:32:14] Andrew Huberman: Well, I am certainly grateful for your passion, for The potential for psychedelics to be added to the array of potential treatments, and I really also appreciate how much you, put it in there Alongside the other treatments, maybe even combination with other treatments as opposed to saying this is the thing that's gonna cure everything, and yet The passion that you have for this potential paradigm shift, the one that really appears to be happening at the level of clinical data now, is so important. So I want to extend a a voice of gratitude for that and for The work that you're doing I mean, I've been outside of this field, but as a neuroscientist, I've been paying careful attention to it, really, for the last 5, 7 years or so, and it's abundantly clear that it is a small group of individuals who are really Thinking in terms of how the system works now and what needs to be done in order to change the system for the better, like yourself, that are really the driving force behind this, new movement or paradigm shift that without question is going to lead to improvements in mental health and physical health outcomes.[2:33:28] Andrew Huberman: So I just wanna say thank you for that. Also, Thank you so much for joining us today to share this immense knowledge set about the history of psychedelics, what they are, what they aren't, their clinical applications as seen in your laboratory and other laboratories. I'm sure people already noticed this, but you're incredibly generous in terms of attribution and And, also, in your caution about explaining how some of the results, in particular, on anorexia, fibromyalgia, are perhaps preliminary but very exciting. They're not published yet anyway. We wouldn't call them preliminary.[2:34:02] Andrew Huberman: And also for touching on mechanism, that is not just about people feel better, but pointed to some Potential underlying mechanisms in terms of connectivity changes, and on and on. So Thank you so much for your time today. Thank you for the work that you're doing, and thank you for the work that is sure to continue. We will provide Links to studies in your laboratory, links to your laboratory so people can learn more and support in the ways that, they deem appropriate for them.
