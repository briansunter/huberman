I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks The 2nd episode in our 4 episode series with doctor Paul Conte about mental health. The 1st episode in the series dealt with how to understand and assess your level of mental health. Today's episode is about how to improve your mental health.[0:00:29] Andrew Huberman: I do want to emphasize that you do not need to have heard or seen the 1st episode In order to understand or glean important information from today's episode about how to improve your mental health, but I do encourage you to go and listen to the 1st episode at some point if you have not already. Today's episode deals with several topics important to all of us, as well as protocols to improve one's mental health. For instance, you will learn how to guide yourself through a process of Self inquiry in which you address certain key questions about your drives, your level of aggressive drive, pleasure drive, the so called generative drive. These are essential things to understand about oneself if you want to guide yourself toward your aspirations And if you want to understand how your subconscious processing is influencing your thoughts and your behaviors and your feelings in ways that sometimes serve your aspirations and in other ways that can hinder your aspirations. Doctor Conti shares with us a way of assessing our internal narratives as well as a way of Creating a constructive self awareness and an understanding of where those narratives and that self awareness stem from in our childhood so that we can navigate forward with the greatest Sense of agency.[0:01:35] Andrew Huberman: We also talk about how to move past common hindrances to improving one's mental health, such as overcoming intrusive thoughts. And perhaps most importantly, Today's episode provides information and protocols that anyone can use to cultivate their generative drive, which is a hallmark of mental health. Just a reminder that doctor Paul Contee has generously provided a few diagrams that we include as PDFs in the show note captions. They are completely zero cost to access, and they can help you understand some of the material that was discussed in the 1st episode of this series as well as the current episode about how to improve your mental health. And while those simple PDF diagrams are certainly not necessary in order to understand the material in today's discussion or in the other discussions of this series, many people find them useful.[0:02:17] Andrew Huberman: So I encourage you to check out those links in the show note captions. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is BetterHelp.[0:02:38] Andrew Huberman: BetterHelp offers Professional therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online. I personally have been doing weekly therapy for more than 30 years. And while that weekly therapy was initiated Not by my own request, it was, in fact, a requirement for me to, remain in high school. Over time, I really came to appreciate how valuable doing quality therapy is. In fact, I look at doing quality therapy much in the same way that I look at going to the gym or doing cardiovascular training such as running as ways to enhance my physical health, I see therapy as a vital way to enhance one's mental health.[0:03:13] Andrew Huberman: The beauty of BetterHelp is that they make it very easy to find an excellent therapist. An excellent therapist can be defined as somebody who is going to be very supportive of you in an objective way with whom you have excellent rapport with and who can help you arrive at key insights that you wouldn't have otherwise been able to find. And because BetterHelp Therapy Is conducted entirely online. It's extremely convenient and easy to incorporate into the rest of your life. So if you're interested in BetterHelp, go to betterhelpdot com/huberman to get 10% off your 1st month.[0:03:43] Andrew Huberman: That's better help spelled help.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up. Waking Up is a meditation app that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions, mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more. By now, there's an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood, reduce anxiety, improve our ability to focus, and can improve our memory. And while there are many different forms of Meditation.[0:04:11] Andrew Huberman: Most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practice in a way that is most beneficial for them. The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practice in a way that's going to be most effective and efficient for you. It includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra, which place the brain and body Into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refreshed. In fact, the science around Yoga Nidra is really impressive showing that after a Yoga Nidra session, Levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to 60%, which places the brain and body into a state of enhanced readiness for mental work and for physical work. Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app is that it provides a 30 day introduction course.[0:04:59] Andrew Huberman: So for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic. Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled and regular meditator, waking up has more advanced meditations and yoga for you as well. If you'd like to try the Waking Up app, you can go to waking up .com/huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's waking up .com slash Huberman. And now for my discussion about mental health with doctor Paul Conti.[0:05:26] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Conti, welcome back. Thank you. In the 1st episode of this series, you laid out for us in a very structured way, you know, what true mental health looks like, Essentially, what we should all be aspiring to. And he touched on these themes of agency and gratitude as, verb states, really, ways of being in the world Yes. That allow everybody to have some sense of well-being, to have some sense of Themselves in a way that is kind to themselves and to others, and really to feel good and do good in their life.[0:06:00] Andrew Huberman: And and without question, this is what people want.[0:06:04] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[0:06:04] Andrew Huberman: Right? You also spelled out for us these 2 pillars, the structure of self and the function of self that consists of a number of different things that from which geyser up or kind of, you know, give rise these feelings of empowerment, humility, agency, and gratitude, and reminded us several times that when we are Challenged when we're not doing as well as we would like, that we need to look back to the structure of self and the function of self and ask specific questions in order to Arrive or rearrive at the sense of agency and gratitude.[0:06:38] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. Yes. I think[0:06:39] Andrew Huberman: it would be wonderful for us if you could just To recap the overall model, because it has the components that I just mentioned, but some subtlety and some really key aspects of These pillars, structure of self and function of self, I think if people keep in mind for today's episode, which is about challenges that people commonly face And even, if you will, phenotypes that we see commonly out there. For people that haven't heard of phenotypes, phenotypes are, the typical appearance of something. So, there is the phenotype of the anxious person, the phenotype of the person who just can't seem to get out of a rut. There's the phenotype of the Traumatized person, and and these things play out differently in in different individuals, men and women, boys and girls. But we're going to visit, many of the most common phenotypes out there And think about how to do better, be better, feel better through the lens of the model that, we spelled out in episode 1.[0:07:36] Andrew Huberman: Of course, if people have not seen or heard episode 1, today's discussion will still be entirely accessible to them. So in keeping with that, if you could just, give us an overview of of what this, structure of the healthy self looks like as a road map for, where we're all headed today.[0:07:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Thank you. Thanks very much. Revisiting the the pillars is is, I think, the best place to start because there really are routes to understanding. And if we understand, then we can strategize, we can make change. Right?[0:08:06] Dr. Paul Conti: We can make things better. So the the the first pillar, the structure of self Starts with the unconscious mind, right, this incredibly complicated biological supercomputer that's firing a mile a minute, right, underneath the surface in us And is throwing up to the surface all sorts of thoughts and ideas and states that then the conscious mind apprehends, and our awareness comes into play. And then we have defense mechanisms that sort of rise up from the unconscious mind, and they they circle and sort of gird themselves around The conscious mind, which they can do in an unhealthy way or in a healthy way or any anything in between. And then the the character structure is sort of the nest Around all of that, and it's from the character structure that we that we are engaging in the world in the ways that we're Engaging, whether it's our active engagement with the world around us, and the idea is that the self grows out of that. It grows out of that nest Sitting on top of the unconscious mind to the conscious mind rising above the defense mechanisms and the character structure.[0:09:09] Dr. Paul Conti: And and if we go back to that when we're trying to understand ourselves, You know, we're trying to understand states of health as well as states of unhappiness or or states that aren't healthy. Right? By by going back In looking at the structure, we can learn a tremendous amount. And the other side, the the the other pillar is the the function of self, and It really starts with a self awareness. Right?[0:09:30] Dr. Paul Conti: The awareness that, hey, there is an eye. Right? I am in the world. Right? This is 24 hours in the day are gonna today, and I'm gonna be doing one thing or another.[0:09:38] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm I'm so I'm to some very significant extent deciding how am I gonna engage in the world around me during that time. Right? So on top of that are the defense mechanisms in action. So defense mechanisms, remember, are unconscious. So there's a lot then going on inside of us That's determining sort of the field set of options.[0:09:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? There may be a lot of automaticity that narrows down the set of options of what we may entertain, what we may be aware of, what we may decide, and that could happen for better or for worse depending upon the health of the defense mechanisms. But on top of that lies salient. So the idea then we would next visit okay. What are we paying attention to?[0:10:17] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. What what's coming from inside? What's coming from outside? And we have to not pay attention to many, many, many, many things in order to pay attention to Whatever our attention is alighted on at the moment, so it's a complex process, and it's worth looking at very closely if we wanna understand ourselves. So after thinking about the the defense mechanisms in action, right, the unconscious aspects of how we're engaging with the world, Then next to consider is salience, which is sort of where does the mind arrive at at rest, or where does the mind trend Taurus, is it something internal?[0:10:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Is it something external? What are all the things we're not paying attention to in order to pay attention to something? And is that thing Healthy, is it not healthy? Is it serving us well? So there's so much to understand about salience.[0:11:04] Dr. Paul Conti: And then the next step beyond that is understanding behavior. Right? How are we Engaging with the world around us, what are our behavioral choices? What are our automatic behaviors? And then sitting on top of all of that are our strivings.[0:11:18] Dr. Paul Conti: So we we have a sense of wanting something in the world around us. And, like, what is that, and how are we trying to get to it, and how does it make us feel? So if we look at the the 10 elements, right, the 5 under the structure of self and the 5 under the function of self, Then what we're really looking at is is sort of like looking at 10 cabinets. Right? And if we're trying to understand ourselves, whether we're trying to just generally understand ourselves or ourselves or we're trying to get at a problem.[0:11:44] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Then looking in all 10 of those cabinets makes sense. Right? Some of them will be bare, meaning that They may seem to have very little to do with the problem we're bringing, and we kind of maintain an open mind. Right?[0:11:54] Dr. Paul Conti: We may be led back to that cabinet, and there may be something There. But what usually happens is if we look in all 10 places, we find a couple where there's there's some rich material to or sort of the x marks the spot, and then we go and we we dig there to sort of mix metaphors. We we dig in the cabinet where we're gonna find something. Right? And then it leads forward a process of understanding.[0:12:15] Dr. Paul Conti: And if we're bringing those things into line where we have a healthy structure of self and a healthy function of self, and we're aware of all of this, and we're working on it. We're self aware, and we're paying attention to everything built on top of that, Then what we end up with is a sense of humility because one cannot be anything but respectful, compassion, and understanding the of of all of this and understanding how does it manifest itself in us and and just the very fact that we can wake our ways in the world, right, is so Just it's so impressive. And in a way, I think it brings to us a respect, just a respect for being here, navigating the world. And I think of that respect is born humility, the complexity of us, the fact that millions of things are going on underneath the surface, millions of Of, neurotransmission and endocrinological function, all of this is going on into the surface. I'm not even aware of it, and then it kicks up to the surface, generates a tremendous amount of respect for the complexity and also the diligence and perseverance it takes us to navigate through the world.[0:13:19] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think Built upon that understanding is a sense of humility and a sense of empowerment. And the humility and empowerment in action. Right? So so expressed. Right.[0:13:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Become agency and gratitude. And agency and gratitude, as you said at the beginning, we're seeing as verbs. Right? That's, like, how we're living Life. It's it's through the lens, so to speak, of agency and gratitude that we're actively living.[0:13:44] Dr. Paul Conti: And again, I would put forth that when we look at measures of human happiness, Right. Across disciplines and across time, this is always what we see is is some way of describing how agency and gratitude together as verbs Manifest and then create happiness. It's the state that we're seeking to be in. Right? Because from that state of active agency and active gratitude, We achieve what it is that I think we're really searching for.[0:14:11] Dr. Paul Conti: And, you know, there are by infinite words, throughout human history to describe what that is, We might choose to use words like peacefulness, a sense of peace, a sense of contentment, being delighted by things. Like, just being amazed and impressed by things in the world around us. Like, this is a state that we're striving for. And I think when people talk about happiness and what we're really Trying to get to, it's this. Right?[0:14:37] Dr. Paul Conti: But it it's not that these things are passive. Right? These things are coming from the active Agency, the act of gratitude, and they're then interacting with a generative drive within us. We have an aggressive drive. We have a Pleasure drive.[0:14:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, this has been thought about now for a long, long time within mental health and validated in a lot of ways, but what hasn't been validated is that they're the only things. Right. We see human beings striving. We see human beings wanting better for themselves and for the world around them. We see acts of kindness that that seem to be rooted To nothing other than the act of kindness.[0:15:13] Dr. Paul Conti: We have within us a drive to know, to understand, to learn, to make better, And that has been described as many, many things across human history, but I think the words we might choose are generative drive, a drive to create and to make better. And it's the the generative drive as something active within us, right, that is then allying with agency and gratitude. Right. The active ways in which we express ourselves, and then that altogether brings us the peace, the contentment, the sense of delight. Sometimes that may exist in us in a state of rest.[0:15:49] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But very often, it's in it's existing in us in a state of activity. Right? And that's why People find, you know, the quote unquote happiness, like what people are seeking, not just in, you know, meditation. Sometimes we can find it there, but people also find it in In action, right, they find it in doing that thing that they love to do or taking care of someone and learning something.[0:16:10] Dr. Paul Conti: So When we look at all of this, we we can then we can then have a route of understanding what is going on inside of us and how We can make the changes that let us be in this state, which is really the state that we're seeking.[0:16:25] Andrew Huberman: I really appreciate that you like the agency and gratitude are verb states, from which peace, contentment, and delight emerge, and Also, the way that you explain the generative drive that, is distinct from aggressive drives and pleasure drives that exist in all of us. You know, I I'm smiling because a number of examples of, peace, contentment, and delight while in action come to mind. I mean, for me, Podcasting and, in particular, preparing for a podcast, trying to mine the literature and figure out, you know, where the gems reside and where the confusion could Could emerge and, all of that brings about such peace, contentment, and delight for me, but it's it's anything but passive. It's, likewise, yesterday, had the experience of running into a a puppy. It's been a while since I've owned a dog, and, dogs are delightful.[0:17:18] Andrew Huberman: Puppies are particularly delightful.[0:17:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Experience of seeing you light up when you ran into the puppy.[0:17:23] Andrew Huberman: You know, I and, you did. And, and I'm still buzzing from that short interaction with the puppy downstairs, the There's a Weyman or puppy. It's just that I don't know why, but I just delight in in animals of of most all kinds. Not a fan of reptiles. Sorry, reptile fans.[0:17:39] Andrew Huberman: So much, but I just drive so much energy from it, and it felt like life energy and the the way that animal is sort of intentionally scattered is amusing to me as Compared to the dog that he will eventually be, which is going to be more linear in his thinking, like, it encapsulates so much of the other things I love, like brain development, etcetera. Anyway, I Highlight those examples because, there's nothing passive about it. It's pure delight and joy for me, And it intersects with other delights and joys. And I think that, as you describe agency and gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight in these Generative forces, as well as other forces that exist in us, I think it's really, critical that, people understand that, Yeah. These are not states that you sit down and and place yourself into.[0:18:25] Andrew Huberman: Although perhaps one could through, reflection or meditation or waking up from a really great night sleep, things of that sort. But that, these are things that we can find ourselves awash in if we are doing the right things, those things can oftentimes be very challenging. So assuming I understand the way the model is spelled out correctly, I'm more and more delighted at the fact that this is not just accessible in one domain, but is accessible in many, many different domains For everybody. Right? This is not something unique to my experience even though I give examples from my own life, but, that we really All do have access to this if we're looking in those cupboards, those 10 cupboards, and asking the right questions.[0:19:11] Dr. Paul Conti: And and to maybe comment even a little further on the experience of of you and the dog. Right? So so it was a An experience of delight. Right? And and you enjoyed it and brought a sense of peace and contentment, like, all of that happens.[0:19:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But think about what that's linked to. Like, I I believe there's a strong sense of agency in you that you are enacting. There's a strong gratitude in you that you're enacting. You're you're handling your life in a way.[0:19:38] Dr. Paul Conti: And and also for all of us, good things always come with good fortune, but but it comes with our strivings and our achievements that you're in a place to delight in that. Right. If you are unhappy, like, I don't like what I'm doing. I'm I'm angry. I'm frustrated.[0:19:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Then there's no room in you to to find the delight. Right? And the delight that you find is also very much linked to the generative drive. Right?[0:20:00] Dr. Paul Conti: That it makes me think of how you you loved and nurtured Casello. Right? So you have it in you to love and nurture a dog, and you have done that in a really wonderful way. And that generative drive is part and parcel of the delight You feel when you see a dog because you love dogs and you think about nurturing, and it all comes together. The the, the Agency and the gratitude expressed as verbs puts you in a position to have that sense of delight, which is so intertwined with your generative Drive with a sense of caretaking, a sense of creating the the beyond self.[0:20:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Because although you enjoyed and loved Casello, you enjoyed and loved his happiness. Right. So it all comes together, and I think it's interesting because in some ways, it's a simple example, but, like, that's life. You know? Life has its It's big moments, but but so much of our lives are the smaller moments that link together, and I think that smaller moment becomes a big example.[0:20:55] Andrew Huberman: I appreciate that you mentioned Costello. For listeners of this podcast that have tuned into early episodes, Costello was the source of the background snoring, for those of you that haven't, you can go check. He's a he was a 90 pound English bulldog mastiff who, who had many skills, the best of which was Snoring. So in addition to the generative drive, which is something that we certainly wanna, talk more about today, you mentioned these Other drives, aggressive drives, and pleasure drives. And much of what we're talking about today is going to be where people can go wrong or where people struggle.[0:21:30] Andrew Huberman: We are also, of course, going to go deeply into where people succeed and in particular, where people can ask questions of themselves. In particular, what is working for them and why as a route to understanding how to sift through those cupboards and understand what's not working and why, and come up with real actionable answers, and and then the ability to move forward. So if If[0:21:58] Dr. Paul Conti: you would, could you tell us[0:21:59] Andrew Huberman: a little bit more about drives generally? Like like, you know, when I hear drives, I I can't help as a neuroscientist, but default to, okay, the dopamine or the, the endogenous opioid circuit or the, serotonergic circuit. But, you know, how do you conceptualize drives within us? And and then perhaps you could tell us what the nature of aggressive drives and pleasure drives and generative drives.[0:22:26] Dr. Paul Conti: So the the concept of a drive, the definition of a drive is is something that's intrinsic to humans. So we could look at it as A motivation. Right? I mean, we don't just lie on the ground and do nothing until we passively die. Right.[0:22:44] Dr. Paul Conti: So something is going on inside of us that is driving us to do something other than that. And historically, the thinking in the field arising from early psychodynamic principles, the the the the theory in the field That has really dominated the field either directly or indirectly in so many ways has been that there are 2 drives within us. That there there's aggression And pleasure. And, again, these are just words. Right?[0:23:12] Dr. Paul Conti: So we could put apply many, many words, which is why, of course, we wanna define what that means. Right? So aggression, even though we're we're using that word for it because the word for it is commonly used. Right? But it means it means sort of forward Active engagement.[0:23:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So so a a good healthy amount of aggression using that word for the drive would be a strong sense of agency. And so so too little aggression can be a problem. Right? Then the person isn't bringing themselves to bear.[0:23:43] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So there's too little in the way of Self determination, forward movement, empowerment agency. Right? And and in the same way, too much Of this drive becomes actual aggression. So, you know, the idea that I want more and if I can't get it in in certain ways, I'll just take it.[0:24:01] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So so then so it starts to become, you know, what we more map to the word aggression, which which should be something negative in most cases.[0:24:10] Andrew Huberman: Like Like a desire or a tendency to harm.[0:24:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Is that Yeah. Sure. We as as aggressive drives get higher, which you see why they're in us because Let's say we're defending ourselves or or or you're defending a family member, right, or or, like, an entire family, right, then it It it makes sense to have high levels of aggression if, like, your family is threatened. Right? So so those drives are in us with with potentially those high levels for a reason, But we we certainly access very high levels of aggression without the the indication of preservation of life or preservation of Safety.[0:24:44] Dr. Paul Conti: So so the the thought is that's a drive in us, and that gets us up and off the ground, so to speak. Right? And that the other drive then is pleasure, which again doesn't just mean that, like, we we all wanna be hedonist. Right? So so pleasure could be even The pleasure of relief and safety.[0:25:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, we're like, you know, we're all back in the cave together, and and we roll the stone in front of the door. We're safe. You know, through throughout human Development, you know, pleasure comes in a lot of ways. It can come through the pleasure of food or other people, you know, friendship, romance, sex.[0:25:18] Dr. Paul Conti: There are a lot of ways we can Achieve pleasure can be relief of things that are unpleasant, you know, relief of pain. But there there's a drive towards this in humans, which again really does make Sense and and too little of it, again, can be problematic because the person then isn't motivated to sort of seek things because they're they're not anticipating or don't receive and too much of a drive for pleasure can also create problems. So so we can kinda see how these Two drives, like, okay, they get us up and off the ground, so to speak. But the the question is, do they explain everything? Right?[0:25:54] Dr. Paul Conti: And it's a very important question because if they playing everything, then there's not really there's not room for Behaviors and choices that are beyond the self. Right? There's not an explanation for the person who I'll I'll give you an an example of, a person I've taken care of who's is a very strong swimmer, you know, knows how to swim, has swam throughout his life, Who was in a place? I saw video of it where there'd been a hurricane and the waves were so frightening. You know, they were just huge this huge surf, and There were people who who had gotten dragged out, and you just see him he runs into the water.[0:26:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? He runs in and he goes, and and he was really at risk. He needs to be saved himself, but he saved them. And I do not believe you can explain that through these drives. I don't think you can say, well, that was he was aggressive.[0:26:52] Dr. Paul Conti: He he wanted to go and do something, you know, that was imposing himself on the world, or He got pleasure in thinking, I'm strong enough to go do this. I mean, I think we're really gyrating. You know? We're contorting ourselves, right, in order to explain it That way, if we think there's a goodness in that man's heart like, I know there's a goodness in that man's heart. I know him.[0:27:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and and that goodness ceases in in the moment, and, You know, he knows that maybe he can save them. Maybe he can. He's not sure, but maybe he can. So the next thing you know, he's in the water.[0:27:22] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think things like the love and nurturing of Of other people, you know, of children, love and nurturing of animals, of plants. Right? Like, there there are things inside of us that we can't explain with those 2 drives. And and I think they have led to a very sort of darker way of just conceiving of humans. You know?[0:27:40] Dr. Paul Conti: I I think it's a reason why Now, you know, you look at us in the in the modern day and age, we come at humans through the lens of pathology. Right? I mean, there's a there's a very, very thick book That if if a person is assessing another person, you know, is thinking about, like, okay. What what numbers in the that book apply? Right?[0:27:57] Dr. Paul Conti: Which is, like, that's not the way to go about understanding humans. And I think if we just think there are those 2 drives, we're not doing justice to to humans. Right? 1, I think it's not True. I think it's evident that it's not true.[0:28:09] Dr. Paul Conti: And then if we're framing it in a way that's not true, we are not appropriately respectful of humans. And If we come from what I believe to be the truth, that there is a generative drive in, it's a drive for the beyond self, a drive to make things Better whether it has anything really directly to do with me or not. And as with the other drives, you know, there can be more or less in people, a combination of nature and nurture. You know, what what Genetically is in us a predisposition, you know, based upon the genetic lineage that comes down to us and the recombination. And now we're a unique person With a unique set of drives, but they are impacted by the genetics, and then they're impacted by life experience, so more Strongly formative life experience.[0:28:52] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So the younger the person, the the sort of deeper the impact of events. They have nurturing versus abuse, Right on the the array, on the relative weighting of drives within people. But ultimately, we get to These 3 drives and how they're functioning in a person being a way of understanding and assessing, like, how Healthy or not healthy, the person is. And then we look back to those 10 cupboards, Right.[0:29:22] Dr. Paul Conti: For the answers, if we're finding things that we don't like, these just drives are out of balance, and they're and here are the problems they're causing. So very, very concrete issues, This, right, of problems in people's lives, we can look and see where is that out of balance. And if it's out of balance, there's something in those pillars that are not in the right place. We can then go back and look in all those covers for, like, oh, where do we dig to find the answer? Right?[0:29:45] Dr. Paul Conti: We learn Things we we bring things more into balance. Right? So so the pillars are in a healthier place, and then what sits on top of it as you use the word geyser. Right? The geyser that then comes up and Floats everything on top of it can do that in a in a healthy way.[0:30:00] Andrew Huberman: And during episode 1, we touched on some of the similarities between understanding the self and, building towards a healthy or healthiest version of self where agency and gratitude are the states that are being expressed. And One of the themes there was this idea, you know, people perhaps want to be healthy so that they live a long time, but Presumably, they also want to be healthy so that they can walk up flights of stairs, pick up their kids, move objects, not get injured, perhaps even do sport or, and, of course, some people want to be healthy for aesthetic reasons as well. And if we were having a discussion about physical health, we could Dress the major pillars there, which were were, items within the cover, like, you know, most people want, some ability to have endurance or stamina to walk some distance or maybe even run some distance. As I mentioned before, walk up a flight of stairs, have some strength, some degree of flexibility, Certainly, some mobility, maybe even dynamic mobility, etcetera. And in order to address those or improve upon those, they could Look in those cupboards and say, well, how much, you know, running, swimming, you know, long form cardiovascular exercise am I doing per week?[0:31:12] Andrew Huberman: How many steps am I taking per day? How many times a week do I lift objects that are slightly heavier than is comfortable for me to lift, etcetera. It's it's very tangible, very concrete. Here you're making the the psyche and the and and the self and mental health, very much Concrete in some of the same way saying there are 10 covers that one can look in. And these drives, as you refer to them, as, generative drive, aggressive drive, and pleasure drive, you'll probably tell us in a few minutes, can be expressed to varying degrees in different people and how that shows up and what that looks like.[0:31:47] Andrew Huberman: I just wanna frame this in people's minds as very similar to addressing whether or not, okay, if somebody can run very long distances, but they're always, you know, Having aches and pains or they they they feel weak or they are weak. You know? There are good reasons for that. They're overemphasizing one form of, exercise, the expression is more along the lines of endurance and stamina, not strength, or vice versa. The the power lifter who can, you know, lift, You know, £750 from the floor in a deadlift, but walks up 2 flights of stairs and is, you know, belly breathing and has to stop at the top of the stairs.[0:32:21] Andrew Huberman: You know, it's it's obvious in the physical realm. It's slightly, more cryptic or more cryptic in the psychological realm, But here it's becoming concrete for us.[0:32:30] Dr. Paul Conti: So I think it's it's very interesting and very ironic. Right? So the field that I'm in, the field of psychiatry Has historically wanted to be sort of part of the rest of medicine or like the rest of medicine. And and what I believe it's ended up doing is glorifying a taxonomy. Right?[0:32:49] Dr. Paul Conti: Glorifying a a a category, mechanism of understanding human beings. So in the way that That if okay. If I'm a, practicing general medicine and you come in and you're congested and and I determine, like, oh, you have You have bacterial sinusitis. Right? So so now I I've made a diagnosis, and now the I I know what I'm gonna do about that.[0:33:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. So so the okay. I'm gonna prescribe an antibiotic. Now the thought comes in of, like, what antibiotic. Right?[0:33:17] Dr. Paul Conti: But the identify sinusitis, now you need an antibiotic It's like kinda how medicine works. Right? So the thought was psychiatry is gonna categorize everything. Right? So we'd say, okay, I've listened to you.[0:33:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I know your number Or your numbers. Right? And then once I've given you the numbers, now I know what to do. I I prescribe this medicine, that medicine, these many sessions of a certain kind of psychotherapy, and, like, That doesn't work. Right?[0:33:41] Dr. Paul Conti: It doesn't work in mental health. It may. I mean, it's just it's not that it never works. But if you're gonna try and understand People, like, it's different, the problem of self. Like, if I have a lack of confidence in one area of life and not in others, Right.[0:33:56] Dr. Paul Conti: That's a significant issue. It is not like bacterial sinusitis where then, you know, okay, arrow goes to prescribe antibiotic. And I think what is ironic is that this route of approach, right, Actually does bring psychiatry or mental health into line with the rest of medicine. Right? Which is why You you can make that parallel, and, you know, it fits well, right, when you're making the parallel to physical health and to, I wanna be healthy.[0:34:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Okay. What are the components of that? What am I doing to achieve that? Something's not the way I want, let me go back and look at those components. I mean, it may be because it's more tangible, sort of Essentially easier to comprehend.[0:34:40] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because it's more it's more concrete. But but I don't, in a sense, See, it is cryptic, just less obvious. Right? But if we go and we look at it and we say, oh, like, that really makes sense.[0:34:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and In a sense, it makes sense that it makes sense. Right? If there's a mechanism of understanding that applies to lots and lots of things that are more concrete, Why would a similar kind of mechanism like, understand what the components are, understand what's built on top of them like, this, I believe is how psychiatry actually fits with the rest of medicine, not by glorifying a taxonomy, but by coming through the lens of Understanding.[0:35:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I couldn't agree more, and I I think that, what's so reassuring is that both in terms of Creating physical health across the various domains of, you know, heart health, lung health, endurance, strength, etcetera, Cognitive health as well as mental health is verbs. You know, it comes back to action items that we each and all should engage in in order to arrive at the Dates and, you know, ways of being that we all want to be in. Right? We wanna feel healthy, look healthy, you know, etcetera.[0:35:49] Andrew Huberman: We want to, Be happy. Right? I I know very few people who don't want to be happy. I mean, certainly, there are people who give up, but, we'll talk about that today and and routes out of that. But At the end of the day, it's all about looking in those bins, asking specific questions, and then moving forward in specific actions to get To the place of empowerment, humility, agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight, etcetera, as opposed to Simply using words and understanding to arrive at insight and then stopping there and expecting everything to change.[0:36:24] Andrew Huberman: And I think that's where a lot of people are confused about psychology, g therapy and psychiatry. And, and as you mentioned, psychiatry has its own, Shadows, if you will, within it where the the use of of drugs, which cert certainly can be very useful, even life saving. Absolutely. Oftentimes is is seen as a, a fix all that, somehow could reorder everything within the cupboards and and make the recipe just right when in fact so talk about today that that is, generally not the best route. But, again, with the understanding that drugs can be very powerful tools[0:36:58] Dr. Paul Conti: play a role. Right. But it's important we understand what role is appropriate for them, and that's where we often go astray.[0:37:05] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, AG one. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs. I started taking AG one way back in 2012, So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking AG one and the reason I still take AG one once or generally twice per day is that it's the easiest way for me to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber that I need in my diet. Now, of course, it's essential to get proper nutrition from whole foods, But most people, including myself, find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day and especially to get enough prebiotics and probiotics to ensure gut health.[0:37:45] Andrew Huberman: As you may know, your gut contains trillions of little microbiota, the so called gut microbiome, which establishes critical connections with other organs of your body to enhance brain health as well as to support your immune system and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health. One of the most common questions I get Is if you were to take just 1 supplement, which supplement would that be? And my answer is always AG one. Because by taking AG one, I'm able to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins, minerals, and probiotics that I need to enhance my mental health, physical health, and performance. You'd like to try a g one, go to drink a g one.com/huberman to claim a special offer.[0:38:22] Andrew Huberman: They'll give you 5 free travel packs, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Again, that's drink a g one.com/huberman to claim this special offer. So As we move forward here in defining and and helping people gain, for lack of a better Agency over their own mental health and and self understanding and defining for them what what action items to take. You know, I think I'd like to ask you about some of the things that I observe in the world and hear a lot about, in particular from the audience of this podcast. You know, It's obvious to me that people vary in terms of their level of aggressive drive, pleasure drive, and presumably generative drive as well.[0:39:08] Andrew Huberman: One common question is, how do I become more motivated? Right? You know? And, of course, that opens up a bunch of other questions like, are people afraid of failure? And that's why they're not motivated.[0:39:22] Andrew Huberman: Are people afraid of success? Is that why they're not motivated? Is there some underlying childhood trauma or unconscious process, that's driving that fear, and so on? But if we were to Take the psychiatrist's perspective, your perspective. If someone comes to you and says, you know, I, you know, I just don't really feel like trying.[0:39:42] Andrew Huberman: It's, you know, school's hard. School loans are, you know, are excessive, which is true, by the way. You know, it's not even clear that with a a degree, I can do much, you know, or, I had a series of failures in in the work domain or in the relationship domain, and and they're just feeling Weighed down as if it's not worth trying, you know, what does that tell you in terms of where to look? And and what does that tell you in terms of their drives? I mean, do we conclude something about their innate level of aggressive drive, or their pleasure drive or their generative drive?[0:40:15] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I think there are many such people out there, and then we'll consider some other, kind of, phenotypic examples. Right. So it's[0:40:22] Dr. Paul Conti: a great example because so, Any good clinician, right, could could hear that story and then and have thoughts about it, right, that that Could and would hopefully be helpful, right, without necessarily referring to drives. Right? So so I think you can anchor Any set of assessments, any evaluation, any attempted understanding 2 drives, right, but but it doesn't have to be that way. So for example, You might ask that person more questions about what they're doing, how they spend their time, because you you're telling me about someone Who's not in getting enjoyment or gratification out of anything. Right?[0:41:03] Dr. Paul Conti: And and that then becomes of interest To me, right, is is there is there something this person does enjoy, right, or something they'd rather be doing? Like, did they did they Go to college and take on a bunch of loans because they thought that was better, because they thought they were gonna do something that now they actually don't wanna do. Right? Or that opportunity isn't there, and now they're frustrated. Like, what is inside this person that might seem different And that and and again, the answers could be complicated.[0:41:30] Dr. Paul Conti: It could be maybe that person enjoys what they're doing, but the cost of living where they are is so high That they still feel miserable, there's a sense of privation, and then that gets back mapped to like, I don't I'm not getting any pleasure out of anything. Right? So the answer could be as simple as you strategize with a person of you know, for example, does a person like that move, you know, move to a different area? So So, like, there's so many ways of looking at this and so many ways of understanding this, but you're describing someone to me who Who is kind of really complaining that nothing is feeling good. Right?[0:42:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Nothing's providing a sense of, of enjoyment or of pleasure. Right? So I I would probably be interested in that first and think maybe the the pleasure drive is higher than what's being fulfilled. Right? Maybe the pleasure drive is is Low, and that's an issue in and of itself.[0:42:20] Dr. Paul Conti: We sort of learn those things. Right? Maybe the aggressive drive is low and, you know, if that person just put a little more Energy into it. Right? Like, they could be in a different place.[0:42:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So you're trying to help the person understand themselves so that you can make change. And again, that understanding doesn't have to be anchored to to the drives, but I do believe the drives are at the root of all understanding. Because if you sit with that person and you talk to that person, then you're gonna be able to understand what is out of balance. Right?[0:42:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Either in the the actual array of the drives or in how they're being being experienced. Because, again, if you have a high pleasure drive To for example and it's not gratified. Right? Like, that represents a problem. Right?[0:43:06] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah.[0:43:07] Andrew Huberman: What what about people who, can experience some pleasure or can keep busy, say, for instance, on social media or playing video games, and I should also say perhaps bringing them to a place of peace, contentment, and delight, but in some sense, it's not really generative. Right? It you know, I'm not going Going to cast judgment and say that video games and social media are all a waste of time. I mean, I'm on social media trying to provide value to people and learnings, and, and I drive value and learnings from other accounts as well. But, you know, there are these, milestones, if you will, in life.[0:43:40] Andrew Huberman: I mean, not that everyone has to, you know, go to college and and get married and have a family. I mean, there are a lot of different paths through life that I would consider successful. But in some sense, we you know, there are milestones. Like, we wanna move forward. There's this phenomena nowadays of a lot of, young people and so called failure to launch.[0:43:59] Andrew Huberman: Like, they're they're not leaving home or they're not finding a vocation. They're not they're not feeling as if they're good at anything, or or they have the sense that unless you're going to be a, you know, like, top 1% in something, it's not worth trying, but they can still find, you know, what most people would describe as pleasures. Like, they might they enjoy food, maybe a little too much. They enjoy, call maybe a little too much. They enjoy social media or video games, maybe a little too much.[0:44:25] Andrew Huberman: I say a little too much because it it's providing more or less a, a sink or a or a reservoir for their aggressive and pleasure drives that's not moving them forward in The the standard milestones of life. Mhmm. I I hear about that a lot. I I see that a lot. You know, so it's a slightly more, complex, phenotype than described before is just simply the amotivated or non motivated person, but, you know, What does 1 you know, what do you think of of that, of the phenotype I just described?[0:45:00] Dr. Paul Conti: Again, because we're unique. Right. Each person is unique, although we fit categories. Right? So there are categories a person there could fit that could be different from what I'm saying.[0:45:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But I think Most people, they say on balance. Right? What's what is most prominent? Right?[0:45:17] Dr. Paul Conti: I think what is most prominent in that situation is There's something out of balance in the generative drive. Right? And what you see a lot of times is the person has a generative drive In them, that's higher than their ability to to realize that drive. The generative drive then is frustrated. So I'll give an example.[0:45:38] Dr. Paul Conti: It's a a real true story of a person who had worked very, very hard, gone to school for a long time, and it achieved a very high paying job. Like, that was the goal. Right? It's a prestigious job. It's a high paying job.[0:45:50] Dr. Paul Conti: And the person, for a while, was was doing quite well at it. And, you know, things went relatively rapidly in a negative directions. Maybe for a little while, the person's doing okay. Then the person becomes very negligent of themselves and their environment when they're not at the job. So, you know, the the House is a mess.[0:46:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Things are dirty. The person is wasting time with things. So this is a person who enjoys it wasn't exactly video games. I will say let's Say it could have been. Right?[0:46:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, it enjoys them to a certain degree and can really gain pleasure and feel good about the time spent. Right? But start spending too much time. Right now, what was pleasurable starts becoming a distraction mechanism. Right?[0:46:34] Dr. Paul Conti: And then what that transition to was overuse of alcohol. Right? So now you have either something that is actually destructive and was negative to job performance, Right. Towards the person, this wasn't a person who was drinking a lot before, and this is a person who was miserable when they were drinking, or they were sort of Wasting their time. Right?[0:46:53] Dr. Paul Conti: And we're aware of all of this. Well, there's a very clear problem, which is that that person Had no interest in what they were doing. None whatsoever. It felt like the majority of waking hours were spent In an automaton like way, but being awake and aware of the tedium of it, the frustration[0:47:17] Andrew Huberman: Of it. The professional side. So they they so she had very little, intrinsic curiosity or desire to do the job that they were Successfully doing.[0:47:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Which comes out only after exploration because it seems like what's going on with this person? Like, this person has a good job, and their life is going really, really well, and and they're doing well financially. And, you know, is this person trying to now, you know, overly indulge themselves? Right?[0:47:40] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, is that why they're drinking? Going on. Right? And what you you feel is that this person had a strong generative drive, and it wasn't met one little bit By what he was doing, which was creating such frustration inside that the person was either taking himself online or doing something that was punitive and self injurious. And, like, this is a real story.[0:48:00] Dr. Paul Conti: The the the person exchanged that job for a job that paid a tenth of what the job they had Paid. And the change in the person's life was amazing. Like, I didn't know this guy could smile. Right? He became happy.[0:48:15] Dr. Paul Conti: He loved what he was doing. He sold a larger house, bought a smaller house, kept it beautifully. Like, he was happy. Right? That's what he needed to be happy Because then the generative drive in him, he loved what he was doing, right, gets enacted.[0:48:28] Dr. Paul Conti: It gets expressed. And then other other things can come then into line. Right. He's not being overaggressive towards himself and drinking too much, you know, because he's saying, oh, to hell with you, to the world around him, and to himself. Right?[0:48:41] Dr. Paul Conti: He's not taking something that serves a purpose in his life. Like, again, if the example had been video games, it would be like, yeah, great. You enjoy doing that x amount of time and, like, go do that and get gratification from it as opposed to then overrelying on it, and then it's not providing gratification. It becomes a distraction. So Those things came back into balance in his life, but there had to be the understanding.[0:49:03] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think there's a lot of that in people who have a generative drive in them that they feel is Frustrated by a world around them that isn't cooperating. Now do I think we can understand that and change that in the vast majority of people who are in that place? Yes. But it has to be looked at first. Right?[0:49:19] Dr. Paul Conti: Because when it's not always that. It's just that a lot of the time. Right? So it has to be understood. What is it in that person?[0:49:26] Dr. Paul Conti: And then how do you go back to those pillars and look at what's going on that the person is in that place? Because the world can bring us a lot of Difficulties. Right? And that person who now is saddled with a lot more loans than they expect. Like, I have tremendous compassion for that and sympathy for that.[0:49:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, that's real. Right? People can be up against a lot of things, and that's just one of them. Right? But it doesn't mean that life can't be okay.[0:49:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It doesn't mean that. But the person has to feel that there's some way, they have to understand enough, about themselves. Okay. This is what this is, and I kinda See what this is and why and how I'm here.[0:50:03] Dr. Paul Conti: And from there, I can start to plot a route to something that is Better because, yes, we have our difficulties, and we can have a lot of them. Right? But it's for the vast majority of us, it's not like they're not surmountable. We have to just understand them. And let's say if that person goes and say, I'm gonna get some help.[0:50:21] Dr. Paul Conti: And they go and someone says, okay. Wait. You you get 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, and you try, like, how can that person think differently, then they'll feel differently. Look. Cognitive behavioral therapy has its place.[0:50:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But It's not gonna solve that. Right? Like, that person needs to understand something about themselves, not redirect their thoughts to better places. Right?[0:50:39] Dr. Paul Conti: So if the person gets a reflex Because that reflux works well for the system. Right? Reflux works well for the system that's treating that person, for the medical system, the insurance system. That person isn't helped one bit. Right.[0:50:52] Dr. Paul Conti: And maybe a medicine can help. Right? Maybe a medicine helps to just take down the anxiety and the tension in the person, then the person can sort of think more about it. And And truly, medicine did help this person because the idea of leaving the job I'm leaving the prestige. I'm leaving the money.[0:51:06] Dr. Paul Conti: Is that okay to do? Like, it generated a lot of anxiety, And it helped to kind of bring the temperature down a little bit of that so that he could think about it, engage in therapy, ultimately navigate to where he wanted to be, Then we could back away from the medicine. So, like, medicine has a role, but if if he just got medicine, I mean, what are the possibility what are the odds of that helping? Like, 0. Right?[0:51:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Because it's it's not gonna make the answers, unless somehow the person feels a little bit better and figures it out on their own. It's not how it works. Right? So medicine Has its place, but a a a a kind of therapy that recognizes the limitations of medicine in most situations And it's designed to really help the person understand, like, that's what we need.[0:51:46] Andrew Huberman: Well, the example you gave is a spectacular one because As you mentioned, medication had its place. Perhaps even redirection of thought in some sense had its place because As I recall, under the the pillar of function of self, one of the the the key items, is salience. You know, what we pay attention to internally or externally, our internal narratives are. But, in staying with the example of this individual, again, as a as a phenotypic, example for everybody to to learn something from, The asking of better questions about oneself is really what leads to The understanding so that like, better forms of inquiry. Right?[0:52:28] Andrew Huberman: The to me, the these are the these better forms of inquiry, better questions are really the, cardiovascular exercise, the strength training, the flexibility training, the mobility training, coordination training of Physical health just translate to to mental health. Right.[0:52:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It's so it's so interesting. Right? Because if you think about it, in the example I gave, Both the the therapy part from through the system. Right?[0:52:54] Dr. Paul Conti: The the CBT has a place. Right? And the medicine part Also had a play. So both of those things have their role, but if we build the whole story of, like, this is what this is and this is how you're gonna be helped around those things, We don't help that person at all. In fact, we ultimately if you take on balance, you take all comers, we end up doing harm.[0:53:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, in some ways, if I we stay with the, The analogy of physical health, it would be like the person who wants to get in shape, and then they get a a no. I'm not picking on Peloton, as a brand, but just a stationary bike. And they they pedal every morning, and they lose weight. Their blood pressure goes down. They're doing better.[0:53:31] Andrew Huberman: But then at some point, if we we know for with certainty that if you just do the same form of exercise over and over again, like, sooner or later, you're gonna get overuse injuries. So then there's, like, the lower back piece and another piece, and and you become out of balance. Right? There's just But, you know, I guess this is stealing from the Lance Armstrong book, but it's not about the bike. Right?[0:53:48] Andrew Huberman: I mean, that you know, it's not about the bike. It's about the Elevation of heart rate. It's about the, whatever other healthy activities go along with exercising first thing in the morning and the all the things that you're not doing as a consequence of Exercising in the morning. So it it seems to me that these these, better lines of inquiry as the path to, Better mental health, a better life, that sit under these pillars of structure or[0:54:13] Dr. Paul Conti: self function of self are really the key. So in this example, right, the parallel that you made is even more dramatic. Right? It wouldn't be the the stationary bike. Right?[0:54:23] Dr. Paul Conti: Because the stationary bike is Achieving a lot of ends. Right? It would be more like telling the person, you know, you should walk more briskly when you're going upstairs. Right? Like, that's a good idea, But that's not gonna make the change.[0:54:36] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So the idea that some CBT, some medicine makes sense. It's more like that. Right? It's not that walking more briskly up the stairs Isn't a good thing.[0:54:45] Dr. Paul Conti: It's that we we can't build the story around your whole health is gonna change based upon that. And then that's that's a problem then if the person thinks just walk more briskly up the stairs and you'll be healthier. Because when it doesn't work, now they've failed. Right? And this gets used a lot in mental.[0:55:03] Dr. Paul Conti: That person failed this therapy, failed that medicine. Right? And and it gets so Also ironic because that's often what the person internalizes. Well, they failed because we set them up 100% for Failure. Right?[0:55:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Because we took things that have their role, at least potentially have their role, and we built the whole story around them Because that story is convenient for the systems that are providing the care. It's For it's convenient for the health care systems. It's convenient for the insurers. CBT packages very nicely, and you could see how you know, if you start changing thoughts and How they make you feel like, you you know, you can get some movement on the surface even if there's no movement underneath. Right?[0:55:49] Dr. Paul Conti: And, again, I'm not saying CBT is bad, But to see it as the whole answer guarantees failure in so many situations. Same thing with the medicine. If you build the whole story just because it's convenient, and And by and large, medicines are cheaper than people. Right? So so you can prescribe medicines very reflexively.[0:56:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Psychiatrists with 15 minutes With a patient that they can't then see back for a couple of months, like, how does that go well? The answer is it only goes well the way a broken clock is right a couple of times, you know, or twice twice a day. Right? I mean, some look, sometimes it goes well where it just somehow works out, and then that person could do a little bit of therapy in medicine choose the right medicines. But by and large, we do those things because they're convenient for the systems even though that's why, Like, people don't get better.[0:56:36] Dr. Paul Conti: Like like, we think they would. That's why they stay in systems. That's why they come in and out of emergency rooms. That's why they're not able to stop the drugs that end up, You know, only being stopped when the person dies. Like, this happens all the time, and we don't stop it because we're coming from a perspective That is so limited.[0:56:55] Dr. Paul Conti: It's not saying let's take a step back and look. Can we really, like, help someone? Can we really help that person understand? Can we help that person make Change, which ultimately would be, of course, so much better for the person and so much better for society, But it's also better if we just look at bottom line dollars and cents. Right?[0:57:15] Dr. Paul Conti: Because the short term view of it is Cheaper today to have a psychiatrist at a 15 minute appointment reflexively prescribe a medicine. That is cheaper today. Is that cheaper across time When that person is utilizing more resources or they're in and out of emergency rooms, it's so shortsighted with which fits with many ways in How our society works. Right? That we want gratification, and we want gratification rapidly.[0:57:38] Dr. Paul Conti: That's why a person would accept that their problems could be Changed by medicine. Right? We're kinda conditioned that way.[0:57:43] Andrew Huberman: Well and then, of course, there's the the cost we don't see, which is that person doesn't get the opportunity to express their generative drive, And so the the and the the consequence of that is incalculable.[0:57:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Yes. And if we take a step back and we look at that, I think that what we will see is that we have it's not quite, like, painted ourselves into a corner, but it's like, you know, the Idea that if there's a a beautiful tapestry that's the size of the wall, right, that you can see that only standing back from it. Right? I mean, this goes back, You know, I think a couple 1000 years, right, this this sort of thought and idea.[0:58:17] Dr. Paul Conti: But if you come up too close to it, then you can't see what it means anymore. And we're up so close To it that we're thinking, well, okay. How could 1 parameter change? And, you know, can can this person get a 15 minute visit sooner rather than later? Or how about this medicine instead of that?[0:58:31] Dr. Paul Conti: And then it's like our noses right up against the tapestry, and we don't see that we're not doing right by individual people a a lot of the Time and we're not doing right by society, which then if you stop and think about it, we're not doing right by us. Because any one of us could be In that position, and many of us have been in that position, being on the other side of things and really needing help and needing to understand. So any of us can be there. So if we're failing a lot of individual people and we're failing the society, it doesn't matter who we are listening to this. Like, ultimately, we're failing Ourselves.[0:59:10] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking I've spoken many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the fact that getting a quality night sleep on a regular basis is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. When we're sleeping well, everything goes better. And when we are not sleeping well or enough, everything in terms of mental health, physical health, and performance gets far worse very quickly. One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.[0:59:41] Andrew Huberman: And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, you need your core body temperature to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed, you need your core body temperature to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. That all becomes very easy when using an 8 Sleep mattress cover because it allows you to program the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle, and towards the end of your night when you wake up. I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover over 2 years ago, and it immediately and persistently improved the quality and depth of my sleep. As a consequence, I wake up feeling far more refreshed.[1:00:12] Andrew Huberman: I have enhanced mood, focus, and alertness throughout the day. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 Sleep.com / huberman to save up to a $150 off their pod 3 cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman. Let's therefore talk about what does work.[1:00:34] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. You know? And, again, Placing on the shelf the the fact that medications can help and CBT cognitive behavioral therapy can help, but it they are just but 2 components of a much larger picture. The map that we described briefly at the beginning of today's episode, and that is, by the way, available as a downloadable PDF in the show note captions if people wanna look at it visually, and that was described in a lot of detail in episode 1, which I hope people will Take the time to listen too because it's so rich with depth of understanding, and I'm certain everyone will learn a ton about themselves and others Simply by listening to your words, I'm absolutely certain of that. That map provides Essentially, a description of the bins, the cupboards to look in, to arrive at better answers and and even the sorts of questions that one might ask.[1:01:26] Andrew Huberman: If we could just talk about that in the context of the example that you gave of this person who made this Really incredible choice to move away from this higher paying job. You know, they were overindulging in in certain, maladaptive behaviors. And, again, we will use this example, but, this example is but one of an infinite number of examples that we could use of a person who's, you know, in a struggle. Right? They're doing something that's not working for them, and they're also not doing things that they know they ought to be doing.[1:01:57] Andrew Huberman: Okay? This is important for people to To understand because, there are gonna be people out there that are thinking, oh, like this poor guy. Like, he's making tons of money. Poor him. You know?[1:02:06] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, he was experiencing deep It's miserable. Lack of satisfaction. So it could it could have been the reverse example. Like, the person isn't in a job that that brings about enough wealth for them to to Thrive. Right?[1:02:17] Andrew Huberman: Because there are financial realities to life. So it's just one example. Right?[1:02:21] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. But it's a good one, I think, because the person left the money. Right. So so what would make you leave that? Right?[1:02:27] Dr. Paul Conti: And and this is well, what would make you leave that is if you are miserable in the situation with that, and you're happy in the situation without it.[1:02:34] Andrew Huberman: Right. So it's about leaving misery and and finding happiness. That's so if you'd be willing to share with us a little bit of your mindset during those sessions, Meaning the sorts of questions you ask him about the structure of his self or to reveal the structure of his self and the function of his self that allowed The both of you to eventually set him down this, far better course. You know, what's better than moving away from frustration and overindulgence and maladaptive behavior to Deep satisfaction, peace, contentment, and delight, and to become a generative human being.[1:03:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. So we can look in each of those 10 cabinets. Right? So, listen, we look in the unconscious mind cabinet. There's not much there.[1:03:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? When the person was growing up, it was very clear that Having more money and having a job that impressed people was was an important thing. He internalizes some of it, so some of it's unconscious, but by and large, she's aware of it.[1:03:25] Andrew Huberman: And then that was revealed to you how he you know, you would ask him a question about, you know, like, tell me about your upbringing. And he would say, yeah. Like, you know, money was important to my family, but we always felt like we had, you know, enough. That he wasn't super wealthy, but had enough. And so when you say there wasn't a lot there, do you mean that there was no kind of, like, x marks the spot or like like blinking red light, like, woah.[1:03:46] Andrew Huberman: There's something really in his unconscious mind that's in his way. Is it do I have that right?[1:03:50] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, more because it was conscious. Right. So so he was aware that it was very much, like, beat into him. Right? Like, this is the only way to be okay, right, is to have a prestigious job that makes a lot of money.[1:04:02] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But he's aware of it. If he weren't aware of it, we have to bring that to light. Right? But he's aware.[1:04:07] Dr. Paul Conti: It's like, look. It has a big impact on me. It makes it hard to step away. Like, I know I don't really care that much the money, but I also kinda do. You know?[1:04:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Sure.[1:04:14] Andrew Huberman: Money is I always say money can't buy happiness, but it certainly can buffer certain stressors in life. Right. I mean, nobody, Sometimes you hear people who have a lot of money saying, like, money can't buy happiness because, you know, there are a lot of miserable rich people, but it's like, you know, it's very different to have a, 2 night nurses To take care of a baby than to be the person who has to stay up all night taking care of a kid, especially or a single mother versus a, a mother that has a partner who's who's willing to pitch in. You know, Doug, you just can't compare.[1:04:41] Dr. Paul Conti: And while that's that's absolutely true, in this case, we're just looking at money as money. Like, as an endpoint. Right? The idea that No matter no matter what, right, how how secure and safe, like, is more money better. Right?[1:04:54] Dr. Paul Conti: And he had an intrinsic overvalue of that. Right? So so it made it harder to step away from it because he he was overvaluing it. He knew he was overvaluing it just in and of itself, not even for what it gets you. Right?[1:05:06] Dr. Paul Conti: But for the psychological meaning of it, right, then we look at his defensive structures. If we look in that cupboard, you see that they've they've really shifted. Right. They shifted from healthy places. Now they're sort of twisted and distorted, and he's doing a lot of denial, a lot of avoidance, a lot of rationalization.[1:05:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. He's enacting a lot of aggression towards himself, and he's he's he's doing a lot of projecting. Right? He's he's harming himself with the alcohol. He's punishing himself.[1:05:34] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, So his defensive structure, it can be healthy. We know that because it was healthier. Right? But then we see that it is so twisted, so we learn a lot from that. Right?[1:05:44] Dr. Paul Conti: A lot is conscious in this person. The defensive structure can be healthy because it was healthy, but it's Eventually,[1:05:50] Andrew Huberman: it was healthy.[1:05:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, it was healthy before. I see. It was healthy before, so you know that it can be healthy again. Right? He has it in him to have healthy defenses.[1:06:00] Dr. Paul Conti: They just started getting away from him As he felt less and less satisfied with his job and more and more angry with himself and more and more miserable[1:06:08] Andrew Huberman: this is a really key point for me and everyone else to understand. Yeah. Throughout the years of high school and college and friends and things of that sort, I would hear this like, I used to Be really good at fitness, or I used to you know, if I had a dollar for every time someone said, you know, you should have seen me in high school, you know, like like the person who lets themself go And and arguably is very busy with with professional duties and family duties, and, you know, you can understand why their time is more compressed, than it was when they were in high school. But, Nonetheless, you know, you hear these sorts of things all the time. Like, I used to have this sense of, like, I could do things or that, like, things could work out or that, and then it's as if there was a previous version of themselves that is completely atrophied, and the new version of themselves or the the later version of themselves Rather, it just simply, like, doesn't have access to that anymore.[1:07:00] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:07:00] Dr. Paul Conti: And that but that's the impact of trauma.[1:07:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right? Okay.[1:07:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Whether it's big trauma or it's, You know, a big event or it's multiple things like, oh, the the world just isn't rewarding me. I'm trying. The world's not rewarding me. I'm trying.[1:07:11] Dr. Paul Conti: The world's not rewarding me. Then people become dispirited, right, demoralized. Right. So so it it's the trauma of that that takes away the the sense of self, the sense of agency. Like, I thought I could do things before.[1:07:23] Dr. Paul Conti: Now I don't think I can do things. Right. But but nothing has really changed in me. I mean, that that's that's a problem. Right?[1:07:29] Dr. Paul Conti: And it's a problem the vast majority of times is born of Trauma,[1:07:34] Andrew Huberman: does that, necessarily mean early childhood trauma or, suppose it could be later life trauma? I mean, one of the things that I I like about what you're saying so much is that, you know, you, the psychiatrist, is hears I used to be able to do something well Or feel well. And and that's like it sounds like it's a a signal. It's really a beacon of health that still exists in the person, but that they're out of touch with. I think for, for most people, when they think about themselves or people who talk about how they used to be functional in some domain, and they're no longer functional in that domain any longer.[1:08:11] Andrew Huberman: It sounds as if, like, things are fundamentally broken. Like like, it's it's as if a piece of them that was That was functioning like drifted out of their body and left. Right? But I I love the optimism, right, because I think so much of what we're interested in covering today is not just What's not working and why, but also what's working and why, and what used to work and why. And and the idea that, You know, within these cupboards, there can be the discovery of of problems.[1:08:37] Andrew Huberman: Clearly, that's why one goes to the cupboards, right, as we're defining it. But that, There are a lot of answers. There are there are rest the ingredients for success already exist within us.[1:08:48] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Right. Especially if we know we've had that ability before. Right? Because we know that we had it before.[1:08:53] Dr. Paul Conti: So think about in this man, he he felt that he couldn't make change. Like, now he's stuck. Right? Like, I I I I got a lot of things done. I was able to to get myself into this school and achieve this and, you know, and then get this job.[1:09:06] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, he he could do all those things, but now he feels like Can't do anything to make himself happy. So, like, we know he could do that. He had a strong sense of agency. He does it now. Right?[1:09:17] Dr. Paul Conti: And and like people often do, they they feel a sense of loss. Like, naturally, I've had this happen in myself. Like, it feels like something's cut out of you, And there's something hollow. I had that thing, and now I don't. Right?[1:09:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Hence, the I'm broken. I'm hopeless. The things that we hear over and over and over again. So think about the shift in this person to, like, what's actually going on, which isn't that hard to discern. We just pay attention to it.[1:09:40] Dr. Paul Conti: So then if we run up the structure itself, we say, okay. Not a lot of it is rooted in the unconscious mind. Right? There there are are Problems of overvaluing certain things, but they're in the conscious mind.[1:09:51] Andrew Huberman: He knows, like, in his household over dinner, it was, you know, dad or mom, you know, Being proud of of some dollar amount that they they achieved. So so that narrative exists, and and he's like, yeah. Like, money was a big deal in my family kind of thing. Right. By the way, I'm not speaking about my family, but Rarely were there discussions about money.[1:10:08] Andrew Huberman: There were discussions about other things, of course. But in in this hypothetical And he knows he over a real patient. Sorry.[1:10:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. He knows he overvalues it. Right. He he knows independent of what money buys and what he needs and all that. He just puts too much importance in money, and he knows that.[1:10:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So, okay, their conscious mind issues, he's pretty aware of them, and they're pretty kinda set in him. Like, those are the issues and they're there. Okay. We learned that.[1:10:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Then we go look at his defensive structure. Boy, that's very, very helpful to talk about. Wow. Like, you had a very healthy defensive structure. What were you doing before?[1:10:38] Dr. Paul Conti: A lot of sublimation. Right. Take Could[1:10:40] Andrew Huberman: you explain sublimation?[1:10:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Take anxiety, tension, or something something negative in the self, or there could be negative, and you channel it towards something positive. Right. He channeled that energy towards learning. Right?[1:10:51] Dr. Paul Conti: He channeled some of the aggressive drive, right, into a sense of agency that that got achievement. So he looked and he said, right. Those You know, the the that, network, right, of of defense mechanisms that comes up out of the unconscious mind was, like, looking pretty good. Right? It was pretty Clear light was coming through it in a, you know, in a way that wasn't distorted.[1:11:10] Dr. Paul Conti: And now we can look at, wow, like, that things are pretty different Now, right, is as he's saying, no. It's okay. Like, what what do you mean? I I spent 10 hours of my weekend utterly wasting time. And what what's wrong with that?[1:11:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Or, you know, he's rationalizing even that he likes to drink when he doesn't because he so madder himself. Like, The defensive structure now is twisted. Right? So we can say, okay.[1:11:35] Dr. Paul Conti: We that's a big observation. Right? And then the Character structure, when we look at that, we find a person who's pretty good at figuring out and understanding things and coming right up to the precipice of change, But there's a long history of then difficulty making the change. Right? I know it, and I'm on the verge of it, but I don't I I I can't bring myself to do it.[1:11:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, that's in his character structure. By the[1:11:57] Andrew Huberman: way, it's such a common thing. I mean, people that know Better. Know they know better. Sometimes you almost have to wonder whether or not it's like, it's like in the pocket, like, they could take it if they wanted to. That that might even give them some comfort, but they just don't do it.[1:12:16] Andrew Huberman: They just don't Engage in the proper actions to move their life from one place to the next.[1:12:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. And if we look then at the level of strivings, like, he does know what he wants. Like, he he wants a feeling Feeling of contentment is really what he wanted. It was a feeling of contentment, a feeling of, like, I'm taking good care of myself. I'm doing something that's of value.[1:12:33] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm enjoying doing it. Like, he wanted those things. And even when we talked more, he had ideas of what jobs would do that. In the beginning, he said he had no ideas. What he really meant That he said to me, but was also saying to himself, is I have no ideas of jobs that would meet these requirements for me that pay as much as the one I have.[1:12:53] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So but but within him, which we got to, where where he knew that there were jobs that would make him happy, he just had to get over that they were lower paying. To think of what we learn about that, there's nothing lost in this man. There's nothing cut out of him, that he's not damaged. He's not hopeless.[1:13:09] Dr. Paul Conti: And now he can understand that, You know, he he that he understands his affection pretty well. Right? And and his conscious mind is is apprehending pretty well what's going on and where he wants to go. But boy, as he hasn't taken good care of himself, the defensive structure gets sort of warped, and then it makes it a lot harder to take care of yourself. It starts making other problems in life, And he starts, like, feeling lousy about himself.[1:13:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, maybe I can't do much of anything. Right? Why? Because work isn't going as well, because he's drinking too much, and Role performance goes down. Right?[1:13:40] Dr. Paul Conti: So we can see that, and then, you know, what's of most interest there is that there's a character structure that can come right up to the precipice, But not but not pull the trigger, so to speak, on what the thing the thing the person wants to do, because now we start getting, okay, An understanding of what's actually going on. Right? And then if we look at function itself, let's look in those cabinets too, right, to help him be more aware of there's an eye here, Like, which he was pretty well aware of, but not enough. Like, there's a person here I'm shepherding through 24 hours in the day. Right?[1:14:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, I am an eye, and I'm Aware of what's going on inside of me, and it can make me happier or it can make me miserable. Like, let's let's let's be more aware of that.[1:14:18] Andrew Huberman: How did he go about doing that? Because I find this this 1st step within addressing the function of self, you know, self awareness and really understand that there's a there's an, there's an I, there's a me, and I'm Moving myself through life, I I find this to be so interesting and on the one hand kind of obvious, like, okay, there's a there's a mean, like, tangible thing. You look in the mirror, you see yourself. But at the same time, it's a bit abstract, I think, to me and to many people out there. Like, how does one go about building up A sense of self in a way that provides positive agency in the world.[1:14:52] Andrew Huberman: Is it to tell you know, we hear all the time about these, like, Affirmations, and I'm sure there are people who look at themselves in the mirror and say, you are enough, and these and I'm not making fun of these people. Right? I actually have my own internal, list that I, tell myself on waking every morning, which has nothing to do with positive affirmation, is just actually defining the different roles that I play. I don't know why this is useful to me, but I find it incredibly useful to me. It reminds me who I am.[1:15:17] Andrew Huberman: It also reminds, or at least reassures me that I don't have, any dementia yet. So, you know, we'll see going forward, but, hopefully not. But, yeah, let's talk about this this line of inquiry within the The category of self awareness that people can do regardless of whatever challenges they they might be having or not having, Yeah. What does that look like, and what do you think that accomplishes at the level of self understanding and and agency in the world?[1:15:45] Dr. Paul Conti: So one way of looking at that is, And these are the words I would use, but, like, what's pervading a person and so to set set setting the stage. Right? Which you can Discern by inquiry. So so for example, in this case, the person so there's a person, right, who would really not think this is okay. Right.[1:16:04] Dr. Paul Conti: This person taking a job at 10% of the previous pay, and the job has less prestige. Right? Who's a person who would be very unhappy about that and very faulting of that And and talk to the this person, my patient through the lens of it, he should feel shame for that. That person's not alive. The person is not alive.[1:16:23] Dr. Paul Conti: So one way of looking at it is what master are you serving. Right? And a lot of, like, the givens. Right? The automaticity in him Was as if, like, that person was sort of alive inside of him really telling him, like, how this wasn't okay.[1:16:37] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, who's fighting that? He wasn't aware that, Hey. That's some other person's voice. It was like he's like, no. I'm very, very conflicted about this.[1:16:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Actually, he wasn't very conflicted about this. Like, when he starts Focusing on the eye, like, what do I actually think? What do I actually think? I don't I don't care if I make 90% less. Like, I don't care.[1:16:55] Dr. Paul Conti: My needs are met. I some money away. I wanna be happy. I'm not conflicted. Like, so so but in order to get there, we we have to look at at the eye.[1:17:04] Dr. Paul Conti: How much is the eye At center stage, right, in all the I don't mean in a in some way, like, paying too much attention to the self, but, like, we're all acting through the lens of the eye no matter what we're choosing. Right? So to be aware of that, and do I wanna be impacted by the opinions of this other person? Because I can let someone else's opinions very much. I mean, we we all do.[1:17:23] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Very much impact my thoughts, but I wanna kinda decide that. Do I really value that person's opinions? I don't want them automatically inside my head Telling me how I feel about myself.[1:17:34] Andrew Huberman: I can't tell you how many people I know come to me in a place of struggle even though I'm not a clinician. And as I listen to what they're struggling with, it's so clear that they know the best answer and route forward, But that they're dealing with some internal oppressive voice about whether or not they are a good person or a bad person, Whether or not the choice they want to make is really a good choice at all, sometimes those voices are the voices of parents, You know, in these particular examples or the voices of peers. And so I think, I understand correctly, what you what you're talking about is getting really firmly rooted in who a person is for themselves and what they really value And what they what they really know to be true for themselves and really trying to not necessarily quiet those voices, but see those voices Truly as other even though they come from with within their head.[1:18:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Is that right? Yes. Yes. To to stop and think, what voices do I want inside?[1:18:38] Dr. Paul Conti: So so maybe I want the voice of a kind mentor who still held me to account, you know, for a very high standard. Right. It's a good voice to have inside of me.[1:18:49] Andrew Huberman: Right? A few of those and then Hey.[1:18:51] Dr. Paul Conti: You know? But what might not be a good voice is, like, say, a not so kind mentor, for whom you could never do anything good enough. That's not so good. Maybe you take part of that and you leave part of that. But the the earlier and more formative the voices are, the more they're In our head automatically, I think that that man thought that he was deeply conflicted.[1:19:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Absolutely. 100%. Like you tell and in his he was. Right. Like, his experience was to be deeply conflicted.[1:19:14] Dr. Paul Conti: But when you go in and dig, there's actually if you just dig and you and you get to, like, okay, the eye is gonna assess this. He's he's not conflicted at all. Right? Which is why then if you're coming up the function of self ladder, right, and you look at defense mechanisms in action, Right. And what's on top of that salience.[1:19:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Now is when it creates an immediacy. Right? So defense mechanisms and actions sort of inform the process and say, Hey. The defenses are shifting to denial, acting out.[1:19:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And that's what sort of gives us a time horizon. Like, these things, this is not gonna be okay. Right. That if we kept down this path, what was very clearly gonna happen you don't have to roll the tape forward that much to see that he's gonna lose his job.[1:19:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. He's gonna feel very ashamed of that. Like, a bunch of negative things are gonna happen. So it helps the person apprehend that, like, there's something going on here. Like, I'm changing.[1:20:04] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because, like, in some way, I'm thinking now that it's okay that I'm wasting 10 hours on something that I could really enjoy if I spend 90 minutes on it. Like like, well, I'm kind of losing a little bit A perspective there. Right? So it it adds a sense like it frames the situation, right, and the salience of it.[1:20:19] Andrew Huberman: Could you elaborate a little bit on, this defense mechanism in action of acting out? You know, I think, we covered in episode 1, and I'm sure it will come up several times more during today's discussion about things like denial, projection, Displacement, etcetera, the those defense mechanisms, seem to have their own intrinsic definition, but, you know, Acting out is something that we hear more and more about these days, like they're acting out. Like, what is acting out? Is it is it acting out of some conflict? Is it trying to, you know, Demolish a a a struggle by by going and doing something else.[1:20:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. We can think of it as by and large an unhealthy manifestation of a lot of aggression, which could be a very high aggressive drive or an aggressive drive that's not too high, but is then Ferthered, it its power is furthered by a negative situation. Right? Say, like this one. Right?[1:21:16] Dr. Paul Conti: Because of the the acting out, what was going on here inside of this person is He was very, very mad. Right? And this isn't a person who who expressed a lot of anger. Right? So he or had outlets for it.[1:21:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? He he wasn't going and running 10 miles. Hey. This was all inside of him. He wasn't getting it out in one way or another.[1:21:34] Dr. Paul Conti: So what he starts doing is he starts acting out anger now, he's angry at the world around him because he's unhappy in it, and it's not giving him more choices. Now, of course, this is about him and not the world around him. Right? But but he's feeling an anger towards the world that won't cooperate. Right?[1:21:50] Dr. Paul Conti: And he's angry towards himself. Right? Because, like, he can't make himself happy. Like, look at all of this. Look at all that he did, and look how miserable he is.[1:21:57] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So a way of acting out then was was is the drinking. Because the drink is to hell with the world. Right? You think I shouldn't be drinking at night and coming to work hangover?[1:22:07] Dr. Paul Conti: I'll I'll do it anyway. Right? To hell with the world. It's a way of snubbing his nose at the world. Right?[1:22:11] Dr. Paul Conti: He's also snubbing his nose at him. Right? To hell with me. Right? The guy who now doesn't come across the way he did before Because I'm showing up at work, not in the responsible way I showed up before, but in a way it's a little disheveled, function is lower, to hell with me.[1:22:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. So for self denigration, like, let people think worse of me. Right? Because why? Because I'm so mad at myself that I think it's justified.[1:22:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And then there's also the inviting of, Hey. If I if I really have an addiction problem here, I lose my job. It's like, fine. I deserve that too.[1:22:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, you know, there's an acting out against the self that If the person doesn't stop and look at that, that can become true. Right? Because that person didn't really wasn't built to say to hell with the world and with me Or do not even understand what's the hell with the world mean. It also means to hell with me, and it's not good for the world or me.[1:22:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But he was able to understand that because we we had looked at like, wow, what shifted in? This is a person who did a lot of sublimation before who now all of that's going into acting out. So they're not taking negative energy and doing something good with it. They're they're taking negative energy and doing things that are bad with it.[1:23:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Why? Because there's too much. There's a lot of negative energy. It's overwhelming Everything else, and then it's going down these pathways where the the unhealthy defenses are always beckoning us. Send the energy down here.[1:23:23] Dr. Paul Conti: It's easier to avoid than it is to face something and figure it out. Right? It's easier to just act out than it is to hold what's inside of us and then think about why It's there. So the unhealthy defenses are beckoning us. And for him to see, hey.[1:23:38] Dr. Paul Conti: You you have had a healthy defensive structure like you can be healthy again. You're not broken. Right? But to also see the way these defenses are going is bringing real risk To, you know, to your to your ability to even be happier, you get further down the shame and loss path, it can be hard, sometimes impossible for the person to get back. So it it sets the stage, like, this is very, very important to what these defenses are, how they're being enacted, And for him to be able to see that, like, oh, this could be healthy, but it's not now.[1:24:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. These, slow, You know, degrading forms of acting out and self sabotage and sabotage of others, I I think are are the particularly dangerous ones because Because they're slow, and they the sometimes the the change is imperceptibly slow, and then one day somebody arrives at a place where, as you said, you know, they Unfortunately, can't get back or that or it requires, you know, going into residential treatment or things that really you know, big departures.[1:24:40] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[1:24:41] Andrew Huberman: The importance in order to get back into life. And, you know, I would never wish for somebody to choose to act out by driving off a cliff instead, but but there are other forms of acting out that Immediately wake people up, but it seems like people don't often select those. They select these more subtle forms of acting out where They don't get caught, and they or they or no one's calling them out on it on it because, you know, you know, plenty of people have 5 or 6 drinks at happy hour, right, as opposed to 50. Right. You know?[1:25:08] Andrew Huberman: So, so it's it's self slow self sabotage as opposed to immediate self destruction. And, again, we're talking about alcohol, but we're talking about food, video games, social media, arguing with spouse. I mean, All of these kinds of things that build up over time to eventually deliver people to a place of of real real problems. I'm curious for this particular individual you worked with. Sounds like that's not what happened.[1:25:34] Andrew Huberman: They they started this process of of self inquiry around self awareness. And, did you see that the, salience, that is what they paid attention to internally and externally, Immediately shifted there, and the defense mechanism, of acting out immediately dissolved. I mean, what was the kind of contour in time and time courses?[1:25:54] Dr. Paul Conti: There was There was less so assuming if we're looking in the cabinets, there's a lot in the defense mechanisms and action cabinet. There's not as much in the salience cabinet Because this is the major thing on his mind, right, above all else. Like, you know, he was having intrusive thoughts about it, and his self talk was about it. But we kind of already knew that, You know, just like we knew it was in the conscious mind. So if you think where's the money at, right, it's not as much in that realm because he's aware of it.[1:26:19] Dr. Paul Conti: If he thought, oh, I'm not This isn't bothering me very much. And then he said, well, all his internal dialogue is about it. Right? Then, like, okay, there's a lot there's a lot to achieve there. But just as he brought a lot that was unconscious into the conscious mind, was aware of it, it was salient.[1:26:34] Dr. Paul Conti: There's less to do there. Right? Because The things to understand and change are not residing so much there.[1:26:43] Andrew Huberman: For people that are, No doubt everyone is seeing about their own internal processes and, and where they could ask better questions and and arrive at better answers to help themselves along. Perhaps you could, elaborate a little bit more on this salience covered under function of self. You know, to me, Salience is what's most apparent, and and, as you talked about yesterday and again today, you know, there's this internal narrative like What's on my mind often, or what kind of jumps to mind? I've started doing this recently based on our discussions here, And I've noticed that under different states of arousal, and here I'm talking specifically about sleepiness versus alertness type arousal. Like, When I wake up in the morning or when I'm tired in the evening, you know, where my mind is at, where it defaults to, and what I'm paying attention to throughout the day, is that you know, just asking myself to notice, and I've certainly noticed some some, Some patterns.[1:27:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I've for instance, I've noticed that anytime, my overall state is elevated, more alertness or in the middle of exercise, my mind goes to some, not so pleasant thoughts. And it's interesting to me. It's like, wow. This is strongly correlated with states of internal arousal that are healthy exercise, you know, within a limited frame is is or exercises, like, in general, if done in a healthy way, is healthy.[1:28:09] Andrew Huberman: And when I'm sleepy, those thoughts never come about. When I wake up in the morning, certain thoughts tend to leap to mind, other thoughts, no. So sort of Categorization of different types of thoughts depending on my internal state. Is that the sort of line of inquiry that you're that you're, Suggesting or describing here?[1:28:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. It's I think it's quite half the picture. Right? Because half the picture would be what's going on in your mind when your mind is sort of at rest. Right.[1:28:34] Dr. Paul Conti: What what is then starts playing itself right in your mind. Right? The other side of it is What comes to the fore when there's a lot of competition for attention? Right? So I'm I'm making this up, but but the idea that, like, if he stubbed his toe really badly, He'd still be thinking about this.[1:28:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because there's so much power. Now again, maybe if, god forbid, he has a badly broken bone, there's a lot of pain. Like, he's gonna think of that first. Right?[1:28:57] Dr. Paul Conti: But it takes a lot of other stimulus to to be more salient than this. Right? So so you can look at what's coming in your mind when your mind is Free and open, that's very, very important and relevant. And then what's winning out when there's maybe a high arousal state and a lot of competition for attention?[1:29:15] Andrew Huberman: That's very helpful. Again, I think that along with this, self awareness piece, the Asking of oneself, you know, what what is happening in my mind when I'm in different states or throughout the day? And as you're describing now, also including when, there are other things available to think about. Like, does that include how often I'm distracted by a particular thought? Like, how many times throughout the day my mind goes from the conversation I might be in to something else?[1:29:50] Andrew Huberman: Or Yes.[1:29:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. Yeah. Does it hijack your attention? You know, there's one way of putting putting that.[1:29:57] Andrew Huberman: A lot of people, mention to me challenges with intrusive thoughts.[1:30:02] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[1:30:04] Andrew Huberman: What can be done about those intrusive thoughts, or Is it simply a matter of paying attention to the fact that they're there and, and then thinking about the the origins of those thoughts?[1:30:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Absolutely. I mean, one example, you could have intrusive thoughts because there's trauma in your background, maybe very clear trauma that you're not facing and addressing, and then you have intrusive Thought to say, I'm not safe. Okay. Go look for what's still in the unconscious mind, or when it comes out a little bit, you you push back into the unconscious mind.[1:30:33] Dr. Paul Conti: That would be a it's a very different scenario than, like, in this case. This man was having intrusive thoughts about his job situation, his overall situation, And it made sense that he was having those intrusive. They were markers of the acuity of it. Right? Of, like, you you have to do something about this Or, like, something very bad is gonna happen.[1:30:51] Dr. Paul Conti: So the intrusive thoughts there this has made sense. Right? Like, this is not going well, and and your mind is forcing you to pay attention to this Because time really kind of is of the essence, you're a real risk now. So intrusive thoughts can be anything from As they often are, they they can be markers of something that is traumatic, something that's underneath the surface, something that is really bothering us that we shoved down, that's making guilt, shame, distress, vulnerability. That's that's very often the case, but sometimes intrusive thoughts are a marker of, like, oh, right.[1:31:21] Dr. Paul Conti: That's the thing to pay attention to.[1:31:24] Andrew Huberman: And once we identify the intrusive thought, I mean, how do we eradicate it? I mean, how do we, work with it? I mean, We're talking about trauma now. You know? Of course, it might map back to a childhood experience, some internal narrative, but, Is there some road map for moving intrusive thoughts from a place of intrusive and disturbing to simply There and kind of meh.[1:31:52] Andrew Huberman: I[1:31:53] Dr. Paul Conti: mean, it'd be wonderful to hit a delete switch, but, obviously, we don't work like that. Well, let's take a look if we could at this example. Right. We which is a little bit different. If we if we run through this example of the person in the job, because then we we should talk about trauma Driven intrusive thoughts, which is, I think, in many ways, the biggest topic about intrusive thoughts.[1:32:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. But think of it this person here, if we go up from Salience, we look at behaviors. Right? And behavior actually now is very, very important. Right?[1:32:20] Dr. Paul Conti: This person is drinking. They're still going to that job they don't want. They Haven't gone and interviewed for the jobs they want. Right? So we start looking at the behaviors that are making problems, the changes in behaviors that could make things better.[1:32:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. And then on top of that, we arrive at strivings. And I think when I was talking about structure of self, I think at least one time I misspoke and said Said striving instead of self. At at the top of these pyramids, self and striving have a lot of overlap. Right?[1:32:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Because if you're growing A healthy self, right, out of, you know, the the sort of top of the structure of self pyramid, then that self is gonna be aware of strivings, and and it's gonna be better able to enact them. So, you know, his his sense of self was shaken here, but he was aware of the strivings for a better life. Right? So now let's see the road map. It's interesting, right, because the road map is his road map.[1:33:11] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? If we look in those 10 cupboards, we come up with A road map and and road map doesn't have us spending very much time in, like, unconscious land. Right? Because, like, he doesn't really need that. Right?[1:33:21] Dr. Paul Conti: If we look at what makes the difference for him, What did we do? Right? We really cultivated the self awareness, the eye that is making decisions for him. We looked at how his defensive structure had changed and the things he didn't want to be there now and the good Things that were there before, and how could he get back some of that? How could he trend back towards what was working before?[1:33:45] Dr. Paul Conti: So we start to really look at that, And then we go from there, really, to changing behaviors. Like, it requires a behavioral change, which is not to walk up to the precipice of doing this Each day, but to actually do it. Right? Because it was very clear all the vectors, so to speak, inside of them were pointing towards doing it, And that that was consistent with the self being healthier, that garden growing on top of the structure, and the strivings then being realized. So for him, that was the road map.[1:34:13] Dr. Paul Conti: And the the the salience, right, wasn't really part of it because the The intrusiveness, the salience bias inside of him made sense, then they're like, of course, it went away once he made the decisions. Right? Because the the intrusive thoughts of, like, You have to figure this out. You have to figure this out. Right?[1:34:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Weren't there anymore along with the intrusive thoughts of you'll never figure this out or, like, it goes away Because he made the change, but he made the change because we looked at self awareness. We strengthened self awareness. We looked at defense mechanisms, How they could be versus how they are, we looked at the behavioral change, which was really necessary, and then also referencing a character structure that had Has difficulty, right, coming coming across the precipice. Right? So we we say, okay.[1:34:55] Dr. Paul Conti: That's a baseline characteristic of him. We kinda understand that. But how do we help him change the behaviors anyway? When he does that, the self is in a better, happier, healthier place. The strivings are realized.[1:35:07] Dr. Paul Conti: This person that stops drinking in the way they were, they start doing the the enjoyment aspects of their life. They start doing them within reasonable bounds again. They're taking care of themselves. Person smiling that that and now think the generative drive is much more fulfilled. So so for what comes on top of those pillars, right, is That person has a sense of humility.[1:35:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Enough humility to say I'm gonna walk away from this job. I don't it's okay that the people in the job will think I'm crazy. How could you leave that? And And, like, it triggers something in me in some way, but, like, it's okay.[1:35:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, I don't I don't have to you know, I I I'm not out there for that. I'm not out there for the big thing that everybody is He's guiding I I can have the humility to go to the job that I know makes a difference and feels good to me. Right? He's empowered to make change.[1:35:52] Dr. Paul Conti: He's we're moving away from this the disempowerment to the alcohol and the avoidance. Right? So there's empowerment and humility. And and absolutely, if we talk to that person, on the other side of it, like, shortly, you know, as he was enacting it, right, getting just to the other side of it, there was so much empowerment and so much humility, which were then Brought to bear through a sense of agency that made the changes, right, that changed the job, that stopped drinking, that dealt with the people who thought negatively of it, right, through a sense of gratitude of It's not awful that I I I'm gonna go make less money. A lot of people said that to him, like, how could you do it?[1:36:25] Dr. Paul Conti: It was so terrible. It's like, it's not terrible. Right? I'm grateful. Like, you know what I'm gonna do?[1:36:29] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm gonna go make an amount of money that that's all that I need. Right? So it was like that's what helps a person do that thing, and that's actually true. Right? That's what what mattered to him.[1:36:40] Dr. Paul Conti: So an activated an active, a verb sense of agency and gratitude Then leads him to the place where there was a peace, contentment, delight. He was delighting in the job that he chose, and his generative drive was in accord With it, you know, then, eventually, we we stopped at some point working together. He didn't need me anymore. He could always come back, but we didn't need me anymore. Then you look at how are those last sessions.[1:37:05] Dr. Paul Conti: A lot of the last sessions were him, like, in an excited way, telling me what he was doing. Right? Like, oh, and then we did this, and, like, I did this. I figured this out. Like, He was so happy about it, and you can see that man's generative drive, which naturally naturally is quite high in him, but was being squelched.[1:37:21] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? That brings him out of balance. Now the generative drive was in quite a good place, and he had enough aggression or assertion, right, to to go and do that job and to do that well and and even enough counter anybody who would still kinda rise up and say that wasn't a good idea, he could counter all that. He was getting pleasure from it. He didn't need to seek Pleasure by what?[1:37:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Not even pleasure because alcohol was pleasurable. No. Pleasure because harming himself and saying to hell with you, to the world, and to him was pleasurable. Right? Not getting pleasure that way.[1:37:50] Dr. Paul Conti: He's getting pleasure in healthier ways, taking care of himself, doing the job he loves, doing his leisure activities. Like, the man comes into balance, And then, like, life is good, and we say, yeah. Okay. Come back in a couple months. Like, comes back in a couple months.[1:38:04] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. Maybe in 6 months, comes back one more time, I don't see him again. That's great. He totally doesn't need me again, and I atrophied, right, from his life. Great.[1:38:13] Dr. Paul Conti: That's that's the success state of it.[1:38:15] Andrew Huberman: Eventually arrived at being truly wealthy. Right? With all with all the components of mental health and peace, contentment, delight. As you describe his story, which is a remarkable one, it occurs to me that the narratives that we hear as children end up being so powerful.[1:38:36] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes.[1:38:37] Andrew Huberman: And I'm sure there are people out there that receive such direct messages from their mother And our father, like, you have to do this. You cannot do that. But often, we get messages through observing and overhearing. Right? The way that our mother talks about our father when he's out of the room, the way that our father talks about our mother when she's out of the room.[1:39:02] Andrew Huberman: And some of this could be nonverbal, like a rolling of the eyes or a, somebody saying yes, yes, agreeing, and then they walk out and they just you know? And kind of blowing them off. Right? I mean, kids are we are all so aware and integrating all of that all the time, and I I I do think those messages get woven into us at a very deep level. Absolutely.[1:39:24] Andrew Huberman: And then, of course, there are the, conscious narratives that we build up as we go through. In particular, I think elementary and middle school and high school. I mean, I can still remember a a negative comment somebody made about a jacket that I was wearing in, like, the 3rd or 4th grade. Mhmm. I forget everything else that happened that year.[1:39:40] Andrew Huberman: I remember that. Remember that. Yeah. And and I'm not, you know, I'm not insecure about the clothing that I You know, I mean, obviously, it's it's a black button down shirt. I've had similar shirts since 1st grade.[1:39:50] Andrew Huberman: Just kidding. But, you know, the But we the fact that that's embedded in my memory systems is like just it speaks to the the salience of of negative The of insults, basically. It was an insult, and I'm sure I've insulted plenty of kids coming up, you know, as a teenager and and back and forth, and, And so but these narratives get so deeply embedded. And the idea that one could pick a different path of vocation or, like, You'll miss the opportunity to be truly happy at a deep level based on these narratives. I mean, on one hand, it's obvious.[1:40:26] Andrew Huberman: On the other hand, you just go like, woah. This this is not good. This is a this is a flaw in the in the design. Right? And yet you're giving us a road map to to understanding and and to, overcoming it.[1:40:40] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Let's say we take your your examples. We we look they're great examples, and we we look at them. Right? The the person making fun of the code in 3rd grade.[1:40:48] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? We're assuming it hasn't harmed you. It hasn't changed the course of your life. Right? What does it tell us?[1:40:52] Dr. Paul Conti: It shows that negative Simuli are very salient. Right? I'm sure you got a lot of compliments in 3rd grade too. Right? But it's a negative that stands out, which just shows that there's a salient bias in us Towards the negative, and that's probably about survival and threat sensing.[1:41:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, in some ways, it it makes sense in around human survival, But it doesn't make sense around human trauma. Right? So then so you had given the example of what gets communicated to the child when, say, Mother says something negative about father when father's out of the room. Father says something negative about mother when mother's out of the room. Just to give an example.[1:41:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So children, because The the complex cognitive mechanisms haven't been formed yet. Right? The the natural way that the brain functions is in a self referential way. Right.[1:41:39] Dr. Paul Conti: So so the child generally doesn't have the capacity to say, like, oh, mom and dad aren't really getting along well in in this certain way. When dad's not here, mom vents a little bit about something about him by saying, child isn't thinking about that. Right? Then what the child will often internalize is, Okay. There's me and there's mom and dad.[1:42:01] Dr. Paul Conti: And mom says dad is bad, and dad says mom is bad, and I must be bad too. Right? Because in general, if your parents are bad, then then the child takes that on themselves. Now again, I'm giving a simple example, but I'm very much it. I mean, imagine if that were very, very aggressive where the mother, when this happens, right, just tells the child how awful the father is and the father does the same.[1:42:23] Dr. Paul Conti: You're not gonna someone's not gonna come out the other side of that being like, you know what? Maybe they're both awful, but I'm not. That's not how that goes. Right? So the lessons The the the traumatic lessons of childhood get internalized.[1:42:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And they don't even always have a solution state. So so you think about the man who knew, like, okay, you have to go get this job and, like, all those things he internalized, you might say, well, I mean, he got to a good place for him. Right? So, like, so For better or for worse, at least there was a place to go.[1:42:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? To, like, to go go work hard, go succeed, go check this box you've been told you're supposed to check. But oftentimes, there is no solution state. So how many children I mean, it's just terrible that this is such a high percentage of the work adult practitioners do is is helping people who as children were told one way or another that they were worthless, incapable, bad. Right.[1:43:13] Dr. Paul Conti: That gets that gets put into the child, unfortunately, far far far I mean, one time on the planet is too frequent, let alone how long often this happens.[1:43:23] Andrew Huberman: That example makes really good sense. Could we and this is a question. Could could we add to that the example whereby the child overhears, again, examples of what, say, men should be like or women should be like. Like, the These things, it's not so much, like, you did wrong, Andrew, or, you know, you did wrong, Paul, like or or telling, The Dar, like, you screwed up, but but it's more, again, narratives that we overhear or even a parent, showing, delight or excitement about a certain phenotype in the world. Like, oh, wow.[1:43:58] Andrew Huberman: Look at that person, or look at them. Like like, isn't she beautiful? Right? The the young child Things like, okay. Well, then that's the epitome of beauty through the lens of the parent.[1:44:07] Andrew Huberman: Or, gosh, like this person. Like, you know, like, then that Child internalizes that this is the epitome of disgust with another human being, and I think children are so savvy, without realizing it, I said, like, okay. Well, then I guess you you move toward that, and you and you aspire to that, and you deflect from that. And you can see how these trajectories can be set very early on. I mean, these are the these are the 4 lane highways that we were talking about at In episode 1, we're just routes of neural processing that could bring us to choices in life and places in life that oftentimes you're like, I don't wanna go down this path anymore.[1:44:43] Andrew Huberman: And and so the the exploration of of early narratives, both direct and indirect, you know, first person and third person Seems so critical. Oh, how how does one go about that? I mean, clearly, with a trained clinician like you, you would guide somebody through the process. But some way they were to try and do this in some sort of structured way for themselves, what are those lines of inquiry look like? Because we have Vast number of experiences from childhood, but some messages are gonna be more salient than others.[1:45:12] Andrew Huberman: Sure.[1:45:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. The the idea that reflective self scrutiny, You know, can help us, I think, is just a great idea. It's a great concept, and and we we do a lot of different things to the inside. We're guided to do a lot of things inside. But this, I think, should overshadow many, if not most of all those other things of, like, what's really going on inside of me?[1:45:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Because if you think about it, A lot of people will come through that and don't learn. Right? So the person is told, like, this is what beautiful is. This is what successful is. This is what good enough looks like.[1:45:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and that person may, through all sorts of experiences, know maybe other people in their lives who are more balanced, be able to arrive on the other side of that, even still Sometimes going through the midst of it depending upon age and situation, you know, like, okay. Like, that's what, you know, my my father and mother thinks, like, This is what beauty is. This is what success is, but it's one set of opinions, and it's not a set of opinions that are gonna define me. Like, sometimes people get to that place, But a lot of times, they don't, and they carry that lesson forward and they're not aware of it.[1:46:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So they think That they're very unattractive even though other people are giving them different signals. They think that they're very dumb even though other people are giving them different signals, and their own grades and their own Tasks may be giving them different signals. Right? But they're not putting the 2 things together, and that's gonna generate tension.[1:46:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? That might be why that person doesn't follow-up on Potential relationships. Right? They just don't think they're good enough, and the person's eventually gonna reject them because of what they look like. Right?[1:46:40] Dr. Paul Conti: They you're taking that with them In this in this example from childhood, right, where they're they're not satisfied with the job that in other ways is, like, really great. Right? They they enjoy the work. They enjoy everything, but it doesn't pay enough. Right?[1:46:53] Dr. Paul Conti: Why? Because they have some false idea inside of what it's supposed to pay. Right? Because it's what the parent said. So so by self scrutiny, like, what are the givens?[1:47:01] Dr. Paul Conti: I always think it it goes back to the math minor. Right? If you can't solve the problem, go back and look at the givens. Right. What are you taking for granted?[1:47:10] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, oh, I know that every time I see an x, that x equals 4. Right? Really, maybe, you know, maybe you wrote down 4, somehow, because you were thinking of 4 at the time and x actually is it 3? Right? So, like, just go back and look at what you're taking For for granted.[1:47:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And a lot of times, this is what we're doing in the therapy process, and then that's when the person can realize. So I'm simplifying. But for the person to realize, like, oh, There's a voice in my head, so to speak, as a natural voice that is the voice of this person, right, who who may not even be around anymore, whose opinion doesn't mean is To me, what it did before, but that voice is saying you're unattractive. You're not making enough money.[1:47:46] Dr. Paul Conti: You're not good enough. Right? And you know what? I don't believe that. Right.[1:47:50] Dr. Paul Conti: I don't they can identify that, and then you can it doesn't happen all at once, but you can get it out of you. But, generally, you don't get it out of you unless you realize that it's there.[1:47:59] Andrew Huberman: What is the process of getting it out? Because I think that we all have the capacity to Remember certain things and and to arrive at a place where we can, understand. Okay. I'm taking for granted the fact that there's a voice in my head that says Blank. Actually, I have a brief anecdote to say about this, and this isn't the the quote, unquote, I have a friend thing.[1:48:22] Andrew Huberman: I literally have a a, a female friend who the other day called me Laughing and crying because, she was being evicted from her her apartment, and she told her mother about this over the phone. And her mother's response was, Well, at least you're thin. Wow. Like like like and and and she was laughing and crying about it because it reflected so much of her childhood.[1:48:45] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[1:48:45] Andrew Huberman: Right? They're like no other accomplishment of having a job, having an apartment, etcetera, like, you know, mattered. It was it was it was about one thing. It was about a a certain form of aesthetic beauty that I'm not even sure she sub subscribes to even though she happens to be thin. Right?[1:49:00] Andrew Huberman: So so the fact their mother would would lift that from The the conversation, there's such a a a deprivation of of of so many things in that in that interaction, but but it really wasn't about that interaction. It was, You know, she was calling me because it was really about her entire childhood. Right? And, obviously, I'm not equipped to to solve the problem, and it wasn't a request for money or anything of that sort. It was just was almost like the the hilarity and the, and the the sadness of the whole picture.[1:49:29] Andrew Huberman: Right? But, again, it Speaks to the these narratives that we internalize and that sometimes show up in in very glaring ways in the real world. It's like to hear that, I think, was shocking to her. I think she needed to tell me to, like, Like, is this real? But then it was clear that that message had existed in her head for a long time anyway.[1:49:46] Dr. Paul Conti: That could be very pivotal If she realizes that, right, and even the power of the humor of it this is absurd. Right? That could be very powerful in in creating change, because if there's some vestige of that inside of her, right, where, like, she still believes, like, oh, I'm not good enough because I achieved a, b, and c, but I don't look like x or whatever, It can very much help because there's a lot of power behind realizing that absurdity of, like, oh my god. That's bizarre. Like, so but But wait, is any of that inside of me?[1:50:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Am I carrying some of that with me? I mean, there's an incentive for self scrutiny in you know, through what you're describing. Because What's the ideal amount of that to still be in her? 0.[1:50:24] Andrew Huberman: So as as one comes to realize the messages they've heard or perhaps, Like, in this case that they're still hearing, is the process of overcoming those messages and really arriving at the self? It it sounds to me like it's a Two part process, at least 2 part process is to look in the bin of what are the givens, what are the what are what am I taking for granted about the internal narratives? And and think about their origins in childhood or elsewhere, but then also cultivating the self awareness piece that's under the function of self. Like, What's really true for me at the level of me that has that that isn't the and this is really, I think, about separating out the voices in one's head, these internalized narratives from the person that we really truly are.[1:51:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Because the idea is that those 2 pillars encompass everything we need to look at. Right? The those those 10 cupboards encompass everything, so It's all that. Right? The the person who's going and looking at the givens, they're trying to understand what might be in my unconscious mind that I'm not aware of.[1:51:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And, wow. The, you know, the last time I got this, like, big award at work, I had this reflexive thought of, like, but you're not thin enough. Wow. Woah.[1:51:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, there could be a process. Like, that's going on inside of me. I don't want that going on inside of me. Right?[1:51:37] Dr. Paul Conti: So The process of trying what is unconscious in us that may be causing us harm, which is often where the that's where the trauma goes. Right? It's where it's where the childhood trauma seats itself, Which brings us back around to the intrusive thoughts. Right? Intrusive negative thoughts and negative self dialogue usually does not mean What it meant to the man who need to change jobs.[1:51:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because because there, they were there for a good reason. Right? Then he needed to make change. More often, There, the the the vestiges, the hangover, the lingering badness of some prior trauma.[1:52:11] Dr. Paul Conti: So Oftentimes, when you think, we talked a little bit yesterday about the person who was driving in the car and just telling themselves over and over that they were that they're a loser. Right? And then they they can't achieve the things that they when they stopped doing that. I'm simplifying a little, but that's the basics of it. Right?[1:52:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Because the the Intrusive thoughts, the self narrative, all the negativity in us is often coming from places that are in the unconscious mind. Right. Not always, but this idea that I I don't think I'm good enough. I'm saying it to myself over and over again, like, well, let's go back and look at why, because the answer to that, again, lies in a different place. It was just a different road map.[1:52:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? The man who needed to change jobs had a road map that, like, spent a little bit of time In the eye, self awareness, and then it kinda then it went through self, defense mechanisms in action land, and it spent a lot of time with behavior, then it got up to the strivings. That's his that's his road map. Whereas for someone who's laboring under the intrusive thoughts, the negative self talk, the automaticity, the givens of childhood trauma that needs to go to a different place. We're now we're spending time with the in the unconscious mind, thinking about what's there, Figuring out what's there, bringing things to consciousness.[1:53:21] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? That person say realizing maybe, you know, your friend, you had this realization of, like, oh my goodness. We say, wow. Did that bring something to the conscious mind in her? If so, great.[1:53:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Let's look at that, and let's look a lot at it, and let's look, are there other things there too? Right. Are there other givens? Right? Let's bring them to conscious to consciousness so that we can talk about them.[1:53:41] Dr. Paul Conti: We can identify them and then look at how does that How does that relate to defense mechanism and character structure? And, like, now what are we doing? A a process of of interested inquiry. Like, This is really interesting. I mean, it it should be interesting to the person doing it.[1:53:55] Dr. Paul Conti: It's them. Right? And it should be interesting to the person doing it with them. Right. Because if you're a therapist, it is not interesting to you.[1:54:02] Dr. Paul Conti: You need another job. Right? So it's or or you're talking to a friend, like, if it's a friend is gonna be interested. So There's an interested, honest, open inquiry with the idea of, holy, we're gonna let's learn things so that we can make change for the better. And even though as we talked about yesterday, the intrusive thoughts and the self dialogue that's gone on over and over and over again, it doesn't go away easily.[1:54:24] Dr. Paul Conti: But that doesn't mean it it it doesn't atrophy over time and go away or that the person can have that reflexive thought like, oh, there's the thought again that I'm a loser or that I should Cut myself or I should drink or whatever it is. Like, I know that thought appears in me automatically at times because it was in my head for so long, but it does not telling me anything. It's just an automatic thought. It's telling me I should drink. It doesn't mean anything, right, other than the fact that, like, oh, that's what happens in human beings.[1:54:49] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, that's how the self understanding Brings change in us and gets us over the barriers of why I've been trying this for, you know, what modern mental health would not ever think. I I took the selection. I did the 10 sessions of CBT, like Like, you know, I I'm a failure. Nothing will ever get better. You know, the a different framing that says, hey.[1:55:06] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, this can get better over time, and my understanding, and my Efforts of my thought redirection, my behavioral changes, all makes it better. And then those things I don't want in my head, they're going away. It's taking time, but they're going away.[1:55:18] Andrew Huberman: I'm relieved to hear you say that one can have intrusive thoughts and that one approach to dealing with those is to Acknowledge them and look at them and not try and push them back deeper. You know, not try and eradicate them. I'm familiar with having intrusive thoughts, not all the time, but at various periods throughout my life. And, the idea that one could just, like, Distinguish them is is a great idea, but that's simply not the way it's worked, at least not for me. But I have found that if I, you know, just say, okay.[1:55:51] Andrew Huberman: This is Spontaneously coming up through the neural circuits of my subconscious, and, and they're intrusive, and I don't like them. But I eventually arrive at exactly the place that you described, which is that it's like there's nothing actionable here. Like, it's just they they go from being, intrusive and and troubling to intrusive and just kind of Mildly irritating to intrusive and, like, okay. You know? I I just, you know?[1:56:20] Andrew Huberman: And, yes, I I go through some redirect, like trying to redirect my attention from time to time when they're happening, but I eventually just get to a place where it's like, okay. It's just a boring story or or or boring imagery. There there's nothing there. Like, there's nothing there, and then and then they eventually break up like like clouds. And that and that process could take a while.[1:56:38] Dr. Paul Conti: But Right. Because you took the energy out of them. Right. You made them go away, which happened over time, and then the energy that was so powerful becomes less and less and less. And what happens?[1:56:46] Dr. Paul Conti: They dissipate. They atrophy. Right. That's how they go away because there's no more power. There's no more power in them, and and that really is the way that we make change.[1:56:55] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think, You know, your emphasis upon the fact that it takes time, the fact that it takes effort, the fact that it only goes away slowly. Over 20 years of of, at times, being a therapist, what I've seen be the most daunting. The thing that makes people just give up and go away And go back to the things that are bad, give up on themselves, are that it takes time. And, you know, if you think it's supposed to take 2 weeks And the world around you is kinda leading you to think that, and then you go for help. And the help kinda leads you to think that whether it's 2 weeks or it's 10 weeks, If it's gonna take 2 years, you're gonna go away disheartened.[1:57:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Or maybe more angry at yourself or maybe demoralized. So We we have to look at the truth of all of this. A parallel to your story in my own life for for years years years, I carried A negative voice inside is always waiting for me to do something wrong. So if I say something that's a little bit off or not exactly what I wanna say Now it would say, like, that wasn't good.[1:57:57] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, it says something negative inside to me, or it's waiting for me to drop something and say that I'm stupid and clumsy, right, with me all the time. But over time, through self reflection, through therapy, like, through a lot of hard work, but a desire for things to be better and a desire to understand it, Like, it's not there anymore. I mean, every now and then, it'll raise its head. Right? I'll I'll do something really.[1:58:18] Dr. Paul Conti: I dropped a cup of coffee. I haven't done it in 10 years, and it made a mess. And Now people are coming to clean it up, and, man, the voice came back. Right? But I could recognize it.[1:58:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, I really feel bad about this. And now it gives that voice a chance to come out, but it doesn't come out much anymore. Whereas what I lived with it for years. It doesn't come out, like, much anymore.[1:58:36] Dr. Paul Conti: And when it came out not that long ago, like, I could recognize. Like I'm not happy I did this, and let me help clean it up, but it doesn't mean I'm an idiot. Right? So so the voice in my head can just go away as it's as as I've been Helping it to do for a bunch of years now.[1:58:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think also important for people to understand is that it takes time, but that we can all potentially engage in Right actions, you know, moving towards strivings and hopefulness as we cope with those and try and diminish those internal narratives, Those intrusive thoughts. It's not as if during the entire process, you you know, you can't function. I mean, I think that the, it's, cognitively and sometimes even physically demanding to do, but we can still engage in healthy ways in in the world, and we can, I'm still trying, avoid acting out and and avoid, forms of denial. And and as I say this, I'm realizing that, you know, that The wish for or the impulse to really just suppress intrusive thought born of trauma or whatever else is is really futile.[1:59:39] Andrew Huberman: Like, that's not gonna work.[1:59:40] Dr. Paul Conti: Does it?[1:59:41] Andrew Huberman: It's not gonna work. We have to embrace these narratives and and not expect them to disappear in a finger snap, but But embrace them and, like, see them and look at them and and and be unafraid to look at them and, discount where they are absolutely not true. Right.[1:59:57] Dr. Paul Conti: I would say unafraid to understand. Mhmm. Right? Because we must understand. Means we must Look at what's going on inside of us.[2:00:07] Dr. Paul Conti: When I didn't like that voice but was afraid of it, like, what is going on inside me? What does it say about me? And I'm and I'm directing away from it. Well, that's why it was with me for, like, several decades. Right?[2:00:19] Dr. Paul Conti: But when I start to go look at it, I can find an answer to it. And, again, it it you have to look at what's going on in that person because one might presume and maybe people listening are presuming this or maybe not, but but the but A reasonable presumption that might just reflexively happen in a person would be to think that, oh, when I was younger, the messaging I was getting was that you're not good enough. Right. You're not good enough. Right?[2:00:41] Dr. Paul Conti: That's why I carry with me the you're not good enough. Right? But it's not that. Sometimes it's the opposite that I was rewarded a lot when I was younger for doing things in a way everyone thought was great. Right?[2:00:54] Dr. Paul Conti: Like getting great grades and being well behaved. You're doing all sorts of things that brought a lot A positive reinforcement to me, but I never handled well things that fell even a little bit short of that, and then it would evoke a lot of shame. So So the oppression inside is not coming from denigration. It's coming from something different. Right?[2:01:13] Dr. Paul Conti: Which is which is also why This is not a search to blame someone. Right? Because sometimes, the the the people who are giving the message, like, they're doing the best they can. I mean, someone who's saying to a child, You're a loser. Like, that's not okay.[2:01:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? No matter what, that's not okay. But but that's often not how it happens. Like, you know, the the parent, like, is just communicating, They don't realize that that every time they're admiring a certain level of wealth or a certain kind of beauty, they're giving that message that the child that that doesn't meet that or is ends up not meaning that isn't good enough, like but they don't know that or, you know, I had like, my my parents tried to nurture me, and they did a good job of it in many ways, and teachers did a good job. But so they they're not Realizing, hey, this person's gonna end up, you know, a bunch of years from now not thinking anything's, you know, good enough.[2:01:59] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, they don't know that. So it's not a search For blame and I think that's very, very important, very important. Because often, people don't wanna look inside because they think either I'm gonna find something dramatically wrong with me. And the answer I I would give is there's almost surely not something dramatically wrong with you if you're having that thought. And if somehow there is, You're better off looking at it now than later.[2:02:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And so that's part of it. The other part is that that people become worried that they're going to ruin something. You know, I'm gonna I like my parents, and if I go look at this, I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hate them. Like, people say say things or think things like that.[2:02:38] Dr. Paul Conti: And The idea that we may get down to something that really involves someone being responsible for something bad. Now if that's if that's the truth, the person already knows that inside The vast majority of times, they know that. They're just not facing that. But most of the time also, it's not that. It's just like, okay, that's how life evolved.[2:02:56] Dr. Paul Conti: And what's the predisposition? Like, You know, I was smart enough to get good grades, and I have a low threshold for shame, and people reinforced me. And and, like, oh, like, I can kinda understand that, So then I can get control over it. It's not a search for anger, frustration, blame of of self or others.[2:03:13] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And oftentimes, I I hear that people are Afraid of, dealing with these deeper issues or addressing these deeper issues for fear that they'll lose, say, their their drive. Right? The the thing that makes them successful in the 1st place and that allows them, perhaps even to afford therapy or afford the time to think about these sorts of questions. So it seems to me that The drives that you referred to earlier, the generative drive, the aggressive drive, and the pleasure drive are such critical nodes or areas to look for all of us in terms of figuring out whether or not we're doing well or less well According to some features that are pretty much universal in people.[2:03:55] Andrew Huberman: Essentially, what I'm saying is, at least by my understanding, We all have drives to some extent or another. And to the extent that our aggressive drive is very high and pleasure drive is very high and Whether or not it's pointed in the right direction, it can be generative. If it's not, perhaps it can undermine our generative drive. I'm very curious to know How you've observed the different, ranges of these drives in people and how that predicts whether or not people will do, more or less well in different areas of life. Essentially, how the different drives play out.[2:04:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm. I think the the first thing to say is where the drives are at, so to speak, in in any of us It's a combination of nature and nurture. So either the the nature part tells us the the range, so that that the drive is gonna be.[2:04:43] Dr. Paul Conti: But because nurture means so much to humans, as as we understand it, from epigenetics, from from the advancement of of Science, we see more and more and more how much nurture matters. So the range that's denoted by nature is probably pretty broad. We we see the manifestation of that, and then the nurture lets us then move that drive. Now sometimes, nurture that's not gone in the right Place can move the drive in the wrong direction. Right?[2:05:08] Dr. Paul Conti: But as as adults, as people who can take care of ourselves, who can learn about ourselves, we we can Change where the drives are seated. It's not an easy thing to do because it requires a lot of changes of self or self knowledge and Hard work and but we can do it. Right? We can change the the sort of array of how those drives are manifesting themselves Within us, and we see that. I mean, that's part of the the hopefulness of mental health treatment, right, that we see not just surface changes, but we can see changes on a deeper level.[2:05:39] Dr. Paul Conti: So I think it's important that these things are not fixed. Although, there are some natural elements, you know, someone who may have sort of low aggression or low self assertion. Okay. It's gonna be in the lower range, but it doesn't mean that it's locked in at any one particular point. And that the the place that we wanna be, what is the place that's consistent with the things that we want?[2:06:00] Dr. Paul Conti: The the agency and gratitude as verbs and the, the sense of well-being and all of that. So the the idea is the state of health has the generative drive As as prominent. Right? That's it's the dominant drive. And then aggression and pleasure, which are still active in us, but they're subserving the generative drive.[2:06:20] Dr. Paul Conti: And that's the state that we wish to be in. So when we're assessing, okay, why why is there something that doesn't feel okay or something that's not going okay? Right. Then one way to start, right, is to look at, okay, what's going on in the person? What may be off in the drives?[2:06:34] Dr. Paul Conti: That gives us A very strong idea of, okay, what's going on, a a a way of understanding what's going on as we then go and look in the 10 cupboards To figure out the specifics, okay, what is actually going on here that we can then change, but the framing of what's going on can come through the lens of looking at the drives And how they're manifest in us.[2:06:56] Andrew Huberman: What does it look like when the aggressive drive is very high and the pleasure drive is also very high?[2:07:04] Dr. Paul Conti: So if these drives are running too high, where we end up at is in a place of envy. Right? And and envy, I I I'm always sort of On the soapbox about envy, because I think envy is just so wildly destructive. And if the aggressive drive is very high So the person say in in one way of, one way this can manifest itself, just wants more and more and more. Right?[2:07:28] Dr. Paul Conti: They're not getting satisfaction from anything. If they want more, that may be because of a strong vulnerability inside of them. So something that might map to to narcissism, for example. There's a there could be a strong aggressive drive to get more, and that leads to to something that's very unhealthy. So The idea that I want more, I need more, I don't have enough, I can't get enough, then fosters envy, right, which is The the not the desire to, like, be better or to have more, but it's just the desire to feel better about the self, Whether that involves raising the self up or bringing someone else down.[2:08:05] Dr. Paul Conti: That's why envy is destructive. So very high levels of Aggression that are not tempered, for example, by a generative drive that that would also be high then create a circumstance of envy, And the envy is destructive. And the same happens if the pleasure drive is very, very strong. So so if one continues to want more pleasure so I can't find any satisfaction. Don't feel good about myself.[2:08:28] Dr. Paul Conti: I feel bereft inside. Right? And and I see that, oh, pleasure can make me feel better, but just for a little bit. Then it fades away, and I want more of it, and I want more of it. That also can lead to the place of envy.[2:08:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, that's the outcome. So if the aggressive drive is running very high or the pleasure drive is running very high or if both are running very high, but it only takes 1 In order to end up in a place of envy, so if the generative drive is not high enough to overcome how high the aggressive drive is, which would mean then the aggressive drive will be sublimated towards good productive things. So take the energy and put it towards something that is goodness. But if the aggressive drive is was way out there ahead of the generative drive, that ends up in a place of envy As does the pleasure drive. If I want more and more and more, but I never get satisfaction from from anything, it never brings me any sense of goodness that Where it ends is is in a place of of vulnerability and resentment.[2:09:29] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because envy involves wanting more. Right. And and and envy, if we look at what's really going on, envy under the surface involves wanting everything. Right?[2:09:38] Dr. Paul Conti: If a if a person is at the outer limits of envy, Right. Which is why envy is so destructive. Because if I can't get enough pleasure and there's so much aggression In me, then I'm not gonna make myself feel better, but what I can do is make other people feel worse.[2:09:55] Andrew Huberman: I wanna ask you more about envy, but First, I want to ask, is one way to characterize the generative drive and to distinguish it from the other drives Is to say that generative drives are prosocial, meaning they tend to bring about benevolent interactions between people.[2:10:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. In the sense that so prosocial as constructive, right, as as in a sense, building goodness, Then, yes, because it it's the drive in us that makes us wanna love and nurture things, right, that makes us wanna learn and and sometimes learn to make better in the world or learn for learning's sake that the that the drive is a drive of goodness. So if the drive is then gonna gonna enact itself in the world around us, It's gonna be prosocial because we we exist as social units. Right? I mean, if we decide, oh, I wanna be an island off somewhere, like, that's not healthy.[2:10:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? We exist in Social units from small, like a nuclear family, right, to a neighborhood, right, all the way up to nations and to the to the planet. So if we if we perceive the truth of that that, Hey. There's an interdependence be between me and others, and I and I see that, then the drive will lead to Choices and behaviors that are socially constructive.[2:11:10] Andrew Huberman: Earlier, you talked about aggression, and you were clear to Make sure that we all understood that aggression does not necessarily mean violent aggression. Right. That there are different forms of aggression. I'm curious if you could give us some examples of how you've observed, people with high levels of aggression and high levels of pleasure drive as well, both male and female. And, you know, here without, defaulting to stereotypes, I think a lot of people just Despite the fact that you've clarified what aggression is and isn't in this in the context of this conversation, we hear the word aggression, and we think, verbal attack, physical attack.[2:11:48] Andrew Huberman: However, the way you're describing aggression and the aggressive drive, I have a feeling that you're referring to other expressions of aggression as well.[2:11:55] Dr. Paul Conti: So if the aggressive drive is running too high, and that could have factors of nature, factors of nurture, Right. Factors of the situation the person is in, factors of their whole life, but it ends up at the moment in a place that is too high, Then what that person is doing in one way or another is to try and exert an unhealthy level of control. And that can be done in so many different ways. It can be done in that overt way of of just intimidating people, right, of of using harsh language its people, it can be done by manipulating people. It can be done through passive aggression.[2:12:29] Dr. Paul Conti: There there are all sorts of ways that the person can try and exert unhealthy control, But that's where we end up if there's too much expression of the aggressive drive in us.[2:12:40] Andrew Huberman: That makes sense, and it reminds me of an example from my own life where, first off, I should say I've had almost exclusively positive collaborations among my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere. Like, Every one of those collaborations has ended in a paper that we were all happy with, but more importantly, the relationships grew and, were not diminished. Right? But I had 1 collaboration with someone not to be named where, it was going very well, but I had the need to reschedule an appointment, so I sent ahead a a note about the fact that my carnea dealing with I had some other things. I explained why I need to reschedule the appointment, and didn't receive a reply, which was a little unusual, but then eventually received a reply that said, Well, it's clear that you don't want to pursue this collaboration, which is like the furthest thing from the truth.[2:13:32] Andrew Huberman: Right? And so I, And so I expressed that, and then the collaboration was reinstated. But it it brought to mind some concern for me, because there's sort of an Dream reaction to, you know, something that happens among academics, or anyone. We get busy when things come up. It was important to tend to, the car, that is.[2:13:52] Andrew Huberman: And then at some point later, they were late to a number of meetings. Okay. No big deal. We're academics. We tend to run late.[2:14:01] Andrew Huberman: That's typical of many academics. But then I was late once to a meeting, and they essentially left and wrote an email that said something of the sort like, I've got my own great ideas, so I'm no longer interested in pursuing the collaboration. And I and I was, like, pretty shocked. Right? Because, there was nothing really outside the ordinary in terms of Busyness and professorial schedules, and and there were other people involved, postdocs and things like that.[2:14:28] Andrew Huberman: And there was a great project to be, you know, to be worked out. So I remember being disappointed, but also really kinda surprised. But then when I mapped it back to the earlier example of the[2:14:38] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:14:38] Andrew Huberman: Car incident, I thought, Well, like, there's a real, sort of lack of ability this person to handle disappointment, and yet they're exerting Or demonstrating rather some of the same behavior of occasionally running tardy and these kinds of things. And I remember feeling like that was pretty aggressive. Like, it's a pretty aggressive reaction to something that, you know, could have been handled with a conversation. Now I must say, I'm very grateful that the collaboration didn't proceed, and it went elsewhere and worked out great, and they're doing great, and we're doing great. And so no hard feelings, but, it stands out to me as a as a pretty salient example of aggression, but not played out at the level of yelling or anything.[2:15:19] Andrew Huberman: There's a passivity in there, but then there's also kind of a, kind of entitlement. And here, of course, I'm only looking at the other person's behavior, and I should acknowledge, I realize. Canceling, not good. Being late, not good. But Listen.[2:15:31] Andrew Huberman: I'm a human being, and I But[2:15:32] Dr. Paul Conti: you canceled once. You were late. Was this this isn't Yeah. That This isn't habitual. This is human stuff.[2:15:38] Dr. Paul Conti: Right?[2:15:38] Andrew Huberman: Right. And and a lot of, A lot of good work had gone into the project. Right. And there was a cost where, you know, most most importantly, the postdocs suffered because they weren't involved in these interactions at all, and and yet the the project halted at that point. Mhmm.[2:15:54] Andrew Huberman: So to me, that seems like an example of Somebody who has a, well, strong aggressive drive, and that's clear from the they are incredibly successful in in in the academic domain. And when disappointed, you know, lashes back or is passive? 1 or 1 or the other. Is that is Is that kind of what we're getting at here?[2:16:15] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:16:16] Andrew Huberman: Not surprisingly, perhaps, the the person rarely publishes with other people. Right. Probably, that doesn't make a very good collaborative partner.[2:16:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. And it it totally makes sense. I mean, if you think about what you're describing here, right, which is some vulnerability in the person. There's some way in which The person doesn't feel good enough. No matter what, the this person has achieved.[2:16:36] Dr. Paul Conti: So then there's a sense of of the need and the right to over control. So when you agree to work together, you know, you didn't agree that I'll never have to cancel anything. Right? Sure. But but but the Thought was different.[2:16:51] Dr. Paul Conti: The framing is different on the on the other end. That now we've we've we're gonna work together. Right? So I'm exerting significant control over you. And, again, you're not aware of it.[2:17:00] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And may it may be that he's not aware of it.[2:17:02] Andrew Huberman: In this case, it was a she.[2:17:03] Dr. Paul Conti: Oh, okay. Okay. So they always think of someone different, but she Has to have some deficit itself that that results in in the reflexive need to over control. And and think about the first response is a nonresponse, right, Which is that's aggression. It's just it's just passive aggression.[2:17:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? The thought would be, well, you're you're worried. Something doesn't feel good in you because I didn't respond, which was True. Right? You're expecting a response.[2:17:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Maybe you don't know. Did you get the email? You know, what's happening? Is she mad? So it's sort of effective.[2:17:31] Dr. Paul Conti: It creates some consternation and some dissonance in you. Right? Then on top of that, the person is willing to potentially, at that point, sacrifice the relationship. Right? So you think about Aggression now is not good.[2:17:44] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? This excess aggression is not good for you. It it also is clearly eclipsing the generative drive. Right? Because it's not good for this person and their research.[2:17:55] Dr. Paul Conti: It's not good for this person and the postdocs in their lab. Right? But the but the person is willing to accept That in the service of gratifying the excess in aggression. Now so then you said something that then sort of made it okay, right, for the short Okay. Then the person feels gratified.[2:18:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, whether you apologize or not, they took it as, you know, you've, to some degree, bowed down before me now, like, it'll be okay to for at least for the short term. Right? But then the next thing that happens actually does end the collaboration. Right? So that's not good.[2:18:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and you say even from a self serving perspective, that person was collaborating with you for a reason. Right? She saw a benefit to the science That she's very, very interested in through the collaboration with you, but then let that all go. Right?[2:18:42] Dr. Paul Conti: In the service of what? In in the service of Of the ego, right, of, you know, my I don't feel good enough about myself. Right? The response to that then is a is a response of envy, That I don't like that you have the freedom to behave differently than I want you to. Right?[2:18:58] Dr. Paul Conti: I don't like any of it. I don't like that I don't control you as much as I would Like to, and ultimately, it's that envy that becomes destructive. So it's a setback for that person. It's of the science that person was doing. It's destructive of the science that you were doing, so envy is destructive.[2:19:15] Dr. Paul Conti: And here, The the the high level of aggression, the aggressive drives at a very high place. It's exceeding the generative drive. The pleasure drive isn't high enough either because there's not enough pleasure coming from the great science that's being done. Right? So then the person is Approaching the world through the lens of envy.[2:19:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? They don't feel good enough. They wanna exert that aggression through over control, and what they end up doing is destructive. Right? And it's very clearly destroyed.[2:19:44] Dr. Paul Conti: It's a great example because it's destructive of the science, which is ostensibly the reason that you're there. Right? It's the reason you were there, but someone who needs to exert over control is there not just for that reason. And then the other reasons can Trump the generative reason that they're there. And that's how envy when when It is the product of aggression or pleasure seeking being too high always, unfailingly, Creates destruction.[2:20:16] Dr. Paul Conti: And how different is that from agency and gratitude as active Verbs. Right? There's there's a sense of agency, but the agency isn't being exactly enacted. Because if the agency is being enacted in the service of science career or whatever it may be, that's not that's not going so well. Right?[2:20:35] Dr. Paul Conti: And the and the gratitude part isn't active. Like, my goodness, I'm I'm here. Like, I have this great career. I'm discovering things. I get to spend my life in science.[2:20:42] Dr. Paul Conti: I get to collaborate with you. Like, there's so many things to feel good about. I have postdocs in my lab. Right? I get to nurture them because I know more and I can guide.[2:20:50] Dr. Paul Conti: That that's not leading. Right? Envy is not those things, which is why people who are doing that, at least in this realm of life, although this often No. This bleeds into other realms of life. What you the vast majority of times, you see is someone who does not have happiness.[2:21:09] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. The in the way that worthy of happiness with the quotes. Right? That happiness is, you know, the sense of peace. Right?[2:21:15] Dr. Paul Conti: The sense of of, well-being. Right? This this being able to delight in things, contentment. Right? The person doesn't have that.[2:21:23] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And here, it's interesting. Right? This person gets to the highest levels of Academia, and they're very successful, and they have a lab of their own, and they're collaborating. You think that's all great.[2:21:33] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? But not inside of them. It's not bringing them Those things is evidenced by how this person is behaving, and and I would bet almost a 100% if you say, what's that person like in other aspects of life, at least in the professional world, Probably in others too. No one's gonna describe a happy person.[2:21:50] Andrew Huberman: So much of what you just said captures this individual, extremely well. And, it also reminds me that so much of the way that you're describing this aggressive drive Can also be observed perhaps in the way that people show up to social interactions, not necessarily big interactions, maybe even just interactions between 2 people. What I'm I'm thinking of here as the the person, male or female, who shows up and and just kind of takes over, like like, talks the whole time and Tell stories. I went to a meal, at the when I graduated university, and someone showed up for the 1st time, at this meal, Meaning, we had never met them before and just, like, sat down and just started telling stories for, like, an hour. Mhmm.[2:22:32] Andrew Huberman: And it was interesting portions of it were captivating. And then at some point, I realized, This is this is either total pathology, like this person is is crazy, but they weren't crazy, or, they have no recognition that They're absorbing all the oxygen in the room as it's sometimes described. But it seemed like they had this need to just control the whole environment by way of speech, Just like, you know, fire hose stories. And I've seen this definitely in the academic realm. I've seen this in the nonacademic realm and social settings, and and what's interesting is perhaps why this person does this Over these people do this, but what's also interesting is how people react to it.[2:23:15] Andrew Huberman: You know, the on the one hand, it I think most people find that kind of obnoxious.[2:23:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. But[2:23:21] Andrew Huberman: there also seem to be people who see this as like, oh, that person has a lot of agency. Like, they they're a leader. Like, they they they actually Grab a lot of the attention that they're seeking, and we tend to view those people as kind of empowered.[2:23:34] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[2:23:34] Andrew Huberman: I don't actually think that they're necessarily empowered, but but Perhaps it stems from the feeling that the rest of us, I like to think, have, which is some sense of, social etiquette where there's some give and take. You know, you walk into a room, you kind of assess, you know, what's the context here. There's some listening as well as some speaking, and so on. And and so when someone shows up and just kind of violates all those rules, on the one hand, it it can be obnoxious and overtake everything, but as Said before, you know, there's also this the sense of, like, oh, like, that must be nice to just be able to, like, be be as 11 feels. And so I think, I'm describing this not because I I think people should mimic this type of behavior either way.[2:24:16] Andrew Huberman: You know, be really meek and not say anything that's on their mind or or just overtake, but because I feel like it might be an exploration of This aggressive drive, and if someone's doing that, are are they trying to, like, mask something else? And why do people react to, these Seemingly powerful people in this way.[2:24:35] Dr. Paul Conti: These things happen in the world around us. Right? They're independent of the spectrum of gender, the spectrum of Intelligence achievement. Right? They're they're they're human problems.[2:24:44] Dr. Paul Conti: So a person you're describing, whether that person has Character structure problems that that are present with them across time or whether they're in a certain place, you know, whether it's in life or today. Like, we don't know for sure What the underpinnings but but what you're describing is it's a presentation of narcissism. Right? And narcissism is rooted not In confidence, not in arrogance. Right?[2:25:11] Dr. Paul Conti: It's rooted in vulnerability. It's rooted in, I don't feel good Enough. And narcissism then then engages with the world through the lens of envy. So no one else gets to have any time. No one else gets to say anything funny.[2:25:27] Dr. Paul Conti: No one else maybe gets to say anything at all. Right? There there's a there's a dominance Of the room. Right? There's a dominance of the room that comes through an inability to tolerate the back and forth of human Interactions.[2:25:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Human engagement. Right? So then that person becomes very dominant. And why is that?[2:25:48] Dr. Paul Conti: Because when they tell a story and they get a Laugh or even if it's not that funny and it's a 15th story, but somebody smiles a little bit or nobody smiles, they can perceive inside that, like, I just did that. I said that, and maybe somebody responded positively. I feel good about that for a split second. Now that's gone. And they then, You know, then the next thing comes and the next thing comes because people who are coming at the world through the lens of narcissism, whether it's just in that Particular event, right, or it's across life, right, are never satisfied, and nothing ever brings enough goodness.[2:26:21] Dr. Paul Conti: Nothing ever brings enough Feeling of pleasure. So the person then wants more, and that's how the person dominates the room. Now that can be very seductive. Right. Narcissistic people, not always, but are often very seductive because of that appearance of mastery, right, of control.[2:26:40] Dr. Paul Conti: So that person did have we we could look at it in the short term and say, that person had mastery over the room. Right? No one said anything for an hour but them. Right. So they had mastery over the room.[2:26:50] Dr. Paul Conti: They had control over the room. But what they're doing is exerting over control. Right? In the short it's like, you know, penny wise and pound foolish. Right?[2:26:58] Dr. Paul Conti: They borrow a dollar today to pay back a 100 tomorrow. Right? Because they got to control that room, but a lot of people, not everyone right. Some people are seduced by it. Right?[2:27:08] Dr. Paul Conti: But a lot of people will take away from this something that's not a good feeling, something that wasn't mutual, that doesn't make the person want us to collaborate with that person, Even be in the same space as that person. Right? So it's it's counterproductive. Right? Because the people who might come under the spell, so to speak, right, They're the people who were brought under the spell.[2:27:26] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? They're they're less observant, dynamic, you know, intuitive, introspective. They they're they're not the people that you want in a sense on your side. Right? The people that would be most valuable to collaborate with, even as thought partners, have conversations with, Like, those people are gonna be put off because even if they don't know exactly what's wrong, they know, like, that didn't feel good.[2:27:47] Dr. Paul Conti: And they map. Do I want that feeling more in my life? No. Right? So that's the the counterproductive aspects.[2:27:53] Dr. Paul Conti: Well, that's why narcissism is destructive. Because you might say, well, there's nothing destructive in that, You know, in that interaction but, again, you have to be standing so up close to it that you don't see the bigger picture. Because when you stand back from that, that's not a person who's By and large, you know, you see that's not a person who's interconnected in the world around them, has a group of good supportive friends, has a bunch of colleagues Where they can't exchange information and and you know, because all that social dynamic has to happen in the rest of life. So you're seeing a situation That is that is counterproductive. That is destructive, and you always see that when people are enacting narcissism, whether it's, Okay.[2:28:31] Dr. Paul Conti: But much bad things have happened, and for whatever reason, like, I'm in an unhealthy place and I'm enacting it right now, or if I'm enacting it every day of my life because it's in my character structure and I haven't recognized and And change it, it's always destructive.[2:28:43] Andrew Huberman: The narcissist that I've known and observed almost always seem to have a partner who Clearly supports their narcissism or at least doesn't speak up very much against it, at least not publicly, and not much else except a professional role.[2:29:00] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm.[2:29:00] Andrew Huberman: In fact, there's 1 scientist who I did not work with who comes to mind, and and the joke about him was always that, this person Would talk about themselves endlessly Mhmm. For the first half hour that you run into them and say, okay. Well, enough about me. Why don't you tell me about me? Mhmm.[2:29:15] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. This person moved to a different country with their partner, comes back every once in a while, has essentially done nothing over the last, a decade or so, I kinda left the field, and, it's kind of the the secretly the laughing stock of the field. There was a One other anecdote about this person, I'm just, I'm not picking on them. I'm just trying to explore the the these dimensions of aggression and and and low pleasure, drive, and envy. At lab meetings, it was it was well known that they they would host a basketball game, but it was well known that you, did not wanna score, like, you know, like, on this person.[2:29:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:29:57] Andrew Huberman: Because you would Right. Be asked to leave the lab. And indeed, several people were asked to leave the laboratory for having made embarrassed the the lab head at One of these lab events.[2:30:08] Dr. Paul Conti: By participating in exactly the event that was described in the way it was described and doing something competent.[2:30:14] Andrew Huberman: Right. So so the the game was essentially a way of for the person to build themselves up, and they were a mediocre at best basketball player. So, like, here's this game where everyone's expected to pretend. Right? And I have to imagine pretend that the person is actually better at what they do than they are.[2:30:30] Andrew Huberman: And and and in some ways, this it feels like a Like a replica of of how narcissism shows up in so many other areas of life. Like you said, you know, these people are rarely surrounded by people who, are Actually, very bright, self, you know, self effacing, etcetera, you know, who, They they tend to gather people that just support them or no one at all because because no reasonably healthy person would would choose to be around that.[2:30:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Because that that game is a metaphor for all of life for that person. It it's sending that message. Like, see this message and extrapolate it out to everything else. So we we and what is so what's the metaphor?[2:31:09] Dr. Paul Conti: What's it communicating? It's communicating that you don't Do anything better than I do. Right? You don't rise above me. Interestingly.[2:31:20] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? You don't arise above me in any Well, you don't get to know things I don't know. You don't get to do anything better than than than I than I do. Right? Or I will be destructive towards you.[2:31:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? It's it's fascinating. Right? Because it's not about the game. Right?[2:31:35] Dr. Paul Conti: The the the game is a way of of of communicating that message. Right? Interesting. The person is not even that good at the game. Like, why not choose something you're really good at.[2:31:44] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Because then the the message is not communicated as clearly. Right? And a lot of this is coming as unconscious. Let's choose something I'm kind of fair to middling at.[2:31:51] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And they make it very clear that no one gets to be better, or I do something destructive to them. I mean, that's exactly what that is. And and imagine, like, someone is thrown out of the of the lab. Right?[2:32:01] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, like, this is in many ways, like, The biggest thing in their life or one of the biggest things that have been changing.[2:32:08] Andrew Huberman: I mean, they they they the cost of that in the larger world is One less potentially fantastic scientist.[2:32:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. And that's the broader that's always the broader picture because the narcissist is standing very, very close to the tapestry. Right? And and so so the interaction there is, you have scored a basket when I have not. Right?[2:32:28] Dr. Paul Conti: So you don't understand the message that you're not supposed to exceed me, and now I will get rid of you because you're dangerous to have around. Right? Because you don't get the message, and and you may me in other ways. And also, I'm gonna feel better because I have the power to be punitive, right, even though it's wantonly punitive. Right?[2:32:46] Dr. Paul Conti: And un completely unjustified, but I have the power to do that, and it'll make me feel good than to push you away. And I know this is not gonna be good for you, and I'll feel good about that. Right? But that doesn't last, of course. That's why the person continues to do it, and it also doesn't understand at all that, like, That's not good for science.[2:33:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Or most importantly, that's not good for me. Right? There's a graduate student in that lab because you didn't say Fire the graduates to make the graduate student leave if the person wasn't good. No.[2:33:17] Dr. Paul Conti: It's make the graduate student leave no matter what. So the person is doing things that are injurious to the society around us, obviously, to the specific person they're targeting and also to themselves. And that's where if you follow if you follow envy and you see high levels of it in situations that are unbounded. So like, this situation is unbounded in the sense that the person can do that. There's no higher authority.[2:33:41] Andrew Huberman: Right. Well, labs, not this is changing. And by the way, I I should back up a second and say that I do believe, and it's been my experience that most scientists and lab heads are are not narcissists, are quite kind, are benevolent. I mean, they can be a little quirky. We're scientists after all, but, but not narcissists.[2:33:58] Andrew Huberman: At the same time, it is true that for a long time, less so now, Laboratories were sort of like little fiefdoms. There was very little oversight from the universities, and so the lab you joined became your entire world and landscape.[2:34:12] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[2:34:12] Andrew Huberman: And there was some exploitation by narcissistic lab heads for sure. Yeah. As you said, it was unbounded. Right? Like, there was no oversight, whereas this would be much harder to recreate today if someone would want it to.[2:34:26] Dr. Paul Conti: And I think that's why By almost everyone listening to this, will it will resonate with them. They'll find some familiarity because you see this or you can see this in situations where There's a bounded group of people. Right? This is just a certain group of people in a certain situation, and that's who they are. But the authority of the person leading the group is unbounded.[2:34:48] Dr. Paul Conti: So there's a situation where if that person has narcissistic tendencies, aggressive drive is too high, Pleasure drive is high but not being met. If all of those things are happening, that's when you see this come to light, which is why the destruction varies based upon the destruction that's permissible within the framework. Right? So here that this person wasn't gonna, like, Fire everyone in their lab. Right?[2:35:13] Dr. Paul Conti: So in a sense, they could only damage their labs so much. Although maybe if you damage your lab so much, you don't get funding, you inadvertently sink yourself. Right. So so even there, that person could bring about their own destruction. But when you see the other end where it's Truly unbounded, like like, in the sense of war.[2:35:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Is someone who had who can control a a a machine of war, Who who then has everything. Right? Like, it look. What do they need?[2:35:39] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Well, they need something they don't have and never will get. So so now they start enacting more, and more is Destructive. Right? And you think, oh, that person wants something.[2:35:48] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, how many times does does someone start a war? Right? That's there's clearly an unjustified War. Right? So war because they they want something, then they get something and they're satisfied.[2:35:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? That that's not how it goes. Right? Then they get something and they're not and they want more. So in in discussions at times about narcissism and envy and and how that can play out on the the world stage.[2:36:10] Dr. Paul Conti: So sometimes, you know, huge events in human history will will come up, and people, for example, will will bring up Adolf Hitler. And and they did it. He Hitler wanted Things wanted things. No. The the the unbound narcissism, the unbound envy wanted destruction.[2:36:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. This is a person who if things have continued to go as this person intended, right, there would have been no one left on earth But him, because the process is nothing but destructive, which is why after the fact that there's Incalculable human carnage. Right? And he himself was among the incalculable human carnage because that's the endpoint Of narcissism, that's the of of narcissism on a broad stage. Right?[2:36:58] Dr. Paul Conti: That's the endpoint of envy at its highest Magnitude, and we see that as examples whether we see on the smaller stage of the lab, right, but, head that you're describing or On the larger stage of of unbounded war, we end up with destruction, like 100% time. That's the final common pathway for all of that.[2:37:17] Andrew Huberman: Are there some consistent themes of childhood that lead somebody to become a narcissist? And in addition to that, I'm curious whether or not narcissists ever have insight, whether or not if offered the opportunity to explore the 10 cupboards Under the structure of self and function of self, whether or not they eventually see inside those cupboards and go, oh my goodness. I've got this, self that's clearly overinflated, and I've got these defense mechanisms, and I'm so envious and and and modify their behavior, or whether or not the Cysts are immune from, constructive self reflection.[2:37:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. Right. To to answer the the first part is is The vast majority of narcissism, it it may be all of it, we don't know for sure, is is rooted in the childhood trauma of not feeling good enough. Right? Which is not an excuse, right, for people doing doing awful things.[2:38:13] Dr. Paul Conti: It's not what what we're saying. We're trying to have an explanatory mechanism, right, Which which goes back to formative life experiences and not feeling good enough, whether it was because that person was directly denigrated Or that person wasn't denigrated but could never work hard enough, never could be could be enough to to to get, approval. Right? Again, it's not a 100% and human beings are complicated. But if you go and look, you you see that that there was never a state like, oh, I feel good enough about myself.[2:38:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And if there's never a state of I feel good enough about myself because someone has told me that and given me the pat on the head or given me the positive comment, you can see how In a certain sort of natural lay of the land genetically and in in concert with with other experiences, that person can get to adulthood With, with a lot of aggression in them and never having experienced I'm good enough, it's still running along inside of them, And then they're enacting that aggression in the world around them. That's most commonly what we see. And because there's such deep Vulnerability and such deep insecurity than people, let's say, people who suffer from full blown narcissism, narcissistic personality disorder, So inaction of envy on the on the highest levels, that is they're so defended. They're so strongly defended In an unhealthy manner from seeing their own vulnerability, that it is extremely difficult to get that person to come around and say, okay.[2:39:40] Dr. Paul Conti: Let let's look in those 10 cupboards. Within the field, people often talk about Treating narcissistic people, they talk about it in a nihilistic way. And and some just very experienced people say, oh, that's impossible. Right. That never gets better.[2:39:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Now I I'm not a believer in therapeutic nihilism. I I I think that, yes, it is it is The norm that that person just can't get it together to go look at that thing, they're so defended against it. They're so afraid of it. Right? They won't look anywhere near it, so they're looking in the other direction, and they're furthering all that unhealth.[2:40:16] Dr. Paul Conti: It's not the case that that it's always that way. And on a couple of occasions, I have worked with, seen, you know, witnessed narcissistic people who can make changes. Now it's usually in the context of something very extreme that causes them to do that. So someone who will no longer have access to Family members they want to see or to financial resources that they, you know, need to keep themselves afloat. It's things that often are that dramatic.[2:40:44] Dr. Paul Conti: It's not always that, but we can see though in those kind of extenuating situations where the the Problem is so big. The envy is so high, but the motivation for change is very, very high because since on the carrot and stick model, the Stick here is very, very strong that if a person then goes and does that, you you can see change inside of them. So we're never in a place of of therapeutic nihilism. But the but the the barriers to that are very, very high because the the self is so wounded That the person is protecting that self so strongly, that's why the narcissism and envy are so full blown, and it's hard to get that person to go back and look, But not impossible.[2:41:26] Andrew Huberman: Based on what you're telling me, it seems that it's a very low probability that A non clinician could change a narcissist. Like, in other words, if one is engaging in the world with a narcissist, because they have to, presumably, or they just find themselves in that place. Would you say to that person, there's very little, if anything, that you can do to Change the narcissist's behavior or, psychological framework. If they for because, of course, if the narcissist Can't often do it for themselves with the help of a skilled clinician. Why would a, why would anyone else be able to achieve that?[2:42:06] Dr. Paul Conti: So we're coming at what we're doing Here from a perspective of truth about human beings. Right? And that truth brings with it hopefulness. Right? It brings with it hopefulness that People can change and how people can change.[2:42:19] Dr. Paul Conti: And and and I am a 100% all for that. It's the way to look at ourselves. Right? But it is also true that there are aspects of pathology that that require clinical treatment In order to improve. So now we're looking from the other side and saying, hey.[2:42:37] Dr. Paul Conti: There's a problem here, and there's a deep problem here. And that we have to come at from a different perspective of how can you help that problem. And there's a science behind this too of what level of clinical care, for example, It is most likely to be helpful to someone like this, and it's not an individual clinician even. Right? It's a team of people Who work through different modalities who can sort of wrap around that person.[2:43:01] Dr. Paul Conti: So it's not just a level of clinical Care is needed, but it's a relatively high level of clinical care. And that in general is the is the only way that we get at narcissism. That's not a 100%, but That's the vast majority of time. So what can then the person do? Right?[2:43:17] Dr. Paul Conti: A person cannot be a team of clinicians. Right? What that person can do, one choice is to disengage. Right? But disengagement can come with the promise of reengagement.[2:43:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Many, many times I've worked with people And practice and rehearsed with them, like, okay, what might you say to someone along the lines of, you know, I've known you for a long time, or I care about you, or I love you, Whatever they may say to lead in, but I I can't be with you or I can't be around you. Right? There's there's there's something going on that that makes it not okay for me. It doesn't Feel okay.[2:43:50] Dr. Paul Conti: Your impression maybe says things, like, you know, you're aggressive or demeaning or whatever it is, or maybe they just say, it just doesn't feel okay. I can't have it. And And then the the the the need to step away from the person, but, look, if you if you got some help, right, if you took better care of yourself in ways that would Be better for you and for the people around you, then, of course, I'd wanna be in your life. You know, something like that. So disengagement can come, You know, with that, encouragement, right, to to the person.[2:44:19] Dr. Paul Conti: But but one way or another, you have to set boundaries, which is okay. I have to deal with this so I'll deal with them a little bit, or I don't have to deal with this person, so I won't. Right? Or I can't get away from this person, so I have to take with a grain of salt What they're saying to me but ultimately, some form of strong boundaries or disengagement is like, that's the response that that That that's the self care response, right, for the person who's who's with the narcissist.[2:44:46] Andrew Huberman: What are some other ways that the aggressive drive and pleasure drive and generative drive for that matter play out. For instance, we talked about the former patient of yours who eventually switched jobs, clearly had a generative drive within him, but it was being blocked by a number of choices rooted in narratives that originated in childhood, etcetera. We talked about individuals with high aggressive drive, high degree of pleasure drive, but a very diminished capacity to experience pleasure, and therefore, A lot of envy and the destruction that comes with envy. Yes. What are some of the other variations on these drives, as you observe them in your clinical practice?[2:45:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Mhmm. Mhmm. Well, our overall framing is we want the generative drive to be the one that's deterministic. Right? It's the one with the strongest Influence.[2:45:34] Dr. Paul Conti: So we wanna we wanna nurture the generative drive in us and in others, and and it makes sense for us to to talk about that. But we've looked at how do things get out of balance. Right? And from the perspective of, well, what if the aggressive drive Or the pleasure drive, what if they're too high? Right?[2:45:52] Dr. Paul Conti: And then it makes sense that often not always what can be driving them to be so High are things that aren't healthy in us. Then the higher they get, the harder it is to gratify them. So we end up with that problem of envy. Right. But we can be out of balance in the other direction too, right, where where the person does not Does not experience an ability to, engage with the world around them.[2:46:19] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? They they don't Think they can do anything to change anything for the better or inside or outside of themselves, and, you know, they're not doing much. They don't feel that they can do much. And and and also not receiving pleasure from things. There's no gratification from the things a person is doing.[2:46:34] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, we see situations like this too With the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive, or both, and then we end up not at envy because envy is the side of excess, But we end up at demoralization on the lower side. Now demoralization is is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis. It can predispose to Psychiatric problems like the biochemical abnormality of depression. Right? But what we're talking about here is not A psychiatric diagnosis.[2:47:05] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Like, envy is not a psychiatric diagnosis. Like, it's a it's a thing, like, that can be experienced that can lead to diagnoses. The same thing with demoralization. If you don't feel that you can make a difference to anything, right, and you're not enjoying anything or feeling gratification from anything, then that pool is gonna win out.[2:47:24] Dr. Paul Conti: That's gonna be a demoralized person. The same way, of course, we know in experiments when, you know, the the you Now you have a a a rat going for food. If, like, if you do it enough when the rat goes through the food and you take the food away, the rat stops trying.[2:47:37] Andrew Huberman: And they learned helplessness Right.[2:47:39] Dr. Paul Conti: And that right. That exists in us too, and it comes along with all sorts of other things because we're being not rats. Right. We have a whole bunch of thoughts about that of, oh my god. I'm not good enough and nothing will ever be okay.[2:47:52] Dr. Paul Conti: And, you know, so demoralization then Is is can be very, very strong in taking a person away from the other things we're trying To seek. Right? Either because that person has the the essentially, the learned helplessness. Right? And all the things the complicated things inside of us that can come along with that, Or the person isn't gaining pleasure from anything.[2:48:14] Dr. Paul Conti: So when when we're considering the ways in which we can be out of balance, right, We think, okay, aggression and pleasure drive, if if 1 or the other or both is too high, we end up at Envy. And if 1 or the other or both are too low, we end up with demoralization. And you can take almost any scenario. It could be a scenario of something that's just not really not going well for a person. Not a clinical scenario.[2:48:43] Dr. Paul Conti: It's a thing in a person's life. Or we can take clinical scenarios and the vast majority, you know, outside of outliers, like a head injury, for example. We can take those scenarios and we can look at it in that way, and we can understand what's going on. At least we can understand enough That when we go back and look in the 10 cupboards, of the 2 pillars, we can then have some understanding of, okay, What is going on? We know the basic picture and how things are not in, in the balance we want them in.[2:49:15] Dr. Paul Conti: Now we can understand that enough to go back And then look in those 10 covers, and and I believe that just about everything except those biological outliers like a head injury fits into that Heuristic, which is why we can use it to understand. We can use it to help. We can use it to make change.[2:49:34] Andrew Huberman: What a powerful lens to Think about and explore the self and where things are working for us and where things are possibly not working for us. If I or anyone else out there wanted to get some read on it, assess their level of aggressive drive and their Level of pleasure drive and their ability to experience pleasure. What sorts of questions would one ask? You know, For instance, is it a question of, like, how driven am I? How how much get up and go do I have?[2:50:07] Andrew Huberman: How much pleasure do I, experience from an interaction with a puppy, an interaction with food. Is it too much? Right? Like, does it draw me off course? Are those the sorts of Very simple, but perhaps also very informative questions that we could start to use to probe our psyche.[2:50:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. I I think yes, but I would come top down. Right? So if if the goal of health is that Aggression and pleasure, those drives are subserving the generative drive, then start to look there. Right?[2:50:38] Dr. Paul Conti: If a person can take sort of an honest inventory Of self. Like, what kind of force am I being in the world around me? And and that could mean, for example, what kind of force am I being In my family, right, am I denigrating to the people around me? Are the other people in the home afraid of me? Like, what what what kind of force?[2:50:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Am I being a force for good? Am I bolstering? It people can't always see that in themselves and take stock of themselves, but what we're talking about a situation where we think a person can. Like, they can bring to bear Who am I being in the world? In other ways, if you think of the example of the person who needed to leave the job, who who could look at that and say say, no.[2:51:19] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm not, You know, I'm not being generative in the world in the way I want to. I'm not I'm certainly not doing my job as well as I would want to. I'm making my own life worse. Right? So so that person could then see that's out of balance.[2:51:31] Dr. Paul Conti: Or in another way, a person might see, you know, a lot of what I'm doing is sort of self serving or maybe Destructive, like, people can realize that. Right? So you can realize by taking an inventory of self is is the generative drive what's Deterministic in me. And, again, not always, but we're talking about a process of exploration. If the answer to that is yes, if you say, look, I'm trying to be the best person that I And and I think about the people over whom I have any authority.[2:51:58] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And and, like, I try to be reasonable, and I try to be fair, and I try to be circumspect. And, You know, I try and think in someone else's shoes. I mean, you know, sometimes I have to set boundaries or expectations or even punishment. Right?[2:52:10] Dr. Paul Conti: But But I'm, like, careful about how I'm doing that, and I'm certainly not perfect. And I get things wrong at times, but, you know, I have do think I'm contributing to the world. I'm doing whatever I take on, you know, As well as I can do it, I'm productive at work. I you know, my my kids are doing okay, or my friends are are are doing alright. Whatever it is that If we can come up with that, then then we can say, okay.[2:52:32] Dr. Paul Conti: Exhale a little bit. Like, we're in a good place. Right? It doesn't mean everything is optimal, of course. So then go look at The level of the aggressive drive, which might mean, you know, how assertive am I?[2:52:42] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? Am I the kind of person who comes up to the precipice but doesn't make the decision? Am I the kind of person who's a little too assertive? And sometimes I'm sort of walking on people a little bit. Like, a person can go look at the aggressive drive within them We're pleasure seeking.[2:52:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Am I doing things that bring me gratification? Right? Am I engaging with the people around me in a way that brings the gratification that one might One might wish for. Right? So if it's in a romantic relationship, is there romance?[2:53:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, are we being nice to one another? Right? So so you can go and look at that and say, am I getting gratification from the things I'm doing? Right? Am I in am I taking this wherever this drive is within me and trying to satisfy it in reasonable, healthy ways that are also good for others?[2:53:23] Dr. Paul Conti: And we're back to the generative drive. So that's one way of coming at it, and it's the way that we would like to because now, What what do we try to do next, and what can we make things better? Right? Can we optimize things? Okay.[2:53:35] Dr. Paul Conti: Things are okay. Right? But can we make them better? But let's say We see that the the the generative drive is not winning the day. Right?[2:53:43] Dr. Paul Conti: And people can see that. Like, look, I'm seeking Pleasure. Right? It's why I got for example, I hear over and over. That's what that's why I got addicted to this substance, and now it's not providing any pleasure to me.[2:53:53] Dr. Paul Conti: It's now making me Miserable. Right? But but the but I wanted what it was giving me. Again, this doesn't mean that the person just wants to have the world's best time. Right?[2:54:03] Dr. Paul Conti: It may mean that they're really suffering a lot. Right? And the pleasure that that drug gave them was some relief from pain. And this is how many, many people It tragically ended up becoming addicted to and dying from opiates. Right?[2:54:18] Dr. Paul Conti: Because they say the opiate after the surgery or the opiate after the injury then is soothing something. Right? And it's soothing something because the person feels less bad about something inside of them. You hear this all The time that that then fosters addiction. So so that person looking for pleasure, this isn't something where we would say in some lighthearted manner, that Person took chances with their life.[2:54:40] Dr. Paul Conti: I mean, sometimes we'll see that, but but more and more what people are looking for then is relief from suffering. Right? But we can get to that point where where we can Ascertain for whatever reason that the pleasure seeking is is too much. And if pleasure seeking and aggression are too much, We we we become aware of dissatisfaction. Right?[2:54:58] Dr. Paul Conti: If you're if you're relying too much on aggression, I always want my way. It's not always gonna happen. Right? Or I always want that pleasurable thing. I always wanna feel better.[2:55:07] Dr. Paul Conti: That also doesn't happen. Right? So so then that can guide us towards being aware of where are those drives. And if the drives are high, like, how much, dissonance is created by the the what's actually coming of the drive, Right. Versus a level the drive is at.[2:55:24] Dr. Paul Conti: So so I guess it's a long way of saying yes to your question, but I would sort of come top down because the generative drive is so important, and it does gate gate forward, like, kinda where are we at, you know, in the spectrum of, like, how healthy am I, or Are there elements of unhealth I wanna kinda go after? Or, you know, am I seeing things in myself that really say things that are unhealthy are really dominating my Life are deterministic, like addiction. You know? Just this one example, you know, addiction, things that are self destructive. Right?[2:55:56] Dr. Paul Conti: Because then, That's a place to then look at it more through the clinical lens. And maybe I won't just talk to a trusted other, you know, or and go get get a book, but maybe I should And maybe I should have a clinical care.[2:56:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The example of addiction is very potent, and it also brings to mind the, perhaps, less apparently dangerous situation, but one that I think is really common where people have a certain amount of aggressive drive. They have a certain amount of pleasure drive, but there's a kind of, passivity and draining out of the generative drive We're competing out of the generative drive because of social media. And the reason I I bring this up is, Again, not because I dislike social media. I rely on and use social media for teaching and learning extensively, really.[2:56:47] Andrew Huberman: But in going back to the pillars that underlie whether or not we Achieve and experience agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight. Within the pillar of function of self, there's this thing, salience, you know, and what we're paying attention to internal and external. And social media does seem to me A unique circumstance never before observed in human evolution where you have a near infinite number of, environments available to you. And we know that, you know, a picture is worth a 1000 words, and a movie is worth a 1000000000 pictures when it comes to drawing our attention. I mean, you just look You give a young child, even an infant, an iPad, I mean, that kid is in the tunnel.[2:57:30] Andrew Huberman: I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing and that Computers and computer screens are going to be a part of their lives now and forever presumably, but it is the case that There are a lot of people who, perhaps have the propensity for a strong generative drive, but Because they also have a propensity for a, pleasure drive, they wake up, they pick up the phone, They look at the phone, you know, something captivates their attention, then they're thinking about that. It might be, something that brings them delight. But more often than not, it's something that brings them either mild irritation or Or mild entertainment, maybe even intense entertainment for a short while, but very quickly, minutes and hours go by in which We are not engaging in the world unless we are posting valuable content. And so social media is a bit of a of a drain on these drives. I mean, it taps into these drives in very strong ways, and all one has to do is observe the behavior of people in public spaces now, in airports, on trains, even in their cars, and, I mean, people are essentially watching TV all day long.[2:58:38] Andrew Huberman: And and it does it does concern me, and I and I I raise it because, I feel like it it can distract from our generative drive in a way that Doesn't necessarily speak to any kind of, like, deep character flaw or any kind of subconscious narrative, but just that that salience, Cupboard, is is, like, clearly something within that salience cupboard is is happening that's, unprecedented, and very, very powerful and potentially quite destructive.[2:59:09] Dr. Paul Conti: Yeah. I think to to understand this, You know, I I would, cite this belief. Right? I I believe this to be true that human beings have a long history of underappreciating the power Of the discoveries that are then in their own hands. So we discover gunpowder how long until we're shooting each other.[2:59:28] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? We discovered nuclear fission. Right? Now are we gonna destroy the planet? Right?[2:59:33] Dr. Paul Conti: So social media, in a sense, it's a discovery. It's a thing that comes from What we figured out as humans that now is there in in front of us, and big powerful discoveries deserve to be treated with respect. A gunpowder is very powerful. And if people need to hunt in order to survive, a gunpowder can help them hunt without getting hurt, and we'd be more successful. Right.[2:59:55] Dr. Paul Conti: Nuclear fission can has provided some good things to humanity, but it can also destroy humanity. So I think the same is True here that what what you're talking about is something of immense power, and you can see how it if it gets out of balance. So so let's use the salient. So Let's say the social media is too salient. Right?[3:00:15] Dr. Paul Conti: That's gonna make a problem. Right? If it's too Salient in the sense that the person is always looking at things that don't make them feel good enough. Right? Well, that's not gonna go well, and that's gonna affect what's in those other Ten cupboards.[3:00:27] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And what is built on top of it? So then it gets into the unconscious mind. Like, oh, I thought I was good enough until, like, now I'm looking at all the social media, And I realize I'm not. I mean, this is people who who treat teens, you know, often talk about this that you see something that you didn't often see before where A person who might have gotten through a lot of formative years thinking like like, oh, how I look is okay, for example, then is Bombarding themselves with social media that tells them how they look is not okay, and then that changes.[3:00:56] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. Or perhaps Social media is just simply absorbing a ton of time and energy, but mostly time that could be devoted to to a generative force.[3:01:07] Dr. Paul Conti: Right. That's the that's the other side. So think about the example of the person who I know it wasn't social media, but we're saying, what if it were social media that instead of 90 minutes a day, You know, it's it's 8 hours because there's an analog there. Right? And we see a lot of this, and it's taking something that that can be good.[3:01:24] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And can in a sense in a sense, you could even should be good. Like, there's enough out there, right, in terms of learning and bolstering that, like, why should it not be good? Right? But it's not good because the defenses then shift.[3:01:36] Dr. Paul Conti: Like, if you're if you're relying on it 10 hours a day, there has to be some denial. Right? Because there are other things to do In the world, there has to be some avoidance. There has to be some rationalization. Like, something is going on there that's not healthy.[3:01:48] Dr. Paul Conti: So if you tell me this person is utilizing social media 10 hours a day, they're not looking at things that make them feel bad about themselves. They're just doing it. Then then I think, okay, something is is out of balance. Now it may be that That that person's defenses are out of balance. So think about the example of the person with the job they didn't like, then their defensive structure changes.[3:02:08] Dr. Paul Conti: Then the thing that was good for them, They rely on too much and now it becomes something that's not good for them. Right? So then you you go and look at what else is out of balance here. Right? What else is is is driving this.[3:02:21] Dr. Paul Conti: So maybe it's being driven by the change in defense mechanisms, etcetera. Maybe it's the other way around that that this person just kinda habituated to doing more and more and more and more of it, And then you would come at it in a different way of okay. Can you can you slowly but surely do less? You know, replace The the time with things that were good before, because you could then back that person out to where they were before, but you're not gonna back the person out to where they were before If it's being driven by something else, so we again come to the curiosity. You tell me that person is on social media 14 hours a day.[3:02:53] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm curious. Right. I wanna understand what what is what is the balance of those drives? Right. You you've just told me a very powerful point about salience That doesn't sound like a good one.[3:03:04] Dr. Paul Conti: So already, you're giving me clues about where the drives are, by which means where's that person at, what's going on in all those cabinets, then you give more Information. I sit and talk with the person. Now, you know, you're gonna understand, like, what is the lay of the land here, and how do we go about making it better?[3:03:21] Andrew Huberman: I love the concept of the generative drive, first of all, because it's prosocial. It brings about great things for us and for for the world. And, I mean, what is better than peace, contentment, and delight, especially when we remind ourselves that those are active Phrases or those those can be achieved and experienced inside of action. It's not just sitting, levitating, navel gazing, that sort of things. It's not Enlightenment.[3:03:46] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's peace, contentment, and delight.[3:03:50] Dr. Paul Conti: Very big difference.[3:03:51] Andrew Huberman: Very big difference. Yes. One of the other reasons I love this concept of the generative drive so much is also because it is a verb state. It has to do with creating things in us and in the world, In cultivating our experience of things and and what we do and what we say and how we respond to what others do and say. And I also like it because It's distinct from the way that we're normally taught to think about psychological well-being or being a healthy individual, which It usually centers around a discussion of goals and values and, you know, like, what am I trying to focus on?[3:04:28] Andrew Huberman: And and, you know, what sorts of people do I wanna within the world. And, certainly, all of that is really important, goals and who you engage with. But I think for many people out there, much of their time is spent thinking about Other people, like how healthy or or unhealthy are the the people they're dating or their friends or What's going on between 2 family members? You know, which, of course, is fine to think about, but a lot of emphasis is placed on, like our assessments of others and how those are impacting us. And in some cases, people default to just thinking about others and their problems And seeing their problems, and what we're really talking about here is a process of introspection and inquiry that's very structured.[3:05:10] Andrew Huberman: And as it's been laid out by you, you know, these 2 pillars, structure of self, function of self with these 10 cupboards. That might sound like a lot of cupboards, but as So we talked about in the 1st episode, all of that flows up to these Mhmm. Very simple[3:05:25] Dr. Paul Conti: Right.[3:05:26] Andrew Huberman: Ideals and concepts and action states and ways of being. And to me, there's nothing more powerful than the statement that What we are all seeking are states of agency and gratitude. Because, again, to go back to the analogy of physical fitness, there are not An infinite number of different physical states or states of fitness that one can seek, there's endurance, there's strength, there's flexibility, there's Dynamic movement, there's, you know, explosiveness. There's speed. There are bunch of, you know, subtleties to it, but here, it really seems that The psyche, ourselves, and our mental health is really tractable if we turn the lens and we look inward.[3:06:10] Dr. Paul Conti: Yes. Yes. I think that hits upon a very, very important point as we talk about understanding oneself and the process of change. Right. And I would describe that as rational aspiration.[3:06:22] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? So let's use the the physical health example. Right? If if I Think, okay, I want to be healthier. You know, I want to have more strength.[3:06:31] Dr. Paul Conti: I want to have more endurance, and I might even have ideas of what that would be. I wanna be able to run a certain distance in a certain time, lift a certain amount of weight. I have an idea of what that is. But rational aspiration is rooted in our present, Or, like, I I'm aware that there's a me now that that that, like, isn't in that state. And I'm aware that there's a there are things that I'm gonna do To get to that state right?[3:06:54] Dr. Paul Conti: And I'm not that dreading them. Like, okay. They they'll be difficult. Right? But that's okay.[3:06:58] Dr. Paul Conti: I can do difficult things. I can take pride in doing difficult things, And that's how we all achieve things. So I see myself in the present, because, of course, goals are good and that that's true. As long as we're still living our lives in the present, because otherwise, goals just become fantasies or things we wanna want to possess. So if I'm aware of the state of physical health I'm in right now, and I'm aware of the state of physical health I wanna be in, and I know there's a bunch of pathways I could take to get there, But I have to think about it, about it, figure it out, do those things, and then I'm gonna navigate myself through.[3:07:32] Dr. Paul Conti: That's how the whole process is good. Right. I don't feel bad about myself now. I recognize something I would like to change. I'm not saying, oh, you're a loser because you don't have those things.[3:07:41] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I feel I feel good about myself now. I recognize there's something I want, and there's gonna be a process, a process across time, across effort that's gonna navigate me there. Then when I get there, I feel good about being there. Right?[3:07:55] Dr. Paul Conti: It's very, very different if I think I want that. I wanna possess in a sense. Right? I wanna possess the ability to run a certain distance in a certain time. Just want the thing.[3:08:03] Dr. Paul Conti: I'm covetous of the thing. Right? That is not good. Right? Because the person then often is denigrating to the self, not always, but that's a motivation to go out and get that thing that's Better and and they're they're really, lamenting the process of getting they just want something as an endpoint, and That doesn't make for happiness.[3:08:22] Dr. Paul Conti: It doesn't make for even the the humility and humility in action, the gratitude, right, of The humility is I can't just do that overnight. I'm gonna have to work hard. People have to work hard. I'm no different than anybody else. I'm not special.[3:08:34] Dr. Paul Conti: I gotta get their end work, in use the elbow grease, and then I'll get healthier. Like, all of that is good that I just want to possess something is not good, and that's why people in in scenarios like this, they might, like, go through maybe in an unthinking way or they're gutting it out where they go and they get that thing. Right? But then nothing is not enough. Right?[3:08:53] Dr. Paul Conti: And they want more. Now there's not there's nothing wrong with wanting more if it's if it's the healthy inaction of self. Right? I'm gonna now map my way. This feels better.[3:09:01] Dr. Paul Conti: I wanna map myself from here to the next level of better physical fitness. That's different than I just want that thing, because then if I get it, It won't be good enough. Right? It doesn't make me happy. It doesn't satisfy me.[3:09:14] Dr. Paul Conti: And that's the that's the the unhealthy state of just wanting things to possess them, and then we don't feel good about them, which is, you know, the thought of if you give people if you give a person something, they'll resent you for it. Right? Again, that We're we're painting in a in a sort of certain way. The context of that statement which I used to hear, you know, a lot even when I was younger, like, people would say that. Right?[3:09:36] Dr. Paul Conti: And what were they trying to get at? Right? What they were getting at is it doesn't feel good if you didn't work for something. Right? Like, if, you know, you didn't work very hard and You got a c, but I give you an a or somebody gives me an a.[3:09:47] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? I know that that's not good. I know that I got The thing, I got the a, and I might feel happy in the moment because I wanted that thing, but there's no real pleasure in it. There's no satisfaction. There's no contentment.[3:10:01] Dr. Paul Conti: There's no sense of self. There's nothing generative. I didn't work hard enough to go from a c to an a. Right? So it's that that and and that really brings us back to to the self that we're growing on top of, you know, of the structure.[3:10:14] Dr. Paul Conti: Right? And how that how that self is functioning. Right? How it's striving. Because now we're really talking about strivings, and if I'm gonna strive for something and work hard to get it, Well, I get the good feeling on the other side of it, and now we're we're living in the generative space.[3:10:29] Andrew Huberman: Well, I love the structure of what you've laid out. Again Thank you. The pillars of structure of self and function of self with 10 cupboards between the 2 of them that when explored Can seem a little bit complex, but there are really some very straightforward types of inquiry that anyone can go about about self awareness and Address potential defense mechanisms, what we're conscious of, maybe what we're not conscious of. Look at our behaviors and our strivings and how that flows up to these Simple ideals, again, of empowerment, humility, agency, and gratitude as verbs. Mhmm.[3:11:02] Andrew Huberman: And then from that peace, contentment, and delight, And the generative drive, which gosh. If if there ever was a a more powerful concept and something to strive for, I I I don't think it exists Because, the generative drive is is extraordinary in in the number of different ways it plays out, and it seems always positively. Right? And, of course, the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive exist to varying extents in all of us, but cannot be allowed to overcome the generative drive if we're going to to really thrive. So, so thank you again so much for this framework.[3:11:40] Andrew Huberman: And, again, to Remind people listening and watching that, this framework is is mapped out in a downloadable PDF if people wanna see it visually even though we've touched on it several times before. I really appreciate how logical, clear, and actionable this framework is. And, and also that In providing a framework for us, it gives us something to hold our mind to. You know, I think I and so many people out there are familiar with, like, Being in a struggle and and not being able to orient. Like like, where am I in the struggle not knowing what to do?[3:12:12] Andrew Huberman: And you've you've provided some incredible Points of reference for us to really, like, focus on start asking questions about I and how I see myself, what am I paying attention to, and so on and so forth to really 1st, anchor and orient, and then be able to move forward in this process as many times as is required to, get where we each and all want to go. So Thank you so much for this. I know in our next discussion, we're going to touch on the relational aspects of human existence, so, you know, not just selves, but interactions between selves, including some of the, let's call it, darker and unfortunate aspects of of human existence like narcissists and, some of the challenges of different, well, you know, full blown personality disorders, but also just in terms of building Healthy relationships between friends, romantic partners, parents and children, and siblings, and and coworkers, and and all the rest. So thank you again for this incredibly rich, knowledge that you provided us and and and a map forward.[3:13:09] Dr. Paul Conti: You're very welcome, and thank you.
