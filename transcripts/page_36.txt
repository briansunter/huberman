I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing doctor Anna Lembke. Doctor Lembke is a psychiatrist and the chief of the Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. She's a psychiatrist who treats patients struggling with addiction.[0:00:30] Andrew Huberman: She has successfully treated patients dealing with drug addiction, Alcohol addiction and behavioral addictions, such as gambling and sex addiction, as well as other types of addiction. In fact, during our discussion, I learned that there are a huge range of behaviors and substances to which people can become addicted to that there is a common biological underpinning of all those addictions. I also learned that there is a common path to the treatment and recovery from essentially all addictions. Doctor Lemke explained that to me and explained how to think about and conceptualize our own addictions as well as the addictions of other people who are struggling to get treatment, move through treatment, and stay sober from their addictions. Addition to treating patients, doctor Lemke is an author and was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma.[0:01:22] Andrew Huberman: I'm excited to tell you that she has a new book coming out called Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. The book comes out August 24th and is an absolutely fascinating read into addiction and ways to treat various types of addiction. I've read the book cover to cover, and all I'll tell you is that at the very first chapter and throughout, you are going to be absolutely blown away. The stories about Her patients are extremely engaging. It brings forward the real struggle of addiction and the incredible, I think it's fair to say heroic battles that people fight in order to get through addictions of various kinds.[0:02:01] Andrew Huberman: And all of that is woven through with story, with science in ways that make it very accessible to anyone whether or not you have a science background or not. I can't recommend it highly enough. So again, the book is Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence, it comes out August 24th this year, 2021. And you can preorder that book by going to Amazon. We will provide a link to that In the show caption.[0:02:25] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I just want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolute utmost quality.[0:02:50] Andrew Huberman: Founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, everything about the sunglasses and eyeglasses that ROKA makes was designed with performance in mind. First of all, they're very lightweight. You don't even really notice that they're on your face. Second of all, Even if you get sweaty, they don't slip off. In fact, they were designed to be worn at work or around the house, but also if you're running or biking.[0:03:10] Andrew Huberman: You can move seamlessly between different activities without having to change your sunglasses or eyeglasses. In addition, the lenses are designed with The science of the visual system in mind. I've spent my career working on the science of the visual system, and I can tell you that it's not trivial to build a lens that allows you to see with perfect clarity Whether or not you're in bright sunshine and then move into shadows, but the ROKA glasses allow you to do that. You always see things with absolute clarity. Another terrific thing about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is the aesthetic.[0:03:39] Andrew Huberman: A lot of so called performance sunglasses and eyeglasses, They're not really built with the best aesthetic, and they kinda make people look like cyborgs. With Roca, they have a lot of different styles to choose from, but all those styles are of the sort that You could wear out to dinner or to work or when engaging in physical activity. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code at checkout. And if you do that, you'll get 20% off your first order. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.[0:04:09] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done, and I've been doing that for a number of years for the simple reason that most, if not all of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed in detail with a quality blood test. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can get further insight into what's going on beneath the hood, so to speak. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however, is you get numbers back. You get the levels back of various things, and you find out if certain things are too high or too low or right on target.[0:04:46] Andrew Huberman: But there are no directives about how to move those numbers in the direction that you would want them to go. With InsideTracker, they have a dashboard that makes All of that very easy, and that dashboard takes your numbers and can help direct you towards particular lifestyle factors, nutrition factors, exercise, supplementation, etcetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are right for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. If you do that, you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code Huberman at checkout.[0:05:18] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 published peer review studies and has over 600,005 star reviews. I've been meditating for a very long time. I'm 45 years old now, almost 46, and I started meditating when I was about 15 years old. The problem, however, is keeping up a meditation practice.[0:05:40] Andrew Huberman: I've experienced this myself. I've had periods of time where I'm meditating regularly and then periods of time where I just kind of Fall off the rails, and I'm just not doing it at all. There's now tons of evidence, evidence from neuroscience, Evidence from psychology, evidence from areas of biology focused on stress and the immune system that a meditation practice, When done regularly, is extremely beneficial for mental and physical health and things like focus and creativity. However, you have to do the meditation practice. And so if you're not doing it regularly, that's a serious problem.[0:06:12] Andrew Huberman: And if you are doing it regularly, great. With Headspace, I find that I can stick to a meditation practice very easily. In fact, that's why I started using it, and that's why I continue to use it. I try and get a meditation practice in every day, but sometimes that requires that it be a brief meditation practice. With Headspace, they have a huge range of different meditations of different durations.[0:06:33] Andrew Huberman: And so that's really helpful in building and maintaining these powerful meditation practices. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/ Special offer, and if you do that, you'll get a free 1 month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations. This is the best deal offer by Headspace. Basically, you get Access to everything they've got completely free for a 1 month trial. So if you'd like to try that, go to headspace.com/specialoffer.[0:06:57] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Anna Lemke. Alright. Great to have you here.[0:07:04] Dr. Anna Lembke: Thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.[0:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I have a lot of questions for you. I I and many listeners of this podcast are obsessed with dopamine. And what is dopamine? How does it work?[0:07:18] Andrew Huberman: We all hear that dopamine is this molecule associated with pleasure. I think the, the term dopamine hits, like, I'm getting a dopamine hit from this, from Instagram, or from likes, So from praise or from whatever is now, commonly heard. What is dopamine? And What are maybe some things about dopamine that most people don't know and probably that I don't know either?[0:07:44] Dr. Anna Lembke: So dopamine is a Transmitter and neurotransmitters are those molecules that bridge the gap between 2 neurons. So they essentially allow 1 neuron, the presynaptic neuron, To communicate with the postsynaptic neuron. Dopamine is intimately, associated with The experience of reward, but also with movement, which I think is really interesting because movement and reward are linked. Right? If you think about, You know, early humans, you had to move in order to go seek out the water or the the meat or whatever it was.[0:08:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: And even in the most primitive organisms, dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment. For example, c elegans, A very, primitive worm. So, dopamine is this really, powerful, important Molecule in the brain that helps us, experience pleasure. It's not the only neurotransmitter involved in pleasure, but it's a really, really important one. And if if you wanna think about something that most people don't know about dopamine, which which I think is really interesting, is that we We are always releasing dopamine at a kind of tonic baseline rate, and it's really the deviation from that base line rather than, like, hits of dopamine in a vacuum that make a difference.[0:09:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: So when we experience pleasure, our Dopamine release goes above baseline. And likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline, and then we experience a kind of pain.[0:09:19] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of dopamine? How frequently we are releasing dopamine In the absence of some, I don't know, drug or food or experience, just sitting, being, is that associated with how happy Somebody is their kinda baseline of happiness or level of depression.[0:09:41] Dr. Anna Lembke: There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed may indeed have lower tonic levels of dopamine. So that's a really reasonable thought, and there's Some evidence to suggest that that may be true. The other thing that we know, and this is, you know, really kind of what what the book is about, is that if we, expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that Repeatedly released large amounts of dopamine in our brains reward pathway that we can change our tonic baseline and actually lower it over time as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine, which More really than we were designed to to experience.[0:10:31] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. And is it would is it, the case that our baseline levels of dopamine are set By our genetics? By our heredity?[0:10:39] Dr. Anna Lembke: Well, I think, you know, if you think about sort of, you know, the early stages of development in infancy, Certainly, that is true. You're kind of, you know, born with probably whatever is your baseline level, but, obviously, your experiences can have a huge impact On where your your dopamine level ultimately settles out.[0:11:00] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. So, if somebody's disposition is one of, constant excitement and anticipation or easily excited. You these are I think about the kind of people where you say, hey. Do you wanna check out this new place for tacos? And they're like, That'd be great.[0:11:13] Andrew Huberman: And other people are, a little more cynical, harder to budge, like my bulldog, Costello. Very, very stable low levels of dopamine with big inflections in his case. Is that do you think that's, set in terms of, our parents, and obviously, nature and nurture interact. But Is that is dopamine at the core of our temperament?[0:11:40] Dr. Anna Lembke: I don't really think we know the answer to that, but I will say that People are definitely born with different temperaments, and those temperaments do affect their ability to experience Joy. And and, you know, we've known that for a long time, and we describe that in many different ways. One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era is to use psychiatric nomenclature like this person has a dysthymic temperament or, you know, this person has chronic major depressive disorder. In terms of looking specifically at who's vulnerable to addiction, that's an interesting sort of mixed bag because when you look at, the research on risk factors for addiction, so what kind of temperament, of a person makes them more vulnerable to addiction, You see, some interesting findings. First, you see that people who are more impulsive are more vulnerable to addiction.[0:12:35] Dr. Anna Lembke: So what is impulsivity? That means having difficulty, putting space between the thought or desire to do something and actually doing it. And people who have difficulty putting a space there, who are Who have a thought to do something and just do it impulsively Mhmm. Are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.[0:12:53] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Could I in terms of impulsivity, Is this something that relates literally to, the startle reflex? Like, I for instance, as a, lab director, I'm familiar with walking around my lab. And, when I decide deciding I'm gonna talk to my people of course, when they knock on my door, it's always like, wait. Why am I being bothered right now?[0:13:11] Andrew Huberman: Even though I love to talk to them. But walk around my lab from time to time, and some people I notice, I'll say, do you have a moment? And they'll slowly turn around and say yeah. Or no In[0:13:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: some cases,[0:13:23] Andrew Huberman: and other people will jump the moment I say their name. They actually have a, a kind of a heightened, Startle reflex. Right. Is that related to impulsivity, or is what you're referring to, an attempt to, withhold behavior that's very deliberate, Under very deliberate conditions.[0:13:40] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So I don't think that that startle reflex is is necessarily related to impulsivity. That that can be related to anxiety. So people who are High anxiety people will tend to have more of a startle reflex. Impulsivity is a little bit different.[0:13:54] Dr. Anna Lembke: And by the way, impulsivity is not always bad. Right? Impulsivity is is that thing where there's not a lot of self editing or worrying about future consequences. You know, you have the idea to do something, and you do it. And, of course, we can imagine many scenarios where that's absolutely wonderful.[0:14:17] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know, there can be a sort of, let's say, intimate interactions between people Where you wouldn't really wanna be super inhibited about it. Right? You would wanna be disinhibited and and impulsive. There I can also, like, imagine, like, sort of, fight or flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right, where where it would really be good to be impulsive and just go, Right. No.[0:14:41] Andrew Huberman: Just Where hesitation can cost you your life.[0:14:43] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. That's right. That's right. But, you know and I think this brings up a really Well, it's something that I've come to believe after 25 years of practicing psychiatry is that what we now conceptualize in our Current ecosystem as mental illness are actually traits that in another ecosystem might be very advantageous. They're just not advantageous right now because of the world that we live in.[0:15:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: And and I think, you know, impulsivity is potentially one of those. Right? Because we live in this world that sort of, like, you have to, constantly be thinking sort of rationally about the consequences of x, y, or z. And it's such a Sensory rich environment. Right?[0:15:32] Dr. Anna Lembke: That we're being bombarded with all these opportunities, these sensory opportunities, And we have to constantly check ourselves. And so so so impulsivity is something that right now, can be a difficult trait, but isn't In and of itself, a bad thing.[0:15:48] Andrew Huberman: I see. Yeah.[0:15:49] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[0:15:49] Andrew Huberman: And it's I I'm beginning to realize it's a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity. What is pleasure? And how does it work at the biological level? And, if if it feels right at the psychological level. I think we and, if you don't mind, painting a picture of sort of the the range of things that You have observed in your clinic or in life that people can become addicted to.[0:16:18] Andrew Huberman: But just to start off really simply, what is this thing that we call pleasure?[0:16:23] Dr. Anna Lembke: Well, I think it's it's actually really hard to define pleasure in any kind of succinct way because certainly there is the Seeking out of, a a high or a euphoria or or, I think, you know, the kind of experience that Most anybody would associate with the word pleasure, but but also, the seeking out of those same substances and behaviors is often a way to escape pain. So for example, when I when I talk to people with addiction, Sometimes, their initial foray into using a drug is to get pleasure, but Very often, it's a way to escape their suffering, whatever their suffering may be. And certainly, as people become addicted, Even those who initially were seeking out pleasure are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal or the pain of the consequences of their drug use. So I I think it's, you know, very hard To actually, you know, define it as this unitary thing, and it's certainly not just getting a high. There are so many ways in which people sort of want escape, which is not the same thing as sort of this hedonic,[0:17:41] Andrew Huberman: you[0:17:41] Dr. Anna Lembke: know, wanting to feel pleasure.[0:17:43] Andrew Huberman: So someone could decide Either they wanna go out and dance or get up and dance because of the pleasure of dancing. I can imagine that. But, and maybe it's very difficult for them to stay seated when a particular song comes on or for instance. But, Seeking what we would call pleasure in order to eliminate pain. That evokes a different picture in my mind.[0:18:07] Andrew Huberman: That evokes a picture of somebody that, feels lost, or depressed, or underwhelmed. I definitely wanna get into the precise and general description of addiction and what that is. But in a previous conversation we had, you said something that really wrong in my mind, which is that Many people who become addicted to things, let's call them addicts, have this feeling that normal life isn't interesting enough that they are seeking a super normal experience, and that the day to day routine, balance, which is actually in the title of your book, Dopamine Nation Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. That the word balance itself can sometimes be a bit of A, an aversive term for people. Mhmm.[0:18:55] Andrew Huberman: And, I I'm struck by this idea. And the reason I wanna is because so much of what I see online is about generating a lack of balance Mhmm. About being Tilted forward at all times, really leaning into life hard, experiencing life, you know, living a full life. Even the commencement Speech given by Steve Jobs on this campus was really about finding passion, digging. You know, there's so much in the narrative now.[0:19:26] Andrew Huberman: So maybe you could just tell us a little bit about your experience with this association, if it really exists between, people's sense of the normalcy or maybe even how boring life can be and their tendency to become addicts of some sort.[0:19:41] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. Well, I mean, I I think that life for humans has always been hard, But I think that now it's harder in unprecedented ways. And I think that the way that life is It's really hard now is that it actually is really boring. And the reason that it's boring is because all of our survival needs are met. Right?[0:20:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: I mean, we don't even have to leave our homes to meet every single physical need, you know, as long as you're of a certain level of financial well-being, which which frankly, you know, we we talk so much about, you know, the the income gap, and, certainly, there is this enormous gap rich and poor, but that gap is smaller than it's ever been in, like, the history of humans. Even the poorest of the poor have more, excess income to spend on leisure goods than they ever have before in human history. If you look at leisure time, for example, so People without a high school education have 42% more leisure time than people with, a college degree. So so what my my point here is that life is hard now in this really weird way In that, we don't really have anything that we have to do. So we're all forced to make stuff up, You know, whether it's being a scientist or being a doctor or being an Olympic athlete Or, you know, climbing Mount Everest.[0:21:19] Dr. Anna Lembke: And people really vary in their need for Friction, and some people need a lot more than others. And if they don't have it, they're really, really unhappy. And I do think that a lot of the People that I see with addiction and other forms of mental illness are people who need more friction. Like, they're unhappy not necessarily because there's something wrong with their brain, but because their brain is not suited to this world.[0:21:47] Andrew Huberman: And do you think they have that sense? My brain isn't suited to this world, or they simply feel, a restlessness, And they're constantly seeking stimulation.[0:21:58] Dr. Anna Lembke: I think that's right. Yeah. I think it's it's not really knowing what's wrong with me, why am I unhappy? How can I be happier? And, of course, as you talk about what what's so pervasive in our narrative now is, like, Find your passion.[0:22:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know? You know, find your you know, whatever it is to save the world. And in a way, that's good Because it has people out in the world and seeking, but but in a way, it can also be misleading in the sense that, I think people aren't entirely aware that that the world is a hard place and that and that life is hard and that, you know, Like, we're all kinda making it up. Do you know what I mean?[0:22:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, there's a a book by Cal Newport. I don't know if you know Cal Newport's work, but I you guys are, very symbiotic in your messages. He's a professor of computer science at at Georgetown. Yes.[0:22:54] Andrew Huberman: At Georgetown. And Wrote a book some years ago, really ahead of its time, called So Good They Can't Ignore You, which is about not, meditating or, doing much work to try and figure out what one's passion is by thinking, but rather go out and acquire skills[0:23:10] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:23:11] Andrew Huberman: And get develop a sense of of passion for something by your experience of hard work and and getting better and feedback. A little bit of the growth mindset thing of our colleague, Carol Dweck. But he's gone on to write books, deep work, and which is all about removing yourself from technology and doing deep work.[0:23:28] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:23:29] Andrew Huberman: And he's been a big proponent of the evils of context switching too often throughout the day Yeah.[0:23:35] Dr. Anna Lembke: For[0:23:35] Andrew Huberman: sake of productivity mostly. His new book is called, a world without email. I'm beginning to realize as I cite off these books and your book, Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance, in the Age of Indulgence that, maybe the reason why you 2 don't know about one another is because neither of you are on social media. That's it. Right.[0:23:51] Andrew Huberman: And yet you're 2 of the most productive people that I know, including productive authors. So that's a discussion into itself. But I find this fascinating. So, Let's talk about the pleasure pain balance and addiction. And I've heard you use this, seesaw or balance scale[0:24:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:24:10] Andrew Huberman: Analogy before, and I think it's a wonderful one, that really for me clarified what Addiction is at least at the mechanistic level.[0:24:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So to me, one of the most significant findings in neuroscience in the last 75 years is that pleasure and pain are collocated, which means the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain, and they work like a balance. So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way. When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction. And one of the overriding rules Governing this balance is that it wants to stay level, so it doesn't wanna remain tipped very long to pleasure or to pain.[0:24:50] Dr. Anna Lembke: And with any deviation from neutrality, the brain will work Very hard to restore a level balance or what scientists call homeostasis. And the way the brain does that is with any stimulus to one side, There will be a tip in equal and opposite amount to the other side.[0:25:07] Andrew Huberman: It's like you have principal laws of physics.[0:25:09] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Right. Right? So, like, yeah, I like to watch YouTube videos. When I watch YouTube videos of American Idol, you know, it tips to the side of pleasure, and then when I stop watching it, I have a comedown, right, which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount, on the other side, and that's that moment of wanting to watch One more YouTube video.[0:25:29] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right?[0:25:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I I just wanna, project there. So this moment of of wanting to watch another That is associated with pain, I think is are we always aware of that happening? Because you just described in a very conscious way.[0:25:45] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:25:46] Andrew Huberman: But when I, indulge in something I enjoy. I'm usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing. I don't think about the pain. I just think about more.[0:25:56] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Right. So really excellent point because we're mostly not aware of it, and it's also reflexive. So we it's not something that consciously happens Or that we're aware of unless we really begin to pay attention. And and when we begin to pay attention, we really can become very aware of it in the moment.[0:26:15] Dr. Anna Lembke: Again, it's like a falling away, like that you know, you're on social media and, you know, you get a good tweet of something, And then you can't stop yourself because there's this awareness, a latent awareness, that as soon as I disengage from this behavior, I'm going to experience a a kind of a pain, right, of falling away, missing that feeling, a wanting more of it. And, of course, one way to combat that is to do it more, right, and more and more and more. So I think I think that is really what I want people to tune into and and get awareness around. Because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot. And then when you begin to see it, you have and if you, you know, keep the model of the balance in mind, I think it It gives people kind of a way to imagine what they're experiencing on a neurobiological level and understand it, And in that understanding, get some mastery over it, which is really what this is all about.[0:27:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: Because, ultimately, we do need to disengage. Right? We can't live in that space all the time. Right? We have other things we need to do, and there are also serious consequences that come with trying to repeat and continue that experience or that feeling.[0:27:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So if I understand this correctly, when we find something or when something finds us that we enjoy, that feels pleasureful. Social media, food Right. Sex, gambling, whatever happens to be in, we will explore the full range of these. There's a some dopamine release when we engage in that behavior.[0:27:51] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[0:27:52] Andrew Huberman: And then what you're telling me is that very quickly[0:27:55] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[0:27:55] Andrew Huberman: And beneath my conscious awareness Mhmm. There's a tilting back of the scale where pleasure is reduced by way of increasing pain. Right. And I've heard you say before that the pain mechanism Has some competitive advantages over the pleasure mechanisms such that it doesn't just bring the scale back to level. It actually brings Pain higher than pleasure.[0:28:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm. Could[0:28:23] Andrew Huberman: you tell us a little bit more about that?[0:28:25] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. Yeah. So, so what happens, Again, so the the the hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior is that it releases a lot of dopamine in our brain's reward pathway. Like, Right? Like, broccoli just doesn't release a lot of dopamine.[0:28:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: Just doesn't. Right?[0:28:40] Andrew Huberman: I'm trying to imagine. I was about to say maybe and I I stopped myself because, No. Bro broccoli's good. It can be really good, but bro broccoli is never amazing.[0:28:50] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Broccoli's never amazing. Because[0:28:51] Andrew Huberman: it's mostly amazing.[0:28:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: We can find somebody on the planet for whom broccoli is amazing. And, of course, if I'm starving, broccoli broccoli is amazing.[0:28:59] Andrew Huberman: Rich Roll. Rich Roll is big on plants, And he he has a good relationship to plants. Right. Rich, tell us how to make broccoli amazing. If anyone could do it, it'd be Rich.[0:29:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. Yeah. But but what happens right after I do something that is really pleasurable and releases a lot of dopamine is, again, my brain is gonna immediately compensate by Down regulating my own dopamine receptors, my own dopamine transmission to compensate for that. Okay? And that's That comedown or the hangover, that after effect, that moment of wanting to do it more.[0:29:30] Dr. Anna Lembke: Now if I just wait for that feeling to pass, Then my dopamine will reregulate itself, and I'll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is. But if I don't wait, and here's really the key, if I keep indulging again and again and again, Ultimately, I have I have so much on the pain side, right, that I've essentially reset my brain to what we call like an anhedonic or lacking in joy type of state, which is a dopamine deficit state. So that's really the the the the way in which Pain can become the main driver is because I've indulged so much in these high reward behaviors or substances That my brain has had to compensate by way down regulating my own dopamine such that even when I'm not doing that drug, I'm in a dopamine deficit state, which is akin to a clinical depression. I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria, and a lot of mental preoccupation with using again or getting the drug. And so that that's the piece there.[0:30:28] Dr. Anna Lembke: There's the single use, which easily passes, but it's the chronic use That can then reset, really, our dopamine thresholds, and then nothing is enjoyable.[0:30:40] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:30:41] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right? Then everything sort of pales in comparison to this one drug that I wanna keep doing.[0:30:47] Andrew Huberman: And that one drug could be a person. Right? I mean, I Yes. I know people in my life that are still talking about this one relationship, this one Person that was just so great despite all the challenges of that thing that it's almost like they're addicted to the narrative.[0:31:03] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[0:31:04] Andrew Huberman: They were Maybe you're still are addicted to the person. Right. So it could be to any number of things. Video game, sex, gambling, a person, a narrative. Right.[0:31:13] Andrew Huberman: To me and because of the way you describe this mechanism, this pleasure pain balance, That all speaks to the kind of generalizability of our brain circuitry. And this is something that fascinates me, and I know it fascinates you as well, which is that, nature did not evolve 20 different mechanisms for 20 different types of addiction. Just like anxiety is a couple of core sets of hormones and neurotransmitters and pathways, and one person is triggered by social interactions, Another person is triggered by, spiders, but the underlying response is identical. It sounds like with addiction as well, there There may be some nuance, but that there there's sort of a core set of processes. So it doesn't really matter if it's gambling, or video games, or sex, or a narrative about a Previous lover or partner or whatever, it's the same addictive process underneath that.[0:32:11] Andrew Huberman: Is that correct?[0:32:11] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Exactly. And that's where this whole idea of cross addiction comes in. So once you've been addicted to a substance, severely addicted, that makes you more vulnerable to addiction To any substance.[0:32:23] Andrew Huberman: And when you say substance, does the same did it is what you just said also true for behaviors? Yes.[0:32:28] Dr. Anna Lembke: So so when I when I use the word drug, about substances and behaviors, really. And be I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex, you know Porn. Gaming, porn, absolutely. Shopping. Work.[0:32:41] Andrew Huberman: You would choose well, just for the record, Anna, doctor Lembke has accused me not accused me, has, diagnosed me, Outside the clinic, in a playful way of being work addicted. You're probably right.[0:32:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[0:32:53] Andrew Huberman: I the first thoughts I have when I wake up are typically about work. Certainly within 50 milliseconds or so of waking. And, probably the last thoughts I have, I would hope are not about work, but, yeah, I work constantly. I I don't I do other things, but I have to actively turn that off.[0:33:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Nice. That's exactly right. And you're certainly not alone In that. And, of course At Stanford?[0:33:13] Andrew Huberman: No. No. No. No.[0:33:14] Dr. Anna Lembke: I mean, here in Silicon Valley. Right? It's highly rewarded. Right? So that kind of that kind of takes place.[0:33:18] Andrew Huberman: In the culture. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And and There's this other city, I think it's called New York, where they also work a lot out here, and it's heavily rewarded.[0:33:28] Andrew Huberman: I once said, and I'm sure that I'm not the 1st person to say it, but, I was thinking about addiction, and I was thinking about the underlying circuits. And And I posted something to the, to the to social media, which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. That was the way that I kind of crystallized the literature in my mind. And then we met, and you and you, of course, came and, gave these amazing lectures in the neuroanatomy course for the medical students, and And the rest is history. But I, I tossed out a kind of, mirroring statement for that As well, which was a bit, overstepping, I admit, which I said, addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.[0:34:12] Andrew Huberman: And I said dare I say, enlightenment is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure. Not that anybody knows what enlightenment is, But it was my attempt to take a little bit of a jab at the fact that nobody knows, and so why not why wouldn't I throw in her biological explanation just to just kinda sample the waters? And people had varying levels of response. But I wouldn't the reason I bring that up is that I would imagine that being able to derive pleasure from many things would be a wonderful attribute. We know people like this that, can experience pleasure in little things and in big events.[0:34:51] Andrew Huberman: Not just, You know, the big milestones of life, but also the the subtle, you know, as that like the the yogis would say, the subtle ripples of life. If such an ability exists, what do you think that that reflects a healthily tuned dopamine system? One that Can engage and enjoy, but then disengage? Is that what we should be seeking? And and to to underscore, I know nothing about enlightenment Meditation or or any of it.[0:35:20] Andrew Huberman: I just, I use these as opportunities to explore.[0:35:24] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So it's a great question. Mean and I I understand the question as so where what should we be striving for? Right? Where where should we settle out?[0:35:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: And, you know, in my book, I really hold out people in recovery from severe addiction as sort of modern day prophets for the rest of us, because I do think that people who have been addicted and then go get into recovery Do have a hard won wisdom, that we can all benefit from. And and the wisdom, I guess, You know, to distill it down, I mean, it's it's many things. But in terms of, you know, dopamine, the the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get your dopamine, and there are less than adaptive ways. And in general, you could describe the adaptive ways as not too potent, so not tipping that balance too hard or too fast to the side of pleasure.[0:36:28] Andrew Huberman: So does that mean never allowing myself to be absolutely in complete bliss, Or does it mean not allowing myself to stay in that state too long?[0:36:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: The latter. I think the latter. So and then then that gets to temperament. So I'm gonna get that to a second. So so in general, what we want is some kind of flexibility in that balance and the ability To re easily reassert homeostasis.[0:36:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: We don't wanna break our balance, which is possible if we overindulge for enough period of time and end up with a balance Tip to the side of pain, this dopamine deficit state we've been talking about. We wanna we wanna flexible, resilient balance, right, which can be sensitive to things going on in the environment, which can experience pleasure and approach, which can experience pain and recoil. Right? This is all adaptive and healthy and active and healthy and necessary and good. We would never wanna balance that doesn't tilt.[0:37:22] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:37:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: But that would be a disaster.[0:37:23] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:37:23] Dr. Anna Lembke: We wouldn't be human. And we wouldn't want that. It'd be really, really boring. On the other hand, what people in recovery from addiction talk about is, To some extent, having to learn to live with things being a little boring a lot of the time. Right?[0:37:39] Dr. Anna Lembke: So trying to avoid some of this intensity and thrill seeking and escapism that really is at the Core of addictive tendencies.[0:37:49] Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt. But when you say boring, can we add stressful and boring?[0:37:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[0:37:54] Andrew Huberman: Because there are days where I'm not ex I have to I'm one of these I have to remind myself to have fun because I sort of forgot what the term means. Right. Because I've I like to think that I experience a lot of pleasure in little things, but I I'm pretty hard driving guy. I like goals and big milestones, all that stuff. Anyway, The point being that many days, I'm not bored thinking, there's nothing to do.[0:38:18] Andrew Huberman: But I am And I'm overwhelmed by the number of things that are really not pleasureful that I have to do. Right. I won't mention what they are because I[0:38:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: I don't want my I[0:38:27] Andrew Huberman: don't want my Colleagues will be like, so that's why you don't[0:38:30] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[0:38:31] Andrew Huberman: Respond to emails. No. Just your email. Not yours, Anna, but theirs. In any event, So anxiety and boredom can hang out together.[0:38:41] Andrew Huberman: Right? Mhmm. Am I correct in[0:38:43] Dr. Anna Lembke: Oh, for sure. I mean, actually, boredom is Highly anxiety provoking. Okay.[0:38:47] Andrew Huberman: Because what That's good to know because I think people hear boredom and they think, like, oh, there's nothing to do here.[0:38:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:38:53] Andrew Huberman: There's not it's I feel like we have ton to do. We just don't really wanna do it. Right. As opposed to something that we're excited to do.[0:39:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Okay. So so that this gets to sort of some of the core things also we were talking about earlier About finding your passion. So I'm gonna try to link it all together. But but, basically, is a boredom first of all, boredom is a rare experience for modern humans Because we're constantly distracting ourselves from the present moment, and we have an infinite number of ways to do that.[0:39:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right? But boredom is really, I think, an important and necessary experience, but it is scary because when you allow yourself to be bored, Let's say you were had that list of all the things you hate to do, but you actually got them all done. Imagine that. And you got your forthcoming book done, And you did all your interviews.[0:39:42] Andrew Huberman: It could happen. Lightning could start.[0:39:45] Dr. Anna Lembke: And you watched your dog, and you cleaned your house, and you went shopping. Imagine that for a moment. You would be sitting in your house, and my guess is you would be terrified because, Wow. What am I supposed to do now? Right?[0:40:01] Dr. Anna Lembke: There's nothing I really have to do, and that is really, really scary. That can feel like free fall. And yet that's really an important and good experience to have, and I think that is an experience out of which we can have a lot of creative, initiative, but also really consider our priorities and values. Okay. Here I am on planet Earth.[0:40:23] Dr. Anna Lembke: What the hee haw am I gonna do with my life? What do I really care about? How do I really wanna spend my time when I'm not distracting myself, you know, in order to to spend it? And the you know, then this gets back to our conversation a little bit earlier about finding your passion. So I think that, One of the big problems now that's very misguided about this idea of finding your passion, it's almost as if people are looking to fit the Key into the lock of the thing that was meant for them to do.[0:40:51] Andrew Huberman: Right. And then everything will feel like a natural progression.[0:40:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: And then everything will be wonderful. Fall I[0:40:55] Andrew Huberman: can attest to the fact that is not how it works in any endeavor. Right.[0:40:58] Dr. Anna Lembke: And that you'll have all this great success or you know? But and here here's where I really think the answer lies, and I really, really believe this. Stop looking for your passion, and instead, look around Right where you are, stop distracting yourself. Look around right where you are and see what needs to be done. So not what do I want to do, but what is the work that needs to be done?[0:41:28] Dr. Anna Lembke: And more importantly, it doesn't have to be some grandiose work. Like, does the garbage need to be taken out? Right? Is there some garbage on your neighbor's lawn that someone threw there that you could actually bend over and pick up and put into the garbage can. Look around you.[0:41:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: There is so much work that needs to be done that nobody wants to do That is really, really important. And if we all did that, I really think the world would be a much better place. And this is what people who have severe addiction, who get into recovery realize. They're like, it's not about me and my will and what I'm going to will in my life or in the world. It's about looking around what needs to be done.[0:42:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: What is the work that I am called to do in this moment? Which also is incredibly freeing because I don't have to search for the perfect thing. There's a lot of burden now on young people that they have to find that perfect thing. And until they found that perfect thing, they're gonna be miserable. You don't have to do that.[0:42:31] Dr. Anna Lembke: Look at the life you were given. Look at The people around you look at the jobs that present themselves to you and do that job simply and honorably One day at a time in a with a kind of humility. I think this is really what what's so striking to me about the wisdom of people in recovery. There's this incredible humility that comes out of that experience. You feel so broken, so ashamed, but you pick yourself up One day at a time, and you build a life that's around what can I do right in this moment that might Benefit another person and thereby benefit me?[0:43:09] Andrew Huberman: That's, a really important point. And, and if You're willing. I'd like to actually stay on this issue of of passion, because, I think The dopamine systems, if I understand them correctly, the dopamine systems merge with this work that you're referring to this immediacy of things calling to us, like taking out the trash, which sounds frankly really boring, to be honest. I I hate taking out the trash, but I do it because I like a clean home, and I like a home that Right.[0:43:42] Dr. Anna Lembke: A home[0:43:42] Andrew Huberman: that smells good Yeah. Or at least doesn't smell bad. So we do these things and, not that we wanna offer some larger carrot as a consequence of doing those things. But if I understand correctly, what you're saying is In the act of looking at one's immediate environment, acting on that immediate environment, We cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain about action and reward That, at least, to my mind, span the range of small things being rewarding and then lead us to bigger things being rewarding. It's not like all we're gonna do is take out Trash and and tend to house.[0:44:22] Andrew Huberman: We eventually will venture out and we eventually will find careers and and work on those. But if I understand correctly, you're talking about getting into a sort of Functional or adaptive action step. And it's the action step that these days we tend to overlook because most of our Mindset is in things that are truly outside of the our immediate reality. Do I have that correct?[0:44:44] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. That was beautifully said. And I would just add to that. I see a lot of young people who, for example, spend most of their waking hours playing video games. And they come to me and they say, I'm anxious and depressed.[0:44:56] Dr. Anna Lembke: I'm majoring in computer science. I hate it. I thought I would like it. You know, if I could only find that thing that I was really meant to do, my life would be better. And my 1st intervention for the many, many people like that that I see in clinical care is you have it backwards.[0:45:14] Dr. Anna Lembke: I don't say it quite like that. You were waiting for that thing to pull you out of the video game world, and you're never gonna find it as long as you're playing video games. You will not be able to find that thing that you enjoy. And so, of course, the intervention is abstain from video games, reset your reward pathways, Start with a level balance, and what invariably happens and I've just seen it over 20 years so many times. I've become really a you know, a believer in this.[0:45:50] Dr. Anna Lembke: All of a sudden, it's like, oh, wow. My computer science class is interesting this quarter. It's like, okay. You know, you you have a receptivity then to experiencing pleasure and reward in a way you just don't have when you're bombarding your reward pathways with these high dopamine drugs.[0:46:08] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. And just to underscore this notion that Tending to the immediate things can lead to super performance. I may have mentioned it earlier this episode, but If I didn't, I'll mention now, which is I have the the great privilege of having some close friends that were in the SEAL teams and doing some work with those communities. And It's a remarkable community for reasons that I think most people don't understand. We people think they see the images carrying logs down the beach and all the blowing stuff out, all the all the stuff that's That's fun for guys like that.[0:46:38] Andrew Huberman: But, all of the guys I know who are in the SEAL teams have this sense of duty about immediate Things. Mhmm. And not just holding the door and doing the helping with the dishes and moving things around. They are constantly scanning their environment for what can be done. They essentially conquer every environment they're in.[0:46:57] Andrew Huberman: They are also some of the the most competitive human beings In the world and they do it unless they're they're in the act of war fighting, which is their their real job. They do it in every environment in a very benevolent way. And it's a remarkable thing because it I think it's what is part of what they're selected for.[0:47:15] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[0:47:16] Andrew Huberman: And, any other there's a range there. But I think when we hear about tending to the immediate things Right. Or this phrase, you know, how you do one thing is how you do anything, that's a tricky one for me because there's certain things I just Do well. But but should we always be trying? I I think that the tending to setting the horizon in closely, And tending to things in one's immediate environment, I think it is very powerful and translates.[0:47:42] Andrew Huberman: Because, again, I think the nervous system, it performs algorithms. It has action Steps. The brain doesn't evolve to do one thing. It evolves to be able to use the same approach to doing lots of different things. Yes.[0:47:54] Andrew Huberman: I[0:47:55] Dr. Anna Lembke: want just wanna add to even beyond that, because that that totally resonates for me and is very consistent with people in recovery from addiction who learned to take it one day at a time, which is one of the, you know, standard lingo from Alcoholics Anonymous, another 12 step groups. But but I think, also, as you say, you know, our brain is really wired for the 24 hour period. We're not very good at Sort of the, you know, 10 year, 20 I mean, we're we have this huge frontal lobes, and, yes, we're great planners and we can but if we live too much in that space, We can really get very anxious and depressed and lost and either catastrophize or get grandiose. But if you can chunk it down to a day, What what people in recovery talk about is how if I can just do today right, then I will get a chain of days That seem insignificant in their individual units, but after 6 months or a year or 2 years of those good days, I've got 2 very good years. Right?[0:48:55] Dr. Anna Lembke: And I look back, it's like, oh, wow. Well, I I guess I I did all that. But I think that's really, you know, one of the keys is is really taking it one day at a time, which which you're sealed, and also this connecting with the environment. Right? So being awake and alert to your environment and connecting with your environment, not trying to escape it.[0:49:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: And, of course, escapism is what we all want and desire, that experience of nonbeing, And we get it from the Internet or from drugs or whatever it is, but it is it's the booby prize. We because, ultimately, it takes you further and further Away from your immediate environment, which is where we really have to connect to get that sense of groundedness and authenticity and, Like, of being in our own lives. Well, I[0:49:36] Andrew Huberman: think the unit of the day is something that comes up again and again of in my discussions with colleagues Who are extremely, successful and who also have balanced lives.[0:49:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:49:47] Andrew Huberman: This actually came up in the discussion with Karl Teisseroff, who is also a Successful scientists and clinician and, and, you know, manages a family, etcetera. So the unit of the day, I think, is fundamental, and those stack up as you mentioned. So along those lines, I've heard you say that in order to reset the dopamine system, essentially, in order to break an addictive pattern, To become unaddicted. 30 days of 0 interaction with that Substance that person, etcetera. Right.[0:50:21] Andrew Huberman: Is that correct?[0:50:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. And and 30 days is in my clinical experience, the average amount of time it takes for the brain to reset reward pathways for dopamine transmission to regenerate itself. There's also a little bit of science that suggests that that's true. Some imaging studies showing that, our brains are still in a dopamine deficit state 2 weeks, after we've been using our drug. And then a a study by Shuckett and Brown, which took a group of, depressed men who also were addicted to alcohol, put them In a hospital where the they have received no treatment for depression, but they had no no access to alcohol in that time.[0:51:01] Dr. Anna Lembke: And after 4 weeks, 80% of them no longer for major depression. So, again, this idea that by depriving ourselves of this high dopamine, high reward Substance or behavior, we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine to for the balance to really correlate, and then we're in a a place where we can of enjoy other things.[0:51:22] Andrew Huberman: So that progressive narrowing of what gives one pleasure eventually expands. So I'd like to, Dissect out that 30 days a little[0:51:30] Dr. Anna Lembke: more Mhmm.[0:51:30] Andrew Huberman: Finally. And I also want to address, How does one stop doing something for 30 days if the thing is a thought? Mhmm. So we'll kinda put that on the shelf for a moment. So days 1 through 10, I would imagine will be very uncomfortable.[0:51:49] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[0:51:50] Andrew Huberman: They're gonna suck, Right. To be quite honest, because what if the way you describe this pleasure pain balance, to my mind says that If you remove what little pleasure one is getting or a lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior, that's gone. The pain system is really ramped up, And nothing is making me feel good. I'll just use myself as an example. I'm not in recovery, but You know, that 10 days is gonna be miserable.[0:52:18] Andrew Huberman: Right. Anxiety, trouble sleeping, physical agitation Yes.[0:52:23] Dr. Anna Lembke: Into the[0:52:23] Andrew Huberman: point where, You know, maybe impulsive, angry. Should should one expect all of that? Should the family members of people expect all of that?[0:52:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So what I say to patients, and it's a really important piece of this intervention, is that you will feel worse before you feel better. For how long?[0:52:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This is probably the first question they ask. Right?[0:52:45] Dr. Anna Lembke: And and I say, usually, in my clinical experience, You'll feel worse for 2 weeks. But if you can make it through those 1st 2 weeks, the sun will start to come out in week 3. And by week 4, most people are feeling a whole lot better than they were before they stopped using their stub substance. So, Yeah. You have to it's it's a hard thing.[0:53:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: Like, you have to sign up for it. And I will say, obviously, there are people with addictions that are so severe that As long as they have access to their drug or behavior, they're not able to stop themselves. And that's why we have, you know, higher levels of care Sure. Residential treatment. So this is not going to be for everybody, this intervention, but it's amazing how many people with really severe addictions to things like Heroin, cocaine, you know, very severe pornography addictions.[0:53:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: I posit this, and I do it as an experiment. I said, you know what? Let's Try this experiment. I'm always amazed, number 1, how many of them are willing, and number 2, how many of them are actually able to do it. They are able to do it.[0:53:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: And and so that little nudge is sort of just what they need, and the carrot is, you know, there's a better life out there for you. And you'll be able to taste it in a month. You really will be able to begin to see that you can feel better and that there's another way.[0:54:04] Andrew Huberman: So the way you describe it, seems like it's hard. Mhmm. But it's doable for most people, not everybody.[0:54:12] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:54:12] Andrew Huberman: And we'll return to the that category of people who can't do that on their own. Well, Then days 21 through 30, people are feeling better. The sun is starting to come out as you mentioned. They It which translates in the narrative we've created here, and support by biology that dopamine is starting to be released in response to The taste of a really good cup of coffee[0:54:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Exactly.[0:54:39] Andrew Huberman: Whereas before it was only to insert, You know, addictive behavior.[0:54:44] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. That's[0:54:44] Andrew Huberman: right. Whichever it is.[0:54:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: Coffee can be addictive too, but but we'll leave that aside. Yeah. I[0:54:49] Andrew Huberman: feel like coffee has a kind of, consumption limiting Mechanism built in where at some point, you just can't ingest anymore. Yeah. But maybe that's wrong. Sorry to Give lift to the caffeine addicts out there as I as I clutch my my mug. So days 21 through 30.[0:55:10] Andrew Huberman: I've seen a lot of people go through addiction and addiction treatment. I've spent a lot of time in those places, This actually, looking at it researching. I've got friends in that community. I I'm close with that community. One thing I've seen over and over again, sadly Often in the same individuals is they get sober from whatever, they're doing great.[0:55:34] Andrew Huberman: These are people with families. These are people that you discard your normal image of an addict and insert the Most normal typical whatever healthy person you can imagine, because a lot of these people you wouldn't know were addicts. And then all of a sudden, you get this call. So and so's back in jail. So and so's wife is gonna leave him because he Drank 2 bottles of of wine and took a Xanax at 7 AM, crashed his truck into a pole.[0:56:05] Andrew Huberman: It's got 2 beautiful kids. Like, how Did this happen again? To the point where by the 4th 5th time, people are just done. I mean, maybe people you might be able to detect the frustration in my voice. I'm dealing with this with somebody that's like, I I don't even know that I wanna help this time.[0:56:22] Andrew Huberman: It's been so many times to the point where I'm starting to wonder, is this person just an addict? This is just kinda what they do and who they are. And I and you never wanna give up on people, but, and I'm hanging in there for them. But I will say that, many people have given up on them. And so what I'd like to talk about in this context is, what sorts of things help other people that we know that are addicted?[0:56:49] Andrew Huberman: What really helps? Mike, not, not what could help, but what really helps. And are there certain people for whom It's hopeless. I mean, I don't like to hold the conversation that way, but I wouldn't be close to the real life data if if I didn't ask. Is it Is it hopeless?[0:57:08] Andrew Huberman: Are there people who just will not be able to quit their substance use or their addictive behavior? Despite, I have to assume, really wanting to. Yeah.[0:57:20] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So there there are people who will die of their disease of addiction. You know? And I think conceptualizing it as a disease is a helpful frame. There are other frames that we could use, but I do think Given the brain physiologic changes that occur with sustained heavy drug use And what we know happens to the brain, it it is really reasonable to think of it as a brain disease.[0:57:47] Dr. Anna Lembke: And and for me, the real window of, let's say, being able to access my compassion around people who are repeat relapsers even when their life is so much better, when they're in the yeah. It's like it's like a no brainer, right, is is to conceptualize this balance and the dopamine deficit state and a balance tilt tilted to the side of pain. And to imagine that For some people, after a month or 6 months or maybe even 6 years, their balance is still tipped to the side of pain. That on some level, That balance has lost its resilience and its ability to restore homeostasis.[0:58:26] Andrew Huberman: It's almost like the hinge on that balance is messed up.[0:58:29] Dr. Anna Lembke: Exactly. And so, I mean, for for someone who's never experienced addiction like yourself, maybe one one way to conceptualize it is[0:58:37] Andrew Huberman: Well, I didn't say that. Oh, okay. I was not I to be clear, I I was not referring to myself, but I I I in this example I was given, I I were, I I would I would, come clean. I I would reveal that. But I I think that, especially after hearing some of Your lectures and descriptions of the range of things that are addictive, I think, I I've been fortunate I don't have a propensity for drugs or alcohol.[0:59:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[0:59:00] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I'm lucky in that way Correct. That, frankly, if they remove all the alcohol from the planet, I'll just be relieved because no one will offer it to me anymore.[0:59:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Right.[0:59:08] Andrew Huberman: So don't send me any alcohol. It won't go to me. Right. But, but I don't have that I like to think I have the compassion, but I don't have that empathy for, you know, taking a really good situation and What from the outside looks[0:59:32] Dr. Anna Lembke: to be[0:59:32] Andrew Huberman: throwing it[0:59:33] Dr. Anna Lembke: in the trash? Yeah. So okay. So so is that let let me and this is really, I think, important because I I also had to come to an understanding of this, and I feel that I have in my 20 years of seeing these patients. And, of course, addiction is the joints.[0:59:47] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right? And so you've got the severe end of things. Imagine that you had an itch somewhere on your body. Okay? It was in I mean, we've all had that, like, you know, whatever the source.[0:59:58] Dr. Anna Lembke: It was super, super itchy. You can go for, you know, if you really focus, you could go for a pretty good amount of time not scratching it. But the moment you stopped focusing on not Scratching it, you would scratch it. And maybe you do it while you were asleep. Right?[1:00:15] Dr. Anna Lembke: That is and that is what happens to people with severe Addiction. That balance is essentially broken. Homeostasis does not get restored despite sustained abstinence. They're living with that constant specter of that pull. It never goes away.[1:00:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: So let me say there are lots of people with addiction for whom that does go away, it goes away at 4 weeks for many of them. But in severe cases, that's always there, and it's lingering. And it's the moment when they're not focusing on not using. It's like a reflex. They fall back into it.[1:00:51] Dr. Anna Lembke: It's not purposeful. It's not because they wanna get high. It's not because they value using drugs more than they do their family. None of that. It's that, really, they they They cannot not do it when given the opportunity and that moment when they're not thinking about it.[1:01:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: Does that make sense?[1:01:09] Andrew Huberman: That's a great description. And, Actually, in that description, I can feel a bit of empathy because the way you describe scratching an itch in your sleep[1:01:18] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:01:18] Andrew Huberman: You know, I've I've done that with mosquito bites and screaming scratching. You know? Like, oh, you wake up scratching that that mosquito bite. And I also Have to admit that I've experienced not feeling like I wanna pick up my phone because it's so rewarding, but just Finding myself doing it.[1:01:36] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Of course.[1:01:37] Andrew Huberman: Like, I'm not gonna use this thing. I'm not gonna use this thing. And then and then just finding myself. Yes. Like, what am I doing here?[1:01:42] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:01:43] Andrew Huberman: Sort of that how did I get back here again?[1:01:45] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:01:45] Andrew Huberman: And I I know enough about brain function to understand that we have circuits that Generate deliberate behavior, and we have circuits that generate reflexive behavior. And one of the goals of the nervous system is to make the deliberate stuff reflexive so you don't have to make the decision, because decision making is a very costly thing to do. Exactly. Decision making of any kind. Right.[1:02:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:02:08] Andrew Huberman: So that does really help. The, I I wanna just try and weave together this, this dopamine puzzle. However, because if by week or so 1st phase of this, 30 or 40 day, detox, it's like a dopamine Fast.[1:02:27] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:02:27] Andrew Huberman: Right? Okay. 1st 10 days are miserable. Middle 10 days, the clouds are out. There may be some shards of sunlight coming through, and then All of a sudden, sun starts to come out.[1:02:38] Andrew Huberman: It gets brighter and brighter. Why is it then that people will relapse not just After getting fired from a job or their spouse leaving the but when things are going really well. Is it this unconscious mechanism? Because I've seen this before. Is, they have a great win.[1:02:53] Andrew Huberman: I have a friend who's a really impressive creative. I don't wanna reel any more than that. But, and relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity to create for the entire world. And I was, like, how can that happen? But now I'm beginning to wonder, was it the dopamine associated with that wind Mhmm.[1:03:13] Andrew Huberman: That Mhmm. Opened the spigot on this dopamine system? Because, it happened in a phase of of a really great stretch of life.[1:03:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. Right. Yeah. So you you raise that great point about triggers. Right?[1:03:27] Dr. Anna Lembke: And triggers are things that make us want To go back to using our drug. And the key thing about triggers, whatever they are, is they also release a little bit of dopamine. Right? So just thinking about, Whatever the trigger is that we associate with drug use or just thinking about drug use can already release the tory dopamine, this little mini spike. But here's the part that I think is really fascinating.[1:03:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: That mini spike is followed by a mini deficit state. So it goes up, then it doesn't go back down the baseline. It goes below baseline tonic levels, and that's craving. Right? So that anticipation is immediately followed by wanting the drug, and it's that dopamine deficit state that drives the motivation to go and get the drugs.[1:04:16] Dr. Anna Lembke: Many people talk about dopamine is not really about pleasure, but about wanting and about motivation. And so it is that deficit State that then drives the locomotion to get it.[1:04:27] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And earlier, your description of dopamine being involved in the desire for more, Giving the sense of reward, but also movement.[1:04:33] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:04:33] Andrew Huberman: I have to assume that those things are braided together in our nervous system Yes. For the specific intention of when you feel something[1:04:39] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:04:40] Andrew Huberman: Good, then you feel the pain. Yes. Maybe you don't notice it. And then the next thing you know, you're pursuing more of the one thing that[1:04:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: you're doing. The word braided together. That's beautiful. Bad life experiences, loss, you know, in any form, stress in many different forms, that's a trigger. But there are absolutely people for whom The trigger is things going well, and the things going well can be like the reward of the things going well.[1:05:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: But very often, What it is is the removal of the hypervigilant state that's required to keep their use in check. So it's the sense of I wanna celebrate, you know, or I wanna this reward happened. I wanna put more reward on there. And it's really, really fascinating because When people come to that realization about themselves that they're most vulnerable when things are going well, that's really a valuable insight because then they can put some, you know, things in place or barriers in place or go to more meetings or whatever it is that they do, you You know, to protect themselves.[1:05:50] Andrew Huberman: Along those lines, I have a friend, 40 years sober, was a severe Drug and alcohol addict from a very young age. Really impressive person. There's a lot of important work in the, kind of at risk youth community out in Hawaii. And he said something to me. He said, As former addicts often do, they got these great sayings, but I think it fits very well with what you're describing.[1:06:11] Andrew Huberman: He said, You know, no matter how far you drive, you're always the same distance from the ditch. And I and and I said, well, that's kind of depressing. And he said, no. That's actually what gives me peace. Yeah.[1:06:23] Andrew Huberman: Because what would happen is for so many years of relapsing and relapsing, getting recovering and relapsing, he felt like It was hopeless. And then somehow conceptualizing that the vigilance can never go away. Mhmm. Mhmm. Instead of making him feel burdened[1:06:40] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:06:41] Andrew Huberman: It made him feel relieved. So I often think about that that statement, you know, no matter how far you drive, you're always the same distance from the ditch. Because in my mind, I conceptualize that as, gosh, that's That's a tough way to drive down the road. But, actually, on a road where you know where the ditches and where you know where the lane lines are, it's actually a pretty nice drive. It's when you don't know where the shoulder is that you constantly have to be looking around.[1:07:04] Andrew Huberman: So there's this we're we're speaking now in in analogies and and imagery, and science. But I one of the things I find so incredible about this community of 12 step, and there are A variety of them are the, the communities that they create for themselves. And some of these things which I do believe link back to really core biological mechanisms.[1:07:29] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Yes.[1:07:30] Andrew Huberman: I do wanna ask about those communities. I have a question which might be a little bit, Controversial, from which is, is it possible that people who were Addicted to drugs or alcohol or some gambling or some other behavior, get addicted to the addiction community. Because one thing that I think I observe over and over is that there's some circuit in the brain of human beings that has to tell you about the dream they had the night before whatever reason. There's another circuit that leads people to, wake you up if they themselves can't sleep. I don't know what circuit it is.[1:08:08] Andrew Huberman: I'm being facetious here. But there does seem to also be a circuit in the brain of addicts to discuss and want to You kinda talk about their recovery a lot. And I mentioned this not to poke at them, but rather the opposite because I think that one thing that is challenging at least for me and having friends that that have a propensity for drug or alcohol addiction, not all of them, but certainly some of them, is when they're talking about the recovery, I feel like it's all they talk about. Mhmm. This meeting, that meeting, that way.[1:08:44] Andrew Huberman: How are we so what I'm really asking here is, is that some can we become addicted to sobriety?[1:08:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. So this is a great question, and it links into some of the other things we've been talking about having to do with Where do we settle settle out? You know, what is the way to live between pleasure and pain? And I implied earlier that, Ultimately, we want a resilient balance that's sensitive to pleasure and pain, but that can easily restore homeostasis after we indulge even when we indulge greatly. But the truth of the matter is that people with severe addiction, I believe temperamentally, want Those extremes, and they're wired for that kind of intensity that is more than just these slight adjustments around the fulcrum.[1:09:32] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right? It's like they want the big highs and the big lows.[1:09:35] Andrew Huberman: They'll say great meeting. Yeah. Real estate. Amazing meeting, or they find[1:09:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: a group. Yeah.[1:09:39] Andrew Huberman: They find a group in a location. Yeah. Like, we see I This is almost an inside joke in those communities. Again, I'm not reporting. I'm not talking about a friend in quotes.[1:09:47] Andrew Huberman: This isn't me reporting. Well, they'll, They'll talk about how attractive people are at a given meeting, or how how bonded they feel to people at a given meeting. That the meetings at Themselves Right. Become their own form of dopamine hit.[1:10:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Yes.[1:10:01] Andrew Huberman: And and, again, I'm not being disparaging. I just I I wanna understand this. Right.[1:10:05] Dr. Anna Lembke: So yes. So, so a lot of times, patients will say to me, oh, you know, I don't wanna go to AA. It's a cult. And my response to that is Because it's a cult is exactly why it works. Okay?[1:10:18] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Because, yes, it is much better for you to be addicted to AA and to recovery than almost any other addiction I could think of. And we know from Rob Belenka's work, who's here at Stanford, that oxytocin, you know, is the hormone that's involved in human pair bonding and Relationships and love, and it directly links to dopamine neurons and causes the release of dopamine. So, yes, when we connect with other humans, Especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way, that's a huge dopamine hit, and it does replace dopamine that people get from drugs. And for people who have this, addiction temperament, they need it on a more intense level.[1:11:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: They're not gonna be generally satisfied with kind of, you know, an, sort of acquaintanceship. Right? They they they want that intensity of the intimacy that you get with people when you're cathartically exposing, you know, warts and all. So, yes, people can get addicted to recovery, and good for them. Go for it.[1:11:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know? And, of course, this can be disruptive for friendships and and relationships where the 1 person is not in recovery. Like, going to so many meetings. You're always talking about recovery. But you know what?[1:11:32] Dr. Anna Lembke: Much better than them being intoxicated. Right? I mean so although you may tire of your friends Talking about their their, you know, meeting all the time. I'm sure you would rather have them do that than than, you know, be in their addiction.[1:11:43] Andrew Huberman: So Absolutely. And, this is now the 2nd time you've done this during this discussion, but now I have empathy because the way you describe their enthusiasm about meetings[1:11:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:11:52] Andrew Huberman: Is probably the way that people feel about me and[1:11:55] Dr. Anna Lembke: your work Right.[1:11:56] Andrew Huberman: And my in neuroscience. I mean, I've been getting up in front of the class since I was 8 years old and talking about things I read over the weekend. Now I just happen to have this thing called the podcast.[1:12:06] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:12:07] Andrew Huberman: I've been I've been doing it since I was little, and it annoys a lot of people. Right? I've learned to suppress it a little bit. Some people like it, but I I'm poking fun at myself just to say that I now can understand that the way I feel about their reports about yet another amazing meeting, or and Or for there's a different form of this, but there are some people for which they just love intense experiences.[1:12:31] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:12:32] Andrew Huberman: They're always, like, Trying to pull me off to Bali because they're talking about how sensual it is. Although I'm sure Bali is wonderful, but there's this kind of ratcheting up. It's like Seeking Burning Man all year long. I've never been to Burning Man. No desire to go to Burning Man.[1:12:49] Andrew Huberman: But inside of academia, I mean, if I were to just turn the mirror at myself, inside of academia or here in Silicon Valley, work And the pursuit of more success even if money is kind of divorced from that. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. Academic work is, you know, for sake of Pursuit of knowledge. It sounds to me like the same mechanism. In fact, it feels to me very much like the the the same mechanism.[1:13:16] Dr. Anna Lembke: So, Andrew, here's what I love about you. 1st of all, you're willing to bring your own flaws and foibles to this conversation. Everywhere. Well, you know what? It's wonderful.[1:13:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: And then you're really open and curious and wanting to understand, because I can't tell you how many people I have met Who really see addiction as some kind of otherness. But the truth is we're all wired for addiction. And if you're not addicted yet, it's it's just it's right around the corner.[1:13:43] Andrew Huberman: Do you[1:13:43] Dr. Anna Lembke: know what I mean? Especially with the incredible panoply of new drugs and behaviors that are out there. So I love that you're willing to take a moment and really try to understand this because it is it is we can all relate, And you're relating it to your essentially, your work addiction is right and and apt. You just happen to be addicted to something that is really socially rewarded. You know, you figured that out in an early age.[1:14:10] Dr. Anna Lembke: Oh, when I do x, y, and z, all these people go, look at that smart kid or whatever it is. You know?[1:14:15] Andrew Huberman: You For me, it made me feel safe.[1:14:17] Dr. Anna Lembke: Okay.[1:14:17] Andrew Huberman: I felt like, yeah. I just felt like this and and I paused there because it's like it's like peace. I'm like, I can relax for a moment.[1:14:27] Dr. Anna Lembke: When you're talking about neuroscience.[1:14:29] Andrew Huberman: No. Or just when I'm when I've when I feel like I'm on the right path. Yeah. And I'm Okay. Onto something.[1:14:34] Andrew Huberman: Or if I see something that I'm excited about, I'm like, I feel, filled with it must be dopamine. I feel Flooded with pleasure, literally, from head to toe. Yeah. And then my next thought is more.[1:14:47] Dr. Anna Lembke: So true.[1:14:48] Andrew Huberman: You're a you're you're[1:14:49] Dr. Anna Lembke: really you're a true addict.[1:14:50] Andrew Huberman: Okay. You are. Thank you.[1:14:51] Dr. Anna Lembke: You are. But you just got really[1:14:52] Andrew Huberman: I think thank you.[1:14:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: You really got lucky with the fact that that what, you know, what you're drawn to Is is adaptive, essentially. You know? And and then your challenge is going to be that your life doesn't get too out of balance in the sense that you're 247 work, and you don't stop and do some other things or think about it. And my[1:15:12] Andrew Huberman: life and my life, admittedly, is somewhat asymmetric. I mean, it has other components of physical health, etcetera, but it is, somewhat asymmetric, which is why I got a dog. Although I talk about him an awful lot. So,[1:15:24] Dr. Anna Lembke: but the dog is good because that draws you out of yourself and a little bit away from the work. But, again, you know, I think the key here is for people who feel like they don't they've never addiction or they don't know anybody with addiction or if they do, they don't get it. Just think of that one thing that is the most important thing in your life that you do that gives you pleasure and meaning and purpose, and then imagine if you couldn't do it.[1:15:46] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. Let's not talk about that. Right. Well, I appreciate the the feedback, and, you can send me a bill at the end at the end. What is the most ridiculous sounding addiction that you've ever witnessed?[1:16:04] Andrew Huberman: That was actually A real addiction along these lines, because I I think we all know the standard heroin pill. You've been very I should mention, Because it's important in your previous book, and we will provide a link to that as well, focused on the opioid crisis and, What we thought was medication turned out to be just as bad, if not worse than a lot of so called street drugs. So we understand those those, you know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction. Now video games, we'll talk about social media a little bit more in-depth. But What's the most, like, wow.[1:16:40] Andrew Huberman: I didn't realize people could get addicted to that. Water. Really?[1:16:47] Dr. Anna Lembke: Really. So I had a very lovely patient who was, had a severe alcohol addiction, and she got into recovery from her alcohol addiction, for many years, but she kind of had a sort of a polydipsia or an urge to be drinking something a lot, And so she drank a lot of water. And slowly over time, she realized that if she drank enough water, she could become hyponatremic and delirious And be out of herself[1:17:14] Andrew Huberman: with die from it. Right?[1:17:16] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Which is she just wanted to be out of her own head. And so she would periodically intentionally overdose on water in order, you know, to to I know it was so sad, so sad.[1:17:29] Andrew Huberman: What happened to her?[1:17:31] Dr. Anna Lembke: She eventually took took her own life. Wow. Yeah. It was really That's[1:17:34] Andrew Huberman: rough.[1:17:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: She was a lovely woman. She was so bright. She had so many interests and passions, and And, of course, it was very sad when, you know, when she died. But but I that was a wow to me. It was like, Wow.[1:17:48] Dr. Anna Lembke: If you have this disease of addiction, you can even get addicted to water.[1:17:53] Andrew Huberman: Wow. And I think it just underscores the The generalizability of these circuits.[1:17:58] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:17:58] Andrew Huberman: There isn't a brain circuit for addiction to water that she happened to have. There's a brain Circuit for pleasure and pain and addiction and water plugged into that circuit.[1:18:08] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Right.[1:18:09] Andrew Huberman: Wow. That's that's intense. In your book, Dopamine Nation, you also describe some amazing paths to recovery. People that, you know, from reading it, I would I won't say which ones and who, because there's some great surprises in the book too. Both, tragic and and and triumphant as they say.[1:18:32] Andrew Huberman: You've often described your patients as your Heroes. Yeah. Yeah. Tell us a little bit more about that.[1:18:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know, when you think about how hard it is to give up a drug or a behavior that you're addicted to, how much Courage that takes and fortitude and discipline and stick to itiveness, these people are really amazing people. I mean, that's I I don't know that I could do it, what they what they do. You know? It's and, like, you know, we talked a little bit about, In just the constant ever present urge to use even after sustained periods of abstinence for some people, That's really, really hard. And, of course, then you double down on the shame that that they feel because of that urge even when their lives are so much better.[1:19:18] Dr. Anna Lembke: I mean, these people are really, really remarkable. And you take their remarkable accomplishment, and then you imagine the world that we live in now where we are constantly invited and tempted and really bombarded with opportunities to become addicted at[1:19:35] Andrew Huberman: It's like revealing an itch Everywhere.[1:19:37] Dr. Anna Lembke: Oh, yeah. I mean, you can't escape it. You know, you cannot escape it that you'll get an email in your inbox inviting you to do x, y, or z. If you're addicted to that thing, you know, you tried to, like, delete all your apps and not go here, all of a sudden, your work inbox, you're you know, you're getting those images, let's say, Really, really, really hard, and yet these people find a way to do it. I think it's absolutely amazing, and they're really wise people.[1:20:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: They have so much wisdom to offer. They've taught me a lot. You know, as I talk about in my book, I have my own addictions, and I really just, like, Took a page right out of their buzz. Okay. What do I do now?[1:20:09] Dr. Anna Lembke: Alright. What did this patient do? What okay. I'm gonna try that.[1:20:12] Andrew Huberman: It is it is an amazing community of Yeah. Of the people that Yeah. They are very Sage, I wanted to, just touch on something that you mentioned which is, the shame. Yeah. You know, you can't go to a meeting, Or talk to addicts without, detecting or or hearing about, like, lies, shame, etcetera.[1:20:34] Andrew Huberman: I heard you say, in an interview with somebody else recently that truth telling and secrets are sort of at the core of recovery. And, yeah, tell us more about that.[1:20:48] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So one of the things that I found really Fascinating about working with people in recovery was how telling the truth, even about the merest detail of their lives, was central to their recovery, And I became really curious about that. Like, why would truth telling be so important? And, of course, there is the obvious thing that when people are in their addiction, they're lying about using. You know, so part of getting into recovery is to stop lying to the people they care about about their use.[1:21:17] Dr. Anna Lembke: But it's really more than that because what what People in recovery have taught me is that it's not it's not even just not lying about using drugs. I I have to not lie about anything. I can't lie about why I was late to work this morning, which we all do. Oh, I hit traffic. No.[1:21:32] Dr. Anna Lembke: I didn't hit traffic. I wanted to spend 2 more minutes reading the paper and drinking my coffee. Right? Or just lying about, you know, I don't know where I had dinner. Like, so people with addiction will get into, you know, the lying habit where they're lying about random stuff because they're sort of in the habit of lying and how recovery is really about telling the truth, you know, in in all ways.[1:21:54] Dr. Anna Lembke: And so one of the things that I What I had a lot of fun with in writing the book is sort of exploring the neuroscience around why truth telling is important To leading a balanced life. And we know, like, every religion since the beginning of time is all about telling the truth. Well, why? Right? And there's really interesting neuroscience behind it That suggests that when we tell the truth, we actually potentially strengthen our prefrontal court cortical circuits And their connections to our limbic brain and our reward brain.[1:22:25] Dr. Anna Lembke: And, of course, these are the circuits that get disconnected when we're in our addiction. Right? Our balance in our reward pathway, our limbic brain, our emotion brain is doing one thing, and our cortical circuits are completely disengage from that ignoring what's happening, which is easy to do because it's reflexive. We don't need to think about that balance for the balance to be happening, But we have to reengage those circuits, anticipate future consequences, think through the drink, you know, Not just how am I gonna feel now if I use, but how am I gonna feel tomorrow or 6 months from now? And that telling the truth is in fact a way To do that, to make these connections stronger in there, I talk about some studies in my book that that kind of indirectly show that.[1:23:06] Dr. Anna Lembke: So I find that really fascinating. Plus, The they just felt, like, being open and honest with people really does create very intimate connections, And those intimate connections create dopamine. So we were talking a little bit about how you, you know, know a bunch of people who need, Like, intensity in their lives, for me, I need a lot of intensity in my human connections. Like, I'm really not interested in and bored by and made anxious by, casual, interactions. But, you know, like, having this kind of discussion with you that's very Intense and also intimate and self disclosing is very rewarding for me.[1:23:47] Dr. Anna Lembke: So that's an important source of dopamine. Thank god I became a psychiatrist.[1:23:51] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Yeah. Absolutely.[1:23:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: Like, I Can't disclose all my stuff, but I am quite transparent with my patients, which is a slightly unorthodox. But, you know, when I think it's right, I'm also transparent with them. So that that's, you know, that's a source of dopamine too when we're honest and we disclose and that you think people are gonna run away from you if you tell them about like, you're weird neurosis, but really they don't. What they're like is, oh, thank god. I'm I'm not the only one.[1:24:14] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm. Right?[1:24:14] Andrew Huberman: Well, what I love about I love many things about your book. I I read it in 1 suite.[1:24:19] Dr. Anna Lembke: Oh, thank you.[1:24:20] Andrew Huberman: And and I was like, wow. Is, I was Pleasantly surprised, but I was like, wow, she's really opening up in this book from the very beginning. And I don't wanna give, that Away, but it's yeah. You're you're very open, where it's appropriate. And, and also, I think that This question about truth telling, I I I always think about, like, tell the truth, be, you know, a 100% about the truth.[1:24:50] Andrew Huberman: But there's also this element about, do you report previous lies?[1:24:56] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[1:24:56] Andrew Huberman: Right? Like, what about prior behavior? And and I'm I'm fascinated by this. Because to me, telling the truth is has many facets, but the the 3 sides of this Thing, in my mind are 1 is reporting everything accurately. The other is what do you withhold?[1:25:12] Andrew Huberman: What do you not withhold? Right? Because some people say, tell the truth or at least don't lie. Mhmm. That's sort of a[1:25:18] Dr. Anna Lembke: Lies of lies of omission.[1:25:20] Andrew Huberman: Right? Lies of omission. Lies of omission. And then there there's the what I have to assume for most people is a small to enormous batch of things that they lied about in the past that still thread into the future. So how important is it for the the addict or the every person really To, because it sounds like cultivating the circuitry between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system would be great for anybody, since we're all addicts.[1:25:48] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:25:48] Andrew Huberman: Everyone should do it. But in in all seriousness, that sounds like a good thing for everybody to do. How, how much work needs to be done on All the priors, all the stuff we've hidden. Mhmm. And, I mean, not me, but all the all the stuff that everybody else has been.[1:26:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So the, you know, the steps of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, a good number of those steps are about that very thing, the past, the ways that we've harmed people in the past. And 1 of the 4th step is about making amends, you know, by admitting the ways in which that we've contributed, to harming others, and it is a really big piece of recovery. So, you know, how important so so for people with addiction, it's really, really important to go back and make amends. And, you know, you The the the the the key idea there is you just go back and you apologize.[1:26:50] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know? And you don't you don't have to get any particular kind of response or you don't need to be forgiven. It's the act itself of apologizing about The ways in which we've harmed or lied to people, in the past that is cathartic and renewing and allows us to kind of shed this skin and be be new in our lives and begin again, sort of absolved, you know, of past sins, so to speak. So so it is really important. You know, are there situations when it's maybe not a good idea because of the that person or the nature?[1:27:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: Sure. You know, there are always gonna be it doesn't have to be, like it's not we're talking about not, like, not like Kant's idea about, like, never lie, but, you know, Robert's in your house, and He's you know, you're a stowaway. You can't lie even about that. It's like, no. There are probably situations where Absolutely.[1:27:40] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know, For[1:27:41] Andrew Huberman: sake of other people's Safety[1:27:42] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Children's safety. Right. Right. I mean, they're they're you can think of a 1000000 scenarios.[1:27:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: But, but but in general, you know, when we're taking stock, Because I don't know about you, but I have a lot of regrets and guilt about a lot of things in my life, and And, and they kind of haunt me.[1:28:01] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:28:01] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know? It's been as I'll have nightmares. Right? And I think that's true for most people. I mean, I occasionally will meet somebody who's like, I don't have any regrets in my life.[1:28:09] Dr. Anna Lembke: I'm like, wow. Like, I I cannot relate to that at all. So, you know, this idea of, like, catharsis and well, I mean, in the 12 steps, it's telling telling god or your higher power, telling another human being The ways in which you've wronged others, considering your own character defects and how those have contributed. To me, that's a really important piece and something that we don't do enough in our current culture, Patient's meditate in life, I I really feel badly about, you know, this thing. I'll be like, yeah.[1:28:56] Dr. Anna Lembke: I get it.[1:28:57] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:28:57] Dr. Anna Lembke: I I understand that You feel[1:28:59] Andrew Huberman: Well, guilt is a is a Right. There's a circuit for that too.[1:29:02] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. And it's it's important. Right? And it's also important to, Recovery into not becoming addicted is, you know, experiencing a certain amount of appropriate shame for things that we have done And, you know, feeling the pain that comes with shame, which is an incredibly painful emotion. Right?[1:29:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: And I think that may be the one that we all try to avoid more than any other Is like that shame, of not being liked or not being accepted or not being celebrated.[1:29:29] Andrew Huberman: Or the other thing that we did is Sure. It is really despicable.[1:29:33] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. It's really yeah. Like, oh my god. I did that horrible thing. Right.[1:29:36] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. And then so, I mean, I've done horrible things that, I haven't gone back and said I did this horrible thing, but I'm maybe I've tried to pay it forward. Like, I've told my kids, you know, when I was younger, did this horrible thing, and it still haunts me. So if you're ever tempted to do something like what I did, you might think about My situate so, you know, some kind of way. Yeah.[1:29:57] Dr. Anna Lembke: But I think wrestling with that is is important.[1:30:00] Andrew Huberman: No. I I think it's a really important element to all this, and There's not, I love that there's neuroscience being done on truth telling[1:30:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:30:08] Andrew Huberman: And the value of truth telling. I think, If I were to predict it, a new and truly exciting area that people are gonna be really curious about in, in this Huge sphere we call neuroscience. I I hope they'll continue to do more work. Yeah. Also speaks to I'm so glad to hear that's happening here at Stanford.[1:30:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: No. That's the that the well, the the The literature that I look at isn't Stanford work, but, but there's work. There might be might be people's temper[1:30:35] Andrew Huberman: Regardless of where it's happening[1:30:36] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:30:37] Andrew Huberman: More of that And all the rest, please. Wanna ask you about using drugs to treat drug addiction. These days, there's a growing interest or at least discussion about Ibogaine. Mhmm. People going down going out of country because I think it's still illegal here, or is illegal here going out of country to, I don't know, either, inject it or smoke it or whatever it is, or people going and doing Ayahuasca journeys, or, MDMA, which is still an illegal drug in this country, but there are clinical trials.[1:31:08] Andrew Huberman: There are people on this campus doing experimental studies. Don't know if clinical trials, but at Johns Hopkins, there are clinical trials, etcetera. So this, this is a vast area. Right? Different chemistries for Different drugs and different purposes, but the the rationale as I understand it is take people who are in a pattern of addiction, Launch them into a experience that's also chemical and extreme.[1:31:35] Andrew Huberman: Often of the Extreme serotonin and or extreme dopamine type. So MDMA, ecstasy for instance, tons of serotonin dumped. Mhmm. Tons of dopamine dumped. How neurotoxic, if neurotoxic, debatable, etcetera, etcetera.[1:31:49] Andrew Huberman: Not a topic for now, but a lot. And then somehow that Stream experience wrapped inside of a, a supported network in there, whether or not there's just someone there, or whether or not they're actively working through something with the patient, is supposed to eject the person into a life where drug use isn't, as much of interest. This violates at at a at a rash purely rational level. This violates everything we've talked about in terms of dopamine biology. It would, if this arrangement is the way I described it, cause more addiction is anything but a dopamine fast.[1:32:30] Andrew Huberman: It's a dopamine Feast.[1:32:31] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm. Mhmm.[1:32:32] Andrew Huberman: So we hear about successful transition through this, at least anecdotally, and may maybe some claims say, what is going on. What is going on? Doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah.[1:32:48] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So I think it's good that you're skeptical. I think we all should be skeptical. Having said that, there are clinical studies showing, you know and these are Small studies in their short duration, small number of subjects, but, you know, taking people, for example, who are addicted to alcohol and then Having them have this, let's say, psychedelic experience in a very controlled setting.[1:33:16] Andrew Huberman: So either typically, it's a high dose psilocybin or or three dose As I saw it for the MAP study of of MDMA of ecstasy. Those are sort of the[1:33:24] Dr. Anna Lembke: seem to[1:33:24] Andrew Huberman: be the kind of The[1:33:25] Dr. Anna Lembke: typical that[1:33:26] Andrew Huberman: kind of bread and butter of this kind of work.[1:33:28] Dr. Anna Lembke: But the thing to really keep in mind is that this is completely interwoven with regular psychotherapy, And that these are highly selected individuals.[1:33:39] Andrew Huberman: And clinical trials.[1:33:40] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Right.[1:33:40] Andrew Huberman: And these are clinical clinical trials.[1:33:42] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. And and And so, you know, I want I think the metaphor that I that that helps me think about this is there are many ways to the top of the mountain, And these are sort of like taking the gondola instead of walking up. It's sort of instead of doing, like, a year of psychoanalysis where you're sitting on the couch every week Reflecting on your life, it's a condensed version of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy plus, you know, MDMA, which gets you there faster.[1:34:10] Andrew Huberman: Creates the intimacy, presumably Right. Because of this[1:34:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: Well, I think the main thing that happens when it's beneficial Is it just allows the person to get outside of their own head and look at their lives on a much broader sweep and to consider themselves not mired in the, you know, quotidian Sort of details of their life, but rather as a human on a on the large planet Earth in the vast universe. So I think it takes it it's like when it works, it's a transformational experience because It gives the person another lens through which to view their live their lives, which which I think, For some people, it's positive and powerful because they can come back from that and be like, oh my gosh. I care about my family, and I don't. I want x, y, or z for them, and I realized that my continuing to drink is not going to, you know, achieve that. So it's It's almost like a spiritual or values based, so I think it can be very powerful.[1:35:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: But but having said that, I truly am quite skeptical because, you know, addiction is a chronic relapsing and remitting problem. It's hard for me to imagine that there's Something that works very quickly, short term, that's gonna work for a a disease that's really long lasting.[1:35:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The 2 addicts I know that that did MDMA MDMA assisted psychotherapy as far as part of this, thing both got worse.[1:35:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:35:48] Andrew Huberman: But the people I know who had severe trauma Uh-huh. Who did this who took this approach seem to be doing better.[1:35:55] Dr. Anna Lembke: Okay.[1:35:55] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. I, I think that, the discussion as we hear it now is just sort of psychedelics, which is a huge category of Right. That includes many different drugs and compounds with different effects. And we hear about trauma and addiction lumped together.[1:36:10] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[1:36:11] Andrew Huberman: And I think that, I'm a splitter, not a lumper Mhmm. As we say in science, and I think it's gonna be important for people to know that This is definitely not a one size fits all Right. Kind of thing, but it sounds like it may have some utility under certain conditions.[1:36:31] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. I think so. I I think we I'm I'm trying to be very open minded about its potential utility for certain individuals, but I can tell you in my Clinical work, what is a very concerning, unintended consequence of this narrative is I have a lot of people who are looking for some kind of spiritual awakening, who on their own, not in the context of any kind of therapeutic psychological work, you know, microdose or Wanna try, you know, psilocybin or MDMA with a friend or wherever so they can have this, you know, spiritual experience that they can figure out their lives, That that's a disaster and and almost never works out well. And I've then had people who literally supposedly, you can't get addicted To psychedelics because, you know, something with the biochemistry, which I don't fully understand because it doesn't make any sense to me, but I have patients clinically who definitely are addicted To, you know, MDMA, to microdosing. So that's very concerning for to me because, like, you know, Pollan's had to change her mind.[1:37:30] Dr. Anna Lembke: That that, You know, I I respect that work, but on the other hand, it's penetrated the culture.[1:37:36] Andrew Huberman: Pollan's book.[1:37:36] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. Yeah.[1:37:37] Andrew Huberman: And and and I I don't know him, and so, I don't have a problem taking a taking a stance. So I'll just say my stance on that is the narrative Of popular authors can expand and wick out so fast[1:37:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:37:52] Andrew Huberman: That pretty soon people are essentially taking their mental health into their own hands. And I I actually have I have great optimism for this, business of of clinical use of, Psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins is doing fabulous work on this. And and there are others too, of course. But those are controlled settings.[1:38:15] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:38:16] Andrew Huberman: And the pharmacology is being tuned up. And one thing that I think is coming, there are several papers published recently in great journals like Nature and Science, etcetera, where there are Scientists who are removing the hallucinogenic components of these drugs and finding that they still have the antidepressant Effects. And so the experience of a psychedelic and the long term effects of the psychedelic might actually be dissociable. Mhmm. And so I, again, I, and I'm always careful to say I'm I'm neither for something or against it.[1:38:53] Andrew Huberman: I I just think that, treading carefully is what's important.[1:38:58] Dr. Anna Lembke: I I I agree with you. And I can just tell you that the the downstream effect for the average person, I'd for many of whom present in our clinic is that they've misconstrued the data on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions, to this idea that they're safe or that anybody can take them in any circumstance and have this kind of awakening, and and That that's not what the data show. Right? The data are these highly controlled settings, you know, carefully selected patients. So That's my worry.[1:39:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know?[1:39:34] Andrew Huberman: Sure. And, I'm gonna be sitting down with Matthew Johnson at some point, and we'll discuss this. And I think that, That care and that, that cocoon of of real clinical care does seem to be an important[1:39:48] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:39:48] Andrew Huberman: Component. Well, I'm glad we could touch on it. And, you know, I'm sure I'll get a bunch of comments telling me that. Yeah. You know?[1:39:56] Andrew Huberman: But But I but I think it is important to explore things from all sides, and that's that's what we we do as scientists. And if Michael Pollan wants to chat, we can do that too. That's fine. I very much enjoyed the book, actually. Yes.[1:40:08] Andrew Huberman: But I think that people run with ideas.[1:40:12] Dr. Anna Lembke: That's right.[1:40:12] Andrew Huberman: They don't walk with them. They sprint. Right. Yeah. There are couple other things I just wanna touch on, but they all relate to social media.[1:40:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: Okay.[1:40:22] Andrew Huberman: You were featured in The Social Dilemma. It was a powerful movie. I think many people avoided seeing that movie because it it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are, and how manipulated we all are.[1:40:33] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:40:34] Andrew Huberman: But it doesn't seem to have changed behavior much.[1:40:37] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[1:40:37] Andrew Huberman: I I have to say that the the movie changed my understanding and my perception, but not my behavior too much. Mhmm. If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing, something that's making our lives worse or our our Us less functional at work and in relationships. I could imagine a version of social media where it's making me more connected. Mean, this is a podcast after all.[1:41:01] Andrew Huberman: I post Yes. Videos. This will show up on YouTube and, and elements of it on Instagram as well. So much like, sugar or, other things, I have to imagine that we need to regulate, not necessarily eliminate This behavior. So I wanna talk about what that looks like.[1:41:20] Andrew Huberman: And I wanna talk about what you've referred to as this narcissistic preoccupation that social media is creating, that we are all far more keenly aware of how we look and how we sound and how We are being perceived than we were 10 years ago. Right. So first of all, social media, How addicting is it really, and what is healthy social media behavior?[1:41:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: So the first message I would wanna get across about social media is that it really is a drug, And it's engineered to be a drug, and it's based on, you know, potency, quantity, variety, the bottomless polls, the likes, the way that it's enumerated, all of that, which doesn't mean that we can't use it, but we need to be very thoughtful about the way you we we use it just like we need to be thoughtful about the way we use any drug. And so that means with intention and in advance, planning our use, right, and trying to use it in as a as a as a really awesome tool to potentially connect with other people and not to be used by it, or get lost in it. And, of course, you know, people are gonna come with different propensities for addiction to any drug, and that's true for social media too. Some people will have no problem using it in moderation or using it in a way that's adaptive, and other other people will immediately get get sucked tin. And the key thing about getting addicted is when it's happening, we we nobody who's getting addicted thinks they're getting addicted.[1:43:06] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right? Let's face it. It's only after the fact that we go, whoops. You know, what was that about?[1:43:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, remember texting and driving? There were all these books about texting and driving, how terrible it was. Yeah. Even the governments have largely given up. You see these these billboards Terrified.[1:43:20] Andrew Huberman: Like, don't text and drive or any text can wait or what. Not worth dying for. Right. But everybody's texting and doing[1:43:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: And if you look at young people today, teenagers, I mean, they're basically cybernetically enhanced that the phone is there. You know, it's like they're talking to you and texting 12 friends at the same time, and there's no stopping it. I mean, the genie is out of the bottle. We're you know, it's not we're not going back. Right.[1:43:42] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know? So we we do need to figure out, you know, how to make this this tool Something that's, you know, gonna be good for us and and not ultimately harmful. And I I don't have all the answers at by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think, You know, some of the wisdom that we have learned from using other drugs also applies to social media, which is say that we have to, again, put barriers in place that allow us to remain in control of our use, which means not Not too much, you know, not too often, not too potent. And[1:44:17] Andrew Huberman: Do you think in going back to this idea of the the unit of the day Being a good, tractable unit, a manageable unit of time for most people. So you're saying in advance. So allocating 2 hours in which you're going to allow yourself to have free rein use of the phone and all its apps and all its things. Or, even more restricted than that. Meaning, okay.[1:44:39] Andrew Huberman: I'm I'm only gonna allow myself 30 minutes a day to post and comment, and then that's a closeout completely.[1:44:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. So I think it's it's it depends on the person and sort of a combination. We talked earlier about, you know, having an itch and scratching yourself At night, we've gotten to a point with smartphones. People are pulling them out, and they are utterly unconscious of doing so. Pulling them out, You know, a couple texts, a couple they don't know what they're doing yet.[1:45:03] Andrew Huberman: Who who works in, does delivers babies.[1:45:06] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:45:06] Andrew Huberman: And, many Pregnant mothers won't actually deliver without their phone in hand. And this used to be the hand that was connected to their spouse. This may be a comment on On on spouses Yeah. More than on phones. But, but, it sounds like there's kind of a security blanket.[1:45:27] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right. Like a transitional object. Yeah.[1:45:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Actually that reminds me. You've referred to, The phone. I think it's the phone, but maybe it's our online persona or ourselves as we've become sort of infantile In our need for it, it's like a baby in a bottle. Right.[1:45:44] Andrew Huberman: And so I do wonder if if we have regressed. And I do think we've regressed a bit Mhmm. In terms of our online behavior, our inability to act like yeah. I saw an adult was somebody that can control their behavior. Yeah.[1:45:56] Andrew Huberman: That's the difference between a baby and an adult. Have to be a developmental neurobiologist for very long to understand that a young organism can't control its behavior and older one can. So to me, A a mature organism, mature in years, organism that can't control its behavior is a baby. It's it's an immature version of itself, And there's neural there's neuroscience to support that statement. I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes, and I think, I'm a grown man.[1:46:23] Andrew Huberman: Like, what is the problem here? Right? You know, I don't eat baby food, but I'm acting like a baby with the phone. Right. Alright.[1:46:31] Andrew Huberman: In the sense that I'm reflexively picking it up.[1:46:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[1:46:35] Andrew Huberman: I'm, not being intentioned and deliberate with it. Do I need a full 30 days, Anna?[1:46:41] Dr. Anna Lembke: So so yes. So so 30[1:46:43] Andrew Huberman: days away from my phone?[1:46:44] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know, that's my recommendation of the full 30 days to reset. Know, if you're if you're severely addicted, the the I I recommend the 30 days. But if you're just a little bit addicted like most of us, probably don't need 30 days. In fact, a single day not only would be challenging, but, but probably maybe sufficient.[1:47:02] Andrew Huberman: My phone is off for Substantial segments of the[1:47:05] Dr. Anna Lembke: Okay. That's great.[1:47:06] Andrew Huberman: And it drives other people crazy. People expect me to respond, but I Don't care. I really[1:47:13] Dr. Anna Lembke: won't. Right.[1:47:14] Andrew Huberman: Right. Actually take a little bit of pleasure Yeah. In the fact that well, because I think the point I'm trying to make is the right one, which is that it's not just right for me, but, like, why Right. I don't see a clause on text messages or emails that say must be responded to within Right. X amount of time or else Right.[1:47:33] Andrew Huberman: Or else. Yeah. So I take the liberty of the replying when I When I'm able to[1:47:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. That's right.[1:47:39] Andrew Huberman: Or want to.[1:47:39] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. We right. But which touches on one of the big challenges about Social media is that as more and more of us are spending more and more time on social media, we're divesting our libidinous energies, etcetera, From real life interactions. So that means even when we want to choose to not be online connecting, We go outside, and there's there's no there there. Right?[1:48:02] Dr. Anna Lembke: There's nobody else there. So I think our collective challenge, and it should be our mission, is to make sure that we are preserving and maintaining offline ways to connect with each other. None of whom are on their phones while you're together for that discreet amount of time, then it's wonderful and liberating and nobody's distracted, and I think that's really the And I think young people are figuring that out. You know? They're trying to create these spaces or try to let's say, instead of Doing a dopamine fast by yourself, do it with your friends.[1:48:48] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right? Then there's the FOMO is less if you're missing out because, Oh, you're all doing the dopamine fast together. So these are some of the tricks that, you know, we can come up with. But I[1:48:57] Andrew Huberman: like that.[1:48:58] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah. Okay. Good.[1:48:59] Andrew Huberman: I don't allow I have a home gym, and I I love working out. I I just enjoy it and always have, and I I don't allow my phone[1:49:06] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:49:07] Andrew Huberman: In my gym anymore.[1:49:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:49:08] Andrew Huberman: And I live in an area where I don't get any reception, like, 2 meters outside my door. So all my dog walks now are just and they were boring as hell. I was like a bulldog. Doesn't like to walk. It's really slow.[1:49:20] Andrew Huberman: And it was so boring for a while.[1:49:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:49:22] Andrew Huberman: Because I was so used to taking calls[1:49:24] Dr. Anna Lembke: when I[1:49:24] Andrew Huberman: walk, and it's super efficient. Yeah.[1:49:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: When I[1:49:26] Andrew Huberman: do that. Yeah. The walks now are some of my favorite part of the day. Yeah. Right.[1:49:32] Andrew Huberman: Because and if the phone were if I were to get a call on of those are the broad reception of the area. I would be very dismayed.[1:49:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:49:38] Andrew Huberman: So I can attest to this, and, I I don't think I'm a phone addict, but I do put work into regulating my[1:49:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. So this is the key. You have to with intention prior to being in that situation, Think of literal physical and metacognitive barriers that you can put between yourself and your phone or whatever your your drug is To create these intentional spaces where you're not constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, and distracting yourself, because I really do think you know, I think we talked just just before we we started with the interview. You know, we're we're losing the ability to have a sustained thought. Right?[1:50:18] Dr. Anna Lembke: I mean, we we get so far, and then then you get to that point in the thought where it's a little bit hard to know what's coming next. And it's very easy to Check your phone or check your email or look something up on, you know, the Internet, and then you never get that opportunity to finish that thought, which is really the source of creative energy and an original thought. Right? You're not just reacting to[1:50:44] Andrew Huberman: Right. And something that could contribute to the world.[1:50:46] Dr. Anna Lembke: That's right.[1:50:47] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big I'm I'm a big believer that you're either consuming or you are creating.[1:50:53] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:50:53] Andrew Huberman: And there there is I should mention, It's important. I do believe in neutral time. I think sleep is great. I'm a big proponent of sleep. I've talked a lot about it on the podcast.[1:51:02] Andrew Huberman: I care a lot about sleep, and not just for sake of performance. I actually just really like sleep. I think that being a constant consumer of visual information And the information of all kinds can can be a problem, but but there's some really great sources of information on the Internet. Yes. And, and I I certainly benefit from from the fact that that those channels exist.[1:51:27] Andrew Huberman: Narcissistic preoccupation. Am I a narcissist?[1:51:32] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know, I first of all, there there's there's healthy[1:51:34] Andrew Huberman: Or is the fact that I asked? Does that take me out of would a narcissist never ask that question?[1:51:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: Oh, yes. Highly sophisticated narcissist would know to do that. Sophisticated. So there's healthy narcissism, which means that we all invest our personal energies into things that we care about. And if our competence in that arena is threatened, we we would all experience a narcissistic injury, and that's It's normal and healthy.[1:52:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: But but but we are living in a narcissistic culture. I mean, that's not news, this preoccupation with individual achievement and individual self worth and individual self confidence. And I think all of that is just fueled by social media where we're not just seeing ourselves, but we're seeing people's reactions to ourselves and every single, you know, thing we say or do, you know, we get likes and this and that. It it's really insidious, And it contributes, I think, ultimately to a lot of personal shame because we're not really meant to be individuals bouncing around in the universe. We're social animals, and we've we're we're probably generally happiest even for natural contrarians among us When we're part of a tribe, right, and if we do too much to kind of separate ourselves from from that tribe, I think that the brain's natural and instinctive corrective mechanism against that is self loathing and shame.[1:53:01] Dr. Anna Lembke: So, you know, it's so ironic because the the culture tells us if we just achieve more, we'll like ourselves more. But the truth is actually the opposite That that I think when people get these pinnacles of personal achievement, you know, you have things like the imposter syndrome or what whatever. You know?[1:53:18] Andrew Huberman: Where you just you know? We're at Stanford after a lot of high achievers here.[1:53:22] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:53:23] Andrew Huberman: Right? Some phenomenal amazing people like yourself and other colleagues of mine that just, always in awe. Like, it's just amazing. Like the mean it is shifted so high. And also people have amazing stoke paths to get here.[1:53:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:53:35] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[1:53:35] Andrew Huberman: Coming from very little, accomplishing so much. But it's also the pressure.[1:53:40] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yeah.[1:53:41] Andrew Huberman: Right? The way that this career was described to me the day I got my job was 1 colleague of mine, the late Ben Barra said, welcome to schizophrenia. You're never gonna be able to complete anything for without getting interrupted. That was partially true, although I've created buffers. And the other one, very successful scientist, a member of the National Academy, etcetera, said to me, you know, just remember, it's pinball.[1:54:05] Andrew Huberman: You never win.[1:54:06] Dr. Anna Lembke: Mhmm.[1:54:06] Andrew Huberman: The best you can do is just keep playing.[1:54:09] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:54:09] Andrew Huberman: And I thought, wow. Okay. Mhmm. Okay. And then you just go.[1:54:15] Dr. Anna Lembke: Right.[1:54:15] Andrew Huberman: But I think that as we achieve more, not just academics of course, but as anyone achieves more, There's the relishing in the accomplishment. There's often the desire for more, but there's also the pressure of, Well, now I have to do this for the next 30 years even though I love it. It's the pressure of well, if the mountain is this high, then do I get here and here and here, and then you start shoveling more dirt on so you can keep climbing? And it's a lot of work. Yes.[1:54:41] Andrew Huberman: And I think that the, the perception of success is that There's a roar of the crowd and you cruise. You don't cruise. That they just give you more to do. Right. Or you give yourself more to do.[1:54:52] Dr. Anna Lembke: Well, what I think is At least in my my life experience, and I've heard this from other people as well, you know, what it's that prize that we're going for That if we get it, is so unsatisfying. And it's the prize that we never imagined That we kinda go, well, how did that happen? But, gee, you know, that feels good. And so I'm very you know, it's what's the key[1:55:18] Andrew Huberman: It's like a mirage In the one case and it's like a, like a yeah. It's on the on it's almost like dopamine can create these mirages[1:55:27] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:55:28] Andrew Huberman: That there's some place[1:55:30] Dr. Anna Lembke: there. And if I just it's that pot of gold.[1:55:32] Andrew Huberman: Right? If I if I just Constant dopamine. Right.[1:55:34] Dr. Anna Lembke: That's right. That's right. Yeah. And and I think this, You know, this really, I think, is related to our our our discussion earlier about this taking it one day at a time or paying attention to that, you know, 24 hour period in environment. I am absolutely fascinated by the ways in which we accumulate success When we do that, totally independent of the desire for success, it's really process oriented.[1:56:03] Dr. Anna Lembke: It's like, Where am I today? How can I make today a good and meaningful day, a little bit better or as good as Some other days I've had constantly tweaking and experimenting with this experiment that we call, You know, our human existence? And when we do that in a way that's authentic and paying attention And value driven, whatever our, you know, values are informed by. It is very, very interesting how those days, again, accumulate, and you find Well, I guess I contributed something of value there, but I wasn't trying to do that. You know?[1:56:43] Dr. Anna Lembke: I think that's really I mean, what what I'm so amazed by is, like, you know, 20 years ago when I went to Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, You know, I just I was happy to just be a good doctor. I was like, I I guess I'm just gonna try to figure out how to be a good doctor, and I'm here to learn that. And now I see these medical students, and they're wonderful. They're brilliant, and they're well they're all intentioned, all that. But they're like, how can I, you know, write the great American novel, Do my startup, go to Africa, apply for that grant?[1:57:14] Dr. Anna Lembke: You know, it's like, really? I was just trying to learn how to be a doctor. And it's, you say, it's a lot of pressure on them, and it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging of the real way to accomplish something[1:57:28] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:57:29] Dr. Anna Lembke: By which isn't about, like, oh, how can I accomplish something? It's like, what can I do today that would be of service? Right? And then finding that of trying to be of service, you know, and and not really going for recognition can sometimes lead to what people call success, Although that wasn't what you were aiming for.[1:57:47] Andrew Huberman: And it's all the more beautiful when it's not what you're aiming for.[1:57:50] Dr. Anna Lembke: So much better. So much better. Yeah.[1:57:52] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big believer That when one can, align their compulsion with some greater good[1:58:00] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes.[1:58:01] Andrew Huberman: A service to humanity or the planet or animals, whatever it is, that, that's the that's where the The really good stuff emerges because it there's a lot of reciprocity there. The world starts to you're supporting the world, and then it starts support you in a way that feels very fluid.[1:58:18] Dr. Anna Lembke: Comes back. Right? And, I mean, that speaks to you, like, your generosity to me vis a vis my book. And I have to say Well,[1:58:25] Andrew Huberman: I love the book.[1:58:26] Dr. Anna Lembke: I know.[1:58:26] Andrew Huberman: There's like we're we're not in a business deal, folks. It's just purely that I heard Anna lecture in my course. Want to learn more about dopamine. She taught me, asked her if she would come on the podcast. It turned out she wrote this amazing book.[1:58:36] Andrew Huberman: She sent me a copy of the book. I read it in one sweep. It's incredible, And I love it. So just like the 8 year old version of me, now the 45 version, of myself, I can't stop blabbing about the things I love.[1:58:50] Dr. Anna Lembke: Well, it's it's awesome, but I have to say I have been surprised by your generosity. It's not something I've encountered frequently. Oh. At Stanford, which is a wonderful place, but it it there there there is a general sense that if I give away to somebody else, I've lost I've lost something, Which is not the right way to think about it, not how you are, and also not how the world works. Because when we give away to other people, We we get back so much more, but it it takes a long time, and it might not come through that path.[1:59:31] Andrew Huberman: I never think about reciprocity, but I was, weaned by good advisors.[1:59:38] Dr. Anna Lembke: That's very nice. Yeah. Yeah.[1:59:40] Andrew Huberman: I think I just this sort of got drilled into me that the more the more you give, the better your immediate life is.[1:59:45] Dr. Anna Lembke: Yes. Yeah.[1:59:46] Andrew Huberman: But I also don't have a long term vision. You know? I I just I'm I'm just excited about the book. I'm excited that people are are learning about the brain and dopamine. I have to admit, having grown up in neuroscience essentially, I did not understand that pleasure and pain were orchestrated the way that they are.[2:00:05] Andrew Huberman: I'm very mindful of it now.[2:00:07] Dr. Anna Lembke: Oh, good.[2:00:08] Andrew Huberman: And it's changed a number of my behaviors. I know a number of people are gonna have questions and wanna get in contact with you. You are not on social media.[2:00:16] Dr. Anna Lembke: That's correct. Yes.[2:00:17] Andrew Huberman: You are true to your you are true to your ideology. That is Yeah. That's great.[2:00:21] Dr. Anna Lembke: And and the reason for that is just I I wouldn't be able to control myself. Mean, that really would be my drug. People are my drug. Intimacy is my drug, and and I wouldn't be able to manage it. And so just It was just easier for me to not do it at all rather than try to moderate it.[2:00:37] Andrew Huberman: Well, the book as you, mentioned before and as I can attest to is has a certain intimacy. People get to know you through the book. So definitely check out the book. If you have questions about the book, etcetera, you're welcome to send them my way. I I will buffer you from all those questions.[2:00:52] Andrew Huberman: I'll filter them. Anna, doctor Lemke, I I should be a formal forgive me. I've been referring to you. No. No.[2:00:58] Andrew Huberman: That's totally fine. Way through because we're colleagues, but thank you so much for sharing this information. And, I know I learned a ton, and I know everyone else is gonna Learn a lot more about addiction and the good side of dopamine.[2:01:12] Dr. Anna Lembke: That's right. Thank you for having me. It's been really, really great to with you.[2:01:17] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you. Thank you for joining me for my discussion with doctor Anna Lemke. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
