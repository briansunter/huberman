Kronikle AI - Understanding & Controlling Aggression | Huberman Lab Podcast #71 - TranscriptUnderstanding & Controlling Aggression | Huberman Lab Podcast #71 - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing aggression. I'm going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression. For instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression, meaning sometimes People will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love who also feel threatened.[0:00:32] Andrew Huberman: There's also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others, and there is indirect aggression, which is aggression not involving physical violence. For instance, shaming people and things of that sort. It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each Each of the different types of aggression. And today, I will define those for you. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression, Talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved.[0:01:02] Andrew Huberman: I promise to make it all accessible to you even if you do not have any biology or science background. I will also discuss tools, psychological tools and biological tools that one can use to better control aggression. Now right here at the outset, I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it. To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of energy, and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression. Later, I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body that reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of Chemicals that make people feel good, acts of aggression.[0:01:44] Andrew Huberman: However, what I'm mainly referring to is the context in which human beings We'll pay money in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression. To put it simply, People spend an enormous amount of money and time and energy watching other people engage in, for instance, aggressive sports. And we know That observing your team winning over another team causes the release of neurochemicals in your brain and body that make you feel good and, yes, that can make you feel more aggressive. We also know, of course, that most governments invest many 1,000,000,000, If not 1,000,000,000,000 of dollars in infrastructure technologies and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed, so called military warfare, etcetera. So today's discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense.[0:02:34] Andrew Huberman: We'll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder that most of you probably haven't heard of, but is actually far more common than perhaps you know. We'll talk about the role of things like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and how that relate to aggression through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression. And we'll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression, Proactive aggression, as mentioned before, and reactive aggression. I'm certain that by the end of the episode, you will come away with a much more thorough understanding of what this thing that we call aggression really is. And when you see it in other people, I think it will make more sense to you.[0:03:10] Andrew Huberman: And when you observe it in yourself or the impulse to engage in aggression, verbal or physical or otherwise, I hope that you'll understand it better as well. And, of course, the tools that I will describe Should allow you to modulate and control aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness and just generally to be able to engage with people in a more adaptive way overall. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast Is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:03:51] Andrew Huberman: Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all your foundational health needs. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take once or twice a day is that it covers all of my basic vitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs. The probiotics are especially important to me.[0:04:17] Andrew Huberman: There are now Abundant data showing that the gut microbiome, which is basically a community of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts, are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function, for mood, and many other aspects of our health. The gut microbiome thrives on probiotics, and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics to optimize the gut microbiome. Athletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery from physical and mental exertion, Digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin c, zinc, as I mentioned before, all the other vitamins and minerals that you need in order to cover your basic needs each day. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road and a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:05:08] Andrew Huberman: There's now a wealth of data showing that vitamin d three Is important for many aspects of our immediate and long term health. Many people, even if they get out in the sunlight, are not getting enough Vitamin d 3. And the k two is thought to be beneficial for calcium regulation and a number of other things important to our health. So, again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you can claim the special offer of the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA.[0:05:37] Andrew Huberman: ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, And everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system. I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty tough challenges as you move throughout the day. For instance, if you go from a brightly lit region To a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust.[0:06:02] Andrew Huberman: ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with those sorts of adjustments in mind. So for instance, if you're outside in the shade, you move into the sun and then back into the shade, you don't have to take your sunglasses on and off. Their glasses were initially designed for sports performance. And the great thing is they could be used for that, but also they have a terrific aesthetic so you can wear them to work or out to dinner. I wear readers at night And when I drive at night, and I wear sunglasses if I'm out a lot on really bright days.[0:06:29] Andrew Huberman: The terrific thing about ROKA glasses is that even if you get Sweaty, they won't fall off, so you can run with them, you can cycle with them, or as I mentioned before, you can just wear them out and about. If you'd like to try ROKA, you can go to roka.com. That's roka a.com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA, r o k a.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.[0:06:53] Andrew Huberman: Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that, in my opinion, are the very best you'll find. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a little over a year ago, and it's the best sleep I've had ever since. If you go to the Helix site, they have a terrific sleep Quiz that just takes a few minutes, asks you questions like do you tend to sleep on your side, your back, or your stomach? Maybe you don't know because you're asleep, but many people do know. And even if you don't know, that's okay.[0:07:18] Andrew Huberman: It will also ask you questions like, do you tend to run hot or cold? Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not? And by taking that brief quiz, they will match you to the Specific mattress that's ideal for you and your sleep needs, and that's really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart. Everybody's unique, and they know that. So if you take this quiz, you'll get matched to a particular mattress.[0:07:37] Andrew Huberman: For me, it was the Dusk Mattress, d u s k. But, again, that's just me, and you may match to that one or you may match to a different one. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress and sleeping much better, go to helix sleep.com/huberman. Take that 2 minute sleep quiz, and match you to a customized mattress, and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and 2 free pillows. I also love their pillows.[0:07:58] Andrew Huberman: I've always had this issue with pillows that they Heat up too much. I'm always looking for the pillow that can cool itself. Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool. They're also not too big, so I'm not propped up not getting the tech snack in the middle of the night, putting my chin push to my chest, nor am I, you know, falling back and having trouble breathing in the middle of the night. They're designed just right.[0:08:16] Andrew Huberman: Also have a 10 years warranty, and you get to try it out for a 100 nights risk free. They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, but I think that you again, if you're interested, you can go to helix sleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and 2 free pillows. Let's talk about aggression. I think that many people out there are put off by aggression, although others are drawn to aggression both in themselves and when observing it in others. The reason to talk about aggression is that, as mentioned before, the context of aggression really matters.[0:08:48] Andrew Huberman: So there are instances where aggression is adaptive, For instance, a mother protecting her children if she's being attacked or if her children are being threatened. I think most people would agree That so called maternal aggression of that sort, provided the context is right, is a great thing. Protecting our young is After all, one of the primary adaptive drives of our species, and thank goodness it is. Of course, other forms of aggression like Unprovoked proactive aggression, somebody simply being violent to somebody else even when unprovoked. Most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior.[0:09:23] Andrew Huberman: It can even evoke aggression in people when they observe that kind of behavior. So, again, context really matters. But a more general and perhaps An even more important reason to think about and understand aggression is that by understanding the biology and psychology of aggression, You will be in a much better position to understand how all emotional states come to be, both in yourself and in others. For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement that I believe arises from pop psychology, not from formal academic psychology, that Aggression is just sadness. It's a form of sadness that's amplified, and it shows up as aggression.[0:10:04] Andrew Huberman: But when we look at the underlying biology And the peer reviewed literature on this, nothing could be further from the truth. We have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression versus Grief and mourning, those are non overlapping. Now that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time. But the idea that sadness and aggression are 1 in the same thing is simply not true. And by understanding that Or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing, you'll be in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able To reduce or eliminate or if it's adaptive to you, to modulate aggression.[0:10:47] Andrew Huberman: And, yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression, in some cases, even Amplifying aggression can be adaptive. Now this, of course, is not the 1st discussion about the biology of aggression or the psychology of aggression. We really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began. One of the names that's Most associated with the formal study of aggression is none other than Konrad Lorenz. Some of you may be familiar with that name.[0:11:17] Andrew Huberman: Others of you may not be familiar with that name. Konrad Lorenz studied so called imprinting behaviors and fixed action pattern behaviors. He's most famous, at least in scientific circles, for getting geese To believe that he was their parent. And if you were to put into Google, Conrad with a k, Lorenz, just as it sounds, Conrad, Lorenz, geese, You're gonna see a lot of photos of Conrad walking down roads with a lot of geese following him or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him. He had a habit of Geese adopting him because of the behaviors that he partook in.[0:11:51] Andrew Huberman: So he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese, and then they would think that he was the parent, they would imprint on him. He even lived with these animals, and they lived with him. Sort of a strange character from what I hear. But, nonetheless, all this work was deserving a no of a Nobel Prize because what he discovered were fixed action patterns that is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single Stimulus. Okay?[0:12:14] Andrew Huberman: This is really important. The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors like swimming behind a parent or looking to somebody for comfort and only them. The idea that that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts triggered by just presence of that person is remarkable because what it suggested and what turns out to be true is that there are neural circuits, Not just individual brain areas, but collections of brain areas that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors. And that's The first fundamental principle that we need to define today, that when we talk about aggression, we're talking about activation of Neural circuits, not individual brain areas, but neural circuits that get played out in sequence like he's on a piano. But that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb.[0:13:05] Andrew Huberman: It has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and it's a process. It's not an event. And as you'll see, that turns out to be very important in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression, prevent it from happening Before it's initiated or maybe even prolonging aggression if that's what's needed. Now Conrad Lorenz had No real knowledge of neural circuits. I mean, obviously, he knew there was this thing that we call a brain and a nervous system, and he knew that there were chemicals in the brain and Hormones and things of that sort that were likely to play a role, but he really didn't take any measures to define what the neural circuits were.[0:13:42] Andrew Huberman: Frankly, he didn't need to. He had his Nobel Prize, and he did all this beautiful work. He'd, he's known for an abundance of work, but he did think about What sorts of underlying processes could drive something like aggression? And he talked about one particular feature That's especially important, and that's this notion of a pressure. The idea that, yes, certain hormones will bias Somebody or an animal to be aggressive.[0:14:10] Andrew Huberman: Certain neurotransmitter states, and you'll learn what those are today, will bias somebody To be more or less aggressive, maybe even submissive and passive, maybe outright proactively aggressive towards anyone or anything in front of them. And, yes, of course, there will be historical features based on their childhood, etcetera, etcetera. He understood that there will be a constellation of things that would Drive people to be aggressive. And he described the so called pressure, almost like a hydraulic pressure. Just think about fluid pressure in a small container Being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can or the container is ready to explode, and how multiple features, multiple variables could impinge on that and create that pressure.[0:14:51] Andrew Huberman: It turns out that's exactly the way the system works. There is no single brain area that flips the switch for aggression. Although we'll soon talk about a brain structure that generally houses the propensity and the output of aggression, This notion of a hydraulic pressure that can drive us toward aggressive behavior or conversely can be Very low pressure and keep us in a state of nonreactivity, maybe even passivity or submissiveness is a very important feature because it really captures the Essence of how neural circuits work when we're talking about primitive behaviors generally, and you can start to notice this in yourself and in others. You can start to notice when you are veering toward aggression or when someone is veering toward aggression, verbal or physical. Now that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure that Lorenz was referring to, and it really does have an underlying biological basis.[0:15:49] Andrew Huberman: Now it was some years later that the first experiments came along, which really started to identify the brain areas and the biological so called pressures that can induce aggressive behavior. And the person that really gets credit for this is a guy by the name of Walter Hess, Who, at that time, was working on cats. And I know that when you say working on cats, a lot of people will cringe. A lot of people have cats as pets. And certainly, cats be delightful.[0:16:17] Andrew Huberman: Some people like them more. Some people like them less. Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats. I should say that these days, very few laboratories work on cats. Most laboratories that work on animal models will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies, for their capacity to do genetics On laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice.[0:16:37] Andrew Huberman: And, occasionally, you'll find a lab that still works on cats. Back in the time of Hess, very few laboratories worked on mice. Most laboratories worked on cats or rats. And the reason for that is nowadays, most Laboratories use mice if they use animal models because of the genetic tools that exist in mice to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, etcetera, which can't Be done in humans or nonhuman primates, at least not very easily, at this point in history. So when I say he was working on cats, I realized that probably evokes some negative emotions in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you.[0:17:11] Andrew Huberman: What we can do, however, is look at the data and make use of the data in terms of our understanding. What Hess did was he had cats That were awake, and he was able to lower stimulating electrode into their brain. Now keep in mind that the brain does not have any pain sensors. So after a small hole is made in the skull, electrodes are lowered into the brain. This is what's done commonly in human neurosurgery.[0:17:35] Andrew Huberman: And He was able to stimulate different brain areas, and he was sort of poking around. And when I say sort of, he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose. He wasn't just poking around in there fun, he was trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire categories of behavior Ala Lorenz. Right? These fixed action pattern behaviors.[0:17:58] Andrew Huberman: Eventually, his electrode landed in a site, he provided electrical stimulation to the cat that caused this otherwise passive, purring, relaxing cat To suddenly go into an absolute rage. So arched back hissing, hair up, so called piloerection where the hairs go up, animals try Make themselves as big as possible often when they're aggressive, drooling, maybe even spitting. Believe it or not, cats and other animals can do this. And the cat tried to attack him or anyone else and anything else, even inanimate objects when he stimulate this particular brain area. So Hess obviously took notice of this incredible transformation in behavior And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation of this particular brain area, the cat very quickly, within seconds, went back to being passive calm kitty.[0:18:54] Andrew Huberman: Now, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals because he had to confirm that it wasn't just happenstance, that there wasn't something Unique about this 1 cat that perhaps, he had stimulated an area that had been built up during the kitten hood of this, of this cat and had been reactivated. Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life or scared and, reactivation of a particular circuit unique to that cat, created this aggressive behavior. That wasn't the case. Every cat that he looked at and stimulated this particular brain area, The cat would immediately go into an aggressive, almost rage type behavior. Now, of course, we can't anthropomorphize.[0:19:34] Andrew Huberman: We don't know what the cat was feeling. For all we know, the cat could be happy, although that seems pretty unlikely. And later experiments done in mice, but also in humans, confirm that indeed stimulation of this brain area evoke not just Behavioral aggression, but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger. So what was this incredible brain area? Or rather, I should say, What is the brain area that harbored this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior in Hess' experiments?[0:20:06] Andrew Huberman: Well, for those of you that are regular listeners of this podcast, you'll probably be relieved to know that today we're gonna talk about some new neural circuits. Oftentimes, we'll center back on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up. And for those of you that haven't heard them before, don't worry. I'll make Clear as to what those brain areas are and what they do. But today, we're gonna talk a lot about the so called V MH or ventromedial hypothalamus.[0:20:32] Andrew Huberman: The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus, meaning a small collection of neurons. What are neurons? Nerve cells. And that small collection of neurons that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small. It's only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain, and that combined 3,000 neurons or so, it's not exactly 3,000, but 3,000 neurons or so is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior of the sort that Hess observed in the cat.[0:21:10] Andrew Huberman: And believe it or not, when you see somebody who's in the act of rage or in an act of verbal aggression or in an act of defensive aggression protecting their family or loved ones or country, etcetera, almost certainly, Those neurons are engaged in that behavior. Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior. And next, I'll describe some experiments that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so, but leading right up until this year and even last month That keep confirming again and again and again that it is the activity of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are both necessary and sufficient to generate The full catalog of aggressive behaviors. Now before I go further to describe the beautiful recent studies on the VMH, the ventromedial hypothalamus and the important role of testosterone and, more importantly, estrogen in the activation of aggressive behavior. That's right.[0:22:07] Andrew Huberman: That's Soon to be clear to you why that's the case. I wanna emphasize that the ventral medial hypothalamus is something that we should all care about. Why? Well, it turns out that many categories of psych psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, and psychological challenges, Things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, and even certain forms of autism Can include elements of aggression and even violence. Now it's certainly not the case that aggression and violence are present In all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder, I'm absolutely not saying that.[0:22:53] Andrew Huberman: However, it can be a feature of those, and it's a well described feature in terms of Trying to understand the constellation of challenges that people suffer from when they have those. So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond just understanding basic aggression In the context of adaptive aggression, so, you know, when, earlier, I used the example maternal aggression. That's one adaptive form of aggression. It also can be pathologic aggression, meaning it can harm ourselves or others. So keep this in mind as we go forward because later, we're gonna talk about specific tools Designed to modulate or prevent aggression in, for instance, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and especially kids with ADHD.[0:23:37] Andrew Huberman: In the meantime, let's return to the VMH, this relatively small collection of neurons. And the reason I say relatively small is, well, your brain has Many hundreds of billions of neurons, maybe even trillions of neurons. The exact number of neurons isn't really clear, but it's a lot. And it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons, this 3,000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus that can evoke this aggressive response. Experiments done by David Anderson's lab at Caltech were really the first to parse the fine circuitry and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior.[0:24:17] Andrew Huberman: These are important experiments, and they're worth knowing about. What they did was They identified, first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus was in the mouse. That was pretty straightforward to do, sort of known before they start these experiments. And then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA, which, of course, becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein, Which DNA, and therefore, which proteins, are expressed in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus? And it turns out that there's a particular category of neurons in the ventral medial hypothalamus that make an estrogen receptor.[0:24:57] Andrew Huberman: And it is those neurons in particular that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior. How did they know Well, they used a tool that's actually been described by a previous guest of this podcast. We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine, Carl Deisseroth. He and others have developed tools that allow people to control the activity of neurons essentially by remote control, by shining light on those neurons. So in the context of an experiment on a mouse, which is what David's lab did, and these were the beautiful experiments of Daiyu Lin, who's now in her own laboratory at New York University, Put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain of the hypo into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse.[0:25:39] Andrew Huberman: The mouse is able to move around in its cage, Freely moving. Even though it has a little tether, this little wire, it's a very thin wire. And that little thin wire is actually a little what we call optrode. And the experimentalist, in this case, Dayu, Was able to stimulate the turning on of a little bit of blue light, and that blue light Activated only those estrogen receptor neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus. And the way she was able to do that is she had introduced a gene that had been developed by our friend, Carl Deisseroth, that allows light to trigger electrical activity in those neurons.[0:26:17] Andrew Huberman: So if any of that is confusing or if all of that is confusing, here's the experiment. There's a mouse in a cage, Has a little wire coming out of its head. It doesn't notice, believe it or not. We know this because it's still eating and mating and doing all the things that mice Like to do on daily basis and sleeping, etcetera. And the mere pressing of a button will activate a little bit of light released at the end of that wire.[0:26:38] Andrew Huberman: That light Activates particular neurons. In this case, it's the estrogen receptor containing neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus. When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse, a couple of things happen depending on what the other mouse is, or we could say who the other mouse is. If it's a male mouse and you put in there with a female mouse, the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse. Provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty, will try to mount and mate with the female mouse.[0:27:07] Andrew Huberman: Now female mice are either in a receptive phase or a nonreceptive phase of their so called estrous cycle. They don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle. They have an estrous cycle. And on particular days of that estrous cycle, they are not happy to mate. They will Basically, keep their hindquarters away from the male mouse at all costs.[0:27:27] Andrew Huberman: They'll even attack the male mouse. On certain days of the estrous cycle, however, the female mouse will undergo what's called lordosis, which is an arching of her back, and she'll allow the male to mount and mate with her. So A large number of experiments were done, but the 1st experiment really was to put the male mouse in with a female mouse who is in the so called receptive phase of estrus, That is she will allow mating, and he starts mating with her. And they go through the standard repertoire of Mating behaviors that you observe in mice, mounting, thrusting, intromission as it's called in the mouse sex world. Well, I guess I don't know what the mice call it, but that's what the experimenters call it.[0:28:08] Andrew Huberman: And then afterwards, he will dismount. Okay? So So they observe this kind of mounting and and sex behavior. It's very typical. But about halfway through the behavior, Daoyu turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor contained neurons only in the male mouse, and what she observed was incredibly dramatic.[0:28:30] Andrew Huberman: The male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries to kill the female mouse. He starts attacking her. Then she turns off the light, the male stops, and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse. So I'm sure all of this was very confusing and disturbing to the female mouse. Nonetheless, that was the repertoire.[0:28:49] Andrew Huberman: They would mate. She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons. The male mouse would immediately Try and attack and kill the female mouse, and then she would stop the stimulation and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse, return to The attempt, at least, to mate with the female mouse. These are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered only by the activation of only the small set of neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus. And for those of you that think that you can watch this sort of thing without being disturbed, I encourage you to go to YouTube.[0:29:23] Andrew Huberman: We will provide a link, where you can see a video of this type of behavior. It's incredibly dramatic. The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous. It occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds, thousandth of a second. The next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse with this stimulation with light capability in its ventral medial hypothalamus into a cage Alone, but with a rubber glove filled with air or water.[0:29:50] Andrew Huberman: Mouse is walking around sniffing, peeing, which is what male mice seem to do. They seem to urinate everywhere. Essentially, an interesting perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually many male animals, perhaps even humans. We don't know, Or maybe we do know. Basically, this has been observed time and time again in, experiments mainly by Lisa Stowers' lab at the Scripps Institute that's characterized this.[0:30:11] Andrew Huberman: If you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage. Whereas if you put male mice into an arena or a cage, They urinate everywhere. They have this kind of obsession with spraying their urine everywhere. You can, sort of transpose that to human behavior if you like. In any event, Daoyu put the mouse in the cage alone, but with this rubber glove.[0:30:36] Andrew Huberman: The mouse is walking around, urinating, etcetera, Doing whatever it is that mice do, then she stimulates the activation of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons, and the mouse immediately tries To kill the glove. It goes into a rage attacking the glove as if it were another mouse or some other animate object, but, of course, it's an inanimate Object is just a rubber glove. She stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm or at least not attacking. Again, we don't know what the mouse was feeling. So these are very dramatic videos.[0:31:08] Andrew Huberman: Again, you can see them by following the link that we'll provide in the caption. If that sort of thing is going to disturb you by, to see, for instance, the attack, 1 mouse attacking another. Please just don't watch them. I'm not interested in, traumatizing anybody or you traumatizing yourself, that is. A number of different variations were done on this experiment.[0:31:27] Andrew Huberman: For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice As opposed to male mice, putting the female mice in with other female mice or with other male mice, no matter what Variation, one carries out. So it doesn't matter if it's male with female, male with male, female with female, etcetera. Stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes this very dramatic, almost instantaneous Aggressive behavior physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done by Daoyu Lin in her own laboratory And other laboratories have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus is connected with a bunch of other brain areas that are interesting, and I'll talk about some of those in a little bit. But one of them That I wanna call out now is the so called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus.[0:32:17] Andrew Huberman: This is a large structure in the back of the brain that houses things like neurons that can create opioids. We all know of the opioid crisis, but these are neurons that can produce Endogenous means made by the body. Chemicals that can cause pain relief, you could understand why that Might occur in a circuit for aggression. Right? Even if one is the aggressor, it's likely that they may incur some physical damage and they'd want some pain relief.[0:32:45] Andrew Huberman: The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits that eventually through several processing stations Stations, excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws. And in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior. Now aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting because in humans, and especially in human children, biting is something that, While young children might do as a form of aggression tends to disappear pretty early in childhood. And if it doesn't, It's often seen as a mark of pathology. I have a story about this actually.[0:33:22] Andrew Huberman: When I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp. And I I'll never forget this. We were playing soccer and, in a in a rare stroke of luck or accident, happen to score a goal. I wasn't a particularly good soccer player, especially not at that stage in my life. They've later figured out that it was just better to make me a full back because I Could just wait there and do what fullbacks do.[0:33:43] Andrew Huberman: I was better at taking the ball or the person out than I was putting the ball in, the goal. Nonetheless, I, Again, by chance, I scored a goal and I was trotting back to my side of the field. And all of a sudden, I felt this Stinging my back, a kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name. I'm not gonna tell you what his name was. A kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back.[0:34:09] Andrew Huberman: And, this, of course, resulted in a discussion And then a time out and all the usual things and parents, I think, got involved. I don't recall. I didn't think much else of it. But I recall that This was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved me down or something that sort. And it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive behavior is associated with a more primitive Now here, I'm truly anthropomorphizing.[0:34:37] Andrew Huberman: I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time. How could I? And I certainly am not going to say that biting in every case Reflects a pathology, although I think there is general agreement in the psychology community and the psychiatric community that past a certain age, The using of one's teeth to impart aggressive aggression and damage on others is a particularly primitive and troubling or at least for the observer, the Person experiences a pretty disturbing event. Daew's lab has shown that activation of the ventral medial hypothalamus triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray, which then triggers a whole other set of circuits of fixed action patterns. Here we are back to Lorenz again with fixed action patterns, including swinging of the limbs, right, punching.[0:35:24] Andrew Huberman: This wouldn't necessarily be controlled punching, but also biting behavior. So it's remarkable to me, at least, that we have circuits in our brain that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth or violent use of things like our limbs That, of course, could be used for things like singing or kissing or eating or, you know, gesticulating in any kind of polite or impolite way. The point here is that neural circuits, not individual brain areas, evoke the constellation of behaviors that we call aggression. Now many of you are probably puzzled or at least should be because I've been talking about this highly specialized brain area, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and this highly specialized Subcategory of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, these neurons that make estrogen receptor, and yet the activation of those cells Triggers dramatic and immediate aggression both in males and in females, and both against males and against females. So what's going on here?[0:36:24] Andrew Huberman: Most of us think about estrogen, and we don't immediately think of aggression. Most of us Here, testosterone, and we might think about aggression, although other things as well. In order to understand this, I just wanna briefly Refer back to a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, and that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky, of course, is a professor Stanford has studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior as well as estrogen and other hormones and their impacts on behavior. To make a long story short and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth, Testosterone does not increase aggressiveness. Testosterone increases proactivity and the willingness to lean into effort In competitive scenarios.[0:37:13] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis. But to Make a long story short, if people are given testosterone or if you look at people who have different lever Levels, excuse me, of testosterone endogenously that they naturally make, what you'll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in aggressive scenarios. So if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone Will have the tendency to make them more aggressive. If somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic, giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent An altruistic, at least up to a point. Now, of course, there are certain forms of synthetic testosterones that are known in Sports circles and in other circles to increase aggressiveness because of the way those particular forms of synthetic testosterones work.[0:38:07] Andrew Huberman: But in general, most of the experiments that I'm referring to have not been done using those. They've been done using the let's call them the more traditional Biological forms of testosterone or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone. In fact, Robert Sapolsky described a really interesting experiment which, if you look at testosterone levels or you administer additional testosterone to people who are doing philanthropy, giving money To organizations and so they're essentially doing good because these are organizations doing good. What you find is that increased testosterone or Further increasing testosterone makes people more willing to compete to give more money than the other person in the room in order, you know, to put it in Air quotes, to alpha out the other person by giving more money. So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy.[0:38:54] Andrew Huberman: It is not an act of aggression. Of course, we don't know what the people are feeling underneath all that. Again, we can't anthropomorphize or, project onto other people what they're feeling. But the point is that testosterone itself does not make people more aggressive. And in the experiments that we've been talking about up until now, It's actually the activation of estrogen receptor containing neurons that makes these animals more aggressive.[0:39:19] Andrew Huberman: And it turns out there's evidence that In certain context, estrogen can make people more aggressive. So what's going on here? Well, what's going on is that Testosterone can be converted into estrogen through a process called aromatization. There's an enzyme called aromatase. Anytime you have Word that ends in a s e, at least if it's in the context of biology, it's almost always not always, but almost always an enzyme.[0:39:45] Andrew Huberman: So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen, and it is actually testosterone Aromatized, converted into estrogen, and then binding to these estrogen containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression. I wanna repeat that. It is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression. It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that. Now this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain is very robust, so much so That if you take a mouse that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme, and they do exist, Then there is a reduction in overall aggression despite high levels of testosterone.[0:40:43] Andrew Huberman: And if people who Or mice who have the aromatase enzyme, have that enzyme blocked, well, then it doesn't matter How much you increase testosterone or any of its other derivatives, you do not observe this aggression. So This runs counter to everything that we know and think about the role of testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness. It can increase the desire to work under challenge. I've said it before, and I ran this or pressure tested this, Against Robert Sapolsky who's been working on testosterone and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now, it is fair to say that Testosterone has the net effect of making effort feel good or at least increasing the threshold at which Effort feels bad or unsustainable, and it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold For activation of brain structures like the amygdala and other brain structures associated with anxiety.[0:41:42] Andrew Huberman: So the next time somebody says testosterone makes people aggressive, you can say, no. Actually, it's estrogen that makes people aggressive and animals aggressive for that matter. Now, of course, it is the case that because Males have relatively less estrogen circulating in their brain and body than females, right, because they have testes not ovaries, That testosterone is required in the 1st place in order to be converted into estrogen to activate this aggressive circuit involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus. But, nonetheless, it is estrogen That is the final step. It is the hormone on which aggression hinges.[0:42:27] Andrew Huberman: And I think for most people, that's a Quite surprising finding. And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature as it relates to Hormones and psychological states and behavior. Now, of course, it is the case that if testosterone is low, that a person or an animal will exhibit Less aggressive behavior. But that's not because of reduced testosterone per se, it's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone. Meaning, if there's no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower.[0:43:00] Andrew Huberman: So we've established that it's not testosterone, But testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression. But, nonetheless, it's Still surprising. Right? I mean, most of us don't think about estrogen as the hormone that stimulates aggression, but turns out all contextual. There are beautiful data showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression can modulated by whether or not days are short or days are long.[0:43:31] Andrew Huberman: In other words, whether or not there's a lot of sunshine or not. Now, Obviously, brain is encased in skull, so it doesn't really know if there's a lot of sunshine out there. Even though you can see the sun with your eyes, you can it on your skin. Day length is converted into hormonal signals and chemical signals, and the primary hormonal and chemical signals involve Melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones. So to make a very long story short, in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight, Both in our eyes and on our skin, melatonin levels are reduced.[0:44:05] Andrew Huberman: Melatonin is a hormone that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence. Also tends to activate pathways that tend to reduce, things like breeding and sexual behavior. In long days, dopamine is increased. Dopamine is a molecule associated with feelings of well-being and motivation and the desire to seek out all sorts of things, all sorts of motivated behaviors. And in long days, Provided we're getting enough sunlight on our skin and to our eyes, the stress hormones, especially cortisol And some of the other stress hormones are reduced in levels.[0:44:42] Andrew Huberman: If estrogen levels are increased experimentally Under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression. However, in short days, if estrogen is increased, There's a heightened predisposition for aggression, and that makes perfect sense if you think about what Short days due to the biology of your brain and body. In short days, the melatonin signal goes up. There's more melatonin circulating for more of each 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones are circulating more.[0:45:13] Andrew Huberman: Why? Short days tend to be associated with winter. In winter, We are bombarded with more bacteria and viruses because bacteria and viruses actually survive better in cold than they do in heat. In fact, in my laboratory, we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria. And when we wanna keep them alive, we put them in the freezer.[0:45:30] Andrew Huberman: If we wanna kill them, if we wanna inoculate them, we put them under UV light like you would see from the sunlight. So shorter days are conducive to aggression, not because days are short per se, but because stress hormone levels are higher and because dopamine levels are lower. Now here's where all this starts to converge on a very clear biological picture, a very clear psychological picture, Under conditions where cortisol is high, where the stress hormone is elevated. And under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin is reduced, there is a greater propensity For estrogen to trigger aggression. Now, again, I know I've said it before, but For males who make a lot of testosterone relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind this idea that if testosterone is high, That means that estrogen is low because while that can be true in the periphery in the body, if testosterone is high, there is going to be some aromatization, that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.[0:46:37] Andrew Huberman: So anytime you hear that testosterone is high, you should think testosterone is high in the body and perhaps estrogen is low in the body, but that means that there's going to be Heightened levels of estrogen in the brain and, therefore, increased propensity for aggression. In females who generally make less Testosterone relative to estrogen. There is sufficient estrogen already present to trigger aggression. So Both males and females are primed for aggression, but that's riding on a context. And that context of whether or not you get A tendency for aggression or not depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low.[0:47:16] Andrew Huberman: And I'm telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher In any individual, there's going to be a tilt, an increase in that hydraulic pressure that Lorenz talked about toward aggression. And if serotonin, the neuromodulator that is associated with feelings of well-being and sometimes even of slight passivity, but certainly of well-being. If serotonin is low, there's also gonna be a further shift towards an aggressive tendency. So if we return to Lorenza's hydraulic pressure model of aggression and other internal states, we realize that External stimuli, things that we hear, things that we see. For instance, someone saying something upsetting or us seeing somebody do something that we don't like To others or to us, as well as our internal state, our subjective feelings of well-being, but also our stress level, Our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources and are content with what we have, all of that is converging on this thing that we call internal state and creating this pressure of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive.[0:48:23] Andrew Huberman: And now we have some major players feeding into that final pathway, That question of whether or not will we hit the other person? Will we say the thing that is considered aggressive? Will we not say it? If somebody says something or does something aggressive to us, will we respond, or will we be submissive or even passive? Again, There are many things funneling into that question and dictating whether or not the answer is absolutely, I'll fight back, or I'm gonna attack them even unprovoked, Or if they say this, I'm gonna do that, or no matter what they do, I'm not going to respond.[0:48:57] Andrew Huberman: These kinds of things are very complex, and yet we really can boil them down to just Few common elements. And I'm telling you that those elements are whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower or relatively higher. Again, relatively higher is going to tend to make people more reactive. Why? Because reactivity is really a function of the autonomic nervous system, which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates between the so called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which tends to put us into a state of readiness through the release of adrenaline.[0:49:28] Andrew Huberman: Cortisol and adrenaline, when they're circulating in the brain and body, make us more likely to move and to react and to speak. It's actually what will Induce a kind of low level tremor, which is an anticipatory tremor to be able to move more quickly. Right? A body in motion is more easily Set into further motion, that is. And the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator that, In general, is associated with feelings of well-being in response to what we already have.[0:49:56] Andrew Huberman: So when we are well fed, Serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body, in particular, well fed with carbohydrates. The precursor to serotonin is tryptophan. And indeed, there are nice studies exploring the types of diets, nutritional programs that can Reduce aggressive behavior both in children and in adults and tryptophan rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan. So for tryptophan rich diets, things like white turkey meat, but then there are also a number of carbohydrates you can look up. It's very easy to find Foods that contain lots of tryptophan, those foods contain the precursor to serotonin.[0:50:34] Andrew Huberman: Now it isn't simply the case that Eating more foods with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression. I suppose it could do that if you ate it in abundance. It could make you tired, and then you're less likely to be aggressive. I don't recommend that strategy. But the idea here is that when it's been explored, Increasing levels of tryptophan either by supplementation or by food or drugs prescription drugs that increase serotonin.[0:50:59] Andrew Huberman: So for instance, Fluoxetine, sometimes called Prozac or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs, tend to reduce aggressive behavior. Now not always, But in general, that's the case. Similarly, because elevated cortisol tends to shift the whole system again, create more of a hydraulic pressure towards Aggressive states. If cortisol levels are reduced, well then, the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced. This is supported by a number of peer reviewed Studies.[0:51:24] Andrew Huberman: We'll provide links to some of those in the caption show notes. We're gonna return to these, a bit later in the context of specific studies that have looked at Genetic variants in different individuals that cause them to make more or less serotonin or at least to metabolize serotonin differently. This is also the case for so called intermittent explosive disorder that can often be associated with gene variants that control how much serotonin is made or how it's metabolized or how much cortisol is made and how much it's metabolized. In thinking about tools, there are a number of things that one could consider. First of all, there are a number of decent studies exploring how Supplementation with the omega 3 fatty acids, which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems, Including serotonin that can modulate, not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone, Supplementation with the omega threes has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain context, in things like ADHD or in individuals who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking.[0:52:32] Andrew Huberman: Now that doesn't necessarily mean that the omega 3 fatty acids or going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus and changing the activity of neurons there. More likely, they are causing or modulating an overall shift in mood through the immune system, through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone or the propensity For neurons in the ventral medial hypothalamus to be activated, how much omega 3 fatty acid? What source? We've talked about this on the podcast before. You can, of course, get omega 3 fatty acids from a number of different foods.[0:53:04] Andrew Huberman: Getting them from whole foods is probably the best way to do it. But many people, including people with Depression will often supplement with 1 gram or more of omega 3 fatty acids per day. Some people, including myself, will take them every day As just a general mood enhancer, I don't suffer from depression, but I've found it to be beneficial, for my health. And so some people do that, and I've talked about before how double blind placebo controlled studies, people taking 1 to 3 grams of omega 3 fatty acid per day, typically in the form of a high quality fish oil, although there are other other sources as well, algae and so forth, Can experience improvements in mood that are on par with some of the SSRIs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Of course, if you're prescribed an SSRI by your psychiatrist or other doctor, please do take that and don't cease to take it.[0:53:50] Andrew Huberman: Just simply to take omega threes. However, you might mention to them, And you can find links to the studies in our previous episodes on depression that supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids up At this 1 gram or more of EPA specifically, so getting above that 1 gram threshold as high as 3 grams per day Of the EPA has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs and still keep their mood in a place that's beneficial for them. And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range that's healthy and doesn't bias someone toward high levels of aggression and irritability, That's, again, going to be set by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues. And I've talked about some of those on the podcast, but I'll just briefly recap them now. Obviously, getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes throughout the day is going to be important.[0:54:44] Andrew Huberman: Again, Because of this effect of estrogen in long days, not increasing aggression. However, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression because of the increasing cortisol observed in short days. Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed in our episode on heat and the use of sauna And heat, but also hot baths. It turns out that hot baths and sauna can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol. All the details on that are included in the episode on heat.[0:55:12] Andrew Huberman: Time stamped, so you can go directly to that if you wanna learn about the temperatures and the various durations. But to just give a, synopsis of that, a 20 minute Sauna at anywhere from 80 to a 100 degrees Celsius is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol. If you don't have access to a sauna, you could do a hot bath, adjust the temperature so you don't burn yourself. I think, you know, 80 to a 100 degrees Celsius is gonna be too hot for many people if it's a hot bath, Whereas many people who can't tolerate the hot bath can tolerate the sauna, so safety first always and, of course. But hot baths Reduce cortisol.[0:55:49] Andrew Huberman: Hot saunas reduce cortisol of a duration about 20 or 30 minutes is gonna be beneficial. And, of course, of you may be interested in exploring the supplementation route. And for reductions in cortisol, really, the, chief player there is ashwagandha, which is Known to decrease cortisol fairly potently, I should just warn you that if you're going to use ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol, first of all, check with your doctor or health care provider Before adding or subtracting anything from your supplementation or health regimen, of course, I don't just say that to protect us. I say that to protect you. You are responsible For your health, what you take and what you don't take.[0:56:25] Andrew Huberman: Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha can have some not so great effects of Disruption of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways. So the limit seems to be about 2 weeks of of regular use before you'd wanna take a break of about 2 weeks. So ashwagandha, again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol but with some other effects as well. Don't use it chronically for longer than 2 weeks. But if your goal is to reduce cortisol, let's say you're going through a period of increased irritability and aggressive tendency, Maybe you're also not getting as much light as you would like, and perhaps also if there are other, circumstantial things leading you towards more aggressiveness and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, That can be potentially helpful.[0:57:05] Andrew Huberman: And in light of all this stuff about cortisol and estrogen and day length, I should mention that There are, in fact, some people who have a genetic predisposition to be more irritable and aggressive, and there are Couple of different gene pathways associated with this. We never like to think about just 1 gene causing a specific behavior. The way to think about genes is that genes generally code for things within our biology. In the context of today's discussion, things like neural circuits Or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made or the amounts of hormones that are made or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors or enzymes, etcetera, that shift the activity of our biology in a particular direction. They bias our biology.[0:57:51] Andrew Huberman: And in fact, there is A genetic variant present in certain people that adjust their estrogen receptor sensitivity, And that estrogen receptor sensitivity can result in increased levels of aggression, sometimes dramatic increases. However, and also very interestingly, photoperiod, meaning day length, is a strong modulator of whether or not that aggressiveness turns Up or not. Whether or not that person with the particular gene variant is more aggressive or not depends on How long the day is and how long the night is. One particular study that I like that references this is Trainor et al. The Title of the study is photoperiod reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression via genomic and nongenomic pathways.[0:58:41] Andrew Huberman: This was a Paper published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We'll put a reference to this, in the show notes if you'd like to explore it further. But it really points to the fact that rarely, Sometimes, but rarely is it the case that just 1 gene will cause somebody to be hyperaggressive. Almost always, there is going to be an interplay between genetics and environment. And as environment changes, such as day length changes and the length of night changes, So too will the tendency for people with a get given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not.[0:59:14] Andrew Huberman: Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing for this Particular estrogen receptor variant, most people, I'm guessing you, are probably not walking around knowing that you have this gene or not. Regardless, I think it's important to pay attention to how you feel at different times of year depending on it's summer, whether or not it's winter, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight exposure to your skin or not, whether or not you're indoors all the time. Generally, those things correlate with season, but not always. You can go through long bouts of, you know, hard work in the summer months when days are long, but you're indoors a lot and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure late in the evening, and perhaps that's when you're feeling more aggressive. So we have to be careful about drawing a one to 1 relationship between any biological feature and Certainly, psychological or behavioral feature like aggressiveness, but it's, I believe, helpful to know that these genetic biases exist, How they play out?[1:00:11] Andrew Huberman: Again, they shift our biology in in a general thematic direction. They don't change one thing. They a variety of things that bias us toward or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes and the various things that we can do in order to offset them. And we described those earlier in terms of trying to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight regardless of time of year and regardless of whether or not you happen to have particular genetic variant. So earlier, I talked about how it is testosterone converted into estrogen that's activating aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself.[1:00:45] Andrew Huberman: However, there are some studies carried out in humans that have evaluated the effects of testosterone and how Levels of testosterone correlate with aggressiveness in the short term. Just gonna detail a few of those studies because I think they are Interesting and important. First of all, there is a study that has explored levels of testosterone in men of different professions. Now before I tell you the data, I want to be very clear here. With a study such as this, one never knows whether or not These men went into a particular profession because they had a testosterone level of a given value or whether or not the work itself Altered their testosterone levels or both?[1:01:30] Andrew Huberman: And I think it's fair to assume that it's probably both. So be very careful in assuming that a given testosterone level is causal for choosing a particular career or that a particular career is causal for Creating a particular testosterone level. This study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure which, To be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone. Typically, blood draw would be the best way to measure testosterone. But, nonetheless, Provided the appropriate methods are used, salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure of testosterone.[1:02:05] Andrew Huberman: The Different occupations that were looked at were and here, they just looked at men in this particular study, were ministers, Salesmen, they didn't say what particular types of salesman, firemen, professors of all things, physicians, and NFL players. And What they discovered was that the testosterone levels were essentially in that order from low to highest. So minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL player. Now we could microdissect all the different stereotypes and all the different features of each of these jobs. For instance, we don't know whether or not the fact that the firemen happened, at least in this study, to have lower testosterone levels on average Then the professors or the physicians was because firemen have lower testosterone levels or because they have a much more stressful job and their cortisol levels are higher than The professor, the physician, and cortisol and testosterone, not always, but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push pull, mode because they derive from the same precursor, etcetera.[1:03:09] Andrew Huberman: Typically, when when cortisol is high, testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa. So we don't know what's causing these effects. And, again, this is just 1 study and just 6 occupations, but I think it's relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of Competitiveness. Right? So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that's required, but also level of competitiveness because it's known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone, In particular, in the winners of competitive interactions, a topic for a future podcast.[1:03:45] Andrew Huberman: Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed, Also, again, salivary testosterone in prisoners, in this case, female prisoners, so these are incarcerated individuals, have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a nonviolent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison, and Higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent as opposed to a nonviolent crime. Likewise, when they analyze prison rule violations, so an indirect measure of aggressiveness, but in this case, it was Strongly associated with aggressiveness because they knew what the violations were. They found were for prisoners that had none, no prison violations, Prison rule violations, I should say, their testosterone levels tended to be lower than the testosterone levels of Women that had some, even 1, were more aggressive violations of prison rules. We'll provide Links to these, studies in the show notes if you'd like to go into them further. Obviously, studies like this need to be taken with a grain of salt because there are many different factors, different prisons have different, degrees of, you know, violence to begin with and competitiveness to begin with.[1:05:05] Andrew Huberman: But just as a final pass at examining the role between testosterone and aggressiveness, there was a very interesting study from Gotz G o e t z, published in 2014 that looked at serum, so in this case, blood levels of testosterone, 30 minutes after application of a gel based testosterone that goes transdermal so that the testosterone can go very quickly into the bloodstream, And then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity of neurons in the so called cortical medial Amygdala. The cordial me the medial amygdala is one of the areas of the amygdala complex as we call it because it's complex. It's got a lot of different nuclei, you know, know what nuclei are, little clusters of neurons. It's got a lot of different ones, but that medial and that corticomedial amygdala in particular Is known to be associated with aggressive type behaviors. It's linked up with as part of the larger circuit that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus and other brain areas that we refer to earlier such as the PAG.[1:06:06] Andrew Huberman: What what is remarkable about this study is that it showed that just 30 minutes After application of this so called andro gel, this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream, there was a significant increase in, of course, testosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation. So testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects On the pathways related to aggression, and I think this is something that's not often discussed because many of the effects of steroid hormones Like testosterone and estrogen are very slow acting. In fact, steroid hormones, because they have a certain biochemical composition, can actually pass through the membranes of cells, the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell and change gene expression in the cell. You think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer and then comes back looking completely different, Well, that's because of a lot of genes got turned on by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen. But the steroid hormones can also have very fast acting effects.[1:07:05] Andrew Huberman: And with testosterone in particular, those can be remarkably fast acting, and one of the most apparent and well documented fast acting effects is this effect, the ability to activate cells within the amygdala. So you might say, well, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear. Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No. Turns out that the amygdala harbors both Cortisol, corticosterone receptors, and testosterone receptors, and they each adjust the activity in the amygdala differently Such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry for inducing states of mind and body that are more action based.[1:07:41] Andrew Huberman: And indeed, in animals and in humans, testosterone application and activation of this corticomedial amygdala pathway will make Animals and humans lean into effort. This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good or at least biases the organism toward leaning into challenge. So if you recall, there's not just one type of aggression. There's reactive aggression, which is triggered when one is confronted with something that Sometimes it's inevitable. Right?[1:08:06] Andrew Huberman: One needs to fight for their life or for somebody else's life, but also proactive aggression. And proactive aggression involves activation of those go pathways in the basal ganglia and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state one happens to be in to begin with. And so this is very important because it points to the fact that, yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways that are in the ventral medial hypothalamus, But it's very likely the case that testosterone is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body Toward those that will lead to aggression. Again, aggression is not like a switch on and off. It's a process.[1:08:44] Andrew Huberman: It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Remember that hydraulic pressure that Konrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure toward an aggressive episode and then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus. So if somebody tells you that testosterone, endogenous or exogenous, makes people aggressive, tell them no. Testosterone tends to Make people lean into effort.[1:09:13] Andrew Huberman: And if that effort involves being aggressive, either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive, Well then, it will indeed lead to aggression, but the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen, not Testosterone. Now thus far, we really haven't talked too much about the social context in which aggression occurs, and that's because there is a near infinite, if not Infinite number of variables that will determine that. So for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate at a Professional boxing match provided it's occurring inside the ring and only between the competitors and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, etcetera. However, there are some things that tend to bias certain social context toward being more aggressive or less aggressive and not always physical aggression. And those generally come in 2 forms that many of you are familiar with, which are Alcohol and caffeine.[1:10:12] Andrew Huberman: Let's discuss caffeine first. Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity? Well, the general effects of caffeine are to increase autonomic arousal. The activity of the so called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is To put it very much in plain language, it's the alertness arm of your nervous system. That is it creates a sense of readiness in your brain and body, and it does so by activating the so called sympathetic chain ganglia.[1:10:41] Andrew Huberman: Again, as I always remind people, simpa and sympathetic does not mean Sympathy, simpa means together or all at once, and caffeine tends to bias our brain and body to Activate the sympathetic chain ganglia, which run from about the base of your neck until the top of your pelvis, and deploy a bunch of chemicals that jut out into the rest of your body, Activate adrenaline release. There's a parallel increase in of adrenaline in your brain, creating the state of alertness and readiness. That state of alertness and readiness can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression. However, when we are in a state Of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert, such as after drinking caffeine, we will bias All those brain and body systems, their hormones, the chemicals, etcetera, that exist toward action as opposed to inaction. So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity.[1:11:38] Andrew Huberman: No surprise there. On the opposite end of things, alcohol tends to Decrease activity in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system tends to make us feel less alert. Now initially, it can create a state of alertness of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain, our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular has what's called top down inhibition. It exerts a Inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus such as the ventromedial hypothalamus. The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior and to engage the no go pathways telling you don't say that Mean thing, don't do that violent thing, etcetera.[1:12:20] Andrew Huberman: Alcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition, Not just in that forebrain circuit, but in other circuits tend to make us more active. We tend to talk more than we normally would, move more than we normally would, But very shortly thereafter, starts acting as a sedative by way of reducing activity in the forebrain, Releasing some of the deeper brain circuits that are involved in impulsivity, but also causing a somewhat set of effect. And then, of course, as alcohol levels increase Even further, people eventually will pass out blackout, etcetera. So what we've got with alcohol and caffeine is we've got Two opposite ends of the spectrum, caffeine increasing arousal and readiness and the tendency for impulsivity, and alcohol also increasing Impulsivity, but through a different mechanism. A really interesting study, I should just mention that the title of the study is caffeinated and non caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression and the impact of self regulation.[1:13:23] Andrew Huberman: So the title is almost self Explantory. This is a papers published in the Journal of Addictive Behavior in 2016 examining how ingestion of Alcohol that's either caffeinated or noncaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted what they call indirect aggression. And just to remind you what indirect aggression is, these are not Physical acts of aggression, these are verbal acts of aggression. So embarrassing others or otherwise somehow Trying to reduce the well-being of others by saying certain things, in particular, in groups. This study examined both males and females.[1:13:58] Andrew Huberman: This was done on, by way of a college campus study. Subjects were 18 to 47 years old. I guess there's some older students on that campus or maybe they use some non students. But, you know, these days, you've also got some students that are in their, thirties and forties, so they have a fairly broad, swath of subjects included, fairly broad racial background as well, included not at equal numbers, but, at least they included a pretty broad spectrum of people with different backgrounds. They looked, In particular, people that ingested non caffeinated alcohol drinks at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week.[1:14:32] Andrew Huberman: K. Again, it's a college campus, not that I encourage that. I'm one of these people that I don't I've never really liked drugs or alcohol, and since we're fortunate in that way, I can Drink or not drink and tend to not drink. But so to me, 9.8 drink 1 8 drinks per week sounds like a lot, but I know for some people that that might actually be typical. And then others who were drinking at least 1 caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week, and those individuals, and as high, I should say, as 7.87 califinated alcohol beverages per week.[1:15:04] Andrew Huberman: So this would be energy drinks combined typically with Art alcohol, it's fairly, commonly available in in bars and and so forth. And some individuals drank as much as, goodness, 20.36 Alcoholic drinks per week total, some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated. The basic outcome of this study was that The more alcohol someone tended to consume, the more likely it was that they would engage in these indirect aggressive type behaviors. In terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, the effect was especially interesting. Here, I'm just going to paraphrase or I'll actually read from the study.[1:15:39] Andrew Huberman: Quote, with regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, our findings indicated that heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use Was associated positively with indirect aggression even after considering one's typical alcohol use and dispositional aggression. What this means is that Even though alcohol can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive and even though certain individuals already have a disposition toward being more aggressive, there was An effect that was independent, meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition, meaning if Someone was consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages. They had a particularly high likelihood of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior. Now this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose, which is this self regulation model that that basically, self regulation involves several things. It involves Engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behaviors.[1:16:33] Andrew Huberman: So as described before, because alcohol tends to have A sedative, suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system, at least after the initial period, it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood that People will engage in any type of behavior, whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that someone will engage in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise. So the combination of caffeine and alcohol is really acting as a 2 pronged system to bias people towards more Impulsivity, that is less self regulation. So it's really yanking your, volitional control, your ability to engage in prefrontal top down inhibition over your hypothalamus from 2 distinct and specific circuits. By now, you should be getting the impression that self regulation is a key feature of whether or not somebody, maybe even you, is going to engage in aggressive speech or aggressive behavior. And we've talked about a number of tools that one can use to reduce the probability that that will happen.[1:17:34] Andrew Huberman: I suppose if The context were appropriate. You could even take those 2 recommendations and just invert them and increase the likelihood that aggressiveness would happen. But regardless, self regulation is key. And in light of that, I want to share with you a study that's focused on kids, but that has Important ramifications for adults as well. As you probably are already aware, there are many kids out there that suffer from so called Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.[1:18:05] Andrew Huberman: There are also many adults we are finding that are suffering from ADHD. And there is also an epidemic, I would say, of people that are concerned about whether or not they have ADHD. Now whether or not they have true clinical ADHD or not is not Clear, we did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD. I would encourage you to check out that episode and some of the diagnostic criteria. If you have the opportunity, you can find that at hubermanlab.com.[1:18:30] Andrew Huberman: As this study I'm about to share with you Aptly points out, there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD. There's no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD. Whether or not one has ADHD Depends on their performance on a number of different cognitive tests and behavioral tests and self report. In any event, The study I'm about to share with you explored how a particular pattern of supplementation in kids with ADHD was able to reduce Aggressive episodes and impulsivity and increased self regulation. And the title of the study is efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[1:19:10] Andrew Huberman: Even though they put carnitine in the title, that what they focused on was whether or not Acetyl L Carnitine supplementation could Somehow adjust the behavioral tendency of these kids with ADHD. And to make a long story short, indeed, it did. There was a very significant effect of Acetyl Cignitine supplementation on improving some of the symptomology symptomology, excuse me, of ADHD. A few details about this study that might be relevant to you, This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled double crossover study. This was done as an outpatient study, so the kids weren't in a hospital.[1:19:44] Andrew Huberman: They were living out in the world. This, again, was done on younger kids. So this was 6 to 6 to 13 year old kids that were diagnosed with ADHD. They received either Acetyl L Carnitine or placebo, and they did all the good practice Stuff that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo and the acetylol carnitine had similar look and taste. It was consumed twice daily after meals.[1:20:11] Andrew Huberman: I just mention that CLL Carnitine typically is taken in capsule form, or occasionally in injectable form here. They they were using this as a drink, which essentially same as capsule form, but the powder is just going directly into liquid. And the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram, so they're doing According to the body weight of these kids, with a maximum dosage of 4 grams per day, the quantity of the medication was supplied here. Reading for a period of 8 weeks, and every 8 weeks, a new quantity of medication was supplied. So, basically, this is a fairly long term study, Exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes in week 8, 16, and 24.[1:20:50] Andrew Huberman: They also looked at Blood things that you could only get through a blood draw, so things like hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etcetera. They these are kids, and and even if it were adults, they would they were quite appropriately examining a lot of the physiological measures that one would want to carry out to make sure, first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing, and indeed they that, but also that no, negative effects are showing up in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids. So first, I'll just Tell you the basic outcome of the study, which was here I'm paraphrasing. Given twice daily, Carnitine appeared to be effective and well tolerated treatment for a group of children with ADHD. They showed significant The abnormal behavior compared to these other boys, and now I'm moving to the table of results.[1:21:35] Andrew Huberman: They showed significant reductions in Their so called total problem score, the total problem score is a well established measure of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD, and I should say adults with ADHD has to do with challenges in social and learning environments and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform, Reductions in attentional problems overall, reductions in delinquency, and most important for sake of today's discussion, significant reductions in aggressive behavior. Now what's especially nice about this study, I think, is that even though it's a relatively small number of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated in Other studies in other laboratories that they were able to confirm the shifts in L Carnitine Within the bloodstream of these kids, that is they were able to correlate the physiology with the psychological changes. You know, in studies like this and, Frankly, in all studies of human pharmacology, you have to worry about effects that show up not just because of placebo effects, but because of called off target effects or related things totally independent of the drug or the particular supplement that you happen to be looking at. To put in the words of, a great neuroscientist.[1:22:46] Andrew Huberman: Unfortunately, he passed away, some years ago, but he was a member of the National Academy, extremely accomplished neuroscientist, once turned to me and Never forget, a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a human being creates a paper. Meaning, you can See effects of pretty much any drug or any supplement in most all conditions. However, it is in cases such as this study where you can Quite convincingly see that the particular feature of physiology that you expected to change actually changed, and you see Logical outcome that you can gain much greater confidence that the changes in delinquency, in this case, reduced delinquency, improved attention, reduced aggressiveness, and forth was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology and levels of L Carnitine or Acetyl L Carnitine and Carnitine In the bloodstream of these children as opposed to something else like L carnitine going and affecting some downstream target that you have no knowledge Now, of course, that's still entirely possible, but I think studies such as these increase our confidence that things like L Carnitine Can be used perhaps in concert with things like omega 3 supplementation, diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan and therefore, more Serotonin, obviously, avoiding things like alcohol.[1:24:08] Andrew Huberman: And as it appears from the study I just described, reducing one's intake or not Consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages seems like it would be a good idea if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, to think about the hormone context and Whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone and estrogen or lower testosterone and estrogen. Maybe even think about the work environment, whether or not you are Existing in a particularly competitive work environment and even day length, time of year, and whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, whether or not you're avoiding light in the evening and so on. So studies such as this, I think, are useful because they point to the fact that Very seldom, if ever, will there be 1 supplement or 1 nutritional change or even 1 behavioral change that's going to completely shift an individual From being aggressive and impulsive, but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens, by paying attention to things like Time of year and work conditions and school conditions and overall levels of stress and likely, therefore, levels of cortisol, etcetera, that you can use Behaviors, diet, and supplementation as a way to shift that overall internal milieu from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure as it's been called throughout the episode toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies.[1:25:31] Andrew Huberman: So once again and frankly as always, we've done a deep dive into the neurobiology and the psychology of of what I believe to be an important feature of our lives, in this case, aggression. Wanna point out that in a episode in the not too distant future, I'm going to be hosting Doctor professor David Anderson from Caltech University who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression. In fact, he is the Senior author on many of the studies related to the ventromedial hypothalamus that I discussed today. Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course. So hearing today's episode will help you digest that information, but we are also going to talk about other emotional states.[1:26:12] Andrew Huberman: He is an expert not just in aggression, But in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds, and how those relate not just to biology and but also certain forms of pathology, things like PTSD and the relationship, for instance, between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression, and many other important topics that I know many of you, if not all of you, will be interested in. In the meantime, I wanna point you to his recently released and wonderful book Entitled The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us, and, again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech. This is a wonderful book. It serves as a tremendous introduction to the history of the study of these areas, the current science, and discoveries being made in these Is all made accessible to the scientists and nonscientists alike. It's a a very engaging read.[1:27:05] Andrew Huberman: And So much so that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy to give to somebody who, is a therapist, and I've purchased another copy To give to a high school kid that, I mentor because he's very interested in the neuroscience of emotions, and I think we are all interested in emotions, Not just fear and some of these negative states, not just aggression, but also the positive emotions of our lives. And so The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us by David Anderson is a wonderful read. I can't recommend it highly enough.

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving the transition time and the quality of your sleep, and improving alertness and focus and so on. Anytime you're considering taking supplements, there are several key considerations. First of all, those Supplements should be of the very highest quality, and you want to make sure that what's listed on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle, which is a problem for many supplement companies out there, the Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements Because we believe Momenta supplements to be of the very highest quality of any supplements out there, and we've been working very closely with them in order to direct them to create that are individual ingredient supplements of the particular quality and sources that we would like to see and that relate to the science and studies covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. If you'd like to see some of those supplements, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.[1:29:22] Andrew Huberman: And there, you will see some of the supplements that we've talked about on this podcast before such as Magnesium Threonate for augmenting sleep, things like L Tyrosine for augmenting dopamine, and things like L Carnitine, which we've discussed on today's podcast. Right now, the list of supplements and the products that are there is only partial to what will soon be included in the future, so that's Ever expanding catalog of, again, what we believe to be the very highest quality supplements available to you. For those of you that are interested behavioral, nutritional, and supplementation based tools for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology Impact your health and performance, we have a newsletter.
