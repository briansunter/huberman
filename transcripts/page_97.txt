I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Nolan Williams. Doctor Williams is a medical doctor and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. His laboratory and clinic focus on depression and other mood disorders.[0:00:28] Andrew Huberman: They focus specifically on the use of transcranial magnetic Stimulation, which is a brain stimulation technique that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits as well as circuits within the body in order to treat depression and Other mood disorders. Other laboratories and clinics use TMS. What sets apart the work of Nolan Williams and colleagues is that they combine TMS with other treatments, And some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge that you've probably heard about these days, including Ibogaine, Psilocybin, MDMA, Cannabis, DMT, and other drugs that at this point in time are experimental in terms of clinical trials, but that at least the preliminary data show Hold great promise for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. In the course of my discussion with doctor Williams, we covered things such as the history Of each of these drugs, how they came to be, and their current status in terms of their clinical use and legality. We also talk about their safety profiles both in children and in adults.[0:01:28] Andrew Huberman: And we talk about what the future of psychedelic research and clinical use really looks like. For instance, we discuss how a number of laboratories Clinics are modifying psychedelics to remove some of their hallucinogenic properties while maintaining some of their antidepressant or anti trauma properties. You'll also learn about some fascinating research in doctor William's laboratory focus on Ketamine, which is a drug that is increasingly being used to Treat depression. And contrary to common belief, the effects of Ketamine in terms of relieving depression may not actually arise from its dissociative effects. One thing that you'll find extraordinary about doctor Williams is that not only does he have vast knowledge of the various treatments for depression, but that he and his laboratory are really combining these treatments in the most potent way.[0:02:13] Andrew Huberman: That is combining psychedelic treatments with brain machine interface or combining brain machine interface with Particular learning protocols, that is neuroplasticity protocols, which can directly change the brain in specific ways. So today, you're gonna learn tremendous amount about the neural circuitry underlying depression as well as positive moods. You'll also learn about all the various drugs that and you're really going to learn about the current status and future of the treatment of mood disorders. Today, you'll also learn about a number of ongoing studies in doctor Williams' laboratory. I should mention that they are recruiting subjects for these studies.[0:02:46] Andrew Huberman: If you go to BSL, which stands for Brain Stimulation Laboratory, so that's bsl.stanford.edu, You have the opportunity to apply for one of these clinical trials for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. I confess that the conversation with doctor Williams was, For me, one of the more stimulating and informative conversations I've ever had about psychedelics, which is simply to say that his breadth and depth of knowledge on that Topic is incredible, and his breadth and depth of knowledge in terms of the underlying brain science and how it can all be combined with clinical applications is also Extraordinary. I'm sure that by the end of today's episode, you're going to come away with a tremendous amount of knowledge about the clinical and nonclinical uses of those substances, and you're going to understand a lot more about how the healthy and diseased brain work. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast has now launched a premium channel. I wanna be very clear that the Huberman Lab Podcast will to be released every Monday at zero cost to consumer, and there will be no change in the format of these podcasts.[0:03:45] Andrew Huberman: The Premium channel is a response to the many questions we get about specific topics, and it will allow me to really drill deep into specific answers related to those topics. So once a month, I'm going to host an ask me anything, so called AMA, where you can ask me anything about specific topics covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast, and I will answer those questions. Those, of course, will be recorded. There will also be other premium content available to premium subscribers such as transcripts and short videos of new tools and unique tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you wanna check out the premium channel, you can go to hubermanlab.com/ Premium, there's a $10 a month charge or $100 per year, and I should mention that a large portion of the proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium Channel We'll go to support scientific research that develops the very sorts of tools that we talk about on the Huberman Lab Podcast.[0:04:34] Andrew Huberman: The rest of the support for the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel will go to supporting the regular Huberman Lab Podcast. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:04:58] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health Can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. One problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests, however, is you get data back About levels of metabolic factors, levels of hormones, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes interpreting your data and knowing what to do about it Exceedingly easy.[0:05:34] Andrew Huberman: They have a personalized platform where you can go and you can see those levels of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, And they point to specific nutritional tools, behavioral tools, supplement based tools, etcetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to Try InsideTracker. You can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.[0:06:02] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover a few months ago, and it is simply incredible. In fact, I don't even like traveling anymore because They don't have 8 Sleep mattress covers in hotels and Airbnbs. One of the reasons I love my 8 Sleep mattress cover so much is that, as you may have heard before on this podcast elsewhere, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, you need your body temperature to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And I tend to run warm at night, which makes it hard to sleep and sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night.[0:06:35] Andrew Huberman: When you sleep on an 8 Sleep mattress cover, you can program the temperature of that mattress cover For specific times in the early, middle, and late part of your night so that the mattress stays cool. And as a consequence, you sleep very, very deeply. It also tracks your Sleep. So it's paying attention to how many times you're moving, how deep your sleep is. It gives you a sleep score.[0:06:53] Andrew Huberman: All wonderful data to help you enhance your sleep. And, of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance, which makes an 8 Sleep a terrific tool for enhancing not just your sleep, but all aspects of your life really. If you're interested in trying the 8 Sleep mattress cover, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman to check out the Pod three cover, and you can save $150 at checkout. 8 Sleep currently ships To the USA, to Canada, the UK, and select countries in the EU and Australia.

Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers Stanford and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty significant challenges in order to be able to see clearly as you move from one area to the next. For instance, when you go from a shady area to a bright area.[0:07:51] Andrew Huberman: ROKA understands this and have designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses accordingly, so you always see with crystal clarity. In addition, because they were initially designed for performance, things like Running and biking, they're extremely lightweight, but they have a terrific aesthetic. So unlike a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses that were designed for sports and make you look like a cyborg. They have styles that make you look like a cyborg if you like those, but they also have styles that you'd be perfectly comfortable wearing to work or out to dinner, etcetera. Really terrific glasses.[0:08:17] Andrew Huberman: I love mine because I can wear them anywhere, and I also use them when running and going out hiking, etcetera. You'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's roka.com and enter the code huberman at checkout. On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements. Supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them.[0:08:45] Andrew Huberman: Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep, or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability, or for enhancing energy, or adjusting hormone levels to optimal range for you. The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous supplements. To find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, livemomentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.[0:09:13] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Nolan Williams. Thanks for joining today. I'm really excited to have this conversation. It's been a long time coming, and I have a lot of questions about different compounds, psychedelics in particular.[0:09:27] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:09:27] Andrew Huberman: But before we get into that discussion, Wanna ask you about depression, broadly speaking. Sure. Intractable depression. How common depression is or isn't? I heard you say in a wonderful talk that you gave that depression is perhaps the most debilitating condition worldwide.[0:09:49] Andrew Huberman: And yet in contrast to other medical conditions like cancer, we actually have a fairly limited number of tools to approach depression, And yet number of tools and the potency of those tools is growing. So if you could educate us on depression, I'd really appreciate it.[0:10:06] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Absolutely. So depression is a a Condition that, it has a lot of a lot of, manifestations. You know? So you can have Kind of a a depression that's primarily loss of interest.[0:10:18] Dr. Nolan Williams: You can have folks who feel very anxious, and they're kind of overactive. You can have people who Don't have any anxiety at all, and they're very underactive when they have low motivation to do anything. You know? So you have this huge range of symptoms that are in that umbrella of depression. And some of our work is to actually work with with folks like Connor Liston and Cornell and try to actually get, biotypes based off of neuroimaging To see if we can kind of parse out the different depression kind of, presentations in the and see that clinically and also see that in the brain.[0:10:51] Dr. Nolan Williams: Depression is, the most disabling condition worldwide. What's interesting about depression is it's both a risk factor, for other illnesses, and it makes other medical and psychiatric illnesses worse. Right? So recently, the American Heart Association Added depression is the 4th, major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Right?[0:11:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: So alongside the the risk factors that we know, hypertension, high blood Pressure, hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol, and, and diabetes, you know, high blood sugar, those 3 Have been on the list for a long time, and depression ends up, you know, being added to the list as the 4th one. And, you know, really interesting. Right? So in addition to Taking medications to address those other 3 risk factors, we really have to be thinking about, how do you treat folks with depression to reduce the risk of having a heart attack in the future. And, you know, there's some of that's being worked on now, but we don't have a complete solution to thinking about that at this time.[0:11:52] Dr. Nolan Williams: And then the other thing that's interesting is once you have a heart attack into the in in the individuals end up having a heart attack, The risk of having depression after the heart attack is higher than the normal population. Right? And so A lot of what we're doing in the lab actually is, is measuring kind of brain heart connections, and we can actually with transcranial magnetic stimulation, a form of brain stimulation, we can decelerate the heart rate. We capture that heart rate deceleration, over the mood regulatory regions, and so actually a direct probe of that connection. So it's it's it's interesting.[0:12:28] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, as you said a 2nd ago, you know, it's a it's a very disabling condition. Moderate depression's about as Disabling is is having a heart attack, acutely having a heart attack. Severe depressions is disabling is having cancer without treatment, You know? And and dying from from a cancer without treatment. And so, you know, it's, it's kind of underappreciated just how disabling Depression is in that way, and I think, important as stigma is consistently kind of being reduced over the years for mental illness, for mental illnesses, then the idea that we can start really putting more funding and putting more focus at the federal level, you know, private foundation level, whatever it is at a given university to to thinking about, developing treatments, we've been very interested in a very particular, clinical set of problems around the the most severe and the most high acuity, settings that, folks with depression end up Being in, and that's in, you know, emergency settings where they go into inpatient units.[0:13:34] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, you know, in the rest of medicine, if It's talking about heart attacks. If I start having chest pain right now and, and you bring me to a primary care doctor's office, they're gonna have a certain number of tests and treatments. Right? But very limited because it's an outpatient, facility. If you bring me to the emergency room after that, there are more tests and more treatments.[0:13:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: If you put me in the ICU or in the Cath Lab, where they do, invasive procedures to the heart, there are more tests and more treatments. In psychiatry, As we elevate the acuity of an individual, you go from being just depressed to being depressed and now thinking about ending your life, The number of treatments actually go down on average. I mean, in some scenarios, they go up, but on average, they go down, and there are no tests. Right? And so we've been very focused on that particular problem, somebody that maybe was doing, you know, fairly okay with a Pretty moderate depression, and then their depression gets worse.[0:14:32] Dr. Nolan Williams: And then they end up in an emergency setting. And the the field really hasn't developed A way of, you know, of consistently being able to treat that problem, and folks end up getting the same standard oral antidepressants that they've been getting outpatient. And and I came to this because, you know, dual trained as a neurologist and psychiatrist, went back and forth between neurology and psychiatry, Saw that in neurology, we have all of these ways of treating acute brain based problems and really wanted to emulate that in psychiatry and find ways to develop and engineer new, you know, brain based solutions.[0:15:09] Andrew Huberman: There's a lot to unpack there. One thing that you said, I'd like to focus on a bit more because I think we hear that the brain and the heart are connected. Mhmm. But you described, I believe, a direct relationship between areas of the brain associated with emotion[0:15:26] Dr. Nolan Williams: Mhmm.[0:15:26] Andrew Huberman: And heart rate. Yes. And That makes perfect logical sense to me, but I think, at the same time, many people out there probably think of the relationship between the The heart and the mind as kind of woo or kind of[0:15:42] Dr. Nolan Williams: a[0:15:42] Andrew Huberman: a soft biology. But here, you're talking about an actual physical connection Yep. Between, what area of the brain is it?[0:15:49] Dr. Nolan Williams: The the the, you know, the 1st place where the stimulation goes is called the dorso lateral prefrontal cortex. It's kind of the Sense of control kind of governor of the brain. Mhmm. And then it'll and then what we know is that when you use a magnet, use kind of what we call Faraday's law, this idea of, using a magnetic pulse to induce, an electrical current in electrically conducting substances. So in this case, Brain tissue, but not skull or skull scalp or any of that or hair.[0:16:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: You avoid all that, just the brain tissue. Then you have a direct Depolarization of cortical neurons, you know, the surface of the brain's neurons in this dorso lateral prefrontal. And if you do that in the actual scanner, which we can do, you can see that that distributes down into the anterior cingulate in the insula, in the amygdala. And, ultimately, the tract goes into something called the nucleus tract to solitarius and ultimately into the vagus nerve Into the heart. So the the heart, very consistently seems to be the end organ of the, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex.[0:16:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: If you measure heart rate in standard ways that cardiologists measure heart rate and you stimulate over this left dorsal lateral, You get a deceleration of the heart rate, and it's very time locked to the stimulation. So it's a 2 second train of stimulation. At one second, you see the deceleration. It goes down about 10 beats per minute, and then it'll drift back up. There's a break for 8 seconds on the stimulation, drifts back up, and the stimulation goes back in, and then the heart rate goes back down.[0:17:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: So you see the heart rate just do this. 10 beats per minute every train. And so we know If you do that over visual cortex, you don't get that or motor cortex, you don't get any of those findings. It's really specific to this kind of control region of the brain. And so, yeah, it seems to you know, it's our work.[0:17:42] Dr. Nolan Williams: Other other folks work, Martin in in, in in Europe, Netherlands work showing the same connections. I think it's been repl replicated, like, 4 or 5 times.[0:17:51] Andrew Huberman: So you mentioned left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime I hear about lateralization of function, I get particularly Curious.[0:18:00] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:18:01] Andrew Huberman: Because, obviously, we have 2, mirror symmetric sides of the brain. Yeah. There are, You know, rare exceptions to this, like the pineal and things of that sort, that are only there is only 1 pineal. What is special about the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex? Does this have anything to do with handedness, right hand or left hand?[0:18:22] Andrew Huberman: Because we know right hand and handedness has a lot to do with lateralization of function for language, a topic for another time. But, Why do you think that left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex would be connected to the heart, in this way?[0:18:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. I think so so left dorsal lateral, you know, is is thought to be the the side that when you excite it, when you kind of, Do excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort of stimulation that you can reduce depressive symptoms. And, a guy by the name of Mike Fox at Harvard has demonstrated that if you have, strokes in the brain that, that cause depression and you put them on the human connectum, A 100, you know, 1,000 patient map, and you ask the question what they're all functionally connected to, left dorsal lateral. If you take Lesions that cause mania in individuals, and you put those all in the human connective map and ask what they're all the one common area they're all connected to, it's the right Dorsal lateral.[0:19:24] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so there seems to be a hemispheric, you know, you know, balancing of mood, between these 2 brain regions. And we know this From an experimental standpoint too, because you can take individuals with depression and you can excite the left or you can inhibit the right, And they they're both antidepressant. You can, excite the right, and that's anti manic in some studies. And so this idea that there is this Hemispheric balancing of mood is is quite interesting. Right?[0:19:54] Andrew Huberman: It's incredibly interesting. And just to, people know if, If you're curious what the connectome is, connectome is a term that was built out of this notion of genomes, being a large, Collections of sequencing and mapping of genes, their proteomes of proteins, of, connectomes as, so called connectomics of Connections between neurons. So the human connectome project is ongoing, and I find that incredible that within the connectome project, they can identify these From humans, not certainly not as many as you have. And if you look at the architecture, the layers, the cell types, and even the neurochemicals of which cells are expressing, say, dopamine or serotonin or receiving input from areas that make dopamine or serotonin. They don't look that different on the Right and left side.[0:20:51] Andrew Huberman: And yet here, we're talking about a, kind of an accelerator and a brake, if you will That's right. On, on depression and mania using What, at least by my eye and I think other people's eye, look to be basically the same set of, of bits, the same parts list[0:21:07] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:21:07] Andrew Huberman: More or less. So what gives The these properties, to the right and left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, is it the inputs they receive? Is this something that we learn during development, or do you think that we come into the world with these, hemispheric biases?[0:21:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. It's a it's a great question. And, you know, it hasn't been worked out, which your original question was around in a Left handed individual, which is, you know, 25% of those folks end up having a right brain dominance, or 1% of right handed people have a right brain dominance If it's flipped. Right? And that you know, unfortunately, that study still hasn't been done at the level because that would be probably pretty helpful for teasing some of this out.[0:21:48] Dr. Nolan Williams: But, you know, it's it's, it's still, you know, it's still being sorted out. Right? We we know enough to know this Phenomenon exists because we can use TMS as a probe and do this sort of these sorts of manipulations. But, to my knowledge, there hasn't been anybody that's gotten so interested in it that they've been able to get a mechanism of why that is. But, but it you know, it's kind of empirically true in the sense that you can push and pull on those systems or in this in the case of of strokes that Folks have, and then you kind of get their brains and and their brain images and look at where the strokes landed, those kind of causal bits of information point to this This, asymmetry.[0:22:33] Dr. Nolan Williams: Interesting.[0:22:34] Andrew Huberman: Well, in that case, going with what we do know, that stimulation of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex slows the heart rate down Transiently, but slows it down and seems to alleviate at least some symptoms of depression. Mhmm. Leads me to the question of why would that be the case? Is it Does it tell us anything fundamental about depression that, anxiety is inherent to depression? I think of Faster heart rate is, you know, part and parcel with, with with, anxiety.[0:23:03] Andrew Huberman: In my laboratory, we've studied Fear a bit in animals and in humans, and we, often observe brachycardia where somebody or an animal is afraid of something. And rather than the heart rate speeding up, it actually slows down, something that most people don't think about or recognize. But, Given that stimulation of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex slows the heart rate down and can alleviate depressive symptoms and that there are other ways to slow the heart down, I have 2 questions. What do you think this tells us about the basic architecture of depression and its physiology at the level of the heart? And does the circuit run-in the opposite direction too?[0:23:43] Andrew Huberman: If one were to have or find other ways to slow the heart rate down, say, with a beta blocker Mhmm. Does that help alleviate depression?[0:23:50] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. That's a great question. So the, I'll answer the 2nd question first. So we know that, and There are ongoing trials of this. If you stimulate in the vagus nerve, in an implanted vagus nerve stimulator, you can actually, you know, have this the afferent, parts of the the vagus, you project ultimately up to the DLPFC through the singlet, Through these anterior insulae, so that same obviously, the same tract.[0:24:18] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And you can, stimulate there and alleviate depression, which seems Very unusual. Right? You're stimulating a cranial nerve down on the neck. But if you can get up into the brain, you actually can improve depressive symptoms.[0:24:31] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, You know, more evidence that this is a a kind of a whole track and system. And, if you stimulate in part of that system, it appears that you can, improve mood.[0:24:43] Andrew Huberman: And what if I were somebody who did not have a stimulating electrode in my vagus nerve, and I I was dealing with minor depression, and I decided I wanted to take some other approach to slow my heart rate down via the vagus. For instance, exhale emphasized breathing or deliberately slow cadence breathing Mhmm. Things of that sort. Is there any The behavioral interventions of those kinds, can alleviate depression or some symptoms of depression. And is there any evidence that it does indeed feedback to the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex to achieve some of that alleviation?[0:25:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: Absolutely. Yeah. So there's there's a number of studies, implicating DLP the dorsal lateral and, and say, you know, meditation, mindfulness, that sort of thing. And and they're Small studies, but but pretty well designed studies suggesting that behavioral interventions in mild depression actually work quite well. There seems to be a volitional threshold for depression where at some point, you you start losing it you you go from being completely in Total volition to having kind of semi volition.[0:25:51] Dr. Nolan Williams: You have thoughts that you really have a hard time controlling and that sort of thing, and when you Go through that threshold. At some point, it gets harder and harder for those sorts of things to kinda kick in and work. In the extreme form of that is catatonia, right, where people in a very severe form of depression get kind of stuck motorically. Right? And they obviously can't they have no control And so, or or very limited control.[0:26:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, I think there's a threshold in which these sorts of interventions will work. Exercise seems to really be a good treatment for for mild depression, and it may work through the mechanism you're describing. Right? As as We all know, you know, athletes hold a lower resting heart rate[0:26:34] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:26:34] Dr. Nolan Williams: Than folks that that aren't you know, if you're if you were an athlete, you had a lower resting heart rate, you stopped, You know, exercising and a couple years later, your resting heart rate, in many cases, goes up. Right? And so maybe that's, maybe that's part of the process. I'm not aware of any studies specifically, looking at dorsal lateral prefrontal, physiology pre, post exercise, but it would be a great study. I think that would be really helpful to understanding this, especially if you had a correlation of Changes and kind of lowering of, say, heart rate with mood improvements.[0:27:09] Dr. Nolan Williams: There there's been a lot of work with heart rate variability And, and depression and, you know, studies are are can point towards it. It's not Not every study is is is, you know, positive for this, but, but quite a few studies say basically that lower Heart rate variability is, associated with, you know, moderate to severe depression, and that may be part of that mechanism of that heart brain, risk.[0:27:40] Andrew Huberman: So I'm both intrigued and a little bit perplexed by this relationship between heart rate and depression. On the face of it, I would think of depression as depressed. So lower heart rate might make somebody more depressed. You even mentioned catatonia or somebody that just Doesn't seem motivated or excited to do anything. I think of mania as elevated heart rate and[0:27:58] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:27:58] Andrew Huberman: Being excited. On the other hand, I realized that anxiety, which, You know, brings about ideas as elevated heart rate is also built into depression, which brings me back to what you said earlier, which is that when we say depression, Are we really talking about 4 or 5 different Yeah. That's right. Disorders Yeah. To That's right.[0:28:17] Andrew Huberman: For lack of a better word? And For what percentage of people that have depression does some approach to reducing heart rate Work. Whether or not it's stimulation of the dorsal left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation or By taking a beta blocker or by stimulating the vagus, can we throw out a number, a rough number? Does that help 30%, 50%? Pervert how long lasting is that that relief?[0:28:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. And to be clear, the, the deceleration of the heart rate is in the moment when the stimulation is happening, But it's not something that's necessarily maintained chronically. It's more of an indicator that you're in the right Network more than it's than it appears to be itself, you know, central to the mechanism. That heart rate variability Peace may be, and there's some studies that link the 2. But the actual deceleration seems to be much more of a marker that you're in The right system, but, you know, it very well could be that the heart rate system and the mood system just sit next to each other and the stimulation It's both.[0:29:23] Dr. Nolan Williams: If you look at how much of the variance in the mood is explained by the heart rate deceleration, it's not it's not a huge, You know, it's not a huge amount. Right? So it only explains, a small percentage. And so it's it's unlikely that Simply, you know, simply reducing the heart rate. And in fact, you know, for many years, Propranolol and these sorts of drugs actually were implicating causing depression.[0:29:47] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so that that's been kind of debunked, but it's it's unlikely that simply decelerating the heart rate's gonna improve depression. But what it does tell you is that if you're in that area that is the mood regulatory area, there's some parasympathetic cortical kind of process that's going on that gets in and and causes this to happen. And it's, you know, it's independent of mood. You can take a normal, healthy, Individual, and you can do this, and they're gonna decelerate their heart rate.[0:30:17] Andrew Huberman: I'm so glad you mentioned the parasympathetic nervous system, which, of course, is the people think of as the rest and digest or the kinda calming side of the autonomic nervous system. As I'm hearing you say all of this, and in particular, What you just told me, which is that it's not as if having a lower heart rate protects you against depression or a higher heart rate is associated with depression. Although at the extremes, that might be true. But rather it's something about the regulatory network, the ability to control Your own nervous system to some extent. Mhmm.[0:30:47] Andrew Huberman: And when I think about the autonomic nervous system, I like to think about it as a seesaw Yep. Of, you know, alertness and calmness. And when you're asleep, it's lot of calmness. And when you're panicking, it's a lot of alertness to the but that and I don't think this has ever been defined. And when I I teach met the medical students at Stanford neuroanatomy.[0:31:04] Andrew Huberman: I my wish is that someday I'll be able to explain what the hinge in that process would be. Right? Not the ends of the see we know what the sympathetic nervous system is and what it's to wake us up and make us panic or make us feel nicely alert and calm. We know what Puts someone into sleep or a coma or makes them feel relaxed. But what shifts from one side of the seesaw to the other and the tightness of that hinge Seems to me what you're describing that[0:31:29] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:31:30] Andrew Huberman: That depression is sort of a lack of control over inner states so that when I'm stressed, I can't get myself out of it. But when I'm feeling Completely collapsed with exhaustion. I can't get out of bed and[0:31:39] Dr. Nolan Williams: need to be[0:31:40] Andrew Huberman: motivated to do the very things that would help me get out of depression, like a workout or social connection or thing You eat a a quality meal, these kinds of things.[0:31:47] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:31:48] Andrew Huberman: So this is perhaps the first time that I've ever heard about a potential circuit For the hinge as I'm referring to it, does that make[0:31:56] Dr. Nolan Williams: any sense at all? Absolutely. Absolutely. I just[0:31:58] Andrew Huberman: wanna make sure that I'm framing this correctly in my mind.[0:32:00] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Absolutely. And in some studies, if you do the same Identical stimulation on the right dorsal lateral, you can get an acceleration. You know, just kind of further confirming this idea of lateralization. Right?[0:32:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: That that Even it appears that even the prefrontal cortis you know, cortical, areas seem to be lateralized in this in this way, and I you know, it's, it's less. The right finding is is more variable depending upon the study. The left's very consistent in this way. So[0:32:31] Andrew Huberman: so we've talked about churns cranial magnetic stimulation for getting into these networks. And and I also just want to take a brief tangent and say I because I've heard you say this before. I think it's so vital what you're saying that it's really not about stimulation of areas. It's Or any specific brain area or vagus nerve being important per se. It's really about a network, a connection a series of connections.[0:32:54] Andrew Huberman: I think that's really important for people to understand, and it's kind of a new emerging theme, really.[0:32:59] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:33:00] Andrew Huberman: The the other thing that to me seems extremely important for us to consider is what ex what are these lateral prefrontal cortices doing? Are they involved, for instance, in sensation, Sensing the heart rate, are they involved in thinking and planning? And this gets down to a very simple question that I know a lot of people have, which is, Can we talk ourselves out of depression if it's mild? Can we, talk ourselves into a manic state or an excited State, a positively excited state that doesn't qualify as mania. You know, other areas of the brain, I I think of they is responsible for perception or for for motor control.[0:33:39] Andrew Huberman: But here we are in this mysterious frontal cortex area, which people say executive function, planning, etcetera. Are we talking about thoughts? Are we talking about structured thoughts? Are we talking about dreamlike thoughts? What in the world is going on in the prefrontal cortex?[0:33:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. It does.[0:33:55] Andrew Huberman: And here I spend Career, you know, in neuroscience, and I still I I still can't really understand what it's doing, and maybe it's doing 50 things.[0:34:03] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. No. It's a great it's a great question. So, You know, to so one of the one of the studies that that we've been working on addition to the depression work is actually trying to Change trait hypnotizability. So, David Spiegel and I have been working on this, and, you know, he's found and, published this 10 years ago that A different part of the left dorsal lateral, is functionally connected with the anteriors the dorsal anterior cingulate, with a lot of functional connectivity and high hypnotizables and not much in low hypnotizables, and that's a different Kind of a different subregion within this bigger brain region we call left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex than the part that seems to be important for regulating mood.[0:34:46] Dr. Nolan Williams: And And so the left dorsal lateral seems to have connections that are location specific within the Overall kind of named brain region that connect to various parts of the cingulate and seem to regulate it. Right. And so if you knock out the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and you have people do the Stroop task, For instance, which is a a task where you have it's a simple task. Probably know this. You have people name the color of words.[0:35:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so If I if I look at a what you know, if I look at one of the cards that they'll show you, it'll have the word red in red, and that's very easy, and that's a call to congruent. And then the incongruent is red in the color blue, and you have to Name, you have to say the the word. You don't, name the color.[0:35:41] Andrew Huberman: You have to suppress a response.[0:35:43] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And so, I'm sorry. You do the you you name the color, and you you and you see the word written, in a different way.[0:35:50] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, basically, if you If you stimulate in a way that inhibits the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or either one, you can actually knock out the ability to do that well, And it'll take longer for people on the incongruent cards to, to be able to name it. And so they have, they have a kind of a time delay that's greater than they had before they got stimulated. So that's a part of the the prefrontal cortex that's different than the part of the prefrontal cortex that's involved In mood regulation, the nice thing about TMS is that you can go through and you can find these areas that are functionally defined Through brain imaging, and you can perturb them and answer the question you're talking about. How do I understand this part of the prefrontal cortex and its function? This part.[0:36:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so we were able to stimulate in in an inhibitory way within the left Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that's involved with, you know, this sort of cognitive control, area, and we were able to knock that area out And, an increased trait hypnotizability. So people had, greater, hypnotizability After they got active stimulation versus when they got sham. And so it suggests that that brain circuit is involved in the, In the process of what hypno you know, therapeutic hypnosis ends up being, but it's a very different region within the left dorsal lateral than, Say, we do when we do these very intensive, stimulation approaches to treat severe depression, and we're able to get people out of depression, know, with the part of this of the dorsal lateral, it seems to be lower in the, you know, kind of more lateral, And, and, inferior on the, DLPFC and connected with a subgenual anterior cingulate, so the part of the anterior cingulate that processes Emotion.[0:37:46] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG One, Is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:38:14] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, And they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k 2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:39:01] Andrew Huberman: Based on what you told us about the Stroop task and the role of the prefrontal cortex in Stroop task, to me, the Stroop task is a rule switching game.[0:39:09] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep.[0:39:09] Andrew Huberman: You're saying in one moment, the the rule is you read whatever the word says, and then then you switch, and then you say the rule now is You tell me what color the word is written in, and you suppress whatever it is the word says.[0:39:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: Okay? That's right.[0:39:23] Andrew Huberman: Okay. A rule in some sense is, like that is a transiently adopted belief system. Yep. So I could imagine that in depression, which has all sorts of Backstory to it, that, of course, the psychiatrist or psychologist or friend can pull on that thread. Like, for instance, somebody might believe that they are bad Yep.[0:39:45] Andrew Huberman: Or that they don't deserve love. I'm trying to bring this into the typical language that people talk about. Or that Absolutely. They will never succeed. Or that even if they keep succeeding, it's just gonna get harder and harder, and it will never feel good.[0:39:58] Andrew Huberman: These are sort of rules like a Stroop task.[0:40:00] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep. That's right.[0:40:00] Andrew Huberman: At some level. It's there are rules that are more pervasive over time, unfortunately. But I could imagine that if the PSC is also contains Some sort of maps or algorithms related to rules of emotionality or self representation or things that we've heard, I think there must be data out there saying that, know, whatever we heard in middle school when someone made fun of us, we can remember that. Because I can remember things that people said[0:40:24] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[0:40:25] Andrew Huberman: A jacket I wore one day or something in the 4th grade. I'm crazy. I didn't even like the jacket. Now I think it was kinda cool. But, anyway, The the point being that we have an intense memory for these things to set up a sort of rule or a question.[0:40:38] Andrew Huberman: Like, maybe I don't really know How to dress,[0:40:41] Dr. Nolan Williams: for instance.[0:40:42] Andrew Huberman: Maybe that's why I always wear the same black shirt. But in all seriousness, it seems like the the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is in this amazing position to access rules, which Mhmm. Are beliefs and beliefs are rules, and then for moments or longer to switch those rules.[0:40:58] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep.[0:40:58] Andrew Huberman: And so for somebody who's depressed to just simply look themselves in the mirror and say, you are great. You are fantastic. That's It feels like a lie if you feel like garbage to say that. It it doesn't fit with the rule. It's like saying that card is not red.[0:41:12] Andrew Huberman: That card is green when your eyes tell you that it's that it's red.[0:41:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: Mhmm. And That's right.[0:41:17] Andrew Huberman: And it seems like there's something about prefrontal cortex that That in principle gives flexibility to rules based on what we know on the Stroop task. So given its connectivity, Can we assume that the talk therapy that occurs in a the psychiatrist's office or with a friend or through journaling out something? Because we do know that reporting things about trauma or difficult circumstances or the rules that we contain and tend to hide inside of us about How we feel miserable about ourselves or anything, really, that in rescripting that, that somehow It allows us to do a sort of Stroop task on our beliefs. Is that is that a a tremendous leap? I'm just really trying to frame this in the context What I and most people think of as depression Yeah.[0:42:05] Andrew Huberman: Totally. Because the network components are vitally important, but I I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, like, what are the What are the the algorithms that govern Yeah. Prefrontal cortex?[0:42:15] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Absolutely. So in a in a kind of standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, what What, the therapist is just trying to do is identify those beliefs and, and, you know, kinda determine how How fixed they are, you know, if they're flexible as you're saying, and then, and then help folks to find another explanation for them And to, and to kind of reintegrate that potential other explanation into their their memory system. Right? Where where I think TMS is really interesting, actually, we had a lot of patients who've told me, like, my my therapist told me that I wasn't trying hard enough In therapy and, and, you know, and I I really am trying hard, but these are, you know, moderate to pretty severe depressed patients.[0:43:03] Dr. Nolan Williams: And as soon as we get them well with with the TMS approaches, you know, kind of rapid, you know, 5 day approach, and the next week, we come in and see them. And they'll say, you know what I did all weekend is I looked at my therapy books, and now I can understand it. And so, you know, I actually see TMS as a way of having kind of exogenous sorts of cognitive functions that in milder forms of depression, we can pull off with psychotherapy. You know, this idea of being able to kinda turn that prefrontal cortex on and have it govern these deeper regions. In depression, the deeper regions govern the prefrontal cortex.[0:43:41] Dr. Nolan Williams: They they precede the prefrontal cortex timing wise. We've got some data in in review now where we're seeing that In depressed individuals that are responsive to our rapid TMS approach, we call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy or or SNT or SAINT, If you look at the brain before people get this, they will they will have a temporal delay where the singlet is in front of the DLPFC. And in people that are normal healthy controls, No depression. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is temporally in front of the anterior cingulate. With effective treatment, We can flip the timing of things so the dorsal lateral is in front of the anterior cingulate Just like in a normal person.[0:44:33] Andrew Huberman: So you're not talking about, obviously, physically moving these structures. You're talking about in time In time. Their activation. So in one case, it's like the coach Telling the player what to do, and then everything's like a player telling the coach what to do, and you you you restore order to the game.[0:44:46] Dr. Nolan Williams: You restore order to the game. And and and then what it looks like is Depression, to your point, is a bunch of kind of spontaneous content that's semi volitional that's being kind of generated out of this Conflict, detection system, the singular that seems to to, to sense conflict and kind of Feed that information gets overactive in depression. And, and then in depression, it looks like the left dorsal lateral Does not sufficiently clamp down on it, and what therapy appears to do is to kind of restore that. What we see with TMS over that region is that we just exogenously do the same sort of thing. We restore the governance of the left dorsal lateral over the cingulate area, and that is correlated with treatment improvement.[0:45:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: So the degree in which you can re Time, we regulate in time the left dorsal lateral over the cingulate, the more of an antidepressant effect you have.[0:45:49] Andrew Huberman: Can we, therefore, say in in crude terms that the dorso lateral prefrontal cortex Really is the governor of how we interpret physiological signals and spontaneous thoughts.[0:46:02] Dr. Nolan Williams: It is it it places a lens The the rest of the brain sees things through, and and you can you can do these experiments where you you can put a normal healthy control person in the in the scanner, and you can make them feel like they have a loss of control, and then you can see that region come offline. Right? So you experimentally manipulate the system, and so kind of buffing it up, it's like almost TMS is almost like exercise for the brain. Right? You're you're kind of exercising this region over and over again with a physiologically relevant Signal and kind of turning that system on.[0:46:41] Dr. Nolan Williams: And what's interesting, we're I think really interesting for for this show is to you We had a couple of folks, you know, probably 5 or 6 folks that have actually told me this where if they remit early enough in the week, we have this very dense stimulation approach where we can Stimulate people really rapidly over a 5 day block. We don't discriminate when they get better to when they stop. So if they they get better on day 1. We still give them the other 4 days because it's in the protocol to do that. We can't we're we're getting to a point where we can tell how long it's gonna take, but we're not there yet.[0:47:12] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, every time somebody gets better at day 1 or 2, at the beginning when we first started doing this, we'd say, you know, we're not sure. Yeah. We think this is safe to keep going, but, you know, what do you wanna do? And everybody was like, no. I wanna keep going.[0:47:25] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, they're by Wednesday, they're, like, Totally zeroed down on the depression scales, you know, even better than most people walking around, like, really no anxiety, no no depression or anything. By Thursday, The 1st guy that that told me this, he came in, and he said, you know, I was driving back to my hotel, and I decided to go to the beach. And I just sat there, and I was Totally present in the present moment for an hour, and he's like, I read about this in my mindfulness books, but I experienced it Last night, I've never experienced anything like this before, and I was like, that's interesting, but kinda wasn't sure. And then and then I didn't tell any, you know, obviously, any more patients about and then about 5 over the last couple of years when they get they remit early in the week. By the end of the week, they're, like, going to the beach, and they're, like, Totally having a what people describe as a pretty mindful present moment sort of experience, which is really interesting, you know, what that is.[0:48:18] Dr. Nolan Williams: I mean, I don't have Full on scientific data to tell you, but it it's just it's a it's an interesting anecdote, right, that that folks, when you push them through this point of of feeling kind of clinically well that some people end up reporting this additional set of features. So[0:48:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You mentioned the singlet and the enterocingulate in particular. Because now I feel like for the first time in my career, I have some sense of what prefrontal cortex might actually be doing, besides providing a bumper for the for the rest of the the brain, is the cingulate, it seems, is a is a more Primitive structure in the sense that it's, it's under the ideally, it's under the regulation of this top down control from prefrontal cortex. But What's mapped in the cingulate? And and for the non neuroscientists out there, when I say mapped, if we were to put someone in a scanner and focus in on cingulate or Put an electrode in there.[0:49:11] Andrew Huberman: What what makes the neurons in there fire? What what sorts of things in the body and in the mind and out in the world, Light up, for lack of a better phrase, the singlet. What does the singlet like?[0:49:23] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. So so that strip task, those incongruent word color associations, the The dorsal part of that, for obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain, you know, certain kind of triggers, you'll you'll see some some of the neuroimaging studies will point to to anterior cingulate. In the kind of very crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, the anterior cingulotomy was a way of treating, obsessive compulsive disorder. Right?[0:49:49] Dr. Nolan Williams: Because that area seems to be overactive in people who are Experiencing obsessive compulsive disorder. You can kind of walk the the cingulate wraps around, you know, this white matter track, like bundles. It wraps around That and so there's a part that's above that, around that, and below that. And depending upon how how much of the, the conflict task has an emotional component. The more, ventral and Subgenual that, that activation is.[0:50:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: So the dorsal part of the Anterior cingulate seems to be kind of more of a pure cognitive, maybe, obsessive compulsive disorder sort of area, whereas when you start getting into mood sorts of triggers like facial expression, conflicts where you're supposed to, The you know, there's an emotional Stroop task where you show the word happy, and then you have a face of of a person that looks mad, Then that's another way of having the same sort of Stroop conflict. That seems to be more perigenial, subgenual areas. Right? So you can kind of You can trigger the singular based off the level of emotional valence from none down to a lot, and, and that seems to be how the How it's distributed, there are, you know, heart rate kind of components to it, autonomic components in there too. There's something called akinetic mutism.[0:51:15] Dr. Nolan Williams: You know, I'm a a I'm a board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral neurologist, and I've seen, you know, a lot of these, what we call zebra cases in neurology where people have, You know, these unusual neurological presentations, and one of them is a a, kinetic mutism. So if you have a glioma Sitting in the inner hemispheric fissure and kind of having, pressure on the singlet, people can get into an almost Catatonic looking state where they kind of get stuck and they don't speak. And and so that tells you something about how the How the singlet works as well. Right? It's it's like if it's, if it's not functioning, then people have a hard time Kind of connecting with reality.[0:51:59] Dr. Nolan Williams: It seems to need to be constantly on, you know, online to be able to interact with the exterior world.[0:52:05] Andrew Huberman: Is it involved in some of the dissociative states that sometimes people who are very stressed or or depressed experience? You said catatonia being an an extreme one. But, I know someone, for instance, that when they get really stressed, and it can even be if someone, yells at them or someone's angry even if someone's Angry with them or they perceive someone's angry with them, there's a developmental backstory to why they they likely feel this way. They sort of just Kinda can't this is a high, high functioning individual normally, and they they just sort of can't function. They can't complete simple things like email or or groceries or things that for a short while, it's it's almost like a catatonia, and they refer to as a dissociative state.[0:52:50] Andrew Huberman: Do you see that in depression? And, I mean, we're we're speculating here as to whether or not that involves a singlet, but what you're saying, it has it holds a lot of salience, for me in thinking about this example.[0:52:59] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. There's, so you see you see catatonia as an extreme outcome of depression and of, and sometimes schizophrenia and other illnesses. Dissociation is an extreme outcome or even some cases, a less extreme outcome of PTSD and and trauma. And, You know?[0:53:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: And it's also a phenomenon that happens naturally in some people that are highly hypnotizable. And so if you ask David Spiegel, I'd say that, Some of the work that he's been working on is around posterior cingulate and and the, capacity to dissociate. But, yeah, you know, with our stimulation approach To to DLPFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, one of the subscales that moved the most was the dissociative Subscale for for hypnotizability. So even in a normal individual, you know, you see that that change in in, in that kind of of dissociation?[0:53:54] Andrew Huberman: I am highly hypnotizable. David's hypnotized me a number of times. In fact, we have a clip of that on our Hebrew Moon LiveFX channel. I I've always, well, always. Well, starting at my early teens, I started exploring hypnosis.[0:54:07] Andrew Huberman: I'm extremely hypnotizable and, Self hypnosis or assisted hypnosis. I don't know that I ever go into associate of states. I'll try and avoid, forcing you into running a clinical session right now, but, to assess anything like that. But this brings about something really, interesting, I think, which is I'm aware that Some of the more popular emerging treatments for depression include things like Ketamine Yep. Which is a dissociative anesthetic.[0:54:36] Andrew Huberman: Is that right?[0:54:37] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep.[0:54:38] Andrew Huberman: And yet and my assumption is that as a dissociative anesthetic, that it leads to dissociative states where people can sort of third person themselves and be feel somewhat distanced from their emotions.[0:54:50] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yes.[0:54:51] Andrew Huberman: I've also been hearing that there are Emerging treatments, psilocybin being one of them, but some other treatments, MDMA, etcetera, that we'll parse each of these in in detail, that lead to the exact opposite state during the effect of the drug, which is a highly engaged, emotionality and heart rate and sense of self. Yeah. And can also lead to relief of depression. Now whether or not this again reflects that depression has many conditions as opposed to just one Or whether or not somehow tickling, or in some cases, pushing really hard on the opposite ends of the the scale really matter. I am absolutely fascinated and, again, Also perplexed by this, why would it be that a drug that induces dissociative states and a drug taken separately that induces Hyper associative states would lead to relief of the same condition.[0:55:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. No. That's a great question. Yeah. So for, For Ketamine, you know, the the level of dissociation appears to be correlated with the the therapeutic effect.[0:55:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: It appears to be, Necessary, but not sufficient to produce an antidepressant effect. And so, folks that that don't have any any psychological Change, from the ketamine or or don't experience any dissociation, typically tend to have less, less potent Antidepressant effects from Ketamine. We did a study a couple of years ago. It was really interesting. So we we gave folks, Naltrexone, which is an opiate, antagonist, It's a mu and kappa opioid receptor antagonist, and we we we gave the same individuals a pill of that or a pill of placebo, and they had no idea which one they were getting.[0:56:34] Andrew Huberman: Was this low dose naltrexone?[0:56:35] Dr. Nolan Williams: Fifty milligrams. So it's pretty high dose.[0:56:37] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:56:37] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. And so we we gave a typical ketamine therapeutic dose, and then we gave 50 milligrams of Naltrexone, or placebo. And then in the same individuals, We we gave 2 in you know, 2 infusions, 1 with each of those conditions, and and if they had an antidepressant effect, we waited until they relapsed. Then we gave them the other condition, and then we look to see what, what effect of blocking the opioid receptor, what effect would you see on the effect of blocking the opioid receptor. With the idea that if ketamine works the way that a lot of researchers at the time thought that it, You know, completely worked in, which is the glutamate system, then you would have, no effect of Naltrexone because Naltrexone just Interacts with the opioid system.[0:57:21] Dr. Nolan Williams: It doesn't do anything with any other systems. Ketamine has a lot of effects over you know, it has clear opioid effects, in mice, in various ways of looking at that, and NMDA receptor antagonism and glutamate effects. And so if it's just that The glutamate part is, is the part driving the antidepressant effect. You shouldn't have any difference in the antidepressant effect between the two conditions. If, however, the antidepressant effect is primarily is the the opioid properties of ketamine are necessary For the antidepressant effect, then you should have a loss of antidepressant effect during the Ketamine plus Naltrexone condition that you observed in the Ketamine plus Placebo condition, and what we what we saw was that there was a dramatic blockade of the antidepressant effect when Naltrexone was present In this yeah.[0:58:18] Dr. Nolan Williams: In the people that had a had an antidepressant, effect with Ketamine plus, placebo alone. And, and then some friends of mine did a TMS study with pain, and they stimulated over the left prefrontal cortex, and they gave naloxone IV Naloxone, which works basically the same way as naltrexone, and they were able to block the anti pain effects of TMS With a opiate blocker, so this idea that another kind of convergent point, right, this idea that the opioid receptor May have a role in mood regulation. What's also interesting is if you look at people that are getting a total knee operation, very painful operation. Right? You know, Total knee replacement, and you you age, sex, you know, everything match the individuals that are going through that, but you have a group of people that Don't have depression in a group of people that do have depression.[0:59:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: The presence of depression triples the the oral, opioid dose by day 4.[0:59:19] Andrew Huberman: That's required.[0:59:20] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's required to to cover the pain, but what may be happening is it's not just treating physical pain. Maybe treating emotional pain as well. Right? At least transiently, it seems to have a pro an antidepressant effect. Chronically, it seems to have a very Pro depressant effect can make people treatment resistant, but, you know, it's it's an interesting phenomenon.[0:59:40] Dr. Nolan Williams: But, yeah, the opioid system seems to be pretty Pretty involved. But what's interesting there with the the ketamine trial is that we didn't see any effect on the dissociation. And so the dissociation was the same each time. So the psychological effect of the what we call the trip or the The kind of dissociative effect where people are having a psychological phenomenon from Ketamine, that was identical both times. And so it It kind of, it also challenged this idea that the psychological experience of the psychedelic effect Maybe all that's necessary to produce an effect, and the pharmacology doesn't matter as long as you can achieve that state.[1:00:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, we think we pretty clearly debunked that idea that the underlying pharmacology and the state, you know, Seem to be important. We don't know for sure if you can and a lot of people are working on this. If you can take out, you know, essentially the psychological effect and still have a drug That works to to treat the the under the illness that you're trying to target and, you know, a lot of there was a mouse study out this week where where they had an LSD analog, And they were able to see some some, animal level data to suggest that could be true. But but until we figure that out in humans, it's it's kind of To be determined, but it is it is curious. Right?[1:01:02] Dr. Nolan Williams: Being able to kind of use experimental manipulations to Try to separate, you know, some of these phenomenon apart and really understand what's what's doing what.[1:01:13] Andrew Huberman: It's so critical, and it's so critical to The other conversation that we'll surely get to, which is the progression of psychedelics from illicit illegal drugs to clinically, Validated and and presumably, at some point, either decriminalized or legal drugs, which has not yet happened, at least not in the US. Just to make sure that people are getting this, and how crucial this is, what we're really talking about here is the fact that, you know, somebody takes a multigram dose of psilocybin or somebody takes, MDMA or they take ketamine, and they experience relief from their trauma, their depression, their addiction, or any number of the other things that Indeed, those compounds have been shown to be useful for in certain contexts clinically supported, etcetera. There's this gravitational pull to the idea that, Oh, it was the hallucinations. Yep. It was the dissociative state.[1:02:07] Andrew Huberman: Yep. It was the feeling of connectedness. And what we're really saying is that while that certainly could be true, It may be the case that a major source of the positive shift that occurs after the effect of the drug Is some underlying biology like shifts in the mu opioid receptor, a la your experiments with Naltrexone, or a change in the underlying neuromodulation that had Anywhere from nothing to something to do with the real shift. Yep. And I know there's a group up at UC Davis that published a paper in Nature About a year ago, also looking at, these are is a chemistry lab, essentially, modifying psychedelics to remove this the Hallucinogenic properties, the mood altering properties, and actually seeing some pretty impressive effects and shifts in mood after the drug wears off.[1:02:57] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[1:02:57] Andrew Huberman: And I know this this gets people upset When they hear it, a lot of peep this gets a lot of people upset, really[1:03:03] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep.[1:03:03] Andrew Huberman: Because people think, oh, no. It's the it's the intense experience that matters. But, in fact, that may not be the case at all. In fact, it's so powerful for people that sometimes I liken it in my mind to you it's like somebody it's like the birth of a new child, and it's such an incredible experience. And then people feel so much connection, and then they sort of connect the the experience of the of the actual birth to connection when in fact there that's true, it turns out, but there are a bunch of other things happening too Yeah.[1:03:30] Dr. Nolan Williams: Totally.[1:03:31] Andrew Huberman: That are simp that's simply the reflection of the fact that you're holding a child and the pheromonal effects, etcetera. So, anyway, I I think it's very important that these different, variables be figured out. Along those lines, I I wanna make sure that before we dive a bit deeper into Ketamine and Psilocybin, that we do touch on A really important topic that has been in the press a lot lately, which is SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, because we can't really have a discussion about depression without talking about SSRIs. And then I wanna circle back to, Ketamine and Psilocybin. It seems that, there are now data And what that essentially say state that there's no direct link between serotonin levels and depression.[1:04:18] Andrew Huberman: Although I my understanding is that the SSRIs are powerfully effective for certain forms of Obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be effective for treatment of depression, but it may again be through some effect unrelated to serotonin itself. Is that Right? And how should we think about SSRIs? Are they useful? Are they not useful?[1:04:38] Andrew Huberman: What's the what's going on with SSRIs in your patients and and in other Other people as well.[1:04:44] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. The the, yes. The the experiment that I described a bit ago around the Naltrexone and and Ketamine It's the 1st time I'm aware of where we were able to essentially eliminate an an antidepressants effect By using a 2nd drug as an kind of a blockade, it it highlights a bigger issue. Right? The issue that we haven't Had a good way of really understanding how these drugs work.[1:05:10] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so it's the difference I think a lot of the the controversy there is that, it's been difficult, I think, for folks, to see that something can, In one hand, work, and in the other hand, we don't know how it works. Right? And so, SSRIs clearly work. You know, many, many, meta analyses kind of proving that out. Right?[1:05:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: That that in a subpopulation of individuals, they achieve great benefit From depression, you know, for depression, for obsessive compulsive disorder, for generalized anxiety disorder, panic, you know, all these things, you can see An improvement in those symptoms, with what we call SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The issue There is that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end up, blocking the the reuptake of serotonin and leaving the the serotonin, You know, in this, in this kind of in between, between 2 neurons, for a while and allowing for more serotonin to kind of be there, The issue, is that they don't they don't work immediately. Right? So they don't work, like, the same day you start taking them, And that that suggests that probably it's not exactly the serotonin being in there that's directly driving it, that it's much more likely That it may have some, say, brain plasticity effects. Right?[1:06:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: We know that things like brain derived neurotrophic factor Get up regulated with chronic, oral antidepressant use. And and so that's that's kind of the ideas that, is that these things work. But what's powerful, and I think what the authors of this paper is extremely controversial patient paper, We're we're, in part trying to say was that there's not a there's not a deficit of serotonin. You're not born with, what people call a chemical imbalance. And psychiatry has known this.[1:07:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: This is not actually new information to anybody. You know? It it's it's kind of a Rehashing of a bunch of information we've known for a while now, but in the lay press, it's kind of hit in a way that it didn't seem to to grab Attention, before with previous publications, but this idea that this chemical imbalance idea is wrong, I I really I really think that part's important because I think that, you know, for A while, I think psychiatry you know, what I'll call psychiatry 1 point o. Right? This kind of idea of Freud and and psychotherapy and its and its origins, It was a lot around, you know, the your family and those experiences and psychotherapy kind of going in and correcting or helping you to figure out Or and, you know, show you being able to see or people hear you so that you can eventually come to the conclusion of Certain cognitions that aren't helping you.[1:08:10] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And there's a huge, you know, there's a huge importance there, but there's a history where, You know, things like the schizophrenogenic mother and all of that, you know, that was a concept at some point. Right? And so we've transitioned from that to To the you know, for a long time, the chemical imbalance, which I'll call psychiatry 2 point o, you know, this idea that there's something Chemically missing. And, and and I I think that the trouble there for a patient who's not A physician who's not someone who's, you know, who's who's steeped in these sorts of ideas, Who's, you know, more of, you know, kind of, kind of a person I mean, a kind of average American out there, right, is that It's telling it's sending a message of there's something missing with me, whether it be my experiences I had no control of over when I was a child or, a chemical in my brain.[1:09:08] Dr. Nolan Williams: What I think is really powerful with with TMS, you know, Really powerful TMS. And a a lovely even powerful of the psychedelic story is it's saying something different. You know? TMS works, and there's no Serotonin coming in or out of the brain. Right?[1:09:25] Dr. Nolan Williams: And we're we're doing a rapid form of TMS that works in 1 to 5 days. There's no There's it's very unlikely that there's some long term kind of upregulation of serotonin that's driving that. So our work actually kind of pushes back on this serotonin Hypothesis is being kind of the center of depression because it says, look. We're not giving anybody any serotonin. We're simply turning these brain regions on, And we're focused on the circuitry, and that's psychiatry 3 point o.[1:09:53] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's not just like neuromodulation. Neuromodulation's a really nice, you know, use case for psychiatry 3 point o because it's so A way to vocally and directly perturb brain regions in in whatever modality you're using. But, you know, there are a lot of a lot of groups that are actually doing their imaging before and after, and they're able to see circuit level changes for something like psilocybin or ketamine long after the drug is gone. Right? Suggesting in those same brain regions converge.[1:10:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: So the subgenual default mode network connection that we see It's changing with our our our stand, Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. It's that same set of brain regions that that Ketamine and, Psilocybin seemed to act on act on these connections between brain networks that seem to shift. And so it Refocuses the story on something that's highly correctable, and it's it's basically electrophysiology, And it's basically kind of recalibrating a circuit that is recalibratable instead of I have something missing Or have some some set of experiences early in life that are, that are gonna forever trap me in these these psychiatric diagnoses. And so it Kinda challenges that idea, and I think that's what's so powerful about psychiatry 3 point o. This idea of focusing on the circuit because it gets us Gets us into thinking about psychiatry and psychiatric illnesses as something that are recoverable.[1:11:25] Dr. Nolan Williams: People can get better. People you know, we've seen with our TMS techniques, we've seen it with with some of the psychedelic work that we've done where people are actually in normal levels of mood for Sustained periods of time are[1:11:37] Andrew Huberman: Within 5 days. Within 5 or[1:11:39] Dr. Nolan Williams: less days. And in the case of of the psychedelics, within a few days. Right? So We can get people out of these states. They're totally well.[1:11:47] Dr. Nolan Williams: There's no drug in their system at that point in the case of psychedelics. There was never a drug in their system in the case of of TMS, and it and it just tells us that that it's it's it's fixable. It's it's just like the heart. It's just like, you know, it's just like an arrhythmia in the heart. It's just like, you know, these These other illnesses that it's like a broken leg.[1:12:05] Dr. Nolan Williams: We can go in and do something, and we can get somebody better. Then I think what's What's empowering and what a lot of patients have told me is they say, you know, I've gotten to you know, some people will relapse and need more stimulation or need more Psychedelics or whatever it is, but they'll tell me I I've relapsed, and I'm depressed again, but I'll never think about killing myself again because I know that if I go get stimulated again, it it improves. It gets better. It it it will I will be able to reachieve it, and I can't and I and I I don't Fear that I'm chronically broken. I don't fear that the chemical imbalance is still imbalanced.[1:12:43] Dr. Nolan Williams: I don't fear that these things that I couldn't control in my childhood, You know, are gonna be there and drive this problem forever, and I think that's that's what's so powerful about this. The sense of control. The sense of control. The sense of They're not doing the stimulation themselves. They're not administering the drug in these trials themselves.[1:13:01] Dr. Nolan Williams: They probably never will. These will probably be medical treatments, But they are choosing to do it, and in that sense, they are in control.[1:13:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I have a a good friend, I won't out him for for reasons that'll become clear in a moment, who, was quite obese, and lost a lot of weight and was really proud of himself. And then we could say he sort of relapsed in the sense. Not not not all the way, but but far along. But his tone around it was very different.[1:13:28] Andrew Huberman: He knew he had accomplished what his goal once before. He was disappointed in himself, but he knew exactly why he had relapsed. It was very clear. He had Essentially, relapsed to the previous set of eating behaviors and lack of exercise behaviors and has now brought himself back again. And it It just resonates, with your story that, you know, once somebody understands they can do it because they've been there before.[1:13:52] Andrew Huberman: This this idea again of of of considering new rules that that there's, And and that brings me to this question about psychedelics and and the, frankly, the altered thinking and perception that occurs in In high dose psilocybin clinical sessions, it seems that the disordered thinking, even though It could, be random. Right? Hearing hearing colors and and seeing sounds is always the, you know, kinda cliche statement of the Timothy Leary area. Yeah. Also, you know, right there, that's a Stroop task of sorts.[1:14:26] Andrew Huberman: It's a it's a it's a synesthesia. It's a combining of perceptions, but it's a it's sort of Stroop task ish in that It's a new set of rules for the same stuff.[1:14:35] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[1:14:36] Andrew Huberman: Right? And people do many people do report improvements in, trauma related symptomology and depression as I understand it from my read of the clinical trials after taking psilocybin because during those sessions, something comes to mind spontaneously as, you and I were talking about earlier. They will report, for instance, A new way of seeing the old problem.[1:15:00] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right.[1:15:01] Andrew Huberman: The old problem could be the voice that they're no good. They'll never nothing will ever work out or could be even more subtle than that. So, that raises 2 questions. 1 is about the basic functioning of the human brain, which is why do you think, The brain would ever hold on to rules that, don't serve us well. That's 1 question.[1:15:23] Andrew Huberman: Yes. And then the second question is, What is it about Psilocybin and related molecules in terms of their neurochemistry, in terms of the ways they disrupt thinking and feeling, etcetera, during the session that allow this, novel rule consideration Phenomenon.[1:15:44] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. So the first question, I think it's an it's an it's an evolutionary neurobiology answer. Right? I think that At the individual person level, you know, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense that when we're really stressed out, some of us wanna eat more, Right? At the individual person level because it's like, that's not particularly that good for my health in the long term.[1:16:06] Dr. Nolan Williams: But if you think about it, like, You know, in some 500 years ago, a 1000 years ago, if I'm highly stressed out, it's most likely that I'm about To not have food at some point, and I should eat a bunch of food that is high fat, high sugar, high carb food to put on weight for that, you know, next phase Where in this stress, I may be in battle, and I don't have food, and I have enough fuel on board. Right? And so we We end up being, you know, we end up being a result of of probably a lot of biology that's not that useful in the modern era. And I think in the brain for For, say let's say, PTSD. Right?[1:16:42] Dr. Nolan Williams: A lot of a lot of veterans come back and they experience these PTSD symptoms, and they're not at all useful back home. Right? You know, they're, You know, they hear some loud noise, and all of a sudden, they're behind a car or they're behind a you know, I've I've heard of folks, you know, jump and run behind a trash can or whatever in the middle of Cisco when they hear a loud noise. But if you put them back in the battlefield[1:17:07] Andrew Huberman: Highly adaptive.[1:17:07] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's highly adaptive. Right? And so I think What what the what's interesting is that, we, in the absence of Using substances like psychedelics end up having these very persistent memories that are attached to negatively valence emotion predominantly. As you were saying earlier, the jacket in in in elementary school, we you know, I had various things like that for me too. Right?[1:17:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: You you You remember these things, and, and we we hold on to those things from, I think, an evolutionary neurobiology standpoint. But what seems to, for whatever reason, kind of alleviate that are these, Are these substances some new like MDMA, some that have been around for 1000 of years like psilocybin and used, in in kind of Sacramental and and as a sacrament in, in traditions, seem to have a therapeutic effect that seems to be pretty long lasting for these phenomenon. And so it's it's just curious. Right? It's curious That that in the absence of that, these things will keep going on and on.[1:18:24] Dr. Nolan Williams: But in the presence of that exposure, Then all of a sudden, you see a resolution of the problem. And we have some work now. We're treating folks with Navy SEALs, and data's still being, you know, being analyzed. But The anecdotes that we're getting right are folks are coming back, and they're saying, I finally that's finally gone. Right?[1:18:44] Dr. Nolan Williams: This kind of The set of PTSD symptoms are finally gone. And so this idea that for whatever reason, going into What's probably a highly plastic state, like we're talking about earlier, upregulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor in the case of Ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic factor, This highly plastic state and, the ability to re you know, kind of reexperience memories. And then, as you know, you know, we we We always reconsolidate a memory. When we bring it back up, we always reconcile, but reconsolidating it in that state, For whatever reason, may drive, drive a therapeutic effect. And, you know, the the the The jury's still out.[1:19:26] Dr. Nolan Williams: There's a I'm a I would say that I'm I'm kind of a I'm an agnostic to What tool I'm using kinda guy. Like, I'm my business is to find treatments that help people, and so I'm much more, like, Pragmatic about it. You know? If if this sort of thing, which, has a lot of cultural baggage, but if this sort of thing ultimately ends up being therapeutic, if we can design trials that convince me and others that it is, then we should absolutely use it. You know?[1:19:58] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, and if it doesn't, then, then then we clearly shouldn't use it. Right? And I think that's a big That's a big question the field is gonna have to work out. We have a hard time blinding these trials because the placebo condition is not easy to To pull off,[1:20:14] Andrew Huberman: obviously A placebo for a psilocybin journey is is hard to imagine.[1:20:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: We've got you know, we've been thinking about this, and maybe that Ketamine study that I was talking about earlier. If we could give people Naltrexone and Ketamine, maybe that's a good, you know, a good sort of Placebo condition. Right? Because we know that we can block any of the actual antidepressant effects at Ketamine. They can still haven't experienced.[1:20:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: You know? And so That's one way of doing it, but thinking about ways to do that and really kind of proving this out, and that's been, yeah, I think that's been been kinda central to the way I've been Been thinking about this, but, yeah, I think there's the the work that's been done so far, the 1st psilocybin trial, the first MDMA trial is published in Nature Medicine recently.[1:20:59] Andrew Huberman: And what do those generally say? I mean, the that that that they are effective for a number of people after 1 session, 2 sessions. Yeah. But what's what's sort of the general contour? Let's let's, start with psilocybin and MDMA.[1:21:11] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. MDMA appears to and and, you know, 1 to a few MDMA sessions have, an anti PTSD effect that seems to be, You know, outside of the kind of standard assumed levels of PTSD improvement that you can observe in individuals, with this level of PTSD. Right? So what we call the effect size, which is essentially like a a Mesh Cohen's d effect size is a measure that allows for you to compare different treatments to each other for different conditions that are, you know, agnostic to what the actual illness is. You know, the effect sizes there, you know, approach effect sizes, the the things that are pretty effective like antacids For heartburn.[1:21:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And you see that with with, with MDMA treatment.[1:21:59] Andrew Huberman: So does that mean that, for people that have trauma who do a and, again, we're talking about in a clinical setting, they they take 1 or 2 doses of of MDMA. I think the standard maps dose is a 150 to 175 milligrams. Again, doing this with a physician, etcetera, controlled clinical trial, legal.[1:22:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep. Exactly.[1:22:18] Andrew Huberman: They do it once or twice. And broadly speaking, what percentage of people who had trauma report Feeling significant relief from their trauma afterward.[1:22:28] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's about 2 thirds of people had a had, a clinically significant, change in their PTSD.[1:22:35] Andrew Huberman: That's impressive.[1:22:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: Which is impressive. Right?[1:22:37] Andrew Huberman: And how how long lasting was that? I mean, these trials were ended pretty recently. So[1:22:41] Dr. Nolan Williams: It it appears to last for a while in the earlier trials where they followed people out. It seemed to last for kind of in the years range for some people, and so it's, you know, it's pretty It's pretty compelling. Psilocybin, you know, that in contrast it with Ketamine, which only on average lasts about a week and a half for a single Infusion. So it's a much shorter[1:23:01] Andrew Huberman: So they have to get repeated infusions of ketamine every 10 days or so[1:23:05] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Or forever? For some people where they end up getting, like like like a bunch of doses for a couple of weeks, and then for some people, that seems to last a while. You know, that's where I think I think the the psilocybin story for depression and the, and the MDMA story for PTSD seem more interesting to me.[1:23:24] Andrew Huberman: For, psilocybin, what is the, rough percentages on and this would be relief not from trauma, but from depression.[1:23:31] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So it's, you know, an open label study is it's closer to, like, half to 2 thirds of people end up getting better depending upon their level of treatment resistance. In the In the, blinded trials, it was more like a a third or so of people, you know, experienced, relief.[1:23:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: And and this is, you know, this is a press release of of the data, you know, and so it hasn't, to my knowledge, it hasn't been published yet. And so, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing the full paper on that one, but But it, you know, separated from from placebo and looks, you know, looks pretty pretty good as well. It looks like it's, you know, The first of 2 trials that need to be done to get this thing, approved for treatment resistant depression. And so, so that stuff looks looks good.[1:24:12] Andrew Huberman: In terms of MDMA, for many years, it was reported in the popular press, and there was a paper published in Science that MDMA was neurotoxic, That it would kill serotonin neurons. This was what was always said. Then I saw another paper published in Science That wasn't a retraction of the previous paper, but rather was a 2nd paper on the same group that essentially admitted that the 1st time around, they had Injected these monkeys because of the with not MDMA, but with methamphetamine Yep. Which is known to be neurotoxic.[1:24:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right.[1:24:46] Andrew Huberman: It was kind of a public ad admittance of oops or big, like, really big screw up, so oops, but never a retraction and then never really a a publicly acknowledged, correction in the in the popular press. So It seems that in the appropriate dosage range and with these 1 or 2 sessions, my assumption, and this again is an assumption, tell me if I'm right or wrong here is that MDMA is not neurotoxic for serotonergic neurons at appropriate doses and with appropriate sourcing, etcetera.[1:25:21] Dr. Nolan Williams: It was an interesting study that, I think the guy's name is Halpern. Last name's Halpern. It,[1:25:26] Andrew Huberman: Not Casey Halpern.[1:25:27] Dr. Nolan Williams: Not Kate a different different now. I think Joshua Halpern, I'm blanking on his first name, but but,[1:25:32] Andrew Huberman: Casey Halpern was a guest on this podcast, and is a former colleague of ours at Stanford who, unfortunately, we lost to University of Pennsylvania. And, Maybe someday we'll we'll we'll bring him back.[1:25:42] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. That's right. So this this individual, you know, received some NIH funding to actually NIDA, You know, National Institute For Drug Abuse funding to, to explore, individuals, of the Mormon faith In Utah who, who partake in only MDMA. So, The way this works is that, MDMA, happened kind of after A lot of the religious documents were were, developed, and so MDMA isn't on the prohibited Drug list.[1:26:19] Andrew Huberman: The banned substance[1:26:20] Dr. Nolan Williams: The banned substance list.[1:26:21] Andrew Huberman: I have some good friends who are LDS.[1:26:23] Dr. Nolan Williams: Very unfortunate. People. I do I do as well, you know, just to kind of set a facts. You know? And so, so these these folks, only use MDMA, but they don't they're not, Yeah.[1:26:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: The problem of with some people using drugs is the poly substance users. Right? So you can't you can't say it's the MDMA if they've also taken other psychedelics, and they've taken opiates, and they've taken k. And then you have this picture where you can't really tease out that problem. But but with this, right, it was Just individuals that were part of the Mormon faith, and so they they were, kind of purist in the sense they only used MDMA, and he confirmed all of that.[1:27:01] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, and it was a a brilliant study. Right? Because then he was able to go in and look at their cognitive profiles versus Individuals, you know, of the same geography, the same faith, all of that, that happened to not take, MDMA and found there were no neurocognitive, differences.[1:27:19] Andrew Huberman: So it it does that mean that it it was not damaging?[1:27:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: It was not damaging. It it it's hard to know because To really do this study well, you'd have to track these folks down before they ever took MDMA Mhmm. And do a pre post and compare to people that didn't. But, You know, this is about as good of a study as you can do, in given the, you know, given the situation to be able to check this out. Additionally, when I was back in Charleston and working at the Medical University of South Carolina, I one of my mentors, there, doctor Wagner, was a neuropsychologist at MUSC, and he was also the the neuropsychologist for the early MDMA trials.[1:28:00] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so he did all the neurocognitive batteries for individuals pre, post, and similarly did not see any Changes in neurocognitive profiles in a negative way. And so, you know, there's there's data from experimental patients receiving this. There's data from people that are chronic users, you know, who only take MDMA, and that that combination of, of data suggests that, there's no there's certainly, no apparent risk in the kind of 1 to 2 to 3 dose range. It's it's probably unlikely that at least, you know, modest dose exposure over a lifetime doesn't appear to have a A profound neurocognitive, damaging effect. Yeah.[1:28:46] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Yeah. I know that, sourcing is key, and we're here trials where purity is assured. And, you know, years ago when so called raves were really popular maybe they're still popular. Never been Been to one, so I wouldn't know, if they're happening or not.[1:29:03] Andrew Huberman: That's how, in the know I am. But it was clear that, you know, testing for purity was important because Sometimes, the drugs, are made such that there are contaminants like methamphetamine, which we No is highly neurotoxic. I think that one reason why people think that MDMA might be neurotoxic is the the, reported, drop in energy or sort of feeling fatigued for a few days afterward. I spoke to a physician colleague of ours who said that that, very likely has something to do with the surgeon prolactin that arrives subsequent to the big dopamine surge that occurs in, in MDMA. And I mention that because I know a number of people, talk about serotonin depletion after taking MDMA.[1:29:50] Andrew Huberman: He has it in mind that while that could be true, It's likely that anytime somebody takes something or it does something where there's a huge lift in dopamine, that there's very likely a huge compensatory increase in prolactin it follows in prolactin, has a kind of sedative effect, numbing effect on mood and libido, etcetera, that eventually also wears off. Does that make sense to you as a physician?[1:30:10] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. It makes sense. I mean, you know, the difference between, say, MDMA and and psilocybin is that MDMA is kind of an amphetamine of sorts. Right? So it has It has effects in dopamine in the, in psilocybin's, you know, pretty pretty neutral and, you know, maybe a little bit of dopamine effects, but kind of much more of a serotonergic focused drug.[1:30:30] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, yeah, I think you're gonna see kind of a different profile after. And and that makes I haven't heard that story, but that makes sense to me 2.[1:30:38] Andrew Huberman: Since you mentioned psilocybin, let's talk a little bit about the neurochemistry of psilocybin as a serotonergic agent. My understanding is it, operates on these, Is it the 5 HT serotonin, 2 c receptor?[1:30:50] Dr. Nolan Williams: 2 a.[1:30:50] Andrew Huberman: 2 a. Excuse me. 2 a and and, receptors. And that I've seen a bunch of different reports in terms of what it's actually doing to the brain while people are under the effects of the drug. And this is important for us to segment out because There are the effects that happen while people are under the influence and then the more long lasting effects.[1:31:06] Andrew Huberman: But some of the effects I've heard about are, for instance, tell me again if these are right or wrong, that there is increased Sort of broader areas of the brain being proactive than would normally occur. Mhmm. Maybe that explains some of the synesthesias, you know, seeing Sounds and and hearing colors and the as the trivial example, but rule breaking Yep. Within the mind. But then I've also heard, that perhaps it's lack of gating of sensory input.[1:31:39] Andrew Huberman: So, normally, if I'm looking at something, I'm not thinking about The sensation in my right toe unless it's irrelevant. But if I'm thinking about the sensation in my right toe, I'm generally not thinking about the truck around the corner. So We have these attentional spotlights, but then somehow it creates a more it adds spotlights.[1:31:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. It de it de gates the thalamus.[1:31:57] Andrew Huberman: De gates the thalamus, right through the reticular thalamic structure. So, what is the evidence that any of that is true, and, are there other phenomena? Is there involvement of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex that we are aware of? And where I'm really headed here for, in a few minutes is, You know, is there a place for combining directed stimulation of the brain with psychedelics so that the effects of serotonin could be primarily within the structures that you know from your work to be relevant to to depression. So what so but to simplify it first, what's going on when one takes psilocybin, And, why is it interesting in light of depression?[1:32:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Definitely. So, David Nutt and Robin Carin Harris' work around neuroimaging, psychedelics are kind of the some of the 1st folks to do that work. And, you know, and to their great surprise, they thought there was gonna be an increase in Activity on psychedelics and what they found is the opposite. Right?[1:32:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: There's kind of a an overall decrease in the level of activity in the brain, with psychedelics. They they have also looked at connectivity, and there's this kind of small world, you know, large world connectivity that you you think about. And so, You know, small world meaning there's a lot there's kind of a much more kind of focused kind of cortical function or, you know, subcortical function or whatever it is. And, and what you see is a difference in that, in that level of engagement of of brain regions, so the connectivity global connectivity to your point kind of increases. And so, you know, it's it's it's interesting.[1:33:31] Dr. Nolan Williams: You know? I think to to kinda have a convergent theory on this, it's still, You know, to be determined, there's still a lot of work I think that needs to be done, but, but it's certainly, suggestive that there's pretty profound changes In, in brain activity and brain connectivity after and what we found to be really interesting is the The antidepressant effects of psilocybin have a particular, connectivity change that we also see with our Our TMS approach is right, and it's this connectivity between the subgenual anterior cingulate and the default mode network. And so when we do this effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, we see a down regulation, the connectivity between them Negatively balanced mood state in the case of depressed individuals in the self representation of the brain, and you see that same connectivity change occur post Psilocybin, you know, suggesting there's a convergent mechanism, and it makes sense. Right? You've kinda got an overconnected negatively valanced System conflict system that's kind of, you know, kind of attached onto the self representation, and people feel stuck.[1:34:46] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And then when you when you do whatever you do that's effective, it it un it unpairs those 2 systems.[1:34:53] Andrew Huberman: I want to ask you about This phenomenon I've heard about during psilocybin journeys, I heard about this from, doctor Matthew Johnson who's running a lot of the clinical trials at, Johns Hopkins and, has been a guest on this podcast. He said that there's something seems to be important about the patient Who's depressed or who's and is under the the influence of psilocybin or the patient who's trying to get over smoking or an eating disorder who's taking psilocybin and is in the clinic, That there's something important to this notion of letting go, that people will feel as if Their thoughts and their feelings and maybe even their body aren't under their control, and that the clinician's job under those circumstances is, of course, to make that they're physically safe, so they don't jump out a window or try actually, give an example of a patient who thought that, I think it was a she could move into the painting in the wall, and obviously, That wasn't true in the real world, although it was true in her mind. So they prevented her from doing that. But that letting go, that somehow, untethering from the autonomic arousal that's occurring is important, which brings us back to this idea Or me back to this idea of of a like a seesaw where you're sort of letting go of the hinge.[1:36:07] Andrew Huberman: You just sort of you your heart rate's going up. Like, just go with it and trust. You know? Your heart rate's going down, just go with it and trust. You're thinking about, something very powerful and depressing related to your childhood.[1:36:19] Andrew Huberman: You're just supposed to go there without fear. You're thinking about what's possible in terms of what could happen. So, anyway, you you get the the the picture. Can we think of that as as just the willingness to do a 1000000 different variations on the the emotional Stroop task? Know, you will entertain the full full array of rules within your head and consider them, whereas there's something more to it.[1:36:45] Andrew Huberman: You know? And, again, we're We're in the the the outer margins of of understanding here. But what are your thoughts on on this notion of letting go as such a key variable for relief from depression during this psychedelic journey.[1:36:58] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. So I'll I'll talk a little bit about something called exposure and response prevention therapy that that's a typical Kinda gold standard treatment for OCD, and it'll help to kinda, you know, help help this a little bit, conceptually. And so what that really is is it's a letting go therapy. And so, you know, exposure response prevention, the idea is that you have to expose the individual To something that you know, some something that triggers an obsession that they then want to do whatever the compulsion is. Right?[1:37:30] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so I'll give you, you know, my 1st exposure and response prevention patient when I was a resident. About, leaving the lights on this car. And, and so what we did is we went out And we turned the lights on in his car and locked his door, so his lights were on. And he was super worried this is gonna kill his battery. And we went and we spent an hour talking about things.[1:37:58] Dr. Nolan Williams: We went back out to his car, and his battery was fine, and his lights were on. And he cranked the car, and we did it maybe one other time, and then all of a sudden, that was gone. Right? And that's the idea is that, You know, you're essentially exposing, and you wanna do it at levels that are, from an anxiety standpoint, tolerable. But exposing the person to something and then letting them see that that exposure ends up being fine.[1:38:27] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? It ends up not causing the thing that they're that they end up being worried about. And so, you know, in some sense, Being in the psychedelic state and we are all all we are all taught at a level to to retain some level of control. You know, people have More or less of that, but we're all effectively retaining some level of control. We all wake up in the morning and put clothes on to go into society.[1:38:53] Dr. Nolan Williams: We all Try to say you know, most people try to say the right things. They don't try to do things that are outside of cultural norms when they're in conversation. And so We're we're constantly at some level controlling the situation that we're in, and so it's, you know, it's not it makes a lot of sense that in that state, Part of the therapeutic effect that may be linked to the neural circuitry is this idea of letting go and essentially letting the system, You know, the network configuration maybe, whatever it is, assume a state that you've Essentially been fighting the whole time the same way that my OCD patient was fighting this, need to click the off button on the lights of his car 50 times before he would Go and do whatever he needed to do. And in some level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn the lights on and him not do anything, We're letting go meaning in the psychedelic state. You're just letting go of whatever it is you're holding on to negatively balanced.[1:40:01] Dr. Nolan Williams: Think thoughts about yourself in the in the, you know, setting of having depression or, you know, reexperiencing a trauma, You know, memory and allowing that to just happen and re seeing it again through a different light, you know, it feels the same in the sense that That's allowing for whatever is going on with these psychedelic states to do whatever they do.[1:40:24] Andrew Huberman: Fascinating. You said it's Exposure response therapy is the[1:40:28] Dr. Nolan Williams: traditional name. Response prevention therapy. Yeah.[1:40:31] Andrew Huberman: Therapy done outside of this of the psychedelic journey.[1:40:34] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's done outside the psychedelic journey, but that idea of letting go is is, you know, present in both of those. You know, psychotherapy, kind of straight up Totally sober, non psychedelic, non anything psychoanualized psychotherapy that we know works really well for OCD and then, You know, in that psychedelic state and so people have done studies with with psilocybin, and now there's some studies with MDMA trying to look at, you're treating OCD, you know, with the same sort of idea of letting go. Right? And and how do you how do you, have an OCD patient kind of let go, maybe even letting go of not washing their hands anymore, you know, kind of accepting the idea they're not gonna get Germs in their hands or whatever it is. You know?[1:41:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so it's kind of part of that part and parcel, that same sort of thinking.[1:41:23] Andrew Huberman: When I was in college, I developed a compulsive superstition. I'm not afraid to admit this. I I'm somehow developed a knock on wood superstition, and I would, I was actually kind of ashamed by of it because it Rationally made no sense. I'm not I don't consider myself a superstitious person, never was a superstitious kid. You know, I'd step on the sidewalk cracks.[1:41:44] Andrew Huberman: I'd I'd walk under ladders. You know? I'd even try to walk under a ladder, even though I don't suggest it. But somehow, I picked this thing up, and, and I used to sneak it at times. I told my girlfriend at the time that I had it in hopes that that would prevent me from doing it.[1:42:01] Andrew Huberman: And it's it's tricky. Sometimes it actually comes back where I think, gosh, I didn't say, you know, knock on wood. I didn't knock on wood. I hope that doesn't actually happen. And it's And it's, quote, unquote, crazy.[1:42:11] Andrew Huberman: Right? But I crazy in the sense that it makes no sense rationally why the events would be linked. And yet, I think a lot of people out there do have in internal superstitions. Yeah. Maybe by talking about it now, it'll it'll go away.[1:42:23] Andrew Huberman: I just see clearly, I just need to challenge it. Yeah. You know, know, it's, anyway, I mentioned it because I, I consider myself, you know, generally rational person. But, it's interesting how these motor patterns, get get activated and and this notion of letting go because I don't actually know what consequence I fear. And the fear as I was hearing the example you gave, you know, the fear of the car running battery running down.[1:42:45] Andrew Huberman: I was about to say, well, what if the battery actually did run out? Then the therapy would be undermined. And yet That could also be interesting too because it's not that big of a deal. You jump the car. Yeah.[1:42:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right.[1:42:54] Andrew Huberman: But in my case, I I need to think about what the ultimate, fear is.[1:42:58] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. And, you know, I I think, I think a lot of people so there's it's interesting if you look at, say, the OCD scale or the depression scale or whatever. We don't define normal as 0. We define normal as some number range above. So 0 to, in the case of the Montgomery Aspert Depression Rating Scale, one one of the depression scales we use, 10.[1:43:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? That's the normal range. And so People can have some sadness and still be considered normal. In the case of the OCD scale, it's about the same ten, right, where we say it's kind of Starts to be, you know, you know, mildly abnormal or something. And I always, you know, I'd always tell the medical students, look.[1:43:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: My friends that are surf instructors, they're more like a 0 on the. People that are professionals, you know, they're they're they're nonzero, but you're it's still within the normal Range, and and especially, you know, in the in the case that you're talking about, it doesn't sound like it got in your way. It doesn't sound I mean, you you're obviously highly successful tenured professor At Stanford and do all the the great things that you do, and so it's it's very much kind of within the normal range, and it's I think Totally totally assume that a lot of people have have these sorts of things. And as long I think something as a psychiatric diagnosis When it severely impairs your ability to function, and that's when we kinda cross that threshold. But, you know, I think that I think that a lot of people and it's great that you're bringing this up.[1:44:26] Dr. Nolan Williams: I mean, it's very anti stigmatizing that you're bringing it up. Right? Because I think a lot of people hold that stuff in, and they don't wanna talk about it because They're worried that somebody else may think something, but the the reality is as a psychiatrist, I talked to a lot of patients, a lot of people that are, you know, family members, You know, folks that are just going through a death in the family, whatever it is, and what you figure out is, like, everybody's got a Little something here and there. Everybody has the knock in some way, if that makes sense. And it's just and we're we're just all we're all just kinda more predisposed not to talk about it, but I think it's important to talk about it because I think that when we start all talking about it, then we realize that we're all Kinda in this together in a way, and that we're and then some folks that, you know, have, you know, have to knock a 100 times.[1:45:14] Dr. Nolan Williams: We call that OCD When you know? And they have all, you know, germ they're worried about germs and all these other things. We call that OCD. And then in that circumstance, You know, they need treatment. Right?[1:45:25] Dr. Nolan Williams: But but it is really on just like blood sugar, just like blood pressure, it's on a range, you know, and not just these discrete diagnoses. You have them or you don't.[1:45:34] Andrew Huberman: It's good to know. I actually feel some relief just hearing this because I I am slightly I I wouldn't say ashamed or sort of embarrassed by it, but I I I offer it as a you know, that you know? It it is what it is as they say, Yeah. And it certainly doesn't seem to hinder hinder my my life much. Knock on wood.[1:45:54] Andrew Huberman: Nice. So if we could talk a bit about Ibogaine. I Yeah. I don't know much about Ibogaine. Although anytime I hear the, you know, a I n e, you know, lidocaine, Ibogaine, I think of an anesthetic.[1:46:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And and going to the dentist, which is an unpleasant experience for me, generally. What is Ibogaine? Does this have anything to do with the so called toad? People talk about smoking frog skin, toad skin.[1:46:24] Andrew Huberman: What is it used for clinically? Is it legal in the US in term as a clinical tool? Who's using it and for what purposes? If you could educate me on Ibogaine, I truly know nothing about it except I think I know how to spell it correctly.[1:46:39] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. That's fair. Yeah. So so Ibogaine is a, is one of the alkaloids that you can extract from Iboga tree root bark that's, typically growing in the comp the in the country of Gabon, Africa. So Gabon is one of the West African countries, kind of middle, of Africa on the on the West Coast and, and Gabon is has a a a group of of folks, You know, called the.[1:47:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's a religious kinda sacramental, group that, sacramentally uses Iboga root bark is part of of that this the sacrament, and they, they've been using Iboga Root bark for a very long time, and it's it's, you know, part of the tradition. There's a whole, there's a whole set of Of kind of ceremony around it. If you're interested in this, there's a book called, Breaking Open the Head by, Daniel Pinchbeck that goes Goes through and talks about this, this whole process. But, essentially, the gabonese have been using this for a long time, And, and it's a it's a kind of an atypical psychedelic. It's not it's not a psychedelic that We normally think about with psilocybin and LSD where there are visual perceptual changes.[1:48:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? So if you if you take psilocybin or LSD, which you What you experience is you experience these kind of visual, perceptual differences in the external world. Right? And on enough LSD or psilocybin, An individual can actually perceive something visually in the external world that isn't there as we talked about earlier. Ibogaine doesn't do that.[1:48:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: Ibogaine does something different. It it's kind of like have you ever seen minority report with, you know, the movie with Tom Cruise? I think 15 or 20 years ago or something, so it dates us a little bit. But, it was this it was this movie where he would be able to go and see these kind of precrimes, and he had this big you know, this big screen where he could look at scenes from from time and, like, kinda go through that scene and see it. And so what What, individuals taking Ibogaine will say is that open eyes, they don't see anything.[1:49:06] Dr. Nolan Williams: But closed eyes, they'll go back through and reexperience Earlier life memories, and they will be able to experience it from a place of Empathy not only for themselves, but from others and kind of a detached empathy and being able to see this As almost a third party, even though they were there, but they're able to see it, you know, as a third party. So Claudio Naranjo, a psychiatrist from Argentina. You know, describe this for a lot of books that that he wrote, and then I think then eighties nineties around this. And so, you know, Ibogaine's been around for a long time. Howard Lotsoff, American guy that brought it over from, from Africa.[1:49:49] Dr. Nolan Williams: He was a polysubstance user, used every drug, You know, on you know, that he get his hands on, took Ibogaine, including a lot of other psychedelics, by the way, took Ibogaine and then never did another drug again supposedly Because he had such a profound Ibogaine experience, Ibogaine is in no way a recreational substance. It's not a recreational substance if you want it to be a recreational substance because you're essentially having this what they call life review. They also call it 10 years of psychotherapy in a night. So these are the Terminology that people talk about. The issue[1:50:21] Andrew Huberman: long does it last? Is it truly 1 night?[1:50:24] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's it's usually you know, we can go depending upon if you get redosed or anything go Sometimes depending upon how fast you metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours. Sometimes it can be shorter, but it is a long time. Wow. It's a very long time. So it's it's definitely the longest acting psychedelic substance I know of.[1:50:43] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, And so people people, you know, will take this, and they'll they'll have this reevaluation of The a given memory, and then is we were talking earlier, reconsolidate that memory again, and then it seems to have, you know, an effect of of that reconsolidation process. And so, You know, about 5 4, 5 years ago, I was tapped by Rob Robert Malinka, one of the, neuroscientists, we both know, and the university says, well, there's a, you know, there's an unnamed donor that's very interested in In funding, a group you know, a scientific kinda open label study of, of these Navy SEALs that have been going down to Mexico and taking, and taking, Ibogaine and, and also on a 5 AME O DMT, which I'll talk about in a second, to treat PTSD, you know, They claimed to have traumatic brain injury, depression, you know, that whole constellation of symptoms. You know? And as as it was described to me, by Various people had done this by their spouses and and whatnot. You know, John we'll just say John.[1:51:50] Dr. Nolan Williams: John couldn't screw a light into a light Like, a light bulb into a light fixture. Right? They just they were just so debilitated. They couldn't do, you know, simple tasks, what we call activities of daily living. And they were coming back and having these really dramatic improvements in, in, you know, all aspects of of life.[1:52:10] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, we have, over the last couple of years, been able to, to do this first in human kind of full neurobiological clinical Neurocognitive evaluation of what Ibogaine is doing. In this case, in in, special operations, Special forces individuals, former Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, that that kind of crew folks, and look at the pre post changes that we, to be able to totally quantitate all of that, and so we've been able to capture all the clinical scales, you know, depression scales, PTSD scales, all that standard stuff, Neurocognitive batteries. So how does your executive function work? Specifically, how does your verbal memory, all of that? And then neuroimaging and EEG.[1:52:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: So this will be the first Human study of Ibogaine for those and the reason why is because Ibogaine is kind of the both seemingly the most potent and most, In in seemingly to me, at least, most powerful, psychedelic, but the The one that has the most risk too because it has a cardiac effect. It seems to be that you can screen people out that have risk off of their Electrocardiogram and and reduce the risk quite a bit, and that's what we we all did. But, but but that's why people haven't really studied it as much, and it's it isn't as, in addition, there's no right nobody goes to Rave on Ibogaine. There's no recreation at all with this. Not fun.[1:53:37] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's people say that it's relieving, but it's hard work. Right? Because, yeah, you're re you're reexamining things. And, you know, and so then so then we we we see these folks after, and I'll I'll tell you. You know, we haven't fully analyzed the data yet, but I'll tell you that, You know, from from what my folks are telling me, it's pretty dramatic.[1:53:59] Dr. Nolan Williams: You know? People come back, and they're doing, they're doing a lot better. They're doing a lot better, And, no nobody I'll knock on wood. Nobody's had any sort of, cardiac issue at all, in, you know, in in the cohort that we've studied, and, and they look a lot better, and they feel a lot better too. And, and they describe these experiences of being able to go back True.[1:54:24] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, you know, soldiers experience something called moral injury, right, where they maybe they dentally blew something up, and it had a kid in it or something like that. You know, you know, if they're in Afghanistan or Iraq, maybe a, you know, a child died on accident or maybe Maybe, you know, a a civilian died or whatever it was. Right? And they and they've suffered these moral injuries as part of the job, and it's almost one of the kind of, you know, vocational risks. They come back and say that they've they've they've, forgiven themselves, you know, which is which is huge.[1:54:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And then and part of that is Being able to see themself in a different light and having empathy finally for themself and being able to kinda have that experience of forgiving. And so so very cool. The the study, you know, what was happening was they were taking Ibogaine and then taking something called 5 MeO DMT. People call it toad.[1:55:15] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's the Sonoran, river toad, I think. It's like you you can find these in Mexico, find them in Arizona. In in the back of the the the toad, produces something old 5 MeO DMT, which is, You know, flavor of DMT that produces a particular psychedelic effect also used, as a sacrament.[1:55:38] Andrew Huberman: Is it a Dimethyltryptamine? Is that[1:55:40] Dr. Nolan Williams: It is it is a Five, MeO Dimethyltryptamine. So it's a kind of Dimethyltryptamine with with a kind of addition to it. The The deal there is, that it lasts longer than traditional DMT. You know, it's like 20 minutes to 5, 3, or whatever kind of thing. And, and so then so these guys were taking Ibogaine, and then they would take the 5 meO DMT after We had to kinda divorce those 2 things, be able to do the study and just understand what was doing.[1:56:10] Dr. Nolan Williams: And they go back down a month later, and they'll do the 5 ME ODMT.[1:56:14] Andrew Huberman: So 2 completely separate sessions?[1:56:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: 2 2 completely separate sessions.[1:56:17] Andrew Huberman: And then one quick question about Ibogaine before a bit more on 5 ME ODMT. Is the Ibogaine journey guided, or the person just closes their eyes and they just start falling into the back catalog of memories?[1:56:30] Dr. Nolan Williams: They have, a bunch of preparatory sessions, and then they have a bunch of sessions after that they kind of, they're able to kind of rehash things. During, there's a sitter that sits there And it kinda sits with them, and and and helps them out, but it's not it's pretty the phenomenon of the drug seems to drive a lot of this. Right? And so a lot of it ends up being what we call supportive psychotherapy or just kind of being there and, you know, maybe holding the person's hand. Maybe you're just Saying I'm here or maybe whatever it is, but you're making sure they know you're around, but you're not really there's not really an interaction per se.[1:57:05] Dr. Nolan Williams: And then the whole kind of goal there is just to get to get folks to kinda go back through and reexamine these memories and ultimately look look like they them. And, you know, it's very interesting. I mean, there's a there's this kind of as you said earlier, Timothy Leary kinda Socio cultural construct that ends up being overlaid over psychedelics. And what I think is that if you Rid yourself of all of those preconceived notions of what it is and isn't and the counterculture movement, all that stuff that neither of us were ever involved in, neither of us Partake in you know, it's it's kind of straight scientists looking at this. Right?[1:57:46] Dr. Nolan Williams: If you can kind of rid yourself of all those sociocultural constructions and then reexamine this, These if we just discovered these today, we would say that these sorts of drugs are a huge breakthrough in psychiatry because they allow for us to do a lot of the sorts of things we've been thinking about with with SSRIs, with psychotherapy, but Kind of combined. Right? Psychotherapy plus plus drugs in a in a substance that kind of allows you to reexamine these things. And so it's It's interesting. It'll you know, there's a lot to do to try to figure out if that's true.[1:58:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: You know? And and I can say that as it stands right now, we don't know if it's That statement is true. Right? There's a lot more work that needs to happen for that statement to be proven to be true. But the hypothesis is if it is true, Then it's very likely that this will be seen as a breakthrough because it allows you to do these sorts of things that you Can't do with normal waking consciousness, but also why we have to really think about this.[1:58:49] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, You know, these drugs can't be recreational drugs. They really shouldn't be recreational drugs. Right? They're really too powerful To be used in the context of recreation because they can put you into these states. And and this generation of psychedelic Researchers are really clear about that.[1:59:11] Dr. Nolan Williams: You know? I think the sixties folks were not clear about that, and they they felt like there was a whole this whole kind of cultural thing that was going on there. But I think this cohort of individuals really understands that in order to really make this happen, we have to understand that if you need a prescription For an SSRI, which doesn't change your consciousness a whole lot, and we we're very worried about that, and the doctor has to evaluate you for that every week, The idea that some of these substances would would go outside of of very strict medical supervision is, is kind of preposterous, actually. It's kind of It's kind of a a dumb moment, I think, for for all of medicine to say, look. We've you know, if we're gonna do this right, we've gotta do it in such a way that's So protected, that's so safe that we make sure people know these things are not recreational, and they're really for the pure purposes of of really powerfully changing, cognition for a while and letting people have these what seemed to be, you know, relatively therapeutic states.[2:00:13] Andrew Huberman: I think it's great that you're doing this study and along the lines of the sort of the early iterations of psychedelics and the counterculture Sure. Of the sixties seventies, some of which took place. Like, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I think, is actually[2:00:25] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[2:00:26] Andrew Huberman: Based on, the Menlo Park VA, which is Yep. That's true. You know, in our neighborhood of Stanford. And things are quite a bit different now. I know, you and I have spent some time with the Operators and former operators at at an event in last Veterans Day, in fact, the so called Veterans Solutions Group that's, Pioneering a lot of these psychedelic treatments for former special operators and current special operators.[2:00:49] Andrew Huberman: And what's interesting to me about that is in contrast to The counterculture movement of the sixties seventies, that room was filled with people that are very much of a structure, the military. Right? So it's no longer, considered left wing, right wing, anti military, promilitary. Here, this isn't just but 1 group of people who's exploring psychedelics as a treatment for Trauma and PTSD and other other things. And, of course, you also have other domains of society looking at this.[2:01:16] Andrew Huberman: And in fact, there were but it was really interesting because there were both, Far left and far right politicians at that event[2:01:24] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right.[2:01:25] Andrew Huberman: Up on stage together[2:01:26] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right.[2:01:26] Andrew Huberman: Talking about, In kind of, lighter terms, heart medicine, but also talking about neurobiology and talk it was just fascinating from a from the perspective of somebody who's trying to learn about this stuff that Psychedelic therapies no longer sit within the anti establishment realm. It's it's both It's it's it's independent of all that. Certainly, when people in the military are adopting it as a potential treatment. Absolutely. Again, still under exploration, but also under exploration at Universities like Stanford and Johns Hopkins and UCSF and University College London and on and on, along the lines of tree barks and toad skins, Tell me about Ayahuasca.[2:02:06] Andrew Huberman: And as a plant, you know, it's intriguing. And is it a proserotonergic, Drug like Psilocybin, and is it useful for the same sorts of conditions that we've talked about thus far and if you could, perhaps tell me a little bit also about the Brazilian prisoner study. Yeah.[2:02:26] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca is another psychedelic. It's used as a sacrament, in, in Brazil and, in Peru and Ecuador and Colombia. So a lot of the South American countries.[2:02:41] Dr. Nolan Williams: And, and what they do is they combine Two plants together with where 1 plant, of the 2 plant combination would effectively do nothing, But the 2 plant combination together is capable of producing, producing this very profound psychedelic effect. And what's Really kind of curious is that there as I understand it, 10 to 20000 plant species in the Amazon, And somehow, somebody[2:03:15] Andrew Huberman: tried them all.[2:03:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: Combined these 2 plants together in certain proportionality And cooked this for 5, 10 hours to the point where you cook out the Dimethyltryptamine out of one of the plants and cook out The reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor out of the other plant, it's such a way that the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents The the GI breakdown of the Dimethyltryptamine in such a way that it's then allowed to cross the blood brain barrier and get into the brain. And if you didn't add the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant derived into this combination, then it would never cross the brain. If you put people on a standard psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor that wasn't reversible, You'd you'd throw them into serotonin syndrome. Right? So this kind of, like, sweet spot that somehow Ayahuasca Practitioners have found being able to get DMT into the brain from an oral source with this combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor It's curious.[2:04:27] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so that that substance has been explored as an antidepressant agent, and some studies have looked at that. It also seems to be very safe. There, there was a there's a psychiatrist down at, UCLA Harbor who's done a lot of work with this where, where he's looked at Children even that have been exposed to to kinda small doses of Ayahuasca is is kind of a sacrament within Amazonian, I've been found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects in adults, and, and so it appears to be safe. It's part of it's kind of part and brought into various religions, including kind of merged with Catholicism in South America, which kind of very interesting. And so, you know, in some sects of Catholicism in Brazil, It's used as sacrament during religious, ceremonies.[2:05:21] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so it became interesting to Brazilian researchers as to whether or not They could affect recidivism rates for prisoners in Brazilian prisons. Right? So they gave half of the prisoners, you know, some sort of inert substance in half of the prisoners a, Ayahuasca session, And the the, recidivism rate or the return to prison rate in the Ayahuasca exposed individuals was statistically significantly lower Then the recidivism rate in the, in the control group suggesting that, you know, whatever is going on there Seems to have an effect on whatever drives criminal behavior, whatever criminal behavior that happened to be, and I don't have the the details on the exact nature of the crime. You know, no I am also in no way saying that we should just be giving psychedelics to to to folks in prison and all of that. I think that that that that is A very edgy thing to do and probably not something that anybody should try, but but it does it does kinda bring up this this Curious question of of what is it about that that would drive people to, to change those behaviors, and and why Why do people make those behavioral decisions?[2:06:34] Dr. Nolan Williams: And in a lot of times, if you look at prisons in the United States, You know, you said people say this. What's the biggest mental health facility in the in the United States? It's a prism.[2:06:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's a a lot to unpack there For sure, you know, the homeless issue, the prison issue, it does lead to something that I heard recently, which is related to all this, which is, cannabis. Yeah. You know, we hear a lot nowadays about, people say, well, it's safer than alcohol. And we did an episode on alcohol that, At least by my read of the literature, indeed, alcohol does seem to be, quite bad for our health beyond the I think and it's pretty clear that not drinking is better your health than drinking at all.[2:07:19] Andrew Huberman: And here, I'm not trying to tell people what to do, but that those are what the data say, and forget the studies on red wine. You'd have to drink so much red wine to get enough Veratrol. It's not even clear if it's Veratrol does anything useful anyway, etcetera, etcetera. Nonetheless, cannabis is now available in a lot of Very high potency forms. People are vaping cannabis.[2:07:38] Andrew Huberman: People are smoking cannabis. I certainly am not saying that cannabis is Bad for people necessarily, although I think children, I would I hope that their brain development would be be completed first, you know, get to age 25. I know that sounds late for a lot of people, but the THC obviously taps into some, endogenous systems of of, and the cannabinoid systems, and it is powerful. And I've seen this, this report that was in Lancet Psychiatry This last year that said that early use of potent cannabis, meaning age 14 to 20 or so, can potentially lead to an exacerbation of psychosis later in life.[2:08:20] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yep.[2:08:20] Andrew Huberman: And I actually put this out on social media, and it sort of exploded. Yeah. I didn't expect it to. And people were saying, well, that's not causal, and, obviously, it's not causal, because people said, well, maybe people with, psychotic Tendencies are seeking out cannabis. Although that's sort of a weak argument in in the sense that there's a at least a four times, yeah, 4 x increase in these, psychotic episodes for people later in life.[2:08:45] Andrew Huberman: But what are your thoughts about cannabis? Because I do wanna acknowledge that it does have medical benefits for certain things. Yep. Pain, chemotherapy. So by no means trying to to knock on cannabis in its appropriate medicinal use.[2:08:57] Andrew Huberman: But what what should we Think about cannabis in terms of this finding that can exacerbate psychosis in certain individuals.[2:09:06] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. So I think, you know, so there's this There's a couple of things. Right? So cannabis is is multiple, you know, cannabinoids. Right?[2:09:14] Andrew Huberman: THC, CBD, CBN, Sativas, and, you know, indicas. It gets That's yeah. There's a lot there to unpack.[2:09:21] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. There's a there's a lot of there's but there are 2 there are 2 main, you know, kind of chemicals you think about and kinda how things are are are, are essentially bread. Right? And so, you know, there's a lot of cannabis that's really bred to be very high, very potent THC, And there's a lot and there's cannabis where the THC's bred completely out. So there's stories, you know, from from Colorado.[2:09:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? This this, strain of of cannabis that's THC free. There's no THC at all, and it's all CBD. And they, it's called Charlotte's Web. And, a bunch of, kids' parents, 1 kid and then kind of a string of parents after that moved to Colorado when Cannabis was legal because legalized because CBD is antiepileptic.[2:10:09] Dr. Nolan Williams: So CBD is also antipsychotic. And so there have been a number of studies that if you give CBD at high doses, it's antipsychotic and schizophrenics, Established schizophrenic patients. The issue is that we've bred CBD out of marijuana selectively over have gotten very good at figuring out how to do that. Right? Conversely, THC is propsychotic and pro epileptic.[2:10:39] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right. And so when you talk about, does cannabis cause psychosis or does cannabis treat psychosis, it appears to be more related to the Proportions of CBD to THC than it does to the kind of idea of cannabis. So for me, there's a there's a kind I have no Stocks this or anything like that, but there's a company called GW Pharmaceuticals. I haven't looked into them in a while, but they, they they have, a lot of clinical trials for something called Dravet syndrome, which is a seizure disorder where kids sees a whole lot. Lennox Gastaut syndrome, which is a seizure disorder where kids are 300 times a day.[2:11:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: Both of these are, like, kids are seizing so much. They they're basically in a seizure or in the postictal phase constantly, And and they've failed everything. They failed barbiturates. They failed bromides, which we we just don't use anymore except into these cases because of the side effects. And they'll give kids CBD, and I think CBD is a pretty safe drug compared to bromide.[2:11:38] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And so this idea that that CBD in a kid is actually safe. It's a it's a it's a cannabinoid, but it's CBD, and it's safe. Right? And so That to me is totally fine.[2:11:52] Dr. Nolan Williams: Also giving CBD in is a adjunctive treatment for for schizophrenia. There have been some Positive trials and negative trials in that, but there seems to be no negative side effects. It seems to reduce some of the metabolic syndrome issues in in, folks with Schizophrenia who are having side effects from the primary antipsychotic. The the converse is there's clearly cases where people that are taking very high doses of THC They become psychotic. They get put into the psychiatric unit.[2:12:21] Dr. Nolan Williams: Nothing happens other than they they kind of get the THC out of their system, And then they resolve their psychosis. Right? And so that that and, you know, a handful of people who have had, you know, seizures related to to high doses of THC and syncope and all sorts of things. And so this idea that THC, High doses of THC can be propsychotic is also not taking a shot at people that think that cannabis overall is a good thing. It's just it it just is what it is.[2:12:51] Dr. Nolan Williams: And the kind of pure if you I think if you zoom back and you say you're a true naturalist, you're thinking about natural medicines in the world, You should think, well, probably marijuana was balanced THC, CBD at some point, and then we just we humans messed with it. Right? And and that most likely, that was probably okay at some level, and then We pushed it one way or another. And then what I mean by okay is in a 45 year old, it's okay kinda thing. Now What I think is going on with the with the kids, with the teenagers, is you've got prefrontal maturation.[2:13:29] Dr. Nolan Williams: Right? And then you're exposing them to a whole lot of High THC load. And, while it's unclear if it's if it's cause or effect, It's certainly in the picture. And if I were a parent, I wouldn't want my 16 year old smoking marijuana. If I were a parent and my 30 year old, Otherwise, healthy, totally fine, you know, whatever, banker, lawyer, kid Decided to try marijuana for the 1st time.[2:13:59] Dr. Nolan Williams: I wouldn't scold them about it. Right? So I think it's it's kind of a different thing. Right? I would never Want my up to 25 year old, just like you're saying, before prefrontal maturation, I've never want my kid to be exposed at all.[2:14:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: But it looks like Except in, you know, susceptible individuals that are susceptible to drug induced psychosis, it looks like, you know, it's a it's a relatively safe thing Past prefrontal maturation. You know, again, I can't I'm not gonna comment of cause and effect, but I but I would say that, you know, It doesn't if you're a parent, it doesn't make much sense. Right? It might you know, you wanna you never know what's ultimately gonna hurt your I mean, you know, my wife's pre we were talking about this earlier. My wife's pregnant now.[2:14:43] Dr. Nolan Williams: She she kind of avoids everything. Right? And rightfully so. Right? This idea that we just We wanna be careful when our children's brains are developing, and I think that's really what you were saying, and I think actually important.[2:14:55] Dr. Nolan Williams: The bigger question that you asked, Which is relative risks of drugs is an interesting one. So David Nutt published in I think it was in The Lancet. I'll have to look it up, but I think in The Lancet, An article about relative drug risks for the person and for society, and this was like he was on the The the UK is, like, British, drug, policy group where essentially what he showed was If you took if you look at societal risk plus personal risk and you combine those 2 you know what drug is the most Dangerous drug in the world?[2:15:32] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna guess it's alcohol.[2:15:33] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's alcohol. Right behind heroin and cocaine and and somewhere in middle is marijuana, and right on the tail end on the other on the exact other end of this, psilocybin.[2:15:46] Andrew Huberman: Is caffeine usually doesn't egg the list?[2:15:49] Dr. Nolan Williams: I I I may have been on the list. It's if it was, it was probably pretty close to psilocybin, but Somewhere in the middle was Ketamine. Somewhere in the middle was was was, amphetamine. Somewhere in the you know, a little closer to psilocybin, I think, was MDMA. You know?[2:16:03] Dr. Nolan Williams: But But if it's it's this combined personal, you know, kind of world risk of these things. And so Alcohol makes it because there's a huge amount of personal risk, and there's a huge amount of societal risk. Right? Drunk drivers Kill x amount of kid you know, people in the world Fight sexual assault All that.[2:16:23] Andrew Huberman: All that.[2:16:23] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. And then all the cancer and all that stuff. And so it it beats out cocaine. It beats out heroin. It beats out all of these things.[2:16:31] Dr. Nolan Williams: And and yet, and yet we don't We don't, as a culture, for whatever reason, we don't, as a culture, see it as a drug. And that's the part that really baffles me. You know?[2:16:44] Andrew Huberman: And I mean serve it. I mean, this is no knock on Stanford at all. Of course, I wouldn't do that. This is every institution I've been to, they serve alcohol at the graduate student events.[2:16:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right.[2:16:55] Andrew Huberman: You know, they serve alcohol. They we they do a happy hour. I've never been a drinker. Can take it or leave it. So Yeah.[2:17:01] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's the same.[2:17:01] Andrew Huberman: And I realized that some people, they really enjoy alcohol. Yeah. You know? My former partner, I mean, she just Was in that, you know, 10% or so of people who would have a glass of wine and just feel great, and the second one, feel great. I I just wanna take a nap after I I have a bit of alcohol, so it never does much for me.[2:17:18] Andrew Huberman: I always feel poisoned. I feel lucky in that sense, but it's it's unbelievable that it is so prevalent, and it's it's just it's baked into the medical even medical institutions. They they'll pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate the opening of a hospital.[2:17:32] Dr. Nolan Williams: That's right. That's right.[2:17:33] Andrew Huberman: You know? It's pretty crazy.[2:17:35] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. No. You're absolutely right. You know? I think I think what's gonna happen but this is me, You know, looking at the crystal ball a little bit, but I think what's gonna happen is what happened with doctors and smoking.[2:17:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: So if you look at the fifties sixties, right, there are all these pictures of doctors smoking cigarettes. You know, with patients or, you know, psychiatrists doing psychotherapy and smoking a cigarette with the patients sitting on the couch, you know, surgeons smoking a cigarette in between cases, There are all these pictures of that. Right? And now all of a sudden, smoking's totally banned. I think it's totally banned from most of Stanford campus.[2:18:06] Dr. Nolan Williams: My suspicion is, as as you're suggesting, right, you know, this is everywhere, and it's all kind of ubiquitous. At some critical point, some tipping point, Everybody's gonna realize that just like with smoking, we've gotta rid hospital systems and universities of alcohol. And at some point in 50 years, it's my view that we'll look at back at these these scenarios that you're talking about And and be like, you know what? We, we were foolish about this. We I can't believe that we we gave people Alcohol on the way you know, when they graduated from whatever, you know, and I think we'll have a different take on it.[2:18:45] Dr. Nolan Williams: But it's gonna take it's gonna take a longer time. I think I think people did a really good job time smoking a lung cancer, and it's, like, very, very simplistic story, smoking lung cancer. You know? Now, you know, as you know, alcohol increases the risk of a lot of different cancers. Not so clear which one.[2:19:04] Dr. Nolan Williams: I mean, there's, like, You know, the kind of oral like the throat, tongue cancer, that's one of[2:19:08] Andrew Huberman: Breast cancer.[2:19:08] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Breast cancer. You know? And so it's it's kind of just it's a harder story to tell, You know? And I think that's why and everybody you know?[2:19:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: And then there's this whole it's you know, my mom says this. It's like, I drink my glass of wine because My doctor told me it was heart healthy, and we we were talking about this. And I try to no. No. No.[2:19:27] Dr. Nolan Williams: But but doctor so and so said it's heart healthy, and so it ends up being this thing where, like, She's drinking alcohol because she thinks that it's it's good for her heart. And, you know, and it's it's hard. I've had those conversations with her. It's hard to Untie that, and I think that, yeah, at some point, we're gonna hit some some threshold moment. And it'll be interesting if we really look at the data and we really look at what's Safe and not safe from purely from this analysis, it kind of it kind of points to the right direction.[2:19:58] Andrew Huberman: It's really interesting. And, also, to say nothing, poor judgment Under the influence of alcohol. I mean, I I would venture that if we were to remove alcohol from university campuses watch watch the students are gonna lobby against me if I say this, but If you were to remove alcohol from campuses, I mean, just think about what I suspect would be the improvement in good decision making.[2:20:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: Oh, yeah.[2:20:21] Andrew Huberman: And that would occur. Or, you know, I I've got stories from graduate school and put in it It it was very different, you know, 10 years ago. There was a lot more alcohol consumption. Again, that was never my thing, but I know people who made really bad decisions. Yep.[2:20:37] Andrew Huberman: In any case, there's a whole landscape there emerging. I think you got your finger right on the pulse of it. I I wanna touch on something slightly different than what we've been talking about, but definitely related to depression. And this, again, is one of these intriguing but perplexing things, which is that Sleep deprivation[2:20:53] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[2:20:54] Andrew Huberman: Can improve symptoms of depression, and yet I'm personally very familiar with the fact that if I don't sleep Well, for 1 night or don't sleep at all. In fact, I do have an ability to function pretty well the next day. I'll do this non sleep deep rest practice I said I blab a lot about on the Huberman Lab Podcast, which is, for me, is tremendously restorative. But I like a good night's sleep. I think everybody Understands now, thanks to the great work of Matthew Walker and others that have really gotten out into the world saying, look.[2:21:23] Andrew Huberman: The foundation of mental health, physical health, and high Performance, if that's your thing, being a functional human being is to try and get enough quality deep sleep at least 80% of the nights of your life if you can. Yeah. That's that's something to focus on just like good nutrition, just like exercise and social connection, etcetera. So sleep deprivation, we know, can in particular, I think rapid eye movement components of sleep deprivation can improve the symptoms of depression, and yet, being sleep deprived can also really dysregulate our control of the autonomic system. I notice on night 2 or night 3 of poor sleep if I'm going through a stressful phase and happening.[2:22:02] Andrew Huberman: All of a sudden, my heart rate is chronically elevated. My thought patterns become really disrupted. I can't then Exercise do I can my decision making is thrown off. My emotionality is more laid out. The hinge, as we're referring to it earlier, feels less in control, under my control.[2:22:18] Andrew Huberman: And maybe I wonder sometimes if I enter that state that you referred to earlier where the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex Is no longer leading the singlet, but the singlet is now in charge. The players are in charge of the coach. Yeah. Not a good situation. So I know you've done some work on sleep deprivation and light and effects.[2:22:36] Andrew Huberman: Please tell us about that, and please tell us about this Triple therapy? Is[2:22:40] Dr. Nolan Williams: it? Yeah. So friend of mine, Greg Salem, one another, one of the professors at Stanford, he's very interested in sleep. He did a bunch of bunch of training in sleep before he went to medical school and, and got very interested in this idea that, As you're saying, if you sleep deprive somebody, 1 night in just kind of an isolated single night, At the at the end of that sleep deprivation, they will have an antidepressant effect, but as soon as they fall asleep, they lose it. So if it's a depressed individual, You can get them to be less depressed acutely.[2:23:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: As soon as they fall asleep, they wake up 8 hours later, then they come they come back into the same level of depression. And so the idea was that you needed to do some sort of circadian reset, and that part of the what part of what depression is Is that it's a dysregulated circadian system, and so mentors of mine say if you can just get the sleep better, that's half the battle of dealing with depression because many people have insomnia around depression and have a a whole host of types of insomnia, fall having a hard time falling asleep, waking up in the middle of night, and waking up earlier, all Symptoms of depression. And so what this does is it sleep deprives the individual, and then there's a certain calculation of Shifting their phase and simultaneously exposing them to bright lights. So that's the triple, the phase shift, the sleep deprivation, and the bright light To try to get their circadian rhythm, essentially, the the theory is reentrained. And so, you know, in the in the trials that we've done and other trials, prior to ours and and and after, you know, it looked like there was a Pretty pretty profound antidepressant effect from this triple this triple therapy that seemed to be durable.[2:24:30] Dr. Nolan Williams: Meaning, Durability is this term we use to say that not only can you get kind of point relief, but that the relief ends up, you know, lasting. What's important to know about this is, like, you shouldn't do this at home for sure. This what you would need to do this with a professional because it's complicated. It's not just one thing. And in sleep deprivation, while it seems to be antidepressant, it's pro anxiety.[2:24:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: So if you take a highly anxious person that's not depressed and you sleep deprive them, they Profoundly anxious. And so that's the other thing that that you have to really realize is that this is like everything else that I've talked about today. All things You you have to do under medical supervision, but but curious. Right? And and I think, you know, the the question always comes up is why isn't this used more?[2:25:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: And I think the reason is that there's not really a mechanism for you know, ultimately, in in medicine, as sad as it is, you have to have a code to do a thing. There has to be a code associated with a treatment, and it's hard to figure out how to make a code for this. And so I think that's part of it. And so If if there's a way and somebody's gotta kinda take that baton on that, but if there's a way to make a code for this, you know, I think you could you could actually, you know, turn it into something that was more widely widely utilized. And, you know, We pray dream up ways of how to how to integrate AI, passive sensing, all that stuff to really make that work.[2:25:57] Dr. Nolan Williams: But I think that would be that would be the the idea. That'd be the trajectory I'd see. So yeah.[2:26:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Having a billable To insurance code is is fundamental. And a lot of listeners to this podcast, I I think, have a background in engineering science, and we we will put a link to that, A manuscript that talks about the triple therapy. Because here, we're talking about 1 night sleep deprivation, some time light exposure to the eyes, and and then shifting in the circadian clock, things central to the themes of this the podcast that come up often. Yeah.[2:26:26] Andrew Huberman: I think for the typical person, can we say, that trying to get a regular light dark cycle at sleep rhythm would be beneficial for overall mood regulation?[2:26:36] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. I think for for the typical person, you know, really really kind of reregulating your sleep and and trying to get, you know, a good night's sleep in which you fall asleep, Stay asleep, wake up in a set time every morning is gonna be pretty crucial. You know, in in mild depression, I think that One has a lot of control over that as we were talking about earlier. I think when you you hit some threshold in depression where things become kinda semi volitional, it's harder To kinda will yourself into that, there are therapies like, you know, there there's a CBT for insomnia, for instance, where you Cognitive behavioral therapy to help with insomnia. Sometimes people and I'm not I'm no sleep expert.[2:27:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: I'd kinda pass this to Greg to fully talk about this, but But, but some of what goes on that people with kind of milder insomnia experience is, like, blue light out of their Computer and things like that that they so you can use, like, blue light blockers to to it tricks your your brain as as you know better than me. It tricks your brain to think that It's still light outside, and so people will they'll have insomnia because their brain still thinks that it's light outside, and then People will, you know, the the kind of strip CBT for sleep. You know, Therapists will say there are only 2 things that you should do in your bed. And if you're under a certain age and and whatnot, it's really one thing that you should do in your bed, which is To sleep and, and and be with your partner. Right?[2:28:05] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so those are those are kind of the 2, The 2 things that you should do in a bedroom, and that's really the only thing is that you should do in a bedroom if you're having sleep problems. You shouldn't watch TV in a bedroom, shouldn't eat in a bedroom, shouldn't, You know, hang out.[2:28:18] Andrew Huberman: The phone out of the bedroom.[2:28:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: Keep the phone out of the bedroom. Yeah.[2:28:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We should get Greg Salem on the podcast. We the I'll just mention for people that wanna regulate their sleep, we have a A sleep toolkit that's available as a downloadable PDF at hubermanlab.com. Just go to the menu, and a lot of the things in that toolkit are based on Work from Stanford Sleep Laboratories, including Jamie Zeitzers and others, lab. Not aimed at depression, specifically.[2:28:44] Andrew Huberman: Listen, Nolan, doctor Williams. This has been an amazing, voyage through The circuitry of autonomic control, this landscape of the prefrontal cortex is, I find incredibly fascinating. And I I Just gonna start off by saying, please do come back again and teach us more about that and your TMS work. I before we wrap, however, I wanna give you the opportunity to talk about the SAINT study.[2:29:11] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah.[2:29:12] Andrew Huberman: Definitely. Is it saint or saints, plural?[2:29:14] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. It's saint. So so, or what we're we're calling it SNT now, Saint has you know, the intent was not to to to kind of connect it to religion, but, But we may have, accidentally done so, and so we we abbreviated it to S and T for the for the subsequent trials, which was Initially, Stanford accelerated intelligent neuromodulation therapy, or now what we're calling Stanford neuromodulation therapy, but it's, The idea there, which is a cool idea, is that TMS, is a device that delivers, the deliver is a treatment, and the treatment is the protocol. And the protocol is the stimulation parameter set in a specific brain region for a specific condition. And so what's cool about neuromodulation, whether it be Transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation or deep brain stimulation, like what Casey Halpern talked about, you know, on another podcast, is this idea that in all those cases, the device itself is a physical layer Conduit of a stimulation protocol that's therapeutic for a given condition in a given brain region.[2:30:29] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so in the case of depression, which we know the most about For with TMS, we've been doing TMS studies for depression for, you know, since 1995, right, and a clearance in 2000, two 1008, 2009. And in that, in that time frame, we were able to go from really knowing Very little at all about how to do something like this to getting an FDA clearance. And and the way that it went down was that There were 2 groups studying, different components at NIH. The first group was studying Mood neuroanatomy on functional imaging that was kind of the 1st generation of functional imaging back then. So PET scans, which are kind of metabolic scans, and then SPECT scans.[2:31:16] Dr. Nolan Williams: And the idea there was looking at activity and metabolism in prefrontal cortex. What they found in these kinda more crude scans is a just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism. The other group right upstairs at the National Institute For Neurological Diseases and Stroke, an INDS, they were looking at using TMS, which had been around for 10 years and repetitively stimulating in motor cortex, what they found was, gosh, we can get a readout in thumb, muscle, movement amplitude that's really reproducible across people, it's, like, you know, universally reproducible. If we do certain stimulation approaches, they are biologically active to either increase excitability, I. E.[2:32:01] Dr. Nolan Williams: The thumb motion and a set intensity goes Up, the amount of the amplitude goes up, or inhibitory or depotentiating, it goes down with other biological stimulation approaches. Then a third outcome, which is important, But it's inert. It doesn't do either. So you can have stimulation approaches that do 1, you know, increase activity, decrease activity, or, you know, or are inert. And so what they found was, oh, we can excite certain brain regions.[2:32:28] Dr. Nolan Williams: Then my mentor, Mark George, said had this kinda moment where he said, wow. There's underactivity in prefrontal cortex and depression, and we can increase activity using this thing that we know we can increase activity in motor cortex. We just need to put it in the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, and then they combined the 2 and started stimulating Once a day in this kind of very abbreviated fashion, and lo and behold, some of those depression patients Resolve their depression, and back then and still today, you can go and as a psychiatric patient, stay at the National Institute of Mental Health and go through clinical trials to try to get treated. And there are patient patients who'd been there for months, and they were able to be discharged because their mood was better. Yeah.[2:33:13] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so it's this very crude approach where they were using ruler measurements or a DLPFC was, and they were stimulating with devices that you needed to physically dunk the coil in an ice bath. And with that, they still were able to the kind of genius of this, Mark and others, they're still be able to to create a a Purely engineered stimulation approach. What's what's cool about that is that that they they kind of found 2 things. Right? They found this one stimulation protocol that does have some antidepressant effect.[2:33:43] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's it's limited. It doesn't treat everybody. It does have some antidepressant effect. And this bigger concept that a neuromodulation device is kinda like a pharmaceutical company for you. Right?[2:33:56] Dr. Nolan Williams: That in a given individual, a TMS device or whatever neuromodulation device is able to generate to to you can create A stimulation approach that is specific to a given condition and specific to an individual. And so the physical layer is just how you exert that similarly to how we make pharmaceutical drugs in a pharmaceutical company, but the actual Therapy itself is what you do, where you do it. And so what we learned from, you know, another 20, 30 years of this is that you can modify the stimulation protocol in such a way where you can create a whole new treatment and put it through the same TMS device or, Thank God, an evolved version of it where you don't have to dunk it in ice baths, and you and it and they can actually really handle much more aggressive stimulation approaches. And so in 2005, a group published in neuron, a paper demonstrating that if you if you stimulate with the hippocampal Rhythms through a TMS coil, you can excite the brain with memory rhythms, and it'll last, Oh, an hour. So you can change cortical excitability in this thumb twitch for an hour, sending 3 minutes of excitatory or 40 seconds in the case of inhibitory stimulation that mimics the hippocampal rhythms, so much more efficient than the original TMS approaches.[2:35:20] Dr. Nolan Williams: And so, you know, after that, group tried to do it in this Kinda 6 week schedule. And after that, you know and while they were doing that, we decided, gosh, you know, this problem I talked about at the beginning of the show where You have these, you know, this problem that we we don't have a treatment for people who are in these high acuity psychiatric emergency states. Right? This idea that We're gonna engineer a treatment where we can reorganize the stimulation approach in time to be much more efficient By utilizing something called space learning theory. And so you you probably know about the space learning theory.[2:35:56] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's the idea for the for the viewers is It's a simple psychological thing, but we've also seen it in hippocampal slice sort of physiology too where if I'm cramming for a test, What I do is I write out 60 note cards, and I read each one for a minute until I get to the 1st note card again. And that's about an hour later. Right? And we just we just intuitively do this. We all we all all, you know, automatically do that.[2:36:22] Dr. Nolan Williams: And we we we intuit that because we know that What doesn't work is writing out 1 note card and looking at it over and over again. Nobody ever does that. Right? You you know, we've we've all been in in graduate school, medical School, and we have these big stacks of note cards. That's space learning theory.[2:36:37] Dr. Nolan Williams: It's this idea that you need to see it about every hour to an hour and a half, and that optimizes learning. If you take The same stimulation approach that I'm talking about, the state of birth stimulation approach, and you take a hippocampal slice of a mouse and you stimulate, You you enlarge some dendritic spines, and you prime some. And then if you stimulate right after that, You don't get any change. It's called in mass stimulation. But if you wait about an hour to an hour and a half, you get more dendritic spines enlarged and more primed, Which by the way also is what ketamine does.[2:37:10] Dr. Nolan Williams: It it does it causes a spleenergic spine enlargement. And so, you know, what we found was is that The old way of doing TMS, this idea of just doing it once a day, every day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks, didn't utilize the space learning theory. It's like Studying for a month or two just a little bit once a day. Like, you remember some of that stuff, but it's, like, not as potent as that week where you're kind of cramming. Right?[2:37:34] Dr. Nolan Williams: And what we realized is that if we could reorganize the stimulation in times that we took the whole 6 week course, we actually figured out a way to do it in a day. And then what we also figured out is that people were under dosing TMS because if you just keep going after 6 weeks out to month 3, 4, 5, more and more people got better. So we figured out it's not just one day. We're gonna do 5 times the normal dose. We're gonna have seven and a half months' worth in 5 days Using space learning theory[2:38:02] Andrew Huberman: So every hour? Every hour for 10 hours. For 5 days.[2:38:06] Dr. Nolan Williams: For 5 days. So it's a 50 hour block. It's 90 minutes of actual stimulation, but spread out through the day in the same way of learning, which is perfect for an inpatient Unit. Right?[2:38:16] Andrew Huberman: 5 days is manageable.[2:38:17] Dr. Nolan Williams: Yeah. Then you can get stimulation. No. Nobody's ever dropped out by the schedule. They they they're, you know, folks They wanna do this, wanna do it.[2:38:25] Dr. Nolan Williams: Still doing their 9 minutes. They'll go get breakfast. They'll do their 9 minutes. They'll go see their therapist or whatever it is. And so what we found, with this reorganization in in time of the stimulation, dose, and then the third component is We do resting state functional connectivity scans on everybody, and we have ways now in the last 5 to 10 years of picking out that specific subgenual DLPFC Subcircuit that I was talking about earlier, that singlet DL PFC, we can pick that out in every single one.[2:38:54] Dr. Nolan Williams: If you if you wanna come to the lab, we can we can find your DL PFC subgenual. It's even more robust[2:38:58] Andrew Huberman: Stay with you just while we're in there. Yeah.[2:39:01] Dr. Nolan Williams: If you want to, we can we can move around your hypnotizability. And we can we can find that spot In each person, instead of finding the same spot on the skull, we find the same spot on the brain, and we can stimulate. We do that every hour in the hour. What we found what we've found is that Folks will, will within 1 to 5 days, you know, in in more cases than not, and depending upon if you're looking at this open label or in trials, somewhere between 60 90% of the time, they will go into full on remission in the sense they're totally normal from a mood standpoint at the end of this. And like I said, with variable durability.[2:39:40] Dr. Nolan Williams: So that's the part we have to figure out now about dosing and how to keep people well. But for some people, you know, we've had 4 years of remission, You know, a year of remission, and it's it's really that cramming of the test. It's really that idea that you're laying in that information to the Exact right spot. And the and the signal is a simple signal, but it's a profound one, which is turn on, stay on, remember to stay on. You know, that idea that you're you're sending this memory signal into the brain, and you're doing it in such a way that you're telling the system.[2:40:12] Dr. Nolan Williams: You're kinda Taking it out of the hippocampus' your own hippocampus' hand is you're sending the same signal the hippocampus normally signals out. Now you're sending that signal Into the prefrontal cortex and kind of utilizing the brain's own communication style to get it to get out of the state. And what's very cool about this is that, is that people when they when they kinda exit out of that, they end up, They end up saying they don't have any any side effects from it, and they feel back to normal. Like, some people you know, not everybody, but there's a subsection of people with With SSRIs where they'll say, I kinda feel numb or I have GI side effects or I can't I can't you know, I don't have the sexual interest that I used to have and that sort of thing. You know, not anything gets accessorized.[2:41:00] Dr. Nolan Williams: As I said earlier, life saving, you know, for a subsection of people, these things really work. But with this, What you see is that people don't talk about any of that stuff. And I think it's it's likely because you're tapping into that Core circuitry, and you're reversing it, and you're doing it with a with a magnet that because it's a very profound electromagnet, it's the same field strength as an MRI scanner, It's able to induce a current in the brain in this focal targeted way without getting into the rest of the brain, without getting into the rest of the body at all, and just really Kinda acting only on that circuitry that's involved.[2:41:37] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. Is the SINGT study still ongoing? And if people are interested in Potentially being, patients or subjects in the study, can we provide them a portal link?[2:41:49] Dr. Nolan Williams: Absolutely. Yeah. So we have, Now the the treatment, my some of my students went over to a company called Magnus Medical, and they've been working on this. They've got an FDA clearance now, And and now folks can get it through trials over the next couple of years because it's gonna take some time for that company to To kind of get up and running and and get a, you know, get a get a device and get the whole thing set up, nationally. But while that's all going on, There's still about a 1000 patients that need to be recruited across a bunch of different trials all over the country.[2:42:23] Dr. Nolan Williams: We'll take people from anywhere in the country. We also have Partners in New York and San Diego and and other in in soon to be South Carolina and other places where we can actually kind of you know, MyLab can help to kind of Let people know where to go, where they you know, based off of where they're at in the US, and get them access to being able to be in a trial. And what we've tried to do is make it so that even if you get the, You know, 5050 chance you're gonna get the real deal or you're gonna get the the the non real deal, but what we have figured out is a way to let everyone have access, if they if they got the not real deal version, the kind of sham version or the fake version for the first part of the trial, There are other trials where they can have access to the real version. So, essentially, everybody eventually gets access to having the real version, and so that's been a big Thing for me is I I want everybody that comes through one of our trials to be able to have access.[2:43:19] Dr. Nolan Williams: I think it's important while, while, you know, the company's doing what they're doing and what the lab's doing and kinda nationally what, you know, other partner labs are doing.[2:43:28] Andrew Huberman: Well, I can assure you you're gonna get some interest. Yeah. Thank you. And listen, thank you so much for taking us on this incredible voyage through the Neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects of depression, the coverage of the different types of depression, the various, therapeutic compounds, how they work. We've, Talked about a lot of things, David.[2:43:51] Andrew Huberman: You've you've shared so much knowledge. And even as I say that, I, I very much wanna have you back To talk about many other things as well that we didn't have time to cover, but also just really wanna thank you for the work that you do. I know we are colleagues, but, You run an enormous laboratory. Enormous in my about 40, people is a is a big group, very big group. Plus, you're you're in the clinic.[2:44:12] Andrew Huberman: You also have a a life, of your own outside of work. And to take the time to sit down with us and share all this knowledge that really is in service to mental health and and human Feeling better and, in fact, avoiding often suicidal depression is just incredible work and an incredible generosity, and just thank you so much.[2:44:32] Dr. Nolan Williams: Oh, thank you, man. I mean, I I, You know, similarly, I wanna thank you for for what you're doing. I mean, I think I think that what you you know, I've I've got a lot of friends, folks that are not in the medical profession, Friends of mine, you know, one of my buddies who's a a real estate agent who works with us, who's a big big fan of your show, and, you know, I told a couple of people like that I was It's coming on, and, and they were, like, super stoked. They're like, we we you know, we watch we watch every show and, you know, super excited to to to watch, mine, and they they said something very important to me that, you know, you make this this complicated, neuroscience and and kind of, you know, brain body science accessible, you know, in in a way that that few have a gift To do, and I think that that's so important, and, and this show is doing so much to to help with science literacy. And, yeah, appreciate you.[2:45:27] Andrew Huberman: So Well, thank you. I'm I'm gratified and honored, by your statement, and, I look forward to more. Thank you.[2:45:34] Dr. Nolan Williams: Absolutely. Thank you.[2:45:35] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor Nolan Williams.
