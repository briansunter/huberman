Kronikle AI - Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Micronutrients for Health & Longevity | Huberman Lab Podcast #70 - TranscriptDr. Rhonda Patrick: Micronutrients for Health & Longevity | Huberman Lab Podcast #70 - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Rhonda Patrick. Doctor Patrick is known to some of you as a podcaster and one of the premier educators in the landscape of mitochondria, metabolism, stress, and other aspects of brain and body health. Her podcast, Found My Fitness, is one of the premier podcasts in the world for disseminating knowledge about how the brain and body work and how we can use behavioral tools, micronutrients, supplements, and other protocols in order to our immediate and long term health.[0:00:46] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Patrick did her formal training in cell biology, exploring the links between mitochondrial metabolism, Apoptosis, which is naturally occurring cell death, which is a healthy form of cell death that occurs in our brain and body throughout the lifespan, and cancer biology. She then went on to do postdoctoral training with doctor Bruce Ames, investigating the effects of micronutrients, meaning vitamins and minerals, and how they affect metabolism, inflammation, DNA damage, and the aging process. She has published landmark review articles And primary research, meaning original research articles in some of the premier journals in the world, including Science, Nature cell biology, trends in cell biology, and FASTEB. Indeed, doctor Patrick is an expert in an extraordinarily broad range of topics that impact our health. For today's episode, we focus primarily on the major categories of micronutrients that are essential for brain and body health.[0:01:42] Andrew Huberman: I have to confess that before the discussion with doctor Patrick, I was aware of only one of the categories of micronutrients that we discuss. And so you'll notice that I am wrapped with attention throughout the discussion, and I think that you'll want to have a pen and paper handy because she offers not only a very Clear understanding of the biological mechanisms by which other micronutrients operate, but some very clear and actionable tools and items that we can All embark on if we are to optimize our brain and body health. We also discussed behavioral protocols. Doctor Patrick is well known for her understanding of the scientific literature on sauna and the use of heat and cold for optimizing things like metabolism, longevity, cardiovascular health, And I'm delighted to say that we discussed that as well and how behavioral protocols can interface with supplement based nutritional protocols. I'm confident that you'll learn a tremendous amount of information from doctor Patrick, much of which is immediately actionable.[0:02:41] Andrew Huberman: And if you're not already following and listening to her excellent podcast, you'll absolutely want to do that. It's found my fitness.com is the website where you can get access to That podcast, it's also on Apple and Spotify and YouTube as Found My Fitness. Doctor Patrick also has a terrific newsletter that I recommend signing up for. Found my fitness.com/newsletter is where you'll find it, and it includes research on fasting, micronutrients, sleep, depression, fitness longevity and far more along, of course, with actionable protocols. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.[0:03:17] Andrew Huberman: Our motivation for partnering with Momentous is to provide people one location where they can go to access the highest quality supplements in the specific dosages that are best supported by the scientific research and that are discussed during various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast. If you go to live momentous .com/huberman, you will see those formulations. I should mention that we are going to add more formulations in the months to come. And You will see specific suggestions about how best to take those supplements, meaning what dosages and times of day, and in fact, how to combine those supplements With specific behavioral protocols that have been discussed on the podcast and are science supported in order to derive the maximum benefit from those supplements. And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn that Momentous ships not just within the United States, but also internationally.[0:04:08] Andrew Huberman: So once again, if you go to livemomentous.com/huberman, you will find what we firmly believe to be the best quality supplements In the precise dosages and the best protocols for taking those supplements along with The ideal behavioral protocol is to combine with those supplement formulations. I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting 2 live events this May. The 1st live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington on May 17th. The 2nd live event will be hosted in Portland, Oregon on May 18th. Both are part of a lecture series entitled The Brain Body Contract, during which I will discuss science and science based tools for mental health, Physical health and performance.[0:04:48] Andrew Huberman: I should point out that while some of the material I'll cover will overlap with information covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast and on various social media posts. Most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere. So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th, Portland on May 18th. You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com/tour, and I hope to see you there. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:05:18] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.[0:05:41] Andrew Huberman: The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome.[0:06:15] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/ Huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs, which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two. There are ton of data now showing that vitamin d three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three. And k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on.[0:06:44] Andrew Huberman: Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim the special offer of the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes what are called nootropics, which means smart drugs. Now to be honest, I am not a fan of the term Nootropics. I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that I don't believe that there's any one substance or collection of substances that can make us smarter.[0:07:10] Andrew Huberman: I do believe based on science, however, that there are particular neural circuits and brain functions that allow us to be more focused, more alert, access Creativity, be more motivated, etcetera. That's just the way that the brain works. Different neural circuits for different brain states. And so the idea of a nootropic that's just gonna make us smarter all around fails to acknowledge That smarter is many things. Right?[0:07:30] Andrew Huberman: If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math, you're doing accounting, a different part of the day, you need to be creative. These are all different brain processes. Thesis understands this. And as far as I know, they're the 1st nootropics company to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes. They only use the highest quality ingredients, which, of course, is essential.[0:07:48] Andrew Huberman: Some of those I've talked about on the podcast, things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine. They give you the ability to try several different blends over the course of a month, discover which nootropics work best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals, And with that personalization, design a kit of nootropics that's ideal for the different brain and body states you wanna I've been using Thesis for more than 6 months now, and I can confidently say that the nootropics have been a total game changer. My go to formula is the Clarity formula or sometimes I'll use their energy formula be before training. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to take thesis.com/huberman. Take a minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month.[0:08:30] Andrew Huberman: That's takethesis.com/huberman and use the code Huberman at checkout for 10% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood nDNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. What's unique about InsideTracker is that while there are a lot of different Tests out there for hormones and metabolic factors, etcetera.[0:09:04] Andrew Huberman: With InsideTracker, you get the numbers back in terms of your levels, but they also give you very clear directives in terms of Lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation that can help you bring those values into the ranges that are best for you and your health goals. That's very different than a lot of the other programs where you get a lot of information, but you don't really know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes that all very easy to understand and very actionable based on the very easy to use dashboard at InsideTracker. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20 percent off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code Huberman at checkout.[0:09:39] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Rhonda Patrick. Rhonda, welcome. There's been a long time coming, even longer than you know because even before we discussed you coming on this podcast as a guest, I've been watching your content for a very long time. So I Wanna start off by saying thank you. You were the spearhead to break through from academic science to public education, so I consider you 1st in, and, the rest of us are just in your wake, so thank you for that.[0:10:07] Andrew Huberman: That's been[0:10:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Oh, that is so kind. Thank you. Thank you so much.[0:10:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's absolutely true.[0:10:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I am so excited to be here having a conversation with you. So[0:10:14] Andrew Huberman: you. Well, it's absolutely true. If anyone, Does their research. They will realize that the statement I just made is absolutely true, and there isn't even a close second. You know, any other public facing, educators that Have formal science training and, do regular post, you know, content, came in several years after you initiated it.[0:10:34] Andrew Huberman: So We're all grateful. I have so many questions, but I wanna start off with a kind of a a new but old theme that you're very familiar with. So temperature is a powerful stimulus as we know for biology, and you've Covered a lot of material related to the utility of cold, but also the utility of heat. And As I learn more and more from your content and from the various papers, it seems that there's a bit of a a conundrum in that cold Can stimulate a number of things like increases in metabolism, brown fat, etcetera, etcetera. Hopefully, you'll tell us more about those.[0:11:14] Andrew Huberman: But heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things, And I wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold deliberate cold exposure and the discomfort of heat might be anchoring to the same pathway. So would you mind sharing with us a little bit about what happens when we get into a cold environment on purpose and what happens when we get into a hot environment on purpose? And I'm hoping that this might eventually lead us to some point of convergent understanding. So if you would.[0:11:44] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I would love to. Let's take a step back, I think you brought up a really important point here, and I think that point has to do with the intermittent challenging of yourself and and whether that is through, You know, temperature changes like cold or heat or through other types of stressors like physical activity or perhaps even Dietary compounds that are found in plants. These are things like polyphenols or flavonols. Humans were You know, we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves. And before we had Instacart where you could basically just get your food delivered to you, Before the industrial revolution, you know, occurred, we were out hunting.[0:12:28] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And I say we, not us, but humans. We were out, You know, gathering, we were moving, and we had to be physically fit. You couldn't, you know, catch your prey if you were a sedentary slob. Right? We're moving, and you had to, like, you know, pick your berries.[0:12:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You had to move. And so physical activity was a part of everyday life. And Caloric restriction or intermittent fasting was also a part of it. This is another type of of of challenge. You know?[0:12:54] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: We we didn't always, you know, have a prey that we caught or maybe Temperatures were such that, you know, there was nothing for us to gather. Right? So food scarcity was something common as well as eating plants. So getting these compounds that I mentioned. So this is these these are all types of stress, intermittent challenges that activate genetic pathways In our bodies, these are often referred to in science as stress response pathways because they respond to a little bit of stress.[0:13:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know, physical activity is strenuous. Fasting's a little bit stressful. Heat, cold, these things are all types of little intermittent challenges. And, there is a lot of crosstalk between These stressors and the genetic pathways that they activate and these genetic pathways that are activated help you deal with stress. And and and they do it in a way that is not only beneficial to help you deal with that little stressor, exercise or heat, It's it stays active, and it helps you deal with the stress of normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, just life, aging.[0:13:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? So this Concept is referred to as hormesis. Right? This is a, a little bit of stressful challenge that activates these stress response pathways in a beneficial way that is a net Positive that actually, you know, is it has a very profound antioxidant, anti inflammatory response or, you know, or whatever the response is. It could be The production of more stem cells, these are cells that help regenerate different, cells within tissues or something like autophagy, which is a process that can clear away All the gunk inside of our cells, pieces of DNA, protein aggregates.[0:14:30] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So you'll find that these stress response pathways are activated, Like, by a a variety of stressors. So for example, 1 pathway is called heat shock proteins. And as their name would apply, one would go, oh, They're activated by heat. Well, correct. They are activated very robustly by heat, and we can talk about that.[0:14:48] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But, you know, you can eat a a plant like broccoli sprouts, Which is high in something called Sulfuraphane. This is a a compound that, is is sort of like a hormetic compound or as David Sinclair likes to say, it's a Xenohormetic compound. I love that. I love that term. And it activates pathway called n r f two, which helps you detoxify things like carcinogens that you're exposed to.[0:15:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, guess what? Heat activates that. So what I'm getting at is there is overlap. Like, cold also activates heat shock proteins. You're like, really?[0:15:23] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Cold? Yes. It activates. These are stress response pathways, and they are activated by various types of stressors. Now, you know, you're gonna more robustly activate heat shock proteins from Heat versus cold, but there is some overlap.[0:15:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So I think that sort of forms a foundation there.[0:15:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's very helpful, and, you know, it brings to mind in the context of the nervous system. I always tell people, you know, you only have a small kit of neurochemicals to work with. There isn't dopamine for, Netflix and then dopamine for relationship and dopamine for work, etcetera. Their dopamine is a generic pathway by which Motivation, craving, and pursuit, emerge, etcetera.[0:16:05] Andrew Huberman: Just like adrenaline is a a generic theme of many different behaviors, and I It seems that it is the job of biological systems to be able to take a diverse range of inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, we don't know what technology will look like in years, but you can bet that some of those novel technologies will tap into the very systems that I'm talking about now, and, there certainly will be other Stressors to come about that will tap into these pathways. I have 2 questions related to what you just said, before we talk a little bit more about cold and heat. You mentioned plants as a a route to creating intermittent challenge. There's a lot of debate mostly online about whether or not plants are our friends or plants are trying to kill us.[0:16:48] Andrew Huberman: The extreme version from the carnivore types, Pure carnivore diet types is that plants are trying to kill us. From the plant based diet folks, it seems like it's more about, what's healthy for the planet, animals, and maybe for us. But if we set aside that argument and we just raise the hypothesis that plants have compounds that are Bad for us, but maybe by consuming them in small amounts, they're creating this hormesis type scenario. So then I think we conceivably solve the problem. We could say, yes.[0:17:22] Andrew Huberman: Plants are bad for us, but in small amounts, they provide this hormetic response, and they're good for us. Right? So in the same way that heat is, too much heat is bad for us, Too much cold is bad for us, can kill us, can kill neurons, but appropriately dosed in an intermittent challenge type of scenarios can be good for us. Is that how I should think about plants in these compounds? Do you think of them as good for us or as, bad for us?[0:17:45] Andrew Huberman: They're a very sharp blade, and we wanna use them potently.[0:17:48] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I I actually I think that it's almost impossible. I mean, you'd have to eat nothing but the same plant all day every day in I mean, The bioavailability of these these compounds in the plants, they're attached to a food matrix. You know, it's it's not like taking it in a supplement form as well. It's it's such that, like, it's it's very difficult to make it toxic. Now There are some cases, for example, if you eat cabbage, and I think there's some group in Africa or somewhere that, like, that's all they eat is cabbage.[0:18:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And there is a goitrogen in CABRAGE. It's not Sulforaphane. It's another compound, but that's all they eat every day. Nothing but that. They get goitrogen and the[0:18:30] Andrew Huberman: thick neck?[0:18:30] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. And they're like iodine deficient on top of that. So, you know, I do think there's there you can, of course, Mick, I mean, there are types of plants that are toxic in small quantities. Right? I mean, that hemlock.[0:18:43] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Exactly. So you.[0:18:44] Andrew Huberman: So Folks, don't don't play this game with hemlock.[0:18:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But you're not gonna get Poison from eating, you know, your your your serving of broccoli at dinner. Right? So, I mean, it it depends on the plant. It's it's I don't these generalizations are kind of they're just not useful. And I think that a lot of people online, in the blogosphere, It it it they gravitate towards them because it's easier, and it's a lot more sensational.[0:19:10] Andrew Huberman: I eat plants, meat, and starches. I'm one of those rare omnivores out there now. I feel I feel like I'm a rare or it's rare to be an omnivore. But I think once you step out of the social medias, as you said, the blogosphere, the most people I would say 99% of people on the planet are probably omnivores.[0:19:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right.[0:19:27] Andrew Huberman: And someone will probably correct me, but I doubt the number falls below 90.98.[0:19:33] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I think if you look at data, you know, and and when we have carnivore data, but, like, I can't wait to see it. But, like, right now, it's a lot of, Okay. Well, this is a lot of anecdotal evidence, and there's, you know, there's a good there's a lot of, good starts with anecdotes, but, like, people change a Thousand things at once, and they don't realize that, but they do. And so anecdotal data is only so good. Right?[0:19:57] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's a it's a starting point. And so we don't really know long term what carnivore diets are gonna do. You know? They may be beneficial short term. They may, you know, be beneficial for reasons of elimination of other things.[0:20:09] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, who knows? Right? Lots of possibilities. But I do think with respect to plants, you know, the there's an the the there's so much evidence. Like, for example, Sulfuraphane is one that I I really like because, there's just evidence that sulforaphane is a very powerful activator of the Nrf two pathway, and this is a pathway That regulates a lot of genes and a lot of genes that are related to, like, glutathione production, genes that are involved in detoxifying Compounds that we're exposed to from our food like heterocyclic amines.[0:20:40] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: In fact, there have been GWAS studies. So these are genetically these are studies that are, genome wide associated studies for people listening, that aren't familiar, people have a variety of versions of Genes. And, we have a gene that's able to make, heterocyclic amines to basically detoxify it so it's not as Harmful. And and people that don't have a certain version of that that's doing it well are very prone to, like, colon cancer and and increased cancer risk. But if they eat a lot of broccoli and cruciferous vegetables, it negates that risk because they're getting sulforaphane, which activates, a lot of the glutathione transfer Glutathione transferase and synthase genes.[0:21:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So glutathione's a major antioxidant in our brain, in in our in our vascular system, in our body, basically. So, you know, there's there's evidence that it that that eating things like, you know, compounds that are like Sulfuriphene or broccoli or Blockly sprouts, which have, like, a 100 up to a 100 times more sulfuric acid than broccoli are activating glutathione in the brain. There's human of that. I mean, that's amazing.[0:21:49] Andrew Huberman: That is amazing.[0:21:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: In plasma.[0:21:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Sorry to interrupt. I just wanna make sure when, so broccoli sprouts are different than broccoli, and you just told us that They have much they're much richer in these, these compounds. So note to self, I should have broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can we cook the broccoli and still get these nutrients, or do we have to eat raw?[0:22:09] Andrew Huberman: I confess, eating raw broccoli is really aversive to me.[0:22:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So The the Sulfuraphane is formed from a compound called Glucoraphanin, which is in the broccoli. And the enzyme that converts it into Sulfuraphane is myrosinase, and it's heat sensitive. So you do somewhat lower the sulforaphane levels when you when you cook the broccoli. However, there was a study a few years back that showed adding 1 gram of mustard seed powder ground mustard seed powder, Which also contains the myrosinase enzyme, 2 year cooked broccoli increases the sulforaphane by fourfold.[0:22:46] Andrew Huberman: So Sal. This is great, because I confess I like broccoli if it's cooked to the appropriate density, not too mushy, but definitely not raw. The idea of eating raw broccoli to me just sounds horrible, but I I like the way mustard seed sounds. So just a little bit of mustard seed powder Added to the cooked broccoli can recover some of these compounds.[0:23:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes. So what I do is I will, you know, lightly steam my broccoli, And then I add a little bit of my Kerrygold butter, and then I add some mustard seed powder on the top of that. And it's got a little little kick. Like, it's just a little spice. You know?[0:23:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And if you don't taste that, it's expired. Like, it should have a little kick.[0:23:25] Andrew Huberman: And because I know people will want to know how often and how much, you know, are you eating this every day or most days of the week?[0:23:33] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, I had shifted to supplementation with Sulforaphane. I've I've admitted I'm I'm admitting right now that I've been terrible about it the past, like, I don't know, 6 months or so.[0:23:44] Andrew Huberman: The supplementation or the or the broccoli?[0:23:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes. The supplementation. And, and, so there's another way to get there's another compound, and it's actually called Moringa. And doctor Jed Fahey, who's really the expert on Sulfuraphane, he's a good friend of mine. He's been on the podcast a couple of times.[0:24:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: He, He he basically thinks and, you know, has done a lot of research on moringa as well that it's a it's like a cousin, and it activates The Nrf 2 pathway similarly to Sulforaphane. And so I've been buying this COOLI COOLI Moringa Powder. I don't have any Affiliation with them.[0:24:21] Andrew Huberman: Cooli Cooli is a brand.[0:24:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Cooli Cooli is a brand[0:24:23] Andrew Huberman: That you have no affiliation.[0:24:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I have no affiliation. Okay. But JetFay, he, like, has researched it, like like, that specific brand, And so it's, like, legitimate it's legit. You know, it's like science backed[0:24:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[0:24:32] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: In terms of actually containing moringa and activating nRF 2, and I add it to my smoothies. So that's what I've been doing.[0:24:41] Andrew Huberman: What are what are some, dose ranges? And, of course, we give the usual recommendations that people should talk to their physician, etcetera, etcetera. But, if people are going to what do you take? That's always the, let's take the let's take the the the David Sinclairian approach. What do you where he'll talk about what he does, as a way to to deal with this, and, of course, everybody's different and should, in all seriousness, should, anytime you add or delete something from your, Consumption should consult some trusted health care professional trusted by you.[0:25:12] Andrew Huberman: What do you recall the the dosages?[0:25:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I do a big Heaping tablespoon.[0:25:16] Andrew Huberman: So Moringa cooling, cooling Moringa. It sounds like a song.[0:25:19] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's with a k. I know. But, You know, for people also listening, it's like, well, why would I do that? You know, I mentioned the glutathione in the brain. I I mentioned it in plasma.[0:25:30] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's It's been shown to lower DNA damage in people and and and white blood cells. It's also been shown there's been several different studies in China. Know, in China, there's a lot of air pollution. And I mentioned that, you know, it's a very powerful activator, n r f two. And I know you're you're familiar with n r f two, but n r f two is like it's your transcription factor that is It is it is binding to a little specific sequence in a variety of different genes, and it's like turning them on, or in some cases, turning them off.[0:25:57] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's regulating what's being activated or what's not being activated or being turned off. And, some of the genes are are basically these These detoxifying pathways, we talked a little bit about the glutathione, but there's also ones that are involved in air airborne carcinogens like benzene. So Benzene is found in air pollution. I mean, cigarette smoke. I mean, if you're if you're smoking cigarettes still, like, please try to quit.[0:26:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You're mutating your DNA.[0:26:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. It's[0:26:21] Andrew Huberman: Like, just say nothing of the lung cancer. Mutating your DNA.[0:26:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And heart disease risk. Heart disease risk. But and, anyways, people and this has been repeated in in more than one study That literally after 24 hours of taking I can't remember off the top of my head what the dose of Sulfuraphane from broccoli extract, Broccoli, seed extract was or broccoli, sprouts extract, not the seed. It was the sprouts. Anyways, They started excreting, like, 60% Benzene and Acrylene.[0:26:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, that's something that we get in cooked food.[0:26:51] Andrew Huberman: It's coming out in their urine?[0:26:52] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Coming out in their urine.[0:26:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, I'm not a smoker, and I have to be honest. It's rare that I hear of supplement for the 1st time because I've been, you know, deep diving on supplements since I was in my teens. This is fascinating, and it brings me back to this question that we had before, and I I I appreciate that you answered it very clearly. Plants have compounds that are good for us.[0:27:14] Andrew Huberman: Not just stressing us. They're activating pathways that are reparative. That's what that's what I'm taking away from what everything you're telling me.[0:27:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right. And and and that Our bodies were supposed to be getting that stress to have those pathways activated. Like, it is like, You know? Right? I mean, this is conserved among different animals.[0:27:34] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, this is this is this is something that is is it's supposed to happen. And In our modern day world, we don't have to eat plants. We don't have to move anywhere or exercise. We don't have to go through periods of not eating food because we can have it at our fingertips at any second. Right?[0:27:53] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, I mean, we've got this Conundrum of we're never activating these stress response pathways that we're that we're supposed to activate. We're supposed to.[0:28:02] Andrew Huberman: I find that fascinating. And, again, drawing a parallel to the nervous system, so what I'm hearing you say is that, historically, we would have To go through some stress, some confront cold or confront heat or confront effort or or hunger in have to exercise, essentially, in order to Obtain these compounds, and then those compounds are reparative. Yeah. I I feel that resembles, the dopamine pathway. I always say, you know, there's nothing wrong with dopamine.[0:28:29] Andrew Huberman: People think about dopamine hits as bad or dopamine is bad. There's absolutely nothing wrong with dopamine. The problem is dopamine, especially high levels of dopamine, Released without the need for effort to access that dopamine is problematic. So a line of cocaine gives you a ton of dopamine with no effort except to ingest the drug, Whereas, working for 4 years or more to get your degree will release a lot of dopamine and a lot of cortisol along the way, as we know, and it's considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases. A tremendous amount of we're approaching the spring, and there'll be a lot of graduations.[0:29:04] Andrew Huberman: Weddings are coming up now that the pandemic is kind of hopefully slowing, and there'll be a lot of dopamine. High levels of dopamine are great, but Only after the effort of having done something in order to access it. And so that's what I'm taking away from what you're saying is that we need to go through this intermittent The different types of intermittent challenge, and we can we are rewarded with particular compounds that are reparative both for the challenge, but then make us stronger. It is hormesis really is, it seems, a case of what doesn't kill us makes us stronger. What so you mentioned Can[0:29:36] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I add to that one thing you just said? Because[0:29:37] Andrew Huberman: Please.[0:29:38] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Because this has been shown with, for example, sulforaphane in animal studies, You precondition, give the animal Sulfuriphene, and then you expose them to, like, you know, hypoxia or some kind of the ischemic stroke condition, whatever they do to induce that. And the Sulfuriphene, it basically protects that. Like, it their preconditioned and their their their stress response pathways are primed. And so when they're then exposed to the ischemic stroke, they their outcomes are so much better, so much better than the animals that didn't get the sulforaphane 48 hours before, whatever it was. You know?[0:30:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and this is, like, this has been shown in multiple animal studies with Sulfuriphene, specifically, in the brain. I know Mark Mattson, doctor Mark Mattson, He's a lot often thought of as the intermittent fasting king, but, you know, he's a neuro neuroscientist, and he, he did publish some work and and talks about Sulfuruppine as well.[0:30:28] Andrew Huberman: I'm really glad you brought that up that example up because many of the questions I get on social media and elsewhere are about traumatic brain injury, and TBI In you know, is just one example. And people always think, oh, sports. It's football. Whenever you say TBI, people always think football, And I just wanna just take a men a moment to editorialize. 90% or more of traumatic brain injury is construction work, at home accidents.[0:30:54] Andrew Huberman: Football players are a hockey players are a martial artists are a tiny fraction of the people who have TBI and concussion of various kinds. It just so happens that within those communities, many of them, 75% or more, experience those. So it's salient within those communities, but, concussion is is prominent. People are always asking, what can I do in order to offset brain injury? I had a concussion 2 years ago.[0:31:18] Andrew Huberman: What can I do? And and it's Been it's been a tough question because we really don't have anything for them. I mean, you tell them sleep well, eat well, exercise, but sounds like some of these reparative pathways, either should be explored in the context of brain injury or I'm guessing are being explored in the context of brain injury.[0:31:36] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. So a couple of things there. 1 is that I mean, traumatic brain injury, I mean, it's terrible, but it's also it's so interesting because it's also, like, Literal real time brain aging. Like, you know, like, it's you're able to, like, accelerate it and understand. So I I often think of when I think of traumatic brain injury, I think of so much overlap between Alzheimer's disease and dementia and these neurodegenerative diseases because there is there are there are a lot of similarities that there.[0:32:04] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know? And so Sulforaphane, I personally think, and I do think there's been some animal research with TBI, I mean and and, Sulforaphane, Mostly preconditioning rather than, treatment. So, again, it's like, well, I mean, if you're gonna if you want a healthy lifestyle thing and you're a construction worker or you're fill in the blank. That's, you know, gonna I mean, anyone that drives in a car, I mean, you're at risk to some degree. Right?[0:32:28] Andrew Huberman: Or bicycle. Bicycle. Yeah. Around Stanford, we have you know, I would say, people Demonize motorcycles. People demonize a lot of things, but moving fast through space on a small object next to a 3,000 pound Vehicle.[0:32:42] Andrew Huberman: I mean, we've lost we have a number of friends who have died. We have a number of people with traumatic brain injury. I'm not against cycling or cyclists, but it it is, it's a risky sport, by any stretch. So in taking things like moringa or in eating my broccoli sprouts, Maybe cooking them a little less than I'm currently cooking them, putting on the the mustard seed. Is there evidence that well, first of all, n r f two is expressed in neurons.[0:33:09] Andrew Huberman: Right? So those those cells should be protected. Are there other cells of the body that could possibly gain protection from these pathways?[0:33:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, lungs For 1, but, you know, just even in plasma cells, I I mean, I think it's pretty n r f two is Pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver. So there's, I mean, there's there's so many animal studies that have looked at all those things. I try to kinda gravitate towards human ones because it's a little a lot more relevant. But but I think, you know, overall, like I I mentioned, you know, DNA damage lower.[0:33:40] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's, like, 24 24 or 34% lower in, human blood cells after broccoli's, broccoli sprout powder supplementation. Wow. And and I made a video on this, like, years ago. 2016 maybe, and I think I have, like, the references on there to exact amounts. I can't remember.[0:33:56] Andrew Huberman: To the video. Yeah.[0:33:57] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It was it's kind of an old video. It's 2 2016. But, I also had Jed on the podcast, and he he did talk about this. But, you know, it's also been shown in randomized controlled trials to help treat autism and autistic symptoms. And yet again, it's doing interesting things in the brain.[0:34:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, I think it I think it does have Something to do with the oxidative stress in the glutathione, which would be relevant for TBI treatment. It it hasn't been shown empirically that that helps with treatment, but I do think, someone could do that study. I think that it's it should be done, honestly, because it's a low hanging fruit. I mean, if there's any impact And there is at least 1 preliminary study that Glutathione is increased in the brain after humans are, you know, basically taking sulforaphane.[0:34:42] Andrew Huberman: So, Which is really for people listening, that's so important because a number of compounds that, people take in supplement form don't cross the blood brain barrier, or they get metabolized in ways that what's listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant for what your cells actually experience. So that's very reassuring. We will get back to heat and cold in this, theme that I tried to service, but I just find this too interesting to to, diverge at this point, from from these themes. So are what other compounds or micronutrients do you, place in the top tier of Useful, interesting there are animal studies. Maybe there are hopefully also some human studies.[0:35:21] Andrew Huberman: We've talked about a few. I know you've talked a lot about omega 3 fatty acids. So if you had to do your kind of top 3 Yeah. Your your superstars of nutrients for the brain and body, Sounds like we've got one one set. What would you put in alongside them?[0:35:37] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Omega 3. The marine omega 3 fatty acids. So these are found in Marine types of, you know, animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish. So so there's a there's 3 fatty acids. There's one from a plant, And and, that's often referred to as ALA.[0:35:54] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: People call it short, alpha linoleic acid. And then there's eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA and docahexaenoic acid, which is DHA. Yeah. But, Ma'am, as[0:36:02] Andrew Huberman: you can pronounce 2 of the most difficult words to pronounce right next to oh, and spell, next to ophthalmology, which if you can spell it, I know people who have appointments in ophthalmology departments that don't know how to spell ophthalmology. A little secret. There's a there's an extra p in there. So the ALA, the I'm not gonna attempt to pronounce it because your pronunciation was perfect, of both of these 2 compounds, and you said there are marine sources. So fish, so sardines, cod, this sort of thing, but what about krill?[0:36:31] Andrew Huberman: I've seen krill oil, and there was a Few years back, people were saying krill is a better source for omega threes than, is, fish oil. I took some krill oil capsules. It made me itch all over, so I stopped.[0:36:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Do you have a shellfish allergy?[0:36:48] Andrew Huberman: No. I don't think so. I don't think so. I'm not a big fan of shellfish, but I like you know, I have oysters every now and again or something and feel fine. So[0:36:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. We can talk about sources. So, krill is a, a a source mostly of A type of DHA and EPA that's in phospholipo lipid form. So it's a phosphatidylcholine omega 3 fatty acid, and, that's Different than most most of the well, if we're talking about fish oil supplements, that's a different story. But if you're talking about comparing fish To eating krill.[0:37:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, we're talking about this would[0:37:22] Andrew Huberman: never eat krill.[0:37:23] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Okay. Are we talking about the supplements? Okay.[0:37:25] Andrew Huberman: So fish oil supplements. Yeah. Krill supplement versus fish fish Oil supplement. And if you if it fits in the conversation talking about great sources of of omega threes In their whole form, I I have a I have a bad feeling you're gonna tell me sardines.[0:37:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Sardines are are yeah. They're they're awesome. Anyways Except[0:37:43] Andrew Huberman: for except for the taste.[0:37:45] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and for the potential contaminants, mercury, I think, was 1 no. Joe is yeah. It was mercury. And, Joe was telling me about, like, he used to eat sardines every Joe Rogan was telling me that he used to eat sardines every day. And, and then he had, like, really high mercury levels.[0:38:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And I was really shocked because sardines are, like, you know, low in the fish, you know, group. So they're the the higher up you get, like, swordfish and sharks, like, Really high mercury because they're eating all the other fish. Right? But I think some brands and if you look at, like, ConsumerLab, ConsumerLab, there's it's like a third party site that I'm not affiliated with, but I'll use them because they they do a lot of analysis of different Foods and supplements. And so you can look at, like, some of their sardines, and they've, like they have a list of, like, ones that are pretty decent.[0:38:35] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But, anyways, back to your question about fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. So the one of the major differences is the that Fish oil supplements. If you get a high quality one, it's in a triglyceride form. So you're you've got, like, a a Glycerol backbone with 3 fatty acids, and and that's attached. And those are either DHA or the EPA.[0:38:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, Or if you have a lower quality fish oil supplement, then you have what's called eth ethyl ester form. And, typically, the reason for that, it's it's When fish oil is purified, it's run through this column with alcohol or something. They cleave it off the glycerol backbone, and then it's just kind of easier to leave it like that than, like, resterifying it, which cost more money. So you can get it in ethyl ester form, which, isn't as bioavailable. And in fact, if you don't take it with food, you're gonna be in trouble.[0:39:29] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You're not gonna absorb Much of it at all.[0:39:31] Andrew Huberman: Would you see this on the packaging? Is it gonna say it's in this ethyl ethyl form?[0:39:36] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Some official brands will put it on their website, Perhaps on their packaging, but you most of the time, you'll have to dig for it on the website and or call them. But I think For the most part, ones that are, like, higher end will will market it like triglyceride form. And it's not that ethyl ester is bad. It just means take it with food. So, so so the one of the major prescription omega threes out there is both of them, actually.[0:40:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: LavaZA, Which is a mixture of DHA and EPA as well as Vascepa, which is a highly purified EPA. These are both prescribed by physicians to patients with hypertriglyceridemia, so high triglycerides, among other things, I think, may maybe dysregulation of lipids as well.[0:40:18] Andrew Huberman: This is amazing. So for people so these are prescription drugs that are essentially very high potency purified omega threes, but they're given to people for lipid issues. So this is the treatment of issues with fat metabolism by giving people fat. Yes. Just to really I just wanna push home again, I'm not carnivore keto or anything.[0:40:36] Andrew Huberman: I'm an omnivore, but but to just push home that, we One thing that's so wonderful that you've done over the years that you continue to do is to move away from these very, broad sweeping Statements about, you know, fat is bad. I mean, here's a case where we're saying fat is not only good. It can be used to combat issues with fat metabolism. And then their you know, fats are not just one thing. They're many things.[0:41:01] Andrew Huberman: So, anyway, I just wanna put a little highlighter and and a point of appreciation there and and make sure that people are are sensitized to the fact that, if you hear that fat is bad, you have to ask what kind of fat. Right? And and here, we're talking about These omega threes. Okay. So the triglyceride form can be taken with or without, food, and there's prescription forms.[0:41:22] Andrew Huberman: What's I can't get I I don't know if I can get ahold of the prescription form unless, you know[0:41:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: have high triglycerides. Or I have a[0:41:29] Andrew Huberman: friend with high triglycerides. No. It's illegal, folks. Don't don't share prescription drugs.[0:41:33] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Or you talk to your doctor and you say, I'm already taking this from I mean, I don't know how it works. Anyways[0:41:37] Andrew Huberman: What's the dosage that you recommend people get? So One way or another.[0:41:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Alright. Okay. So the the dosage that physicians prescribe for high triglycerides, for example, is 4 grams a day.[0:41:50] Andrew Huberman: Four grams of EPA?[0:41:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Of, yes, of the, Vascepa. I think Lavaas is also prescribed at 4 grams a day, And, you can you can get either of those from your physician. My father-in-law just got one of them just crappy to use. We were buying our own omega 3 for years years. Hey.[0:42:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You can actually get this, and health insurance can cover it.[0:42:08] Andrew Huberman: And[0:42:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: it's a really purified form, but you have to take it with food. That was the bottom line. I've totally gone on tangents, but, like, I you're asking more interesting questions anyway. So[0:42:16] Andrew Huberman: Well, normally, I ask about mechanism, and then I talk about protocols. In the Or or the why. Or the why. I mean,[0:42:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: but We haven't gotten there yet. But I[0:42:24] Andrew Huberman: think that, and we we definitely will get there, but I think a number of people nowadays are Just really excited about what they can do for their health. And so here, we're, we're just raising the importance of omega threes, and then we'll definitely get to the why and the underlying mechanism.[0:42:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I think 4 grams is, I mean and in fact, like, you know, Bill Harris doctor Bill Harris is He's just one of the the pioneers on omega 3 fatty acid research. He was on our podcast not you know, last August. And, he was saying the reason FDA chose that was literally just because how much they could get people to take. Like, it like, the it it wasn't like an upper end. Like, oh, this is not Anything above that is unsafe.[0:43:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: That wasn't the case. I mean, it was it was it was just purely, like, cost and, like, like, You know, compliance. You know? So, like, what they can get into a a pill, the amount they can get, and how many pills they can get people to take.[0:43:15] Andrew Huberman: I'm smiling because, our good friend, Sachin Panda at the Salk Institute, who's done a lot of important work on intermittent fasting and other incredible work on circadian rhythms, etcetera. When I was talking to him in preparation for an episode on intermittent fasting, he I said, why the 8 hour feeding window? And he said, well, the graduate student who ran those had a partner. I think it was a girlfriend as I recall. Hope I didn't get that backward.[0:43:40] Andrew Huberman: And the partner said, listen. You can be in lab 10 hours a day, but you can't be in lab 14 hours a day if you want this relationship to work. And so it was 8 hours of feeding window plus some measurements, you know, and time to walk into the lab, park the car, etcetera. So the 8 hour feeding window that everyone holds so wholly was actually just born out of this relationship between these 2 graduate students. You know, had they been single, Yeah.[0:44:03] Andrew Huberman: I was single all through graduate school or most of it anyway, and I lived in the lab. So if it'd be me, we'd all be, intermittent fasting would mean eating 14 hours a day. Yep. That was a joke. Not a good one, but, just wanna make clear I'm joking.[0:44:15] Andrew Huberman: But the point that you're making is a really good one that the 4 4 gram Amount is not a threshold based on anything except the threshold of people's willingness to actually take the stuff. So, and I think that's important for people to hear because so often we hear the 8 hour feeding window, you know, 4 grams of EPA, know, a 150 minutes of cardio, and it's really a question of what you can reasonably do in a study. You know?[0:44:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So I take 4 grams a day. I take 2 in the morning, grams in the morning, and I take 2 grams in the evening. I take my EPA in the morning, and I take my DHA in the evening.[0:44:49] Andrew Huberman: You split them.[0:44:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I do. I don't know if I don't think it's necessary. Not necessarily. I'm I just happen to buy I happen to get a certain fish oil supplement that's, like, separates them. And so, you know, like, Lavazza Lavazza is a great one, and it's all, like, in one, and it's easier.[0:45:05] Andrew Huberman: What if someone doesn't have a prescription? So I take over the counter fish oil. I know I feel better because I've done the experiment going on and off. I take that mainly for I don't have depression, but My mood is better. My joints feel better.[0:45:19] Andrew Huberman: I just feel better, and I like to think that my platelets are slipperier, and and they're they're they're, you know, cruising through any little, obstructions in my my veins or arteries, that's the image I have in my head, but I don't have any data to support that part.[0:45:32] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. I mean so if You're if you're asking for, like, where do people get these[0:45:36] Andrew Huberman: essential substances? At the bottle, and it says, 2 grams per serving, but then I look and it's 750 milligrams of EPA, right, or a 1000 milligrams of EPA. Let's say half of it is EPA. Then do I want to hit a threshold of EPA or a threshold of of what's listed on the bottle, right, on the on the front of the bottle. And it because my understanding is that need to hit a threshold level of EPA in order to derive these important benefits.[0:46:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I think 2 grams is, is a good threshold. Now, the International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO, They have a website where they do third party testing of a ton of different fish oil supplements from around the world. And they measure the concentration of the omega 3 fatty acids in the actual supplement because nothing is ever what it says on the bottle. And then they also measure measure contaminants, so mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things that you'd find potentially in fish that were harmful to humans. And they also measure mercury and then oxidized fatty acids.[0:46:47] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So these omega 3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are extremely prone to oxidation. So please keep your fish oil in the refrigerator, because it's colder. Yeah. They're extremely prone[0:46:59] Andrew Huberman: Mine's in the cupboard, so now I know.[0:47:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The the the the shelf life's, you know, increased lower oxidation. Mhmm. You know?[0:47:05] Andrew Huberman: It makes perfect sense. Right. Yeah.[0:47:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, Anyways, they measure that, and I typically like to look for they give you a total oxidation number. It's called toto to no. T o t o x. TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE TOE BE AT THE LEAST UNDER 10, ideally under 6. It's really hard to find All the right mixtures of things, but people can go to this website and they can browse through the products.[0:47:31] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I've put together an Excel sheet, Which I have a a YouTube little screencast that I'm yet to publish. Press the publish button on. But it basically you have to go back and check and update because these are from different Lot numbers, you know, of the products, they do have up to, like, 20, 27 or something. And so I've gone through and found my Top picks of e high EPA brands and high DHA brands if I were to buy some, the ones that I would choose because of the low total oxidation and the high concentration of either EPA or DHA. Now, people can go of either EPA or DHA.[0:48:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Now, people can go and do this themselves. It just takes some work.[0:48:06] Andrew Huberman: No. I'm glad that you did the work. I I'm going to put up a tweet Every week[0:48:11] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Oh, no.[0:48:12] Andrew Huberman: With you tagged until this list is published online. Sorry, Rhonda, but I'm gonna do it. I know it's very sadistic of me, but in service to the community that and myself.[0:48:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And I and I chose 5 brands from region. I try to choose I try to find 1 in, like, Europe and one in Canada, there's a great selection of No.[0:48:27] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for doing that work. I don't want to do that work, and I I trust you. So, yeah, I try and get 2 grams per day of EPA Yeah. From supplementation. I'll now put it in the refrigerator.[0:48:38] Andrew Huberman: Mood is better. I made that decision mainly based on the data that I'm aware of, Looking at comparison of people doing that anywhere from 2 to 4 grams of EPA per day compared to, SSRIs, serotonin Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and, treatment of depression, and I don't wanna take an SSRI if I don't have to, and, fortunately, I don't have to. But The data are, by my read, are remarkable. People that take these things in sufficient doses, meaning the EPAs are able to get by with much lower dosages of SSRIs for depression relief or in some cases to come off their SSRIs completely, or avoid going on anti Depressant medication. Now, of course, this is not something people should cowboy.[0:49:20] Andrew Huberman: You know, mental health issues are serious, but, what other reasons I'd love your thoughts on that, on the mental health part. And, so maybe you could tell us what are some things that getting 2 to 4 grams of EPA per day is going to help within our brain and the rest of our body.[0:49:36] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So do you do you know, so I actually published a paper back in 2015 about The role of omega 3 and vitamin d in depression, bipolar disorder bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior. But, so, like, within that paper, like, the doing background research, and this was a review article, by the way. I was just connecting dots because No. I'm gonna[0:49:57] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna grab it. But I I confess I don't know the paper, but I love quality reviews because the references therein are so useful.[0:50:06] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, There's a huge role for inflammation, the cause of inflammation and depression. And, you know, I think we did a short animated video on this as well, like, years ago back when I was, You know, publishing that that work where, you know, people are injected with lipopolysaccharide. I mean, this is something that we're We're generating from our from our gut, mostly from, you know, our gut permeability, which happens a lot. Endotoxin, it's also called it's there it's endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. It's basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells.[0:50:36] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: When bacteria die, so, like, when the immune cells in our gut come into contact with the bacteria Because we drank, alcohol 5 days in a row or whatever, we release endotoxin or something stressed us out. We release endotoxin into our body, And that causes inflammation. And so you can inject people with lipo lipopolysaccharide and cause depressive symptoms. However, if you take those same cohort of people, Give them EPA, and I think it was somewhere around 2 grams, and then inject them with lipopolysaccharide. We're establishing causation here.[0:51:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? It totally the depressive symptoms versus the placebo. So their placebo was saline control. So there was this was a placebo controlled because, obviously, it's hugely important for depression. It ameliorated the depressive symptoms that was caused by lipopolysaccharide.[0:51:21] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. And LPS, lipopolysaccharide, is no joke. I, years ago when I was working on thermal regulation, we would inject animals with LPS to induce fever. It's there's a the vagus nerve registers the presence of LPS signals to these, particular hypothalamic areas and cranks up body temperature because, basically, it's a signal that body is infected. Right?[0:51:46] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. So I will continue with my 2 grams Per day. Maybe I'll ramp it up to 4. I'm not doing the DHA separately. There is d d DHA in the same[0:51:57] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes.[0:51:57] Andrew Huberman: Supplement. Is that okay?[0:51:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And and, you know, to kind of boy, we have we got a lot of things to hit back on because your one of your original questions was Krill oil versus fish oil. And DHA too.[0:52:09] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. DHA specifically, is it it it's, you know, in phospholipid form, It it's more bioavailable. So our our bodies you know, if you're comparing exact quantity or concentration, you know, In triglyceride form versus, phospholipid form, you will get more in your plasma cells or in your plasma plasma cell. In your in your plasma, with krill oil. However, krill oil, supplements are so low dose.[0:52:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, I mean, Good luck getting 2 grams of omega 3 from krill oil. And, also, krill oil supplements are notoriously, like, Rancid. I don't know for whatever reason.[0:52:50] Andrew Huberman: What made me itchy all over.[0:52:52] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I I think there's just I I, like, I I I haven't found a good krill oil supplement. I I pretty pretty much stay away from it. I mean, if you smell it too, I mean, it's just like like it just smells rancid. So but the thing is and I also published a paper on this back in 2019 or yeah. Something like that, about DHA in phospholipid form getting into the brain, in a through a different mechanism than DHA in triglyceride form, and so It's going through a transporter called the MFS d two a transporter, and I think it's very relevant for people with an APOE four allele.[0:53:29] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, I with an Alzheimer's susceptible. Right. So so, like, 25% of the population has an allele in a gene called APOE, 4 and, basically, it or it's apo we, but the 4 is is referred to as the the the bad kind of version of it. This is something in our our bodies. It's also in our brain.[0:53:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And if people have one of these versions, if they got one from their mom or their dad, they have a fold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease if they get 2, which is much it's much more, less less it's less common. I think it's, like, 2% of the population or something has two But they have, like, a 10 or 11 fold increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. So, there is a role for phospholipid form, DHA in the brain, but you also make phospholipid DHA inside your body. And you can do that by taking in more triglyceride forms. So 2 grams like the magic.[0:54:18] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: More 2 grams or more is the magic number, I think. So so kinda back to, like, the the why for fish oil, and and I I personally think it is one of the most powerful anti inflammatory Things dietary lifestyle, things that we can we can get easily relatively easily that, is it's gonna Powerfully modulate the way you think, the way you feel, and the way you age. And, a variety of different Types of studies kind of led me to that conclusion, a a a variety of, you know, observational studies. So there's been lots of work by doctor Bill Harris and his collaborators Looking at what it's called the omega three index. So this is actually the omega three level in red blood cells.[0:55:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So red blood cells turn over about every 120 days. So it's a it's a long term marker of omega three status. This is very different from 99.9% of any study you see or any, lab that you go to to get your omega three levels tested, you're getting your plasma phospholipid levels tested, Which is kind of like you can think of it as, what did I eat a couple days before? Oh, I had fish. My omega 3 levels are great, But did you eat fish like that every week, or was it like you know, it was like you went out to dinner.[0:55:38] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, it's not a great Biomarker for long term omega three status. It's kinda like the, you know, fasting blood glucose levels versus the HbA 1 c, which is like a long term right, of your of your blood glucose level. So the omega three index, he's done a variety of studies, observational studies. So for people listening, these are studies. They're obviously flawed because they're not establishing causality.[0:56:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They're you know, you're looking at, People's lifestyles. But in the in the case of of Bill Harris's work, he's measuring something. So he's measuring the omega three index. And he's measuring omega 3 index in people And then looking at their mortality risk, for example, or their cardiovascular disease risk. And what he has found is that Most fur first of all, standard American diet has omega 3 index of 5%.[0:56:29] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Japan, by contrast, Has an omega three index of around 10 to 11%. Big big difference there. And they also have about a 5 year increased life expectancy compared to people in the US. And that Do[0:56:42] Andrew Huberman: you think that's mainly due to their fish intake, seafood intake?[0:56:45] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So what he showed was I I think it's A a big part of it. Mhmm. I mean, you can't always say it's the only thing, but what he showed in his data was that in and I I think it was Framingham study Where he he looked at the omega 3 index and people that had a omega 3 index of 4% or lower, so close to what the standard American is, but a little bit lower. They had a 5 year decreased life expectancy compared to people that had an 8% omega three index. And so, big difference there.[0:57:16] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? 5 5 years life expectancy. But here's the really interesting thing, Andrew. He also looked at smokers And smokers and their omega 3 levels. And so we stratified it.[0:57:25] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? And he found smokers that had no omega 3 We're, like, the worst of all. I mean, it was, like, it was just, like, worse. Right? We we all know smoking is bad for us, and we'll take take years off our life expectancy.[0:57:38] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But smokers that had the high level, like smokers that were taking their fish oil or eating fish or whatever it was they were doing to get them up to 8%, They had the same life expectancy as nonsmokers with the low low omega three index.[0:57:50] Andrew Huberman: Wow.[0:57:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right?[0:57:51] Andrew Huberman: Wow. And That's that's amazing, and it's also amazing to me that people still smoke cigarettes. But I see a lot of people vaping, And I I and I'm and I know a lot of people consume cannabis. Right? People have has there been any studies of, specifically of vaping or people, smoking marijuana, and, all cause mortality.[0:58:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I haven't seen those. Yeah. I haven't seen those.[0:58:16] Andrew Huberman: They're not motivated enough to come in as research subjects. Okay. That was that was, again, a a poor joke. It is hard to study people, Marijuana use, unless I'm told by my colleagues that study this stuff, unless you offer people marijuana, in which case they'll do it. But, again, they're Actually, not very good research subjects in all seriousness because they are not very motivated or consistent, and they forget their appointments.[0:58:38] Andrew Huberman: So, that's incredible, and you mentioned that the data on pollution related to the plant compounds earlier. So it's almost like these things are, again, are acting in a reparative way. Food[0:58:52] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The omega threes are are I mean, they're they are Resolving inflammation. They're, like, blunting inflammation. They're they're doing so many different, like, at they they affect So many different parts of the inflammatory pathway, which is I think it plays a huge role in in the way we age, the way our brain ages, the way we feel, our mood, just our joints, all that. And so it's it's amazing, but it's not, you know[0:59:17] Andrew Huberman: I I I love fish oil. I feel better when I take it. I try to eat some fatty fish A couple times a week. I do want to just touch on food sources for a moment. First of all, are there plants that are rich in omega threes, and second, my, I have some friends who are really into meat, and, I like meat a lot.[0:59:38] Andrew Huberman: My dad's Argentine, but I don't very much of it. I try to eat high quality meats in relatively limited amounts, but I do eat pretty often. But I've been told, by these, sources of a questionable authority that if an animal grazes on really good grasses, for instance, that the meat can contain a lot out of omega threes, which in principle makes sense based on this omega three index, because you're telling me that a lot of it this omega 3 is sequestered into the red blood cells. So if I'm eating high quality grass fed meat and the grasses had omega threes, do the my steaks have omega threes or no?[1:00:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So there was a study published that compared conventional meat. So meat that is you know, that animals are fed, You know, corn or soy or whatever it is.[1:00:25] Andrew Huberman: Which which is terrible.[1:00:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah.[1:00:26] Andrew Huberman: But for animals and people, as far as I can tell, I'm sure I'll get I'll get some, Attacks, but that's okay. I won't read those comments. The, the again, a joke. I read all the comments. But, the It seems to me that these animals would have to get either be taking fish a well or eat plants that are very rich in omega threes in order for the the meat to actually contain sufficient omega threes.[1:00:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I so so the meat comparing the conventional meat to, like, the grass fed or, you know, pasture raised cows, or cattle. There were higher levels of alpha linoleic acid. And ALA is The it can be converted into EPA and DHA. But the conversion is very inefficient and very dependent on A variety of factors including genetics. Genetics, a huge, you know, regulator.[1:01:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, some people can do it much better. Others, like, you're getting, like, 5% of conversion to EPA. Estrogen is a major A regulator of making that more efficient, and and it makes sense because pregnancy, when your estrogen just goes through the roof. I mean, These omega 3 fatty acids play a very important role in brain development. So you're you know, women are supposed to be converting Any ALA they can into the longer chain omega 3 fatty acids.[1:01:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? So so, estrogen does affect that, But I would say plant sources. So if you're looking for the ALA, plant sources would be, you know, walnuts, flaxseeds. Those are probably the highest. But if you're if a person is a vegan or a vegetarian, their best bet is to actually get microalgae oil, you can supplement with microalgae oil because microalgae do it's they do make the the DHA.[1:02:16] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so, That would be a better source for for people that are that are vegetarian and vegan rather than doing the the flaxseed oil Because that conversion inefficiency, you know, the enzymes that convert ALA into EPA and DHA. Again, there's it's inefficient.[1:02:33] Andrew Huberman: And then for people that eat fish, sardines, you said. Salmon. Salmon, and you have to eat the skin as I understand.[1:02:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You don't have to, but Okay. It's good. It's rich with with the oil. Yeah. And and and the reason I say, like like, I I I think the best would be wild Alaskan Skin salmon versus the farm raised because the farm raised, again, they're feeding them they're feeding them corn they're feeding them, like, green and stuff.[1:02:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Really? And then they give them astaxanthin. So Astaxanthin is a carotenoid. It's the carotenoid that's in things like krill or crustaceans that make their red pigment.[1:03:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's also being used now as a Supplement, and there's a prescription form to try and rescue some age related vision loss because of the the Role of the vitamin a pathway in photoreceptors. Uh-huh.[1:03:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. Well, you know, actually, the carotenoids themselves, so like luteinines, zeaxanthin, they're really good at sequestering singlet oxygen, Which is some damaging. Right? To that[1:03:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. As we age, they, because the retinal cells, the, cells of the IR is So metabolically active, they accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species and, mitochondrial repair and Limiting reactive oxygen species is is a major, theme of trying to rescue vision. I think that's some that is that's a whole other podcast in story. There's some really interesting data now On the use of red light to try and trigger these pathways from[1:03:53] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: seen some[1:03:53] Andrew Huberman: Glenn that's my, good friend of many years and amazing scientist, Glenn Jeffries, lab at the University College London. I'm The we should talk about that at some point.[1:04:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: If not today that study, like, 2020, was it? No.[1:04:04] Andrew Huberman: They have a second study.[1:04:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Do they?[1:04:05] Andrew Huberman: They've done a cat. Looking real. I mean, you know, I they're they're cautious. They're they're appropriately British and cautious about it. You know, I've I always joke if those studies have been done over here, everyone would already Know about it.[1:04:16] Andrew Huberman: Glenn is a very conservative guy, but they've done this stuff now in in pigs, in rodent models, and now also 2 studies in humans. It's looking pretty pretty interesting. So sardines, but also anchovies. I mean, all I by the way, I hate all the food items that I'm describing. I can barely tolerate salmon.[1:04:34] Andrew Huberman: I don't like fish at all. Actually, I like live fish oil. I fish tanks when I was a kid. I just don't no. I find fish unless it's in sushi form, I find it absolutely, repulsive, and I don't know why.[1:04:44] Andrew Huberman: I probably have some mutation.[1:04:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So raw fish is actually higher in mercury than cooked.[1:04:49] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Well, that's good. Now I don't really like sushi that much anyway. You're giving me great reasons to not eat fish, but except I should eat these other fish sources or supplement more heavily. That's the message I'm getting.[1:04:59] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Sardine. My my, like, every day, my, like, first meal almost is, like, a can of sardines and an avocado with, like[1:05:05] Andrew Huberman: Avocado is good.[1:05:06] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I love, Yeah. With a little bit of lemon and then some little hot sauce, like, you know[1:05:10] Andrew Huberman: Just avocado and omega threes?[1:05:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Avocado is very good in monounsaturated fat. It's not really high in polyunsaturated fat. Omega 3 really I mean, it's it's it's either the the DHA and EPA that's in the the marine sources fish Or it's the plant ALA source, which is, like, the flaxseed or the walnuts. So[1:05:29] Andrew Huberman: It's rough. I mean, all these, companies now are are making these, Plant based products that taste like meat. My wish is that they would just make a fish that tastes like a steak. But that's,[1:05:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The fish come out albino, the ones that they farm raise, because they don't eat any of the[1:05:45] Andrew Huberman: I'm joking. I don't want a genetically modified fish that tastes like a steak. Although, you know, I I love the taste of steak. The point here is that if you don't if you if one doesn't see themselves regularly consuming these fish, these Fish sources of omega threes, it seems to me that the only way to really get them is from supplementation.[1:06:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And supplementation is a good way to get a a high dose and and to get back to your dose point. There was a a couple of studies that that basically, You know, I think there was there was some way they showed that people that are in the 4% omega three index range, in order to get to the 8%, right, the 5 year Increased life expectancy if we're comparing the 2 groups was to supplement with at least 2 grams. It was about 2 grams a day. And that and I think it was a little bit less if it was triglyceride form, but I think 2 grams is, like, a good safe number. So Most Americans that are not eating a lot of fish and they're not supplementing are probably around a 4 to 5% omega three index.[1:06:47] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And to get to the 8% and and I think that's a good Empirical way of thinking about it. Right? Okay. Well, I wanna get to that 8%. By the way, I'm almost 16% omega 3 and I[1:06:57] Andrew Huberman: was gonna ask about, about testing. Yeah. So So where can somebody where and how can somebody measure their omega three index? Which, again, just to remind people, is essentially, the percentage of omega threes that you have in your blood with the caveat that the omega three index will be heavily biased by what you ate In the previous days.[1:07:18] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Not the omega 3 index. Okay.[1:07:20] Andrew Huberman: So the omega 3 I thought you said in red blood cells, if I ate salmon 2 days ago, my omega 3 index is gonna go up.[1:07:25] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: No. That was plasma.[1:07:27] Andrew Huberman: I misunderstood. Okay.[1:07:28] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So so most people are measuring like, if you look at a lot of studies and, honestly, Andrew, I think a lot of the reason for conflicting data It is because people are measuring plasma omega 3 levels.[1:07:39] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:07:40] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The phospholipids. It's in a phospholipid. Right? So your your phospholipids are carrying thing. These are lipoproteins.[1:07:45] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, they're they're carrying things like omega 3, introglycerides, and stuff and shuttling them around. So, the omega three index is actually in the red blood cells, and red blood cells take a 120 days to turn over. So if you're gonna do a baseline test, if you wanna know before supplementing what your level is, you have to wait to a 120 days before doing the 2nd test after supplementing to know how much you you went up because The that's how long it takes for your red blood cell to turnover. So the omega three index, Bill Harris has a, a company that he he Cofounded is called Omega Quant, and they measure the omega three index. They have a variety of different index tests.[1:08:25] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You can do, like, a basic one or a little more advanced.[1:08:27] Andrew Huberman: This is from a blood[1:08:28] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It it it's a little blood spot thing. Yeah. And, you know, like, he uses money to, like, funnel back into doing lipid research. Like, he's, like, Out there doing all sorts of interesting studies on omega threes. It's great.[1:08:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But I the omega three index is great. I think that, honestly, more people and more researchers should be using it because, the conflicting data, all it always comes down to what we're measuring, the sensitivity of it. You know? Are we even measuring anything? So, you know, you're you're giving someone 500 milligrams of DHA and you don't see any effect.[1:09:00] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, did you measure What their levels were, and did you measure the omega, you know, omega 3 index? You know, there's all sorts of problems with randomized controlled trials, and I think that It just we need to, like as scientists, we need to come together and, like, make some progress. I mean, you know, let's all talk to each other. Mhmm. Let's let's let's figure things out.[1:09:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, This this test is out there. It should be used. It should be used not just by Bill's group, but, like, everyone.[1:09:26] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well and I'm learning So much for me, and I agree we need more collaboration. I've always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations in my lab at Stanford, and, Oh, collaborating is just so much more fun. Online, there seems to be a bias more towards creating silos as opposed to, bridges, but, I appreciate that you bring up the need for more collaboration and and knowing which measures are best. And in this case, now I'll thank you for the clarification.[1:09:52] Andrew Huberman: I understand this omega three index is going to be best. You mentioned you so, basically, when now I mean, I look at you, I think you are 16% omega 3.[1:09:59] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And dolphins are 19%. I'm almost[1:10:01] Andrew Huberman: Is that your goal? You're trying to get there?[1:10:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It is.[1:10:04] Andrew Huberman: To to the interesting actually, they should probably do something where you're trying to achieve the omega three, ratio of the the your favorite species. Now that we've covered a bit of how to get these things into 1 system Depending on what one eats, etcetera, and some of the better measurements, how is omega 3 and some of these other related, Lipids, how are they having these positive effects? In my mind, and this is this is incredibly elementary, but my understanding is that at some level, they're making platelets more slippery. Is that true or not? I hope I'm happy to be wrong.[1:10:40] Andrew Huberman: How is it possibly impacting my mood? Is it through the synthesis of membrane on neurons that allows neurons to release more transmitter, like serotonin and dopamine. I mean, what are some of the Purported, reported, and known mechanisms.[1:10:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I think some of the the most well known mechanisms, do you have to do with the the omega 3 fatty acids being very powerful regulators of The inflammatory process in some way, shape, or form, whether that has to do with resolvins that are produced. So these from the metabolites, of, like, DHA, for example, Resolvins play a role in resolving inflammation. Like, you want your inflammatory response to be activated when it's supposed to be, you wanna resolve that inflammation and the inflammatory response in a timely manner. Right? And Resolvins help do that.[1:11:30] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and so Resolvins are 1. And then there's these specialized, promediating molecules, the SPMs, that also help resolve the inflammation. There's, Like you mentioned, the leukotrienes and prostaglandins, and these things are being affected by EPA, and they do affect platelets and platelet aggregation, and they, you know, they do affect That whole pathway as well. And so there's just and there's, you know, I think there's just so many different ways and inputs. And so when we talk about inflammation, honestly, it that that's a big general term.[1:12:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But you're talking about when you're talking about serotonin release, you know, at the level of neurons, you know, we know that these inflammatory molecules cross the blood brain barrier. And I just mentioned ago about injecting people with lipopolysaccharide and causing depressive symptoms. You know, it's known that that omega 3 actually, specifically, EPA is able to help Serotonin in inflammation inhibits the release of serotonin. And so EPA is actually able to blunt inflammatory responses along with DHA as well. DHA does that through resolvents and stuff.[1:12:34] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And this then helps more serotonin be released because you're you're not having So much inflammation getting into the brain and affecting serotonin release. Right? That's one mechanism. And then another would be, well, DHA itself has been shown it's It's a very important, fatty acid that makes up cell membranes, many cell membranes, including in our neurons. And as you very well know, Andrew, the structure and function of receptors, of transporters, these membrane bound proteins on the surface of our cells, including neurons, are affected by the membrane fluidity.[1:13:06] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know? Like, How rigid and how fluid the cell membrane is, and DHA plays a role in that. And so, for example, in animal Studies, if you make an animal deficient in DHA, their serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, they're affected because the structure of them is affected through the Fluidity of the membrane. And so I think that's another mechanism, and and I'm talking sort of general because I'm not a neuroscientist. Test?[1:13:32] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: No.[1:13:32] Andrew Huberman: But it makes perfect sense. I mean, we know, for instance, neuroplasticity and the almost always involves the recruitment of more receptors or an improvement in some feature of receptors to neurotransmitters, and they literally move laterally in the membrane. They kinda float around like little rafts. Sometimes they are, in fact, in lipid rafts. And so it makes Perfect sense that these molecules like DHA, which are part of the structural fat of the neuron because, of course, the outsides of neurons are basically fat.[1:14:01] Andrew Huberman: Not just the myelin that People have heard of, but the actual membranes that it getting that right. It you wouldn't want it as rigid as concrete, but you wouldn't want it as soft as Need to come up with something here. It's like gooey stuff that kids play with. It's like that goo. Anyway, there's a yes.[1:14:19] Andrew Huberman: It's disgusting, and it's too soft be a membrane for a neuron. That's what[1:14:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: they told me now. Machine.[1:14:23] Andrew Huberman: Someone put it in someone[1:14:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: put it[1:14:24] Andrew Huberman: in the comments and tell me what that disgusting gooey stuff is. You don't want your neurons to be That gooey, and yet you don't want them to be, like, concrete either.[1:14:31] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's a balance.[1:14:32] Andrew Huberman: It's a balance. Yeah. And in mentioning DHA, I'm just gonna I realize I'm backtracking, but I wanna make sure that we close all the hatches for people. We talked a lot about, EPA, but are Food sources of DHA, that you find particularly attractive either by taste or by, potency for DHA, what What are just a few that we could throw out? Because I am I am aware that there are supplements where you can get a nice ratio of EPA to DHA, or you take them separately as you do.[1:15:02] Andrew Huberman: But if I wanna make sure that I'm getting enough DHA, what do I need to be sure I'm eating on a regular basis?[1:15:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, the fish is packaging the DHA and EPA in the ratio. Okay. And, but I I also do eat salmon roe, which is, very salty, and, it's a it's a really high source of the phosphatylcholine DHA that we talked about.[1:15:22] Andrew Huberman: Fish eggs.[1:15:23] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It is. Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah. And, actually, I didn't eat.[1:15:25] Andrew Huberman: That I like for some reason.[1:15:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Oh, do you?[1:15:27] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'll eat so I'm discovering something about myself. This is was not meant to be nutritional psychotherapy, but you're doing that for me anyway. I'm discovering that, yeah, I like eating embryonic fish. I just don't like eating the actual[1:15:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Okay. Well[1:15:40] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So fish eggs are are okay. So caviar, basically.[1:15:43] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Caviar. Yes. And and that's a good source of the phospholipid form. And I was consuming that a lot because I wanted to get the phospholipid form.[1:15:50] Andrew Huberman: Yep.[1:15:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So and it's actually really good. There's been some animal studies in piglets and rodents as well showing that Consuming phospholipid DHA, during fetal brain development, like, gets, like, 10 times more DHA in the brain. Again, it's[1:16:07] Andrew Huberman: Makes sense based on fetal development. So do I need to in buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive at $100[1:16:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: in 10. Need to. Yeah. I think it's a it's a matter of preference and, you're if you're supplementing with your Your 2 to 4 grams of fish oil, I mean, that you're gonna get phospholipid form anyway because your body's gonna make it.[1:16:29] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I've I've seen some containers of of What I assume to be quality fish eggs that are not at the caviar level that you can find in in the better grocery stores that aren't super expensive.[1:16:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right.[1:16:40] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't dip as low as to go eat, for instance, like, fishing bait. Like, when we were kids, we used to go fishing. You put the fish egg on the thing. That's probably not good. It's good enough for the fish, apparently.[1:16:50] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Only half joking here, folks. I'm just trying to protect you from yourselves. Don't get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bait. Okay.[1:16:58] Andrew Huberman: So that's great to know. So we have these plant based compounds. We have the omega threes, so EPA, DHA, and Then you mentioned there's a 3rd category. What would you place in your 3rd category of foods or supplement based nutrients that Our health, brain, and or body health can really benefit from.[1:17:19] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, I think the most obvious would be vitamin d, which is actually, As you know, a steroid hormone that we produce when we're in the sun, depending on the time of year, we can make it in our skin. And depending on how much Melanin we have on our skin or whether or not we're wearing sunscreen or how old we are, it's it's a very it there's a sliding scale on how efficient that process is.[1:17:40] Andrew Huberman: And it's sort of as I understand, there's an inverse relationship with the darkers the more darker you the darker your skin is naturally, the more vitamin d you need to consume. Is that right?[1:17:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The darker your skin is, the harder it is. So there was a study out of the University of Chicago, this was several years ago, where they looked at, African Americans and, compared African Americans to, Caucasians with light skin, fair skin, and how How well they could make vitamin d from sun exposure and, and and how long they had to be in the sun to make x amount. Right? And it turns out that, African Americans with darker darker pigmentation, which protects them from the burning rays of the sun, it's a natural sunscreen, I had to stay in the sun, like, 6 times as long as someone with, none none of that natural sunscreen. So, I think the the the The take home there is, you know, a lot of people with a darker skin living in Sub Saharan Africa or people living in India with darker skin Or in the Philippines, you know, these equatorial regions where there's, there you tend to see darker skin because it's protection from the burning rays[1:18:44] Andrew Huberman: and stuff.[1:18:45] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They they are in the sun war.[1:18:46] Andrew Huberman: Right. Yeah.[1:18:47] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And they're getting more, vitamin d. But, people that maybe moved to United States, like Minnesota, or In a place where, you know, UVB radiation isn't, you know, getting to the atmosphere 12 months out of the year, it's only getting there 4 months, for example, Or even living in our modern day society where people just don't go outside anymore. I mean, we're inside. We're at our laptops in school. We're at work.[1:19:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: We're in our cubicle. Whatever. So, supplementation does play a major role, not only for people with, you know, darker skin that that aren't outside all the time, but for everyone. 70% of the US population Has inadequate vitamin d levels. 70 of the whole Amazing.[1:19:23] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: US. So this is everyone. And and so I think that Insufficient levels defined as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter, and and that's sort of defined by the the Endocrine Society, Looking looking looking at a lot of different aggregate studies in all cause mortality, for example, there's been a lot of different meta analyses of All cause mortality studies where vitamin d levels are are really seem to be ideal between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter. And so, In order to get to that level, if you are not outside all the time live in sun Southern California where you're always outside without sunscreen on. I always wear sunscreen because I'm trying to protect my skin from so many wrinkles and stuff.[1:20:09] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? But also skin cancer is, you know, somewhat of an issue as well. So So so, basically, the point is that vitamin d is a steroid hormone, meaning it actually binds to a receptor And, another receptor dimerizes with it, vitamin the the retinoid receptor. And that complex goes into the nucleus of a cell where your DNA is, And it recognizes little sequences of DNA called vitamin d response elements or called VDREs. There are specific sequences of DNA that this complex Vitamin d bound with the vitamin d receptor goes inside and recognizes and turns on a whole host of genes, turns off a whole host of genes.[1:20:47] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, this is This is important stuff. Like, imagine 70% of the population having insufficient testosterone. Right? It's a steroid hormone.[1:20:57] Andrew Huberman: Which might we might be headed there, but probably not. No. I think that it's names are very important, I think that one of the issues is that vitamin d is called vitamin d. It's not called, DHEA or, you know, variant blah blah blah. It doesn't sound like a hormone.[1:21:15] Andrew Huberman: I also I'm glad that you're mentioning, skin as the major Kind of interface between the environment and vitamin d synthesis because a lot of people think of skin as just a protective sheath around us or something to adorn ourselves with earrings or whatever. But skin obviously serves those roles, but the skin is an endocrine organ. It has the capacity to make Things that impact hormones and to make hormones. There's this beautiful study out this last year where, this took place in over in Israel where they had people get outside for 20 or 30 minutes A day, 3 times a week, exposing a, culturally acceptable yet, you know, substantial amount of their their skin, during that time and saw big increases in testosterone and estrogen, and this is through a keratinocyte linked pathway involving 53, they did a bunch they this was done in humans, but they did some knockout studies in parallel. And what this study told me or reminded me is that skin is an endocrine So the idea that sun could trigger the activation of of a production of a hormone is really interesting, and makes total sense.[1:22:17] Andrew Huberman: So when vitamin d gets into cells and it's, binding to these VDR ease, what, What sorts of things are they triggering? So, like, for testosterone, we know it's gonna trigger protein synthesis, muscle growth, tendon strength, etcetera. With estrogen, it's gonna be, Keep your neurons going, your joints feeling good. I always remind people that, by the way, because guys are always seem to want to increase their testosterone and reduce their Estrogen. Just remind people, if you reduce your estrogen, guys, your libido will plummet to near 0.[1:22:47] Andrew Huberman: Don't crush your estrogen. It'll also make you stupid. If you're not already stupid, it will make you stupid. So estrogen's vitally important for males and females. When vitamin d Gets into cells, what sorts of things is it stimulating?[1:23:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Okay. So first of all, it's it's regulating more than 5% of the protein encoded human genome. More than and this was you know, I say more than because when I was looking at this data really in-depth back in Starting in, you know, 2012 to 2014, it was that, and then it's now grown. But, One of the important things that you'll find interesting that I published on back in 2014 was that, I'd gone through this this big published database where someone had, you know, published all these genes they found BDREs in. And, basically, I found that Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 and Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 was on there.[1:23:44] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so then I started looking at the sequence and I was doing some in silico work, And it turns out that, the VDREs in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 so for people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase is an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. So tryptophan is what we an amino acid that we get from our food. You convert serotonin you you convert tryptophan into serotonin into the gut in the gut, but you also do it in the brain. However, serotonin does not cross the blood brain barrier. So Tryptophan has to get into your brain, and then you have to convert it to serotonin in your brain.[1:24:18] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, the enzyme that does that in your brain is called Tryptophan Hydroxylase 2, and it's activated by vitamin d. The one in the gut is actually Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1. Some of my my published work hypothesized that it might actually be repressed by vitamin d because it has a sequence. The sequence itself, this 12 nucleotide sequence, it can determine, into some degree whether it's gonna be activated or turned off. And so, like, I was able to look at that and think, oh, maybe this and that.[1:24:48] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so since then, there have been some groups that have confirmed more with in vivo and or in vitro studies. His mine was all in silicone and All that stuff. But, anyways so serotonin, a really important one. But most people I mean, this is regulating our immune our immune cell, immune system. It's regulating, our blood pressure, you know, all that that that's water retention.[1:25:11] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know? I mean, bone, of course, homeostasis. 5%, more than 5%. I mean, I can't tell you, like, so much.[1:25:18] Andrew Huberman: You know? And with 7 0% of the US population deficient, I'm beginning to think that this could be the linchpin in a number of really important issues. So supplementing vitamin d three is what I normally hear as the that I do. I take, I think I end up taking 5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs of vitamin d 3 per day. Just done that for a long time, and I've had my levels tested in their in range.[1:25:45] Andrew Huberman: But I have a family member. I'll just mention this. I have a family member who was not feeling well, just kind of feeling off, a little low, that had some digestive issues, this went on a long period of time, Was taking, on my recommendation, 15,000 IUs of d three and was still deficient in d three, now takes, I'm not suggesting anyone do this as a special case, perhaps, but no chronic illness that we're aware of needs to take 30,000 IUs per day in order to bring their d three range just into normal, which is, to me, is striking because they eat quite well, they're a healthy weight, etcetera. But it and it's made a tremendous difference in terms of their mood. Now, of course, it's correlative.[1:26:25] Andrew Huberman: Now they feel better. They're doing it. Who knows? They're probably also getting outside more. But, I mean, I think people need to get tested.[1:26:32] Andrew Huberman: They need to get their d three levels tested, but where where and what is a good starting range for people to To think about d three supplementation and, again, foods that can increase d three.[1:26:45] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So vitamin d three is a good way to supplement with it. Their vitamin d two would be a plant source. You often find it as fortified in, like, foods like milk. It's usually d two. There's been a a few[1:26:56] Andrew Huberman: still drink milk besides kids? Oh, people Out here, it's like you can't find cow's milk.[1:27:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, all the latkes that you're getting. Soy milk.[1:27:05] Andrew Huberman: What's the other one?[1:27:06] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They're fortified in those as well. Okay.[1:27:07] Andrew Huberman: Oh, they are? Okay.[1:27:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. They're fortified in[1:27:09] Andrew Huberman: I have a hard time finding[1:27:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: milk and oat milk and all that stuff. Yeah. They're they're they're in all that stuff. Okay. Vitamin d is naturally to some degree in fatty fish, like, you know, like, you you think about cod liver oil.[1:27:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? It's like it has vitamin d, but it's not You're not gonna correct a deficiency with eating vitamin with eating fish for your vitamin d. Like, you you you're either gonna correct it with sun exposure, Being in the right area, having the right amount of sun, and being the right age, because as you get old, you become very inefficient at doing that, Converting, vitamin d making vitamin d 3 in your skin.[1:27:43] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's probably what was going on here because this person is getting up in their[1:27:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: There's a lot of Single nucleotide polymorphisms. We talked about APOE 4 previously, but there's a variety of, genes that people very common, actually. In fact, I've had many people that have had to do done that exact same thing. So measuring your vitamin d levels before and after supplementation is only way you're gonna figure that out. Right?[1:28:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Very important. If you don't measure it, like, you don't know. Like, you know, you you can't know what you don't measure. So, so, there's a variety of SNPs that basically make that conversion inefficient. And in fact, there've been, a lot of these Mendelian randomization studies.[1:28:23] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So these are studies where people scientists will look at common SNPs, people that have these common variations of a gene that's a little more than 1% of the population. So it's not a random mutation. It's actually found in a in a a sizable percent of the population. And then they've looked at various outcomes. And, a lot of times they'll look at genes that are also involved in some kind of lifestyle factors, so vitamin d, and snips that basically make the conversion of vitamin either vitamin d precursor into d 3 or in d 3 into 25 hydroxyvitamin d or into the active steroid hormone, which is 125 hydroxyvitamin d.[1:29:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And there's a variety of different snips that show people. So you're not looking at vitamin d levels at all. You're looking at just the snips. And you know if they have it, they have low vitamin d. Okay?[1:29:11] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So it's really a way of Doing a beautifully randomized controlled trial with an observational study because you're You you're not biased. You know? Vitamin d levels are also associated with health. People that are have higher vitamin d are either outside more, they're more physically active, Or they're aware of their health and their supplementing. Right?[1:29:31] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So you always have to worry about that when you're when you're you're doing an observational sleep. But when dealing in randomization, it's beautiful for that reason where You now just random people are randomly have these genes, and it's not like, there's no health status. Like, if you have the SNP, like your friend like your family member was healthy and all that. You know? Were healthy, and yet they couldn't get their d levels up.[1:29:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? So, these these Mendelian randomization studies have found that people that can't convert Into the the precursor, the 25 hydroxyvitamin d, which is usually what's measured. It's the most stable form of vitamin d in the body. They have a higher all cause mortality if they can't do it so people with you know, that don't have it have a lower all cause mortality. They have a higher respiratory related mortality.[1:30:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They have a higher cancer related mortality. So, to me now why did I get on this rant? Oh, because you're a friend you're a family member. So, basically, they also are more likely to get multiple Gross. This this has all been done with Mendelian randomization.[1:30:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so, it really does hammer home the importance of measuring your vitamin d levels and, being being, very proactive about that. I mean, you can you can get it done anywhere. Your doctor will do it. You ask them to do it. You know?[1:30:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, supplementation wise, typically, if you don't have one of those SNPs, for for the most part, taking 1,000 IUs of vitamin d will raise blood levels by around Five nanograms per milliliter. So let's say you're deficient. You're 20 nanograms per milliliter, and you wanna get to 40. You're gonna need at least 4,000 IUs if you're Normal don't have any of these snips that change your metabolism of vitamin d. Right?[1:31:04] Andrew Huberman: Does it matter, when you take it relative to sun exposure, time of day, with or without[1:31:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Food. I've seen some not so great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time of day is important. I don't think it real like, I can't seem to to, you know, to find anything that really suggest because, like, the for it to actually be converted into the hormone, I mean, it's stored.[1:31:28] Andrew Huberman: The slow acting the steroid hormones are slow acting.[1:31:31] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. It's not like immediate thing. Right. So, like, you know, maybe we'll get some new data that's, like, otherwise, but I just don't yeah.[1:31:38] Andrew Huberman: It simplifies the problem anyway. So for people who are going to be stubborn and not get their d three levels test or their d levels tested and Simply say, oh, I'll just take some d three. That was me, by the way, until I got tested. I threw 5,000 IUs into the mix and figured, well, it's not gonna kill me. It'll bring you my vitamin d levels up.[1:32:00] Andrew Huberman: I didn't realize that's a bit of a of a of a course way to approach it, but, You know, I feel fine, and I'm I'm still breathing in ambulatory. So, is is that reasonable? A 1000 to 5,000 I use for most people will be reasonably safe. Again, we're not Make it just assuming that people are gonna just jump to it without the blood test.[1:32:17] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Of course. I think that, if we if we if we look at the the the literature, The scientific literature, it is extremely hard to get, like, hypercalcemia, which would be the major concern with really high levels of Vitamin d three supplementation. I mean, we're talking, like, hundreds of thousands of IU a day for a long time. So[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: Hundreds of thousands.[1:32:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes. Yes. Now the the the upper tolerable intake was set by the, the the Medicine Institute, To be 4,000, I just it was just like the safe it was kinda like one of those things where it's safe. I I personally take 5,000 I use a day as well, And, you know, my levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mil, and I I do out you know, I don't I don't put sunscreen on, Like, all the time, like, I do put it on my face and I wear a hat, but, like, some of my skin is being exposed. So I do make it, you know, from the sun as well.[1:33:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But,[1:33:10] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you brought up, the fact that you keep arms exposed if you because in these studies, that I mentioned before, looking at Sun exposure on skin and increases in, other hormones, testosterone, estrogen mainly, it was it became clear from looking at those data that The amount of skin that you expose is important, which makes perfect sense once you hear that. But I think most people are thinking, oh, I'm out in the sun, but are you wearing Shorts and a T shirt, or are you wearing a sweatshirt and it's a hoodie? Or, you know, are you are you all covered up out in the sun? Well, that might be great for setting your circadian rhythm by way of, light to the eyes, because that's the primary mechanism for that. But seems to me that the the more of your body surface that you can safely and appropriately, Please, folks, appropriately exposed to the sun, the more vitamin d you're going to create.[1:33:59] Andrew Huberman: Right? So laying out in on your back deck, in shorts and a T shirt with arms exposed and legs exposed is a very different stimulus than walking around in jeans and a and a sweatshirt.[1:34:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Absolutely.[1:34:10] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:34:11] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah.[1:34:11] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Especially if you got sunscreen on your face. I know it almost seems like trivially simple, but I I'm not sure that people are used to thinking about their skin as a interface to create these hormones. Yeah. So surface area matters.[1:34:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And by the way, you know, there there have been studies looking at, People that are deficient in vitamin d, in this case, it was, African Americans that were given a 4000 IU a day vitamin d supplement to bring them back to sufficient levels. And, so that this was a smaller smaller study than, I would like, but it reversed their epigenetic aging by, like, 3 years. Because, again, it's a hormone. It's regulating more than 5% of your protein encoding human genome. There was there's been studies looking at Vitamin d receptor knockout mice, and I I use this a lot in my presentations when I'm talking about vitamin d and longevity.[1:35:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But, If you look at these animals, the vitamin d receptor, as I mentioned earlier, vitamin d binds to the receptor and then it complexes with the retinoid receptor and they go into the nucleus of complex and reg you turn on and turn off genes. Well, if you get rid of that receptor, which is what you can do in animal studies, you can just you can sort of determine, like, what effects There will be with no vitamin d. Right? Like, what how do you study no no vitamin d? And so, what was found was that These animals and in fact in fact, I don't think it was a complete knockout or you know, because I think it might be embryonic lethal.[1:35:35] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But[1:35:36] Andrew Huberman: Some hypo some hypo which is basically geeks speak for A gene is very is vastly reduced in its function number and function, number people know what I mean, but, but isn't eliminated completely. Yeah.[1:35:48] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right. Well, these animals, if you look at them, after the age of 4 months, I mean, the mice look Like, I mean, they're accelerated aging. They're wrinkled. They have no hair. I mean, they just I mean, their life span lifespan shorter.[1:36:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, they just they you can look at this animal and not know anything about mice or work with them and be like, that animal looks like it's, you know of course, mice life spends around, like, two, two and a half years, but, like, 500 years old.[1:36:14] Andrew Huberman: Right. You know? It looks like it it went to graduate school twice. Yeah. Actually, graduate school is a lot of fun.[1:36:19] Andrew Huberman: I like to think I age backwards in graduate which is not true. I look at the photos. I definitely aged forward. You, on the other hand, look exactly the same way you did 10 years ago. I'm not saying that to Flattery, but it's absolutely true.[1:36:29] Andrew Huberman: I mean, the the data are the data. It's it's remarkable. So I I think it's I'm definitely gonna try and get my Omega 3 percentage up there. I'm not gonna, you know, hinge it all on that, but, clearly, you're doing a lot of things. Right?[1:36:42] Andrew Huberman: So if I'm taking vitamin d three, I still need to get out into the sun. Correct? Absolutely. Okay. I think a lot of people don't know that, or at least I have family members that have been a little bit resistant.[1:36:53] Andrew Huberman: Like, my vitamin d so I don't need to get outside as much. I think people are really afraid of getting out into the sun because they're worried about melanomas. And, and I'm as to be honest, I'm as scared of sunscreen as I am of melanoma. Like, there's some of the things in sunscreen are really spooky, Mainly, the comp and here, I'm not one of these I drink tap water with some folks. I like, people cringe with it.[1:37:15] Andrew Huberman: I I drink tap water. I have the occasional croissant or doughnut. I'm I'm not you know, I'm I'm 90%, 80% of the time I'm doing the right things the right way, I think. Although, I'm now gonna improve on them with this new knowledge, but But I don't like what I see in most sunscreens because if you look at these compounds, they cross the blood brain barrier. I don't want compounds crossing the blood brain barrier[1:37:38] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Titanium dioxide?[1:37:39] Andrew Huberman: Dioxide, some of the triclosans that are also in these cleansers. I mean, it's once you know a little bit about neurons, folks, you realize that the neurons you got are basically the ones you've got for your entire life. You know, there's a reason why there's a blood brain barrier, a blood ovary, and a blood testes barriers because the genetic material resides in the testes, the ovaries, and the brain, those neurons don't turn over. Are a few new neurons, but not that many unless you're a mouse, frankly. And so protecting those is very key, and a lot of the things in sunscreen, are downright dangerous.[1:38:10] Andrew Huberman: So I think there are sunscreens that are safe, but it's very hard to figure out which sunscreens are free of these Compounds. I'm amazed that they're still on the market, frankly.[1:38:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I've always geared towards the ones with the the the minerals that are, like, reflecting it. It is it is somewhat difficult to penetrate things all the way through the skin into the get into the bloodstream. I don't but I don't know. Maybe some of these compounds get in there easily. I have seen the evidence with some of those things.[1:38:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They go there is some evidence they go transdermal, and they[1:38:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And they get in? Okay. Well, I know that there some of them react with The sun and while they do protect from the UVA and or b, they, like, form massive reactive oxygen species and Carcinogen. I mean, it's like the the very thing you're trying to protect yourself from might actually cause[1:38:57] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:38:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: We don't know. I mean, like, it's completely speculation. But, There is, like, I think some more more and more evidence coming out with some of those compounds. And I I can't remember all all of them off the top of my head, but, a lot of high end ones also have Have you know? It's the chemical sunscreen ones.[1:39:13] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:39:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The chemical ones.[1:39:14] Andrew Huberman: Right. We should do, I'm proposing that we do a journal club. A journal club, folks, is where academics get together and Read pay when they get read papers and they get together and they pick apart the papers, there's a strong correlation between being an early graduate student and being the most Critical because once you've actually published some papers, you realize that, you know, most studies, people are doing their best within the context of what they can do. It'd be great to do a journal club at some point about sunscreens, because I'd love to really figure out what's in these compounds. I mean, people are using them like crazy, I'm not one of these people who's like, oh, I won't use commercial toothpaste or anything like that.[1:39:46] Andrew Huberman: I I I'm like I said, I drink tap water. I use commercial toothpaste, whatever. But when it comes to sunscreen, it freaks me out Because the some of these compounds do go transdermal, and some of them cross the blood brain barrier, and I'd like to keep my neurons free of That stuff. Anyway, we're speculating now.[1:40:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Wear a hat.[1:40:03] Andrew Huberman: Wear a hat, but get out in the sun and get your d three levels up. Okay. So we've we talked about these plant based compounds, the omega threes and d three. Unless there's something else that you just Absolutely must throw into the mix. I probably will return us to the conversation that I opened up with, which is about cold and heat, which, Admittedly, I pulled us off that that path, so I wanna I take full responsibility for that.[1:40:28] Andrew Huberman: But before I do that, I just wanna offer you the opportunity. Is there Are there is there anything that, fit to supplement based or food based compounds that you, you know, you think are especially useful for brain and or body health.[1:40:43] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I do think magnesium is important in there as well. I mean, I think, You know, again, about 40% of the US population doesn't get enough magnesium. It's an essential mineral we're supposed to be getting from our diet, and it's[1:40:56] Andrew Huberman: involved in everything.[1:40:57] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It is. It's involved it's also involved in vitamin d metabolism. And in fact, being deficient in magnesium may make it more difficult for you to actually Make vitamin d hormone. So that 125 hydroxy vitamin d. So one of those other factors, again, talking we talked about genetics, but there's magnesium status as well, considering 40%.[1:41:18] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: That's a big number. Now, you know, magnesium's also involved in Making ATP the the energetic currency of our cells. They're you know, basically, all of our cells need ATP to do anything. And, they're all it's also involved in utilizing ATP as well as DNA repair enzymes. These are enzymes that are involved in repairing damage to our DNA.[1:41:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I personally think that magnesium insufficiency is a a a insidious type causes an insidious type of damage Daily that you can't look in the mirror and see. Like, when you're deficient in vitamin c, you're like, my my gums are falling apart. I have scurvy. Right? But, like, you can't see DNA damage.[1:41:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You can't see it, but it's happening. It's happening right now in my body, and it's happening in your body. It's happening normal metabolism is happening, you know, every day. But we repair that damage. We have repair enzymes in our body called DNA repair enzymes.[1:42:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They require magnesium. Magnesium is a cofactor for them. What that means is, you know, a cofactor means enzymes need it to function properly. And so, without that cofactor, They're not doing it properly. And I like the the way I like to think about magnesium, it's easy because people go, what food should I eat?[1:42:28] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? Naturally, that's the next question. Well, magnesium is at the center of a chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. So Dark leafy greens are high in magnesium.[1:42:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's one of the and peep basically, what is the 40% insuffic insufficiency in the US tell us? People aren't eating their greens. They're not eating their greens. They're eating their packaged food. They're eating their processed food.[1:42:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The standard American diet isn't really high in dark leafy greens. So so dark leafy greens are how I like to get my magnesium. I think it comes along with all these other important I mean, you get calcium in them, you get Vitamin k one, you're getting a lot of other micronutrients, and you're getting other compounds that we don't know about, and ones that we know about, like Sulfuriphene. Right?[1:43:12] Andrew Huberman: As with broccoli, do I need to eat the dark leafy greens raw? And in this case, I'm a little more open to it because I actually like the taste of, Dare I say kale, and, kale's a dark leafy green. Right? Start I mean, it's obviously I'm not[1:43:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: lutein and zenithiasis.[1:43:28] Andrew Huberman: I'm a try chromat, meaning I'm I'm not color blind, but I but I just wanna make sure it falls under the strict category. Yes. Because every once in a while, I'm like, oh, I eat my vegetables. I like avocados. If you wanna remind me, avocados is not vegetable.[1:43:37] Andrew Huberman: I love vegetables, also. But so kale, what are some other examples? And[1:43:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard, Romaine lettuce. I mean[1:43:47] Andrew Huberman: Is the bitterness an important component to this? I know every[1:43:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: museum, no. But for for Sulfuraphane Sulfuraphane for cruciferous vegetables. That would be the the the the Brassica family. But your question about cooking them, So magnesium is it it is bound to the food matrix, and, and it can be somewhat less bioavailable. But I you know?[1:44:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So cooking it can somewhat release the the magnesium, but it goes into the water too. So, like, you have to, like, Either steam it or kind of, you know, like, get your water in[1:44:24] Andrew Huberman: You can drink it. With[1:44:25] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: it. Like yeah. You know? I I personally don't worry about it.[1:44:28] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Just don't worry.[1:44:29] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I think, like[1:44:30] Andrew Huberman: Well, if you don't worry, I'm not gonna[1:44:31] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But I also like I too supplement with mag I do take around a so supplementation with magnesium mean, this we could go on and on. Let's keep this the short and sweet because we're gonna get back to the other stuff. But, you know, it can cause GI distress at, like, high doses. I personally like to take around a 130 or 135 milligrams. Mhmm.[1:44:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: That way it's not like, a huge bolus to my gut.[1:44:53] Andrew Huberman: But I[1:44:53] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: think it[1:44:54] Andrew Huberman: depends on the form of magnesium too.[1:44:56] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes. Yeah. I mean, you can take, like, magnesium, 3 and 8, for example, and it, you know, isn't as affect you know, it doesn't affect the gut as much.[1:45:04] Andrew Huberman: Magnesium citrate.[1:45:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Citrate is what[1:45:06] Andrew Huberman: I take. Yeah. It is the pretty I[1:45:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: take pretty[1:45:09] Andrew Huberman: potent, gut stimulus. I mean, I I feel like it's a little bit harder to man to digest.[1:45:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: A 100135 milligrams should be pretty good. And citrate actually Oh, boy. Do we wanna go here? So,[1:45:20] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I I it's up to you, and we can, we don't have to. I personally, I've been supplementing with magnesium for a long time. Yeah. I've I use three and eight and bisglycinate Mhmm. And malate Mhmm.[1:45:34] Andrew Huberman: For different reasons. So I, Yes. I would love to go there if you're if you're willing[1:45:37] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: to. Would be the best, and that that that has to do with the short chain fatty acids being good for the gut and a lot of work done by a former colleague of mine and good Mark Shigenaga showing that the short chain fatty acid citrate, malate, lactate, but but specifically, malate really and lactate are the are the are the major ones that get into To to the gut epithelial cells and our energy source for the mitochondria and the goblet cells. So, anyways, whole other[1:46:03] Andrew Huberman: That's okay. Yeah. I take MALLETE because I was told that it would, be helpful. I first of all, it doesn't make me sleepy like some of the other Forms of magnesium, which are act as a mild sedative for me. Mhmm.[1:46:15] Andrew Huberman: They do tap into the GABAergic pathway neuro neurotransmitter folks that, In general, broad sweeping generalization here can can have somewhat of a, of a sedative quality, which is why I take magnesium threonate And or bisglycinate before sleep, 30 to 60 minutes before sleep, definitely enhances my transition time to sleep, and the depth of sleep. No question. In my my experience, there's some data that three and a can be cognitive can be neuroprotective, although those are still those studies are ongoing. I I'm getting the sense that maybe you're a little more skeptical of that than[1:46:50] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I am. Yeah. I know. I'm I I've I've seen the studies with the 3 and 8. I I think, Like, looking at the actual data from the the the the one clinical study, there wasn't statistical significance until all 3 of the pieces of data were pulled together, but that really could just be because their sample size was too small.[1:47:07] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:47:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? Yeah. I'm thinking[1:47:08] Andrew Huberman: that that paired with the there's some work. Yeah. The work on with so in the this is getting kind of into inside ball of neuroscience. You know, the the quality of the labs matters, folks, And that's something that's not accessible to people outside of fields. And, you know, Guosong Liu and some of the other folks with at that time at MIT did I I think very highly of their work, and so the the animal studies are indeed just animal studies, but I was pretty impressed by what they did in those studies.[1:47:35] Andrew Huberman: Very pioneering thing When you think about this being done 10, 12, 15 years ago, and then, yes, we need more human clinical data, but I for me, I figured that the Given the safety profile of Mag3 and eight, given that it helps me sleep better and sleeping better is just better for everything, frankly, That's why I take it. And bisglycinate and three and eight seem to be somewhat interchangeable, but there's I don't know of any reports that bisglycinate can be neuroprotective. But malaise, I take during the daytime. I I it for me, and, again, this is subjective, it has a tangible effect in improving the recovery time from exercise. So it I don't know that I've been sore from a workout since I started taking Mallet, and I used to get very sore from even kind of trivial workout.[1:48:19] Andrew Huberman: So I don't know what's going on there, but I keep taking it.[1:48:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Malate, again, the short chain fatty acid. And, I mean, you know, when you do heavy when you do intense extra exercise, you release endotoxin from your gut. I I'm just going back to the interesting work because the the the malate being the short chain fatty acid and, you know know, Mark Shigenaga is showing this is all in animal research, by the way. But, I mean, it was like, you know, feeding these animals Malate, and it really protected the gut, endotoxin release, and, it affected metabolic syndrome and all sorts of things, but I think malate malate's awesome. And I always try to eat green apples.[1:48:52] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They're really high in malic acid[1:48:53] Andrew Huberman: Oh, good to know.[1:48:54] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, tart cherries. Tartture is really high in it as well. So[1:48:57] Andrew Huberman: It also tastes really good.[1:48:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But I I I was really interested in the magnesium threonate stuff. I take a supplement called Magnesium by Moon Juice, and it's like a little powder. It's got a little bit of monk fruit, but it, tastes good. So I I do it a little bit before bedtime, as well. Probably several more hours though because I don't like to drink tons and tons of fluids before I go to bed.[1:49:17] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, it has magnesium threonate and a variety of other, versions of magnesium in it as well, and, I really like it. But I thought the magnesium three innate stuff was super interesting. I, you know, would love to see more clinical data as well, but I think, know, once we get it, it'll probably be like, oh, yeah. It's getting into the brain, and it's awesome. So Right.[1:49:34] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know, why wait?[1:49:35] Andrew Huberman: Right. I, I and along those lines, I once put out a a Post that said, you know, I I feel like there are a number of different categories of health cons health information consumers online, and understanding which one you're in for which topic can alleviate a lot strain and stress of finding the information. Like, there's some people that are perfectly comfortable with data from a mouse study. It's like if it's done in mice, great. I'll try it.[1:49:56] Andrew Huberman: Other people say, no. It has to be done in humans. Double line placebo controlled studies, you know, randomized clinical trials, etcetera. Then other people are just say, you know what? I don't even care about any of that.[1:50:06] Andrew Huberman: Just Tell me what you do. And then other people would say, you know what? I don't even care what you do. Just tell me what to do. And then there's this other category, which are if it's in pill form or powder form, they'll take it.[1:50:16] Andrew Huberman: And so I think a lot of the battles of people picking apart people's posts and things have to do with the fact that that people don't realize that people are showing up to the table In one or some combination of those stances, we know people that will try anything, and we know people that won't take anything. So, the idea here is to create a a an array of possibilities for people, and I think the animal data are very impressive. We should have you back on[1:50:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: to talk. With the hope of because I feel like the animal data is very promising, and so I'm like, it probably is, so why not? Well and, obviously, you're doing things right.[1:50:50] Andrew Huberman: So So you're doing things right. So cold and heat converge on some common pathways related to what you called Intermittent challenge, which I love. I I think if, you know, intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, I mean, maybe even intermittent sleep deprivation. I keep waiting for the intermittent sleep deprivation movement. I will say I pull a few all nighters per year just for Work demands and procrastination and deadlines, and I'm a I'm the worst combination of of academic because I'm both a procrastinator and a perfectionist, So you end up pulling some all nighters.[1:51:26] Andrew Huberman: The sleep I get the next night is pretty amazing, I must say. It's the sleep of gods, but I don't recommend anyone use sleep deprivation for that. But could imagine that we also evolved having some sleepless nights. So this idea of intermittent challenge is is a really attractive one, and I wanna make sure that we credit you with the phrase intermittent Challenge.[1:51:43] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: No. Credit doctor Mark Madsen.[1:51:45] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Doctor Mark Madsen[1:51:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: gets to and he has[1:51:48] Andrew Huberman: used those word that phrase. Okay. Great. We'll make sure.[1:51:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like Doctor David Sinclair, I love the xenohormesis. He was in, like, one of his publications just so many years ago. I just love it. It's brilliant, a brilliant term. So, Mark Matson[1:52:00] Andrew Huberman: Those Harvard guys are pretty smart. You know, it's I mean, it's a it's a good school, I guess. Of course, it's a good school. We will credit the appropriate people. Thank you for that clarification.[1:52:11] Andrew Huberman: So, you've talked a lot about the use of deliberate what I call deliberate cold exposure only to distinguish it from cold that you might just be accidentally exposed to, but it's sort of obvious when we say cold exposure. There's some amazing data on cold. The other day, I saw a post from you, and if you've include this in talks before, I did not know this until I learned it from you, so credit to you, That even 20 seconds of immersion in I think it was 4 degree[1:52:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: 49 degree Fahrenheit.[1:52:41] Andrew Huberman: 49 degree Fahrenheit. Okay. I was translating the Celsius, but 49 degree Fahrenheit water. So cold water can lead to long lasting increases in epinephrine adrenaline. And I have to presume other neuro, neuromodulators and neurochemicals as well.[1:52:56] Andrew Huberman: What are some cold protocols that you find Particularly interesting or attractive from the standpoint of, I don't know, pick your favorite metabolism, Neuro slash mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, of course, weaves back to metabolism. You know, we could we could do an entire episode all about coal, but what I'd love to know is, you know, what sort of activity or stimulus do you Do you think is a reasonable and particularly potent one, to use in terms of cold?[1:53:28] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So today, I did 3 minutes at 49 degrees Fahrenheit. I have a cold tub.[1:53:33] Andrew Huberman: So you get in up to your neck?[1:53:35] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, I try. I keep floating up, and so I'm like, It's, like, really hard. So the like, I I I would say, like[1:53:43] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:53:44] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Maybe most of my shoulder. I mean, really, I'm floating up. I was telling I was telling my husband. I like, this there's too much water in here for me. I can't Or[1:53:50] Andrew Huberman: too much salt in there? Is it like the Dead Sea where you float on top?[1:53:53] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Is there salt in there? I don't know. He takes care of all the Okay. Stuff that, You know, it's it's it's the it's the plunge.[1:53:58] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. But, yeah, they may then, by the way, we're the podcast nor I am sponsored by Plunge. They did give me one. That thing is fantastic. Also, because it circulates the water.[1:54:06] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It does.[1:54:06] Andrew Huberman: Which make sure that you break up the thermal layer, and it's even colder.[1:54:09] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It is even colder. It sucks. Anyways, so look. I'll I'll I'll give I'll give it a a I'll be honest here. I wish I did more cold than I do.[1:54:19] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I do cold when I'm gonna go on a podcast. I definitely do cold when I'm gonna do a podcast, When I'm gonna give a talk or when I'm anxious, I need to make it more of a ritual. I love doing the sauna. I hate the cold. I Hate it.[1:54:32] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Unless it's summertime, it's a lot easier for me to get in the cold in the summertime. But, what I do love about the cold is how I feel after, and, I feel less anxious. I feel good. I feel more focused, which is why I usually do it before Any type of public speaking or in just when I'm just anxious, I'll just get in there. And so, The 20 seconds at 49 degrees I think it was 49 degrees Fahrenheit was really a good number because Time and temperature do time or duration, I guess, would be a better word, and temperature do matter.[1:55:11] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But but, You know, you can you can do 20 seconds at a colder temperature, which is I prefer, or you can do a minute or longer at a warmer temperature. I think There was another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit at 1 hour. It was, like, 2 or 3 full, but who wants to do 1 hour?[1:55:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm familiar with that study. I the the I love this is really It reveals just how absolutely nerdy I am and maybe why some times and relationships in my life were challenged. I love reading the method sections of papers. So, you know, people can come at me with a number of things about papers, and I might miss something for surely, I miss certain things like anybody does.[1:55:47] Andrew Huberman: But the methods, I sort of I I relish in reading the methods, and that paper is really interesting because they had people sit in lawn chairs, basically, in swimming pools So for an hour and it wasn't real it was chilly. It wasn't super cold. I mean, sixties not[1:56:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right.[1:56:03] Andrew Huberman: It's not warm, but it's not ice cold, obviously. But an hour is ridiculous, at some level, but the increases in dopamine were massive and lasted hours. So it's it's really so the mood enhancing effects that you report are they're not, you're not imagining that. Those are almost certainly a you know, The consequence of having slowly elevating but significantly elevated dope dopamine that goes on for hours. That's almost a dreamlike profile for dopamine Because most everything else, like an Adderall, a Ritalin, a cup of coffee, and a, and a workout drink or pre workout drink or something is gonna give you a big spike in adrenaline and dopamine and a Big crash.[1:56:43] Andrew Huberman: And somehow, it creates this really nice contoured profile. So I whatever you're experiencing there is very nicely supported by the data.[1:56:52] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Well, I I need to get I need to get doing it more. I I've I've had a a couple of scary experiences going from hot to cold.[1:57:00] Andrew Huberman: Can you explain? Yeah.[1:57:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Blood pressure changes, I think, where I basically went straight from a really hot Jacuzzi. I was in there for, like, 30 minutes. I mean, I was I was doing heat test.[1:57:10] Andrew Huberman: Too easy. Okay.[1:57:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. A 104 degrees Fahrenheit.[1:57:12] Andrew Huberman: That's toasty.[1:57:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And then I for 30 minutes. And then I went straight into at the time, It was our pool. It was in, like, February. It was, like, wintertime, and it was, 50 it was in the fifties. It was cold.[1:57:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and I was in there, and I was, like, listening to Simon Garfunkel. I was, like, trying to stay in a long time, get on my cold, and I was trying to press Dan because he, like, goes in there for, like, He'll stay in there for, like, 15 minutes. But I started to feel really, like, blinky, like, low blood pressure or something, and I got scared, so I got out. And then I couldn't stand. Like, I had vertigo or something, and I was so scared.[1:57:48] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I was so scared. And so and I've I've had a couple of Times 2, we're just going straight from the sauna to it, to the cold plunge, where I'm starting to feel I'm like, oh, I feel a little blood pressure Change or something. And it makes sense. The the sauna is causing vasodilation, and the cold plunge is or cold exposure is causing vasoconstriction. It feels like a very, you know, just shocked my system.[1:58:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so now I wait. Like, I wait, like, a few minutes before going in, but, I do need to kinda, like, make it more the cold more routine because I talk all about the science. I'm familiar with all of the science and, You know, the the norepinephrine or noradrenaline, you know, it's affecting brain and mood, and and I'm you know way more about that than I do. I know how I feel, and I, know, know it's a neurotransmitter, and, you know, it is it is released. At least in rats, they've shown or was it mice?[1:58:39] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I think it might have been rats, but multiple studies showing in that it's released From the cold in the brain.[1:58:44] Andrew Huberman: And and now in humans as well. Oh, in brain control. Study, but the that's the we can put a link to this. It's published in 2000, European Journal of Physiology, that big dopamine increase, they also looked at epinephrine and cortisol and saw some really yeah. So this has been done They[1:58:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: did brain. Oh, I didn't[1:58:59] Andrew Huberman: Oh, no.[1:58:59] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: No. Not your plasma. No. Yeah. Yeah.[1:59:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Very hard to measure, doping directly from the brain unless you're doing microdialysis. No. Unfortunately, there there's, unfortunately, their skulls were intact. Fortunately for them unfortunately for the research committee, their skulls were intact, so they couldn't measure directly in the brain.[1:59:14] Andrew Huberman: But, obviously, there there's a correlate there. You know, it's it's a very real effect. I I think that, but the the advantage of not doing it too often is that you're not cold adapted. Now it's very hard for anyone to get truly cold adapted. I some people start to look forward to the cold, and what I think they're looking forward to is the feeling afterward, that dopamine rush.[1:59:37] Andrew Huberman: But if you get cold adapted, then it certainly blunts the some of the effect.[1:59:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But I wanna be cold adapted because that means I have have more mitochondria in my adipose tissue and on perhaps even muscle. Like, that's been shown.[1:59:51] Andrew Huberman: The so maybe this is a good opportunity to So cold and UCP one, if you could educate us on UCP one, I find this really and I learned about it from you. So[1:59:59] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. Well, so norepinephrine actually released in the plasma. It does act as a hormone. Vasoconstriction is one thing it does, but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions that have to do with adaption to cold. One happening happening to be, you know, shivering is a very Inefficient way to produce heat, which is what your body is trying to do when it's exposed to cold.[2:00:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And your muscles are basically contracting and and and, And producing heat from that, but that's just not very efficient. So, the the more eloquent way to do it or elegant, I guess, way to do it is, you know, to basically Have your mitochondria produce tons and tons of heat. So, the way it does this is by activating a gene called UCP 1, uncoupling protein 1. Norepinephrine is upstream without activating it. So, that what that does is essentially so mitochondria are these little organelles inside of your cells that are responsible for producing energy.[2:00:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Usually, that's in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP, and that's what Let everything function inside your body from your neurotransmitter production to your heart beating, etcetera. However, you can uncouple your mitochondria. Basically, your mitochondria, they're like a little battery. So they have, they have well, they have a double membrane, first of all, their structure, but they have a negative charge on the inside, And they have a positive charge on the inner membrane. So in between the outer membrane and inside the inside part.[2:01:26] Andrew Huberman: Like a neuron.[2:01:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like a neuron. Yeah. So I guess it's it's like a neuron. It's like a battery, negative and positive. Well, basically, you can uncouple that that charge, and so that positive charge protons start leaking out of the Your mitochondria freak out.[2:01:38] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So this is called uncoupling it. And they start to it's maximum respiration as we call it. They try to make as much energy. They're like, I gotta get those that that that proton back, that gradient, the electrochemical gradient. And so they just go insane.[2:01:54] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And they, in this case, it's uncoupled energy. So the energy they're making is actually heat, not ATP. But heat is but you're essentially burning substrate. So who cares? You're burning you're burning glucose.[2:02:06] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You're burning lipids. You know? You're you're basically burning things and making heat. And so, that's what uncoupling it does, and that is a much more efficient way of producing heat than shivering. So as you become more adapted, maybe the the the longer duration that you've you've stayed in the cold or the more times you've done it, You'll no longer shiver anymore.[2:02:25] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You will start to then just do this uncoupling type of thermogenesis as it's called. And, Another type of adaptation that occurs is you actually produce more mitochondria in your adipose tissue. And, and that actually happens Also regulated by Norepinephrine or noradrenaline through a protein called PGC one alpha. And what that protein does is it makes More mitochondria in your adipose cells. So per adipose cell, you're getting more mitochondria.[2:02:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's a beautiful way To basically make more heat when you're it's it's one of those things where it's like it's it's your body's going, okay. I'm gonna be exposed to this cold next time. How can I make sure I don't die? Oh, I can have more mitochondria, and I'm gonna make more heat. And so you're making more mitochondria in your adipose tissue.[2:03:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and this is often referred to as, like, the browning of fat. And the reason for that is because if you look under a microscope at a lipid droplet, you know, basically, a fat cell, not a lipid drop, it adipocyte. You'll find that it looks darker because there's more mitochondria in there. So it's referred to as browning fat. And so, we I don't wanna get into the whole beige fat brown.[2:03:37] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know, there's this whole I'm sure you've had experts on that all about that,[2:03:40] Andrew Huberman: but Not yet. I mean, I always think of white fat, beige fat, brown fat, and beige is kind of intermediate. In our White can be converted into beige. But Right.[2:03:47] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And beige can take on thermogenic Characteristics, essentially. And so, so you can activate beige fat so that it's thermogenic in the sense that it's burning glucose and or, you know, fatty acids and and producing heat. So, so the more you expose yourself to cold, The more you can brown your fat, so to speak, and and therefore, you can tolerate the cold for longer periods, which people do notice, And you can, then have the thermogenic qualities of having more brown adipose tissue or beige activated beige adipose tissue, Which is, you know, you'll get a lot of naysayers out there saying, oh, brown fat doesn't regulate metabolism at all. And the reality is there's, like, thousands of researchers trying to They'll pill up brown fat and thermogenic like, they're trying to make it a a pill because it does affect metabolism. You know, it's not the only thing.[2:04:40] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's certainly if you're obese And trying to lose weight, you're not gonna, like, do that just by doing cold exposure. You need to do dietary and exercise, changes, you know, predominantly. But It does it does affect metabolism. And, you know, again, this is this has been shown in human studies. So, it is a a interesting Another it's another possible mechanism for, affecting metabolism, and that's an adipose tissue, but you also Make more mitochondria and muscle tissue.[2:05:09] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And this is regulated not via Norepinephrine, but it is still PGC one alpha. Interestingly, Not like not that anyone else really cares about me, and maybe you do, Andrew.[2:05:18] Andrew Huberman: I I'm I'm eating this up.[2:05:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So p so PGC one alpha, is is respond is response to Norepinephrine and adipose tissue to make more mitochondria. But in, in muscle tissue, it's unclear what the regulator is. Cold exposure does it. So this is this was shown, at least in a couple of studies I've seen where, people that were exercising, I believe, or maybe may have been men only that were Exercising, did some separate training, and then did cold water immersion something like 50 degrees Fahrenheit, 15 minutes. And PGC one alpha, which is a biomarker for mitochondrial biogenesis, which is the generation of new mitochondria.[2:05:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: By the way, that's awesome. You want more mitochondria in your muscle. It's associated with, improved muscle mass, improved endurance. I mean, mitochondria are essentially either they're making energy in your cell, and we, you know, we don't Make more mitochondria normally. Like, you have certain inputs, extra high intensity interval training.[2:06:11] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Exercise can do it.[2:06:13] Andrew Huberman: And actually make more mitochondria.[2:06:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yes. Yeah. And that's been shown in people.[2:06:16] Andrew Huberman: And we training or just high intensity interval training?[2:06:20] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I haven't seen weight Training, I've seen it in in high intensity interval training, endurance training, but that doesn't mean that it hasn't been shown. I just haven't seen it or that it hasn't And so[2:06:31] Andrew Huberman: to know, I'm I'm always looking for reasons to finally do more hip type high intensity interval training work. I do weight training, and I do Low intensity cardio.[2:06:40] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: There was a brilliant study by, at the time he was a postdoc, Matthew Robinson, and He's now gone on to start his own lab at the University of Oregon Health Science Center.[2:06:53] Andrew Huberman: Great place.[2:06:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and he did a study where, both young and old older people were they had this whole high intensity protocol, which remember what it was, but their protocol, for x amount of time, I'm I'm sure it was at least a month, they then measured Biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis in their muscle tissue and, the the amount of mitochondrial biogenesis in old people Typically, it happened in both young and old from HIIT from the high intensity interval training was I mean, it was, like, enormous. At least 50%, I think. Like so, I mean, it was just like, woah. And so, like, why would you want that? Well, you know, mitochondria your your you don't make cell your cells are turning over.[2:07:35] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You make new cells. You replace old ones. With your mitochondria, you don't really do that for the most part. You can. Mitochondrial biogenesis does happen, but you have to Stimulate it to happen.[2:07:45] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, the way your like, what happens with your mitochondria is they essentially are bobbing around inside of your cells, and then they They fuse with other mitochondria, exchange all their content, mitochondrial DNA, and then fizz back apart. And that's how they kinda stay young ish. But, like, as you age, you you keep doing that with the same pool of mitochondria, then you're gonna get a bunch of old mitochondria mixing old stuff together. Right? So why wouldn't you wanna, like, Bring up new, healthy, young mitochondria into that pool.[2:08:12] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? So in my mind, when I hear mitochondrial biogenesis, I'm like aging. That's the first thing I think of. So, anyways, cold exposure does that. Amazing.[2:08:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Other things as well. So[2:08:23] Andrew Huberman: You know what? It's I and, Ed, please, thank you for offering to, you know, somehow filter the the level of detail, but I assure you that listeners of this podcast are are Familiar with getting, drinking from the fire hose of mechanism, and that was really helpful. And, again, this is just one example of maybe 4 or 5 other things That you said, at least, that are gonna inspire me to change my behaviors. I'm gonna start doing some high intensity interval training. Doctor Andy Galpin was on this podcast recently, and he told me that that The subtle zone 2 cardio and the weight training is great, but that I really should be doing some max heart rate work per week.[2:08:58] Andrew Huberman: You know, going into max heart rate for 90 seconds and resting and Feeding that, maybe even mild repeats. I'm just curious as a brief aside before we we talk about heat, what What sort of, cardiovascular or other types of training do you do? Do you do HIT? I imagine you are doing high intensity interval training. You could just give us a sense of the contour of your your week as it relates to exercise and and because you've been very gracious in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food.[2:09:24] Andrew Huberman: What about Exercise.[2:09:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So I, it all depends on my week, of course, and and and what I've got going on with my son and and my work schedule. But I typically I do a lot of high intensity interval Tabatas on a stationary cycle. I use Peloton because, I just like, the instructor there, like, telling me what to do and then me competing with everyone else. I'm like, you know? So, it worked[2:09:47] Andrew Huberman: You're revealing something about your psychology. This is what we just learned about. So this podcast is actually just a decoy for for, psychological assessment of the guest. No. I'm kidding.[2:09:55] Andrew Huberman: But so now we know you're competitive. Good. Yeah. That It explains a lot of how you got through graduate school and then do do what you do. So you're getting on the Peloton, and what does it look like for someone who's not Familiar with Peloton.[2:10:07] Andrew Huberman: I know what they are, but I've never been on 1. You are pedaling against the instructor for how many seconds?[2:10:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, you're there's a bunch People that are online either doing the class with you at the same time or have all time doing it so you can you can kind of toggle on what you want and, like, You can try to compete against them.[2:10:24] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so it's really competitive. Oh, yeah. Okay. And[2:10:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: the instructor is just there to, like, whip you. Like like, you know, make you it there there's there's a part of The brilliance with Peloton is, like, I used to do rush what's called rush cycle, and I used to go in. It's basically you go in and group group cycle and have an instructor there, and you do all this high intensity interval training stuff. And I loved it because there was a competitive aspect to it that had me Working harder than I would work if it was just me in the room, like, without an instructor or anyone there. And it was just like, I'm at a gym, Any gym, and I'm just on a stationary cycle listening to a podcast doing something, which is fine if that's your group.[2:11:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? But there is something about that group setting That kind of make holds you accountable too. Right? And and the Peloton made it somehow virtual. It was amazing.[2:11:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I remember being back at Rush Cycle. This is before pandemic. And people talking about Peloton in my class, and I'm like, oh, it's ridiculous. Why would I do that? Like, that's never gonna work.[2:11:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I need to, like, be here. I mean, then the pandemic hit, and I was, like, all over the Peloton. And, it works for me really well. So I tend to do that At least 3 times a week. Sometimes I do it more.[2:11:34] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, you know, I'll do 4, and I do a 10 minute. Just 10, because it's efficient, and I push my ass. I push myself really hard.[2:11:42] Andrew Huberman: That's the Tabata.[2:11:43] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's it's 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, And it's 10 minutes.[2:11:46] Andrew Huberman: And on means you're pedaling like your life depends on.[2:11:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Maxing it.[2:11:49] Andrew Huberman: And there's a lot of resistance in the pedals.[2:11:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. Well, so you basically there's a part where you're I always do resistance. I'm like The power I do the power for there's a part where you're you're sitting, set cycling, you're trying to go really fast, but I always crank the resistance up. I always go above what they give me. And then, and then there's a part where you're standing and then you really crank the resistance up, which I really do.[2:12:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, like, you feel it in your glutes. It's like[2:12:09] Andrew Huberman: going up a hill.[2:12:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. Exactly. And so they, like, break it up, and most of the you'll have, like, those 2 2 2 parts. And I love the efficiency of it. You you just you get it done, and people sometimes hear me go 10 minutes or really you think you work.[2:12:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I'm like, Look. Like, you Mac you do Max. You Tabata for 10 minutes, and it like, it's it's intense.[2:12:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Most people can't sprint for the, For the gait of a airplane they're about to miss carrying a a backpack. So if you think about if I think about that, and then I I've just grabbing myself, you know, just sprinting through the airport and going, alright, Andy Galpin. I got my 90 seconds max heart rate in for you carrying this thing. But 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating that over and over for 10 minutes.[2:12:50] Andrew Huberman: So by time you're done, you're cooked.[2:12:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And then I Because I'm competitive during the recovery that they give you at the minute, at the end, I'm pushing it max because I wanna keep the numbers higher. Great.[2:12:59] Andrew Huberman: So 3 times a week?[2:13:00] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. Three times a week, and then, I always have my sauna on preheat preheating up. It takes about an hour and a half, and I I get it to about 189 degrees Fahrenheit. I hop right in the sauna after my, you know, my my, Peloton.[2:13:12] Andrew Huberman: So the elevated heart rate continues? Is that the the rationale?[2:13:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, I literally, like, Down a bunch of water, and then I get in. And and then I, like, either, read a science paper or prepare for a presentation or a podcast, Or I, hash over things in my mind. And it's interesting because something about getting in the sauna, I think the stress, the heat stress of it I used to so I started doing the sauna in 2009 in graduate school. Okay? And I You're[2:13:41] Andrew Huberman: an early adopter.[2:13:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I started doing it Every day I lived across the street. I lived in a studio apartment with Dan. We lived in this, like, small studio apartment, like, smallest apartment you could ever imagine. And it's across the street from a YMCA because I was poor in graduate school. Very poor very poor.[2:13:55] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, so, you know, I I[2:13:56] Andrew Huberman: recall I recall being I I lived in my lab.[2:14:00] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Wow.[2:14:01] Andrew Huberman: But then again, I lived in my lab as a postdoc, and as a I admit, I lived in my lab with my Bulldog as a faculty member, for other reasons. Okay. But I get it. I when you're a graduate student, you're poor, basically.[2:14:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so I used to I used to go to the the sauna Before going into the lab and, I would and I would I started noticing that I was all of a sudden able to handle stress better. Like, the stress of my 6 month setback because of failed experiment, which is crushing On top of the pressure from your my adviser and my my own pressure because I'm I'm very competitive with myself, and I put a lot of pressure on myself. So I was having a hard time. I mean, I was very stressed out in graduate school, and the sauna started to really noticeably affect my Anxiety and my ability to handle stress. And I was like, what is going on here?[2:14:54] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So I started looking into the literature, And, you know, started getting interested in the effects on the brain. And in fact, at the time, I had a friend who was, not actually experimentally, but theoretically looking into the the opioid system. And, basically so when you get in the sauna, you release a lot of endorphins. Endorphins are the feel good harm feel good opioids, that, you know, make you feel good. But, you also released something called dynorphin.[2:15:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And dynorphin is an endogenous opioid that binds to a receptor called the kappa opioid receptor, Which, dynorphin is responsible for that dysphoric feeling when you're in the sun and you're hot or when you're running, doing exercise, and you're like you feel uncomfortable. Well, I think that's dynorphin. I'm speaking[2:15:43] Andrew Huberman: in absolute. I think I think it is. I mean, that there is evidence in, alcoholics that some of the symptoms of withdrawal that the experience are related to dynorphin, and dynorphin is known to negatively impact the dopamine receptor system. So, basically, it's the feel like garbage pathway.[2:16:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right. You feel like garbage, and so you think, that that would not be good, but, This is where my my friend that comes in. He he was looking at the effects of, like, treating, morphine or heroin addiction and, you know, people that are using those drugs. They basically the the endorphins or the, you know, morphine or, you know, heroin, they bind to a receptor in the brain called the mu opioid receptor. And, as as they peep they take these drugs, that myopia receptor, becomes downregulated, and so you need more and more of the drug to feel as good as you did.[2:16:35] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Right? Well, endorphins, also bind to that receptor. And he was looking into some of the, other other drugs that are like Salvonorea salvinorum or something. Salvia, it's called. It it binds to the capioid opioid receptor.[2:16:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It also makes you kinda feel uncomfortable. Anyways, He had put some studies in front of me that showed, basically, binding of the, you know, either dynorphin or, you know, Whatever ligand to the kappa opioid receptor basically sensitizes the mu opioid receptor to the feel good endorphins and also changes I think it also, upregulated or something. So, basically, there's a lasting effect of feeling good. So the endorphins that you release later from hugging someone or a joke you're laughing at or whatever, you feel it for longer. Right?[2:17:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so, anyways, this is a with the sauna with respect to the sauna, it's a big sort of hypothesis of mine. I did kind of publish That part of, my hypothesis in a review article, but I do I do wish more people would kinda look into that. That'd be amazing. But but what I was getting at, I think, was, I would use I would use the sauna to memorize things. This is way back in the day, and I still do it.[2:17:46] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And and I wanted to talk to you about this because you're of your neuro you're a neuroscientist that there's something about being in the sauna, Like and I think I don't know if it has to do with the, like, the stress response. Like, when you when you have an emotional trigger, like, you remember things better. Right?[2:18:02] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. The the there is a clear and known explanation for mechanism for this.[2:18:08] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. So in the sauna, I mean, you also release Norepinephrine, just like you do in the cold. There's a lot of overlap. You know, you're really you're you I mean, it it is a stressor, but I, like, use it To remember things, like, I'm going through something. I wanna go through a presentation or a talk or a podcast or whatever, and I go in that sauna.[2:18:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, I mean, you should try it, like, if you haven't already. I don't know I[2:18:28] Andrew Huberman: have a sauna and a cold plunge now, and I haven't tried prepare I read books in the sauna in the evening. It's a it's a time I insist on having my phone out of there, mostly because I initially, because I thought I'd cook the phone, but also just to get some separation from the phone and screens in the evening, so I read books. Only challenge sometimes is you're dripping sweat onto the books, but I'm willing to forego a few pages of a book. The, the The idea that being in this semi stressful environment would aid in the learning and and retention of information is It's really well substantiated by this beautiful work by a guy named James McGaugh. I don't know if his lab's still active, but he was at u UC Irvine for a while, And then I think at, University of Arizona as well.[2:19:10] Andrew Huberman: They have a great memory group at both places, very strong in learning and memory, both places. And he was the one that really defined this, kind of, inverted u shaped function for the relationship between adrenaline and memory. Basically, if you're too relaxed and not stressed enough, you're not gonna remember any information. At peak levels of stress, You actually are a memory machine, at least within the context of whatever it is you're trying to learn. So very well, yeah, what you're describing is very well matches with that.[2:19:41] Andrew Huberman: And then, of course, it tapers off as you really increase adrenaline to the point where people are starting to lose autonomic function, where they're just they're they're panicking, basically. But, obviously, you're keeping it in range. The other thing that, I would like to ask you about is in the sauna, of course, there's vasodilation, and perfusion of blood to the brain is a wonderful way to enhance cognition. There's even some really nice data showing that during inhales as opposed to exhales, people are better at learning information. Believe it or not, during the inhale, you're taking in and absorbing and remembering more than during exhales, and these are beautiful studies done in humans, of course.[2:20:15] Andrew Huberman: So I can imagine that vasodilation, getting more profusion of blood to the brain plus a little bit of stress or maybe a lot of stress from the epinephrine, and yet it's in and then, of course, there's gonna be the I don't wanna call it placebo, but there's gonna be the the context the condition place Context of it. Like, if we if we had a good experience remembering something in the sauna once, we tend to the positive association effect of that location is real. Just like if people go to a new city and they get robbed, like, if you go to Cincinnati I've never been to Cincinnati. But you get robbed in Cincinnati, your purse gets taken, your wallet gets taken. You kind of hate Cincinnati as a tourist, But that could happen in any number of different cities.[2:20:51] Andrew Huberman: Right? The opposite is also true. So if something good happens someplace so I'm imagining that it's a combination of those effects, but I'll start it would be very hard to to do this in the cold. I feel like the cold is a very potent I think it takes you too far down that curve, the McGaugh curve.[2:21:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I have to sing songs or something when[2:21:07] Andrew Huberman: I'm Distracting[2:21:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: stuff. Yeah.[2:21:08] Andrew Huberman: Songs and But afterward, you're very efficient at learning.[2:21:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: After I am. And Yeah. With respect to the sauna, the vasodilation does occur, so there's a lot of overlap between moderate intensity aerobic exercise and heat stress. And as you can imagine, when you're exercising, you're elevating your core body temperature, you're you're sweating. And, when you're actually in the sauna, blood does get redistributed to the Scan to facilitate sweating.[2:21:32] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But much like exercise, blood flow in general is improved to the brain, to the muscles, everywhere. So, You know, I think generally speaking that and this you know, there's studies showing that sauna use is associated with a much lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Like, People you know, people that use it 4 to 7 times a week have greater than 60% reduction in dementia and Alzheimer's disease risk[2:21:56] Andrew Huberman: compared to once. Sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. You said people who use it I I apologize, but maybe you tell us again. People use it 4 to 7 times per week have[2:22:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: They have a Greater than 60% reduction in dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk compared to people that use it only 1 time a week. People that use it 2 to 3 times a week have Something like a 20 a little greater than 20% reduction in risk is a dose dependent effect on dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk. It also has a profound like, there's a there's a big link between the cardiovascular system and the brain. Obviously, blood flow, a big one. Right?[2:22:33] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know, like, You you need to get blood to your brain. But cardiovascular mortality so mortality from cardiovascular disease, if People use or actually, this was men. If men use the sauna 4 to 7 times a week, it's a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality compared to 1 time a week. Again, dose dependent manner 2 to 3 times a week is something like 24% lower, death from cardiovascular disease. There's also lower, You know, sudden cardiac death is like a heart attack.[2:23:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: That's like 60 something greater than 60% lower if if men use it 4 to 7 times a week versus once. Again, a dose dependent thing. And the thing that's so profound there also to me when again, looking at the methods, when I look at the data, And this is all work from doctor Jari Laukkanen. He's in, the University of Eastern Finland and just one of the the the world experts on sauna use, Especially with respect to cardiovascular health, what, some of his data has also shown is that, if you look at the duration, the time spent in the sauna so a lot of the So I mentioned the temperature I do is about I do, like, 189 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, I go in there.[2:23:41] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I'm pretty heat adapted. And, so the more you do The more you do the sauna or any sort of heat stress, whether it's a hot tub or jacuzzi, you you become adapted. You're you basically start to Sweat at a lower core body temperature to cool yourself down. All these sort of physiological changes start to happen earlier. It's like I mean, so I say it a long time.[2:24:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: That's a lot. You have to listen to your body. Most of the studies, that I just talked about were From, the the duration the time spent in the sauna, when I said 50% reduction in cardiovascular disease related death, What was shown was that men that were in the sauna for only 11 minutes, even if they used it 4 to 7 times a week, that reduction was only, like, 8% instead of 50. It had to be greater than 19 minutes. So, like, 20 minutes is the sweet spot at about 1 74 degrees Fahrenheit.[2:24:33] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so and and most most of the saunas in Finland, by the way, they're they're they're humid, so they they they put hot water hot not hot. They put water on hot rocks to create steam. And so it's some usually between 10 to 20% humidity in the finished sauna. So those those studies were, I would say, most of the time you're gonna find that their humidity is also elevated. But to me, the the dose dependent nature of it and the duration knowing like, you know, To me, that's a very strong data that this is more causal than some, you know, corollary thing.[2:25:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Because That's always the problem with observational studies, including these, which they corrected for a whole host of factors like cholesterol, You know, exercise, just everything. Everything under the sun. I mean, they corrected for those. And on top of that, you have the dose dependent nature of the duration, the time spent in the sauna, and the frequency. So to me, it's like something's going on here.[2:25:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Plus, there's been studies intervention studies where it's like, you know, comparing directly head to head Moderate intensity aerobic exercise on a stationary cycle to 20 minutes in a sauna. They're they're physiologically, the same things happen. So Heart rate elevates while you're doing the activity. Blood pressure increases while you're doing the activity. But then after Heart rate decreases.[2:25:49] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Resting heart rate decreases below baseline. Blood pressure is improved, so it decreases below baseline. This is happening the same in moderate intensity cycling versus sauna. So, again, the sauna like, this heat stress, there's something about it that really mimics this moderate intensity aerobic exercise, Which is really great for people that can't go for a run, that can't even get on a bike. So, you know, disabled people, granted there are some safety Concerns are they're pretty mild, but they do exist, you know, so people that had a recent heart attack or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem, Drinking alcohol, never do that.[2:26:24] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Elderly people low prone to low blood blood pressure, always talk to physician before doing this on. It is it is Stressful.[2:26:30] Andrew Huberman: Pregnant?[2:26:31] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Pregnant women. Oh, yeah. I definitely, avoided saunas when I was pregnant. But, the The it is I think it's very relevant for disabled people and also people, like, that are sedentary. I've been sedentary most of her life.[2:26:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, my mother, I've I've been able to get her in the sauna because she's not I mean, I I did get her on the Peloton once, but it's really much easier. She feels like it's a spa treatment, and and it's like she can listen to her music in there. And, Like, I care about her health, but she's she's mostly been a sedentary person. And so, I find it much easier to convince her to get in the sauna than to get on Peloton. Ideally, you do both.[2:27:07] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: The the question would be, well, I exercise. I run. I do my high intensity interval training. Why do I need to get in the sauna? And and the reality is is, and so I published all this in a in a review in the the experimental gerontology Last year, I guess.[2:27:21] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Early late last year. And, basically, cardiorespiratory fitness, which is a marker of it's a marker of health. You know, cardiorespiratory fitness has improved in people that do exercise and sauna compared to exercise alone or sauna alone. So for those peep healthy, fit people out there already exercising, there's a synergistic effect by Also adding Asana into that routine. And to me, that's great.[2:27:51] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, there's so many beneficial things happening, with With the with the heat stress, in addition to, like, mimicking aerobic exercise, there's the heat shock proteins that we talked about earlier. And those it kinda brings me back to my Early days of science when I was at the Salk Institute, for Biological Studies doing research on little nematode worms that, We or someone else injected amyloid beta 42, the peptide, the 42 Amino acid peptide that is involved in amyloid plaques found in the brain correlated with Alzheimer's disease and other, you know, brain disorders. We injected those into the muscle tissue of worms. And, basically, these worms become paralyzed with age because the the the aggregate aggregated proteins, these these proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one of the main things they do is they basically make sure the proteins inside of your cells Maintain their proper three-dimensional structure and are folded right, and so they don't they're not prone to aggregating and forming these plaques in your arteries and also in the brain.[2:28:57] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And there's, back to my my my worm studies I was doing, I would I would elevate hedgehog proteins in these worms and it would totally, you know, correct the problem where the the they would no longer become paralyzed. They'd move around like they were young. So, many animal studies have been done looking at Alzheimer's disease, you know, like all all a human like Alzheimer's disease and a rodent And heat shock proteins protecting from it. You know? So, heat shock proteins are robustly activated in humans.[2:29:26] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: This has been shown to, even or, you know, 50% higher over baseline levels after just 30 minutes at 1 63 degrees Fahrenheit in the sauna. So, and they stay activated at least in rodents for, you know, 48 hours at least. So, You know, having these heat shock proteins around, making sure they're they're properly taking care of our our proteins so they're not aggregating in our brains and in our in our plaques Could be another potential way that sauna is protecting from Alzheimer's disease and, other, you know, cardiovascular health as well as longevity. So, you know, there's there's people that have SNPs in heat shock protein factor 70 That if they have one of them, so they got one from their parents where they have more active heat shock protein 70, they live on average 1 year longer than people that don't have that SNP. If they have 2 versions, they got 1 from their mom and one from their dad, they live on average 2 years longer than people that don't have that snip.[2:30:23] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So it's also Wow. Been associated with human longevity as well as in lower organisms. So you can heat shock a worm or a fly, and they live 15% longer. This is just worked on by Gordon Lithgow at the Buck Institute years years 2 years years ago. So, anyways, I guess what I was getting at was, the heat shock proteins are are part of that stress response pathway that about earlier.[2:30:43] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, you know, they're also activated by cold as well. Cold shock does activate heat shock proteins, not as robust. Sulfurifene act activates them. Again, it's one of the reasons I think we should get all of these things because they are more robust inputs. You know, their input activating mechanisms are more robust for, you know, different ones.[2:31:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So there is crosstalk. There is you know, I mean, I guess, I get It'd be more accurate to say there's, overlap. But but, you know, it's also like you wanna get the most robust from all of them. Right? I do.[2:31:14] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, I mean, that's why I wanna do the sauna and exercise and eat myself, you know, my broccoli sprouts and and, All that stuff. So[2:31:22] Andrew Huberman: Alright. It's super interesting. A couple couple of questions came up for me. One is, you mentioned these, SNPs, these, nucleotide repeats. Basically, genes that some people have more of or less of, than others that can predict Longevity in some sense.[2:31:40] Andrew Huberman: Is that the FOXO three pathway? That's one that can yeah.[2:31:44] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I mean, FOXO 3 is, in fact, if you go back to the worm studies I was talking about, that was, like, one of the the first things. When you see it with your own eyes, you can take these worms That, you basically decrease their insulin signaling pathway and their IGF one. Worms have, what are called homologous genes, so they have A lot of similarities to humans. They have an insulin like receptor. They have an IGF one like receptor, and they make something like FOXO 3, which we have.[2:32:10] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And, basically, if you if you decrease that insulin signaling pathway, their FOXO3 is always active in those worms. And they they live, like, a 100% longer. And And not only do they live longer. I mean, they are like a very young worm. I mean, they are like you look at this thing and you're like, This looks like the worm that was just born, like, hours ago.[2:32:30] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: What's going on? This thing's at the end of its life. Now as a as a side note, the thing that always got me on this was, By the way, this was discovered by Cynthia Kenyon, and, this was, like, back in the nineties. And, honestly, I'm not sure that anything has been as exciting in the warm world since then, But I thought I mean, it was a really big finding. The only the only caveat there is that the worms go through this dour it's called a dour Stage when when this happens, when you decrease their insulin signaling and stuff, and they, like, go into this, like, metabolic stasis.[2:33:01] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Like, they're not eating as much or moving. And and it's like, okay. Well, they live a 100% longer, but, like, they go into this weird state. You know?[2:33:08] Andrew Huberman: I know people like this. Some in the longevity community. They know who they are, but they'll get the last laugh because I'll be dead, well fed, but dead, and they'll they'll still be going. So in terms of the the many data on Sauna and and I also just wanna acknowledge these, Finnish groups that did this work is really pioneering. Right?[2:33:29] Andrew Huberman: When you think 20 years ago, long before social media or any of this, and they're out there up there, I should say, measuring cortisol and growth hormone and all this stuff in in people getting in and out of sauna, very, very interesting. So 20 minutes seems like the threshold at 170 degrees Fahrenheit. More times per week seems to be better than fewer you when in terms of all cause mortality, cardiovascular risk, according to what what I just learned from you would[2:33:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: be a a good, I think, minimum effective dose.[2:34:01] Andrew Huberman: Four times a week, and you combine it with the cold. I've also seen a protocol where it's a very extreme protocol. I don't recommend this to people right off the bat where they had Subject human subjects get into the sauna for 30 minutes, get out for 5, 30 minutes, get out for 5, 30 minutes for a total of 2 hours of exposure, but that was What led to these massive 16 fold increases in growth hormone? I actually have a so I and they had to do it very seldom. So it sounds like these protocols you're describing 20 minutes Done, 4 times per week, far more reasonable for most people to access.[2:34:33] Andrew Huberman: But I I know people are probably desperate to know, what if they don't have a sauna? You know, a sauna is kind of a unique item, so I have a couple questions. Can people use hot baths, with the appropriate warning, of course, that, without getting into description of the the mechanics and the underlying biology, it's pretty obvious, that the testes, if they get too warm, you'll You'll kill sperm. That's the reason why the testes are housed in a structure called the scrotum that can move around. So just to be you know, here we are biologists just talking about realities here.[2:35:06] Andrew Huberman: So if you're trying to conceive children or keep your sperm healthy, guys should probably stay out of warm hot baths of[2:35:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: For at least 6 months. That's been shown.[2:35:14] Andrew Huberman: So 6 months.[2:35:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So sperm product so sperm motility goes down and sperm production goes down, but that is completely, Like, corrected, if they stay out of the sauna for 6 months. So so through 6 months later, it's back to normal.[2:35:27] Andrew Huberman: Great. That's very useful information, I'm sure, to a number of people out there. So there if people don't have access to a sauna, and we get this about cold too. You always say, what about cold showers? And I always say, well, Studies may have mainly been done on immersion because it's hard to keep things controlled in cold showers.[2:35:45] Andrew Huberman: It just doesn't make for a very good experiment because help you get a bigger person, Less of them is under the shower, and so it doesn't make for a good experiment. So it's a it's not as good as immersion. But with the with heat, I could imagine that a hot bath would work almost as well.[2:35:58] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. So there's been some studies looking at, for example, activation of heat shock proteins, also brain derived neurotrophic factor increases with heat stress. And so, the saw the the hot bath at around 104 degrees Fahrenheit, which is typically what studies will use for temperature, Which, is actually cooler than what I I cranked my bath hot. It's so hot.[2:36:16] Andrew Huberman: But you're very heat adapted. I'm very heat adapted.[2:36:18] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. And, it's 20 minutes from the shoulders down. And and that is, like, a very robust activation in heat shock proteins and in, brain derived neurotrophic factor.[2:36:27] Andrew Huberman: Right.[2:36:28] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And then Heat shock proteins are also protecting against muscle atrophy. So that's also having to do with the protein structure in the muscle tissue as well. And this has been studies in animal, you know, animal data, as well as some recent human data as well. It was local hyperthermia or local heat treatment, but, essentially, it showed that it protected I mean, it was like There was a study where, they were looking at muscle disuse, and it was it was something like the local heat treatment prevented, like, almost 40% of the muscle atrophy from disuse. So, like and it's funny because I used to use this sauna when I was injured and stuff.[2:37:00] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I would go in the sauna, because I I, like, I didn't know at the time because I was graduate student, but I knew, like, just from experiments that, like, you know, like, I'm not losing as much muscle. I feel better. Like, I you know, like, at the time, I was reading all about the growth hormone and stuff back then, but, and I knew about heat shock proteins and I so I kind of knew, but that data wasn't around yet. And so, Now we have the data, and I've always, like, felt like I wasn't losing my muscle like I should have been when I was doing this on. And I was doing it literally 7 days a week.[2:37:32] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It was, like, hardcore.[2:37:33] Andrew Huberman: This is also during graduate school?[2:37:35] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Yeah. Now now I'm doing I'm doing the sauna, like, A bare bare minimum, I do 3, but I try to do 4 because of the it it all depends on my schedule. I also like to do long runs. I really it's, like, long being, like, 3 miles, Not like campaigns long. But I I really for me and I we were talking about this earlier, like, off camera that The runs for me are are for my brain, and there I get this mind wandering effect where I daydream and I think about things.[2:38:05] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Work through problems. I get creative. I come up with ideas, and this is all happening on the runs. And so I I just I I I I miss my runs if I don't do them, and I miss it because of the brain effects I get from it. And when I exercise, I it's funny because I'm a female, and you think that I'd be exercising, you know, to stay fit and in shape and care, you know, care about my figure.[2:38:27] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: But when I exercise, Literally, what I'm thinking about is my brain, and I'm like, this is the best long longevity drug there is. This is it right here, Rhonda. Like, you you're always wondering. You're always wanting to know. You're wanting to do Like, if you don't exercise, you're missing that essential dose.[2:38:42] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And so that for me is is is the motivation, the doping seeking thing I I'm looking for. Admittedly, I need to, I do not do enough strength training, and I have to do it. I have to. I have to. I'm like, I'm just I'm so after the endurance and the hit, and I I I really need to add that in, because muscle mass is also extremely important For aging as well.[2:39:03] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You know? So that's that's my that's my fault.[2:39:06] Andrew Huberman: Well, the the brain effects are really interesting. I also run. I try and get 1 longer run per week and a few other runs, and I do it without a phone. I don't listen to podcasts. I Occasionally, we'll listen to music, but I really try not to.[2:39:19] Andrew Huberman: I I also find that my mind solves problems. It I feel like it it washes out the cobwebs, so to speak. Some of the most, brilliant and prolific neuroscientists that I know who've had very long careers, Eric Kendall, Nobel Prize winner at comes to mind for all his work on memory. Used to swim a mile a day, and now I think swims half a mile a day, but he's in his late nineties, and he's still sharp, which is incredible. And his lab has done some work showing that any load bearing exercise repeated so endurance work, unlike the Peloton or cycling that's really load bearing, although you're cycling Playing really hard with the resistance, but, causes the release of Osteocalcin from the bones, which acts in an endocrine way.[2:40:02] Andrew Huberman: It's sort of like a hormone. It can actually travel to the hippocampus and, at least in these animal studies, induce the proliferation of neurons, growth of synapses, BDNF, a number of downstream things, which Kind of makes sense if you if we were to put it just so evolutionary story on on this. You know, a body that's active can signal to the brain that the body Still needs cognition. You know, an inactive body, in some ways, is depriving the brain of any signal about what the body is doing. Right?[2:40:30] Andrew Huberman: This is, Obviously, I'm making this up as as as conjecture, but we know in ocean and various ocean animals that they'll swim around for some period of their life, and then they'll have A completely stationary portion of their life, and basically, the brain degenerates. There you don't need much of a nervous system if you're not moving. So I think there's really something there, and also just letting your Ideas in mind drift. I love that you and I appreciate that you shared your protocols because I think right now, we're in an interesting time in public Health information history where people are just kinda getting bombarded with cold is good, heat is gold. Is it cold is good.[2:41:05] Andrew Huberman: Heat is good. Excuse me. I misspoke. There are all these micronutrients and, of course, macronutrients are important too. And, today, you've really, enriched us with the Description of the underlying mechanisms and the logic behind them, but also sharing what you do is really informative because I think people need a jumping off place.[2:41:24] Andrew Huberman: And, obviously, they need to start Someplace and getting heat adapted, etcetera, takes time, but I really appreciate that you're willing to share your protocols and that you do the things that you that you teach and educate people about. As a final question, because I have, have, have to ask, red light sauna or no red light Sauna. I've been a little bit vocal about my feelings that none of the red light saunas I've ever been in got hot enough, and it was frustrating. So, like, I feel like it's neither here nor there. However, I do acknowledge that red light and low level light therapies are now known to do a number of interesting things.[2:42:00] Andrew Huberman: There's a Nobel Prize in 1908 for phototherapy For lupus, so, you know, it's not like a new thing, the idea that light and light could do things, positive for our biology. But Do you have a red light in your sauna? Do you think it's useful? And I mentioned this because this is the number 1 question I get about sauna. Red light or no red light or some some intermediate answer?[2:42:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So I don't have, an infrared sauna, but I do have like, I have a sauna that has lights. It makes red light, but I don't think it's the red light that you're talking about. Okay. It's not activating it at a specific wavelength, which is[2:42:35] Andrew Huberman: It's usually so that The range that seems to be helpful, and I I confess, I use a red light panel for other things, is 670 nanometer out to about 720 nanometer. So it looks like red and very dim pant lights, Dim red and bright red, and the idea is that red light can travel the photon and energy is such that it can travel down through the, deep layers of the dermis of the skin.[2:43:02] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I, you know, I I don't have a red light in my sauna. I don't know if it's essential or not. I don't think so based on all the studies I've about. I think that would be a is, you know, the the the potential effect on, mitochondria is interesting. I do think there's, A lack of really good solid evidence in, you know, humans, but I don't that not might only be because it's just not studied enough, and that's usually the case.[2:43:29] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So perhaps, you know, like, there's the Joovv. Right? The Joovv they have those pant red light panels.[2:43:34] Andrew Huberman: Joovv and Kozy are the 2 ones I know, k o z e and Joovv. They're they're as far as I know, I'm probably gonna insult both companies at the same time, but I'd rather insult them both at the same time than than just compliment 1 or insult 1. Both of them seem excellent for getting the appropriate wavelengths of red light, and I do not have a relationship to either[2:43:52] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: of those. Well, I I personally think that the the sauna in and of itself, it's about The heat stress and, typically, the question I get is infrared sauna or regular sauna. And, there are some differences as well. Infrared saunas, Maybe the infrared saunas are the ones that have the red light that you're talking about. Infrared saunas only get up to around a 140 degrees Fahrenheit.[2:44:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So as I mentioned, the studies were about 174 degrees Fahrenheit. And so, you really have to stay in a longer period of time. However, there have been some studies coming out of Japan. They they use infrared sauna. They have this whole protocol.[2:44:30] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: It's called Weyon Therapy, and they They they they get people in infrared saunas, and then they wrap them in a towel and, like, they stay warm for x amount. So it's like, the whole protocol ends up being, like, an hour long. But it's again, it's a 140 degrees Fahrenheit, so it's an infrared sauna. And it's been shown to improve a variety of, like, Coronary heart disease and conditions, heart related conditions, like, there have been some improvements. So, obviously, there's there's evidence that infrared saunas can be beneficial for cardiovascular health.[2:44:59] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: I do I've used infrared saunas many times at my my in laws. They have a infrared sauna, and I have to crank that thing up for a while until it's maxed. And then I have to sit in there for an hour at least. I do sweat a lot, and that's another thing, we didn't talk about. You do sweat some heavy metals, and some Some, heavy metals are excreted predominantly through sweat and others through urine.[2:45:22] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So so for example, cadmium, There's, like, a 125 fold increase in cadmium excretion from sweat when you get in the sauna. Also, lead is something like 17 fold. Excretion is higher. Another one is aluminum. It's about 4 fold higher.[2:45:37] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: So, infrared, you do sweat a lot too, and that's because the main difference is that you're heating Your body up through thermal radiation versus the ambient hair air, like, an a standard, you know, sauna, is a heater, and the heater's heating up the air, and and and that's how you're heating yourself up. So, it is a little bit of a different mechanism. I prefer regular saunas. Most of the data out there is from From the heat stress itself, like the your heart rate's elevating when you're in there. You're feeling hot.[2:46:04] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: You're getting that cardiovascular. I mean, that's what you're feeling when you're in the hot sauna. And that for me takes a really long time in the infrareds on it. I get at the very end. But, I do think there are some benefits from infrared.[2:46:15] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: And they are more affordable. They're less of a fire hazard, but, again, hot baths are, I think, a good alternative modality for heat stress, compared to, like, a regular sauna. So[2:46:25] Andrew Huberman: Great. That's a really helpful answer. I like I said, I use the red light, but not in the sauna, and, and thank you for reminding us of that, 174 degree Fahrenheit Threshold that was mainly used in all these studies. So we covered a lot of of territory, but I just wanna thank you again. It was Extremely thorough and extremely informative.[2:46:45] Andrew Huberman: I'd now have my notes are are always look a little bit like, they were drawn out by a macaque monkey who has no knowledge of the English language, I can decipher this, to tell you that there are at least 10 additions to my current protocols that I'm gonna Add, and I'll have lots of questions, so I apologize in advance for that. But, on behalf of the listeners and, just directly from me, thank you so much for your time. I learned a ton.[2:47:13] Dr. Rhonda Patrick: My pleasure. Thanks for having me on.
