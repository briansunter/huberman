Kronikle AI - Marc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation & Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience - TranscriptMarc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation & Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Marc Andreessen. Marc Andreessen is a software engineer and an investor in technology companies. He cofounded and developed Mosaic, which was one of the 1st widely used web browsers.[0:00:27] Andrew Huberman: He also cofounded and developed Netscape, which was one of the earliest widespread used web browsers. And he cofounded and is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, One of the most successful Silicon Valley venture capital firms. All of that is to say that Marc Andreessen is one of the most successful innovators and investors ever. I was extremely excited to record this episode with Mark for several reasons. First of all, he himself is an incredible innovator.[0:00:54] Andrew Huberman: Second of all, He has an uncanny ability to spot the innovators of the future. And 3rd, Mark has shown over and over again the ability to Understand how technologies not yet even developed are going to impact the way that humans interact at large. Our conversation starts off by discussing What makes for an exceptional innovator, as well as what sorts of environmental conditions make for exceptional innovation and creativity more generally? In that context, we talk about risk taking, not just in terms of risk taking in one's profession, but about how some people, not all, But how some people who are risk takers and innovators in the context of their work also seem to take a lot of risks in their personal life and some of the consequences that can bring. Then we discuss some of the most transformative technologies that are now emerging, such as novel approaches to developing clean energy, as well as AI or artificial intelligence.[0:01:46] Andrew Huberman: With respect to AI, Mark shares his views as to why AI is likely to greatly improve human experience. And we discussed the multiple roles that AI is very likely to have in all of our lives in the near future. Mark explains how not too long from now, all of us are very likely to have AI assistance, for instance, assistance that give us highly informed health advice, highly informed psychological advice. Indeed, It is very likely that all of us will soon have AI assistance that govern most, if not all, of our daily decisions. And Mark explains how, if done correctly, This can be a tremendously positive addition to our life.[0:02:23] Andrew Huberman: In doing so, Mark provides a stark counterargument for those that argue that AI is going to diminish Human experience. So if you're hearing about and or concerned about the ways that AI is likely to destroy us, today, you are going to hear about the many different ways That AI technologies now in development are likely to enhance our human experience at every level. What you'll soon find is that while today's does center around technology and technology development. It is really a discussion about human beings and human psychology. So whether you have an interest in technology development and or AI, I'm certain that you'll find today's discussion to be an important and highly lucid view into what will soon be the future that we all live in.[0:03:05] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't.[0:03:26] Andrew Huberman: That means of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar. The electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health, physical health, and performance. Even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think, our energy levels, and our physical performance. LMNT makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration, and it does so by including the 3 electrolytes in the exact ratios they need to be present. I drink LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up.[0:03:54] Andrew Huberman: I usually mix it with about 16 to 32 ounces of water. If I'm exercising, I'll drink 1 while I'm exercising, and I tend to drink one after exercising as well. Now many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because, obviously, we don't to consume sodium in excess. However, for people that have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are consuming very clean diets, that is Consuming not so many processed foods or highly processed foods, oftentimes, we are not getting enough sodium, magnesium, and potassium, we can suffer as a consequence. And with Element, simply by mixing water, it tastes delicious.[0:04:29] Andrew Huberman: It's very easy to get that proper hydration. If you'd like to try Element, You can go to drink element, that's l m n t.com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element l m n t. Com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.[0:04:45] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before in Podcast about the fact that sleep, that is getting a great night sleep, is the foundation of all mental health, physical health, performance. When we're sleeping well, everything goes far better. And when we are not sleeping well, we're enough, everything gets far worse at the level of mental health, physical health, and performance. And one of the key things to getting a great night sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is that you have to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.[0:05:13] Andrew Huberman: And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, You need your core body temperature to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, you want your core body temperature to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. With 8 Sleep, it's very easy to induce that drop in core body temperature by cooling your mattress early and throughout the night and warming your mattress toward morning. Started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover a few years ago, and it has completely transformed the quality of the sleep that I get. So much so that I actually loathe traveling because I don't have my 8 Sleep mattress cover when I travel.[0:05:46] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman, and you'll save up to $150 off their pod three cover. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 Sleep .com/huberman. And now for my discussion with Marc Andreessen. Marc, welcome.[0:06:06] Marc Andreessen: Hey. Thank you.[0:06:07] Andrew Huberman: Delighted to have you here and have so many questions for you about innovation, AI,[0:06:12] Marc Andreessen: your view[0:06:13] Andrew Huberman: of the landscape of tech and humanity in general. I wanna start off by talking about innovation from 3 different perspectives. There's the inner game, so to speak, or the psychology of the innovator or innovators. Things like their propensity for engaging in conflict or not, their propensity for having a dream or a vision, and in particular, They're innovation as it relates to some psychological trait or expression. So we'll get to that in a moment.[0:06:46] Andrew Huberman: The second component that I'm curious about is the outer landscape around innovators, who they place themselves with, the sorts of choices that they make and also the sorts of personal relationships that they might have or not have. And then the last Component is this notion of the larger landscape that they happen to find themselves in. What time in history? What's the geography? Bay Area, New York, Dubai, etcetera.[0:07:11] Andrew Huberman: True. So to start off, is there a common trait of innovators that you think is absolutely essential as a seed, to creating things that are really impactful?[0:07:26] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So I'm not a psychologist, but I've picked up some of the concepts, some of the, some of the terms. And so I've I've it's it's it's a great moment of delight in my life when I learned about the big five personality traits. Because I was like, There's a way to actually describe the answer to this question in at least reasonably scientific terms. And so I I think what you're looking for when you're when you're talking about real innovators, like people actually do really creative breakthrough work.[0:07:47] Marc Andreessen: I think you're talking about a couple things. So one is very high in what's called trade openness, right, which is one of the big one of the big five, which is basically just, like, flat out open to new Yes. And, of course, the the nature of trade openness is trade openness means you're not just open to new ideas in one category. You're open to many different kinds of new ideas. And so we we might talk about the fact said a lot of innovators also are very creative people in other aspects of their lives, right, even outside of, their their their specific creative domain.[0:08:12] Marc Andreessen: So that's important. But, of course, just being open is not sufficient. Because if you're just open, you could just be curious and explore, right, and spend your entire life reading and and doing you know, talking to people and never actually Create something. So you also need, a couple other things. You need a high level of conscientiousness, which is another one of the big five.[0:08:26] Marc Andreessen: You need somebody who's really willing to apply themselves. In our world, typically, over a period of many years, right, to be able to to to accomplish something right. You know, they they they typically work very hard. That often gets because the stories that end up getting told about these people are, you know, it's just like there's this kid, and he just had this idea, and it was like a stroke of genius, and it was like a moment in time. And, you know, it's just like, oh, he was so lucky.[0:08:46] Marc Andreessen: It's like, no. Like, for most of these people, it's years years years of of applied effort. And so you need you need somebody with, like, an extreme, you know, basically, willingness as to defer gratification, it really apply themselves to a a specific thing for a long time. And, of course, this is why there aren't very many of these people as there aren't many people who are high in openness and high in because to a certain extent, they're they're opposed, right, traits. And so you need somebody who has both of those.[0:09:10] Marc Andreessen: 3rd is you need somebody high in Disagreeableness, which is the 3rd of the big five. So you need somebody who's just, like, basically ornery. Right? Because if they're not ornery, then they'll be talked out ideas by people who will be, like, oh, well, that you know, because the reaction most people have no ideas is, oh, that's dumb. And so somebody who's too agreeable will will be easily dissuaded to to not pursue, know, not pulling the thread anymore.[0:09:31] Marc Andreessen: So you need somebody highly disagreeable. Again, the nature of disagreeableness is they tend to be disagreeable disagreeable about everything. So they tend to be these very sort of iconoclastic, you know, kind of renegade characters. And then there's just a table stakes component, which is they just also need to be high IQ. They just they just need to be really smart because it's just it's hard to innovate in any category if you can't set the size large amounts of information quickly.[0:09:53] Marc Andreessen: And so those are 4, like, basically, like, high spikes, you know, very rare traits that basically have to, have to come together. You you could probably also say they they probably at some point need to be relatively low in neuroticism, which is another of the big five because if they're too neurotic, they probably can't handle the stress. Right. So so it's kind of this this this dial in there. And then, of course, if you're if you're in if you're into, like, this the the sort of science of the big five, basically, you know, these are all people who are on, like, the far outline Kinda point on the on the normal distribution across all these traits.[0:10:21] Marc Andreessen: And and then that just gets you to, I think, the the sort of hardest topic of all around this this this whole concept, which is just there are very few of these people.[0:10:29] Andrew Huberman: Do you think they're born with these traits?[0:10:31] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Well, so the the they're they're born with the traits, and then and then, of course, the traits are not, you know, genetics not destiny. And so the the the the traits are not deterministic in the sense of that, you know, just because they have those personality traits doesn't mean they're they're gonna, you know, deliver great creativity. But, like, they need to have those properties. Because otherwise, they're just not either gonna be able to do the work or they're not gonna enjoy it.[0:10:49] Marc Andreessen: Right? Or I mean, look. A lot of these people are highly capable, competent people. It you know, it it's very easy for them to get, like, high paying jobs in traditional institutions and, you know, get lots of, you know, traditional awards and, you know, end up with big paychecks Some you know, there there's a lot of people at, you know, big institutions that we we know you and I know well, and I I deal with many of these where people get paid a lot of money and they get a lot of they go for 20 years, and it's great, and they never create anything anything new. Right?[0:11:13] Marc Andreessen: And so there's there's a lot of[0:11:14] Andrew Huberman: Administrators.[0:11:15] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Well, and a lot of them yeah. A lot of them end up in in administrative jobs. And that's fine. That's good.[0:11:20] Marc Andreessen: The world needs, you know, the world needs that also. Right? The the the innovators can't run everything because everything you know, the the the rate of change would be too high. Society, I think, probably wouldn't be able to handle it. So you need some people who are on the other side who are gonna kinda keep the lights on and keep things running.[0:11:33] Marc Andreessen: But but there is this decision that people have to make, which is okay. If I have the sort of latent capability to do this, this actually what I want to spend my life doing? And do I wanna go through the stress and the pain and the trauma, right, and the anxiety, right, and the risk of failure? Right. And so do do I really want to?[0:11:48] Marc Andreessen: Once in a while, you run into somebody who's just, like, can't do it any other way. Like, they they just have to.[0:11:53] Andrew Huberman: Who's an example of that?[0:11:54] Marc Andreessen: I mean, Elon Elon's the, know, the paramount example of our time. And he and I I bring him up in part because he's such an obvious example, but in part because he's talked about this, in in in interviews where he he basically says, like, I he's like, I can't turn it off. Like, the the ideas come. I have to pursue them. Right.[0:12:10] Marc Andreessen: That's why he's, like, running 5 companies at the same time and, like, working on a 6th. Right? It's just like he he can't he can't turn it off. You know, look, there's a lot of other people who are Probably had the capability to do it, who ended up talking themselves into or, you know, whatever events conspired to put them in a position where they did something else. You know, obviously, there are people who try to be creative who just don't have the the the capability.[0:12:29] Marc Andreessen: And so there there's some Venn diagram there of determinism through traits, but also choices in life. And then also, of course, the situation in which they're born, the context within which they grow up, the culture, right, and what their parents expect of them and And so forth. And so you have to you know, you you to kinda get all the way through this, you have to thread all these all these needles kind of at the same time.[0:12:49] Andrew Huberman: Do you think there are folks out there that meet these criteria who are disagreeable, but that can feign agreeableness. You know, they can for those just listening, Marches raised his right hand. In other words, that that can sort of the phrase that comes to mind, maybe because I can relate to a little bit, they sneak up through the system. Meaning, they behave ethically as it relates to the requirements of the system. They're not breaking laws or breaking rules.[0:13:16] Andrew Huberman: In fact, quite the opposite there. Attention to the rules and following the rules until they get to a place where being disagreeable feels less threatening to their overall sense of security.[0:13:28] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. I mean, look, they're really highly competent people don't have to break laws. Right? Like, it's it's the there was this There was this there was this myth, you know, that sort of happened around the movie, The Godfather, and then there was this character Meyer Lansky, you know, who's, like, ran basically the mafia, you know, 50, 60, 70 years And there was this there was this great line of, like, well, Meyer Lansky had only, like, applied himself to running General Motors. He would have been the best CEO of all time.[0:13:48] Marc Andreessen: It's like, no. Not really. Right. Like, the the the people who are, like, great or running the big companies, they don't have to they don't have to be mob bosses. They don't have to, like, break laws.[0:13:55] Marc Andreessen: They can, you know, they can they can do they can work. It's they're smart and sophisticated enough to be able to work inside the system. You know, they don't need to take the easy out. So I I don't think there's any implication that they have to, you know, that they have to they have to break laws. That said, they have to break norms.[0:14:07] Speaker 2: Right.[0:14:07] Marc Andreessen: And and and specifically, the the the thing this is probably the thing that gets missed the most because the process of the process of innovating, the process of creating something new, like, once it works, Like, the stories get retconned, as they say, in comic books. So the the stories get adapted to where it's like it was inevitable all You know, everybody always knew that this was a good idea. You know? The the person has won all these awards. Society embraced them.[0:14:28] Marc Andreessen: And it's just if in invariably, you if you were with them when that was when they were actually doing the work or if you actually get a couple drinks into them and talk about it, it'd be like, no. That's not how it happened at all. They faced a wall of skepticism. Just like a wall of basically social, you know, essentially denial. No.[0:14:42] Marc Andreessen: This is not gonna work. No. I'm not gonna join your lab. No. I'm not gonna come work for your company.[0:14:47] Marc Andreessen: No. I'm not gonna buy your product. Right? No. I'm not gonna meet with you.[0:14:50] Marc Andreessen: And so they they they they they get just, like, tremendous social resistance. They're they're they're not getting positive feedback from their from their social network the way that more agreeable people[0:14:59] Speaker 2: need to have.[0:15:00] Marc Andreessen: Right? And this is why is why agreeableness is a problem for innovation. If if you're agreeable, you're gonna listen to the people around you. They're gonna tell you that new ideas are stupid. Right.[0:15:08] Marc Andreessen: End of story. You're you're not gonna proceed. And so I I would put it more on, like, they need to be able to deal with they need to be able to deal with social discomfort to the level of ostracism, or at some point, they're gonna get out, and they're just gonna quit.[0:15:20] Speaker 2: Do you[0:15:20] Andrew Huberman: think that people that meet these criteria do best by banding with others that meet these criteria early, Or is it important that they form this deep sense of self, like the ability to cry oneself to sleep at night or, You know, line the fetal position worrying that things aren't going to work out and then still get up the next morning and get right back out there.[0:15:41] Marc Andreessen: Right. So Sean Parker has the best line, by the way, on on on, on this. He says, you know, being a being an entrepreneur, being a creator is like, you know, getting punched in the face, over and over again, he said, eventually, you start to like the taste of your own blood. And I love that line because it makes everybody, like, massively uncomfortable. Right?[0:15:56] Marc Andreessen: But it gives you a sense of, like, how basically Painful to process. If you if you talk to any entrepreneur, you know, who's been through it about that, they're like, oh, yeah. That's exactly that's exactly what it's like. So so there is this there is a big individual component to it. But look but look, it can be very lonely.[0:16:09] Marc Andreessen: Right? And it'd be especially, you know, very hard I think to do this if if nobody around you is to do anything even remotely similar. Right? And if you're getting just universally negative responses, like, you know, very few people, I think, had very few people have an ego strength to be able to survive that for years. So I do think there's a huge advantage, and and this is why you do you do see clusters.[0:16:26] Marc Andreessen: There's a huge advantage to clustering. Right? And so you have and and, you know, throughout history, you've had this clustering fact, right, you had, you know, clustering of the great artists and sculptors in Renaissance Florence. You know, you had the clustering of the philosophers agrees. You had the clustering of of tech people in Silicon Valley.[0:16:39] Marc Andreessen: You have the clustering of creative, know, arts, movie, TV people in Los Angeles, right, and so forth and so on, you know, for you know, it there's always a scene. Right? There's there's all there's always, like, a nexus and a place where where people come together, you know, for for these kinds of things. So generally speaking, like, if somebody wants to work in tech and innovate in tech, they're gonna be much better off being around a lot of people who are trying to do that kind of[0:17:00] Speaker 2: thing then they are[0:17:00] Marc Andreessen: in a place where nobody else is doing it. Having said that, the clustering has it can have downsides. It can have side effects. And and you put any group of people together and you do start to get group even among people who are individually very disagreeable. And so these same clusters where you get these very idiosyncratic people, they do have fads and trends just like every place else.[0:17:19] Marc Andreessen: Right? And so they get they get they get wrapped up in their own social dynamics. The good news is the social dynamic in those places is usually very forward looking. Right. And so it's usually it's usually like, you know, it's I don't know.[0:17:30] Marc Andreessen: It's like a herd of iconoclast looking for the next big thing. Right? So iconoclast looking for the next big thing, that's good. The herd part, Right? That's what you gotta be careful of.[0:17:38] Marc Andreessen: So even when you're in one of these environments, you have to be careful that you're not getting sucked into the group think too much.[0:17:42] Andrew Huberman: When you say group think, do you mean excessive friction? Do you do pressure Testing each other's ideas to the point where things just don't move forward, or are you talking about groupthink where people start to form a consensus or the, self belief that, Gosh. We are so strong because we are so different. What what do you can we better define groupthink?[0:18:01] Marc Andreessen: It's actually less either one of those things both thing. It's like an you know, there there there are years where they're all of a sudden, there's like a lot of volcano movies. It's like, why are there all these volcano movies? And it's just like, I don't know. There was just something in that just stall.[0:18:22] Marc Andreessen: There was just something in the air. You know, look, tech Silicon Valley has this. You know, there there are moments in time where you'll you'll have these well, it's like the old thing. Like, what's the difference between a fad and a trend? You know, fad fad is the trend that doesn't last.[0:18:33] Marc Andreessen: Right? And so, you know, Silicon Valley is subject to fads and both fads and trends just like any place else. Right. In other words, you take smart and disagreeable people, you cluster them together, they will act like a herd. Right?[0:18:43] Marc Andreessen: They they will end up thinking the same things unless they try very hard not to.[0:18:48] Andrew Huberman: You've talked about these personality traits of great innovators before, and we're talking about them now. You invest in innovators. You try and identify them, and you are 1 so you can recognize these traits. Here, I'm making the presumption that you have these traits. Indeed, you do.[0:19:04] Andrew Huberman: We'll just get that out of the way. Have you observed people trying to feign these traits? And are there any specific questions or, behaviors that are a giveaway, that They're pretending to be the young Steve Jobs or that they're pretending to be the the young Henry Ford. Pick your list of other other names that qualify as, authentic legitimate innovators. We won't name names of people who have tried to disguise themselves as true innovators, but What are some of the, the the litmus tests?[0:19:40] Andrew Huberman: And I realize here that, we don't want you to give these away to the point where they're, lose their potency. But if you could share a few of those,[0:19:46] Marc Andreessen: I'd be happy to help. Good. We're we're actually pretty open book on this. So, so yeah. So so first of all, yes.[0:19:51] Marc Andreessen: So there are people who definitely try to, like, come in and basically present as being something that they're not. And they've, you know, like, they've read all the books. They will have listened to this interview. Right? They they will they, you know, they study everything, and they they construct a facade, And they come in and present to something they're not.[0:20:03] Marc Andreessen: I would say the amount of that varies exactly correlated to the Nasdaq. Right? And so When stock prices are super low, like, you actually get the opposite. When stock prices are super low, people get too demoralized and people who should be doing it basically give up because they that whatever whatever with the industry's over, the trend is over, whatever. It's all hopeless.[0:20:21] Marc Andreessen: And so you get this flushing thing. So no nobody ever shows up at a stock market low, And so it's like I'm the new I'm the new I'm the new next big thing, and and and and does and and and doesn't really wanna do it because because they're a higher status. The kinds of people who do the thing that you're talking about, they're they're fundamentally oriented for social status. They're they're trying they're they're they're trying to get the social status without without actually I got to Silicon Valley at 93, 94, the valley was dead. We we talked about that.[0:20:52] Marc Andreessen: By 98, it was roaring, and you had a lot of these people showing up We were you know, we basically basically had a lot of a lot of people showing up with with type of kind of stories. 2000 market crash. By 2001, the joke was that, there were these terms b to c and b to b. And in 1998, they meant b to c meant, business to consumer, and b to b meant business to business, which is the 2 different kinds of business models for Internet By 2001, b to me b to b meant back to banking, and b to c meant back to consulting. Right?[0:21:20] Marc Andreessen: Which is the highest is people who the people oriented to status who showed up to be in tech were like, yeah. Screw it. Like, this is over. Stick a fork in it. I'm gonna go back to, you know, in Goldman Sachs or go back to McKinsey, you know, where I can where I can where I can be high status.[0:21:31] Marc Andreessen: And so you you you you get this flushing kind of effect that happens in a in a downturn. That said on a On a on in a big upswing, yeah, you you get you get a lot of you get a lot of people showing up with with a lot of, you know, with a lot of, you know, kind of, let's say, public persona without the substance to back it up. So the the way we stress that you can actually say exactly how we test for this which because it it's it the the test exactly addresses the issue in a way that is Fake. And and it's actually this it's actually the same way homicide detectives try to find out if you've if you're if you're if you've actually if you're innocent or whether you killed somebody, it's the same it's the same tactic, which is you you ask increasingly detailed questions. Mhmm.[0:22:08] Marc Andreessen: Right? And so, you know, the way a homicide cop does this is, you know, what were you doing last night? You know? Oh, I was at a movie. Which movie?[0:22:14] Marc Andreessen: You know? Without a doubt. Which theater? You know? Okay.[0:22:17] Marc Andreessen: Which seat did you sit in? You know? Okay. What was the end of the movie? Right?[0:22:22] Marc Andreessen: Like, Right. And you you ask increasingly detailed questions and people have trouble at at some point, people have trouble making up and things just fuzz into just kind of obvious bullshit. And, basically, Fake founders basically have the same problem. They have a cons they're they're able to relay a conceptual theory of what they're doing that they've kind of engineered. But as they get into the details, it just it just fuzzes out.[0:22:40] Marc Andreessen: Whereas the the the true people that you wanna back that can do it, basically, what you find is they've spent 5 or 10 or 20 years obsessing on the details whatever it is they're about to do, and they're so deep in the details that they know so much more about it than you ever will. And in fact, the the best possible reaction is when they get mad. Right? Which is also what the homicide cops say. Right?[0:22:58] Marc Andreessen: Which actually want is you actually want the you obviously want the emotional response of, like, I can't believe that you're asking me questions this detailed and specific and picky, And they kinda figure out what you're doing, and then they get upset. Like, that's good. That's perfect. Right? But but but they they have, you know, but then they have to prove in themselves in in the sense of, like, they have to be able the questions in in in great detail.[0:23:18] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that people that are able to answer those questions in great detail have actually taken the time to systematically think through the if ands Yeah. Of all the possible implications of what they're going to do, and they have a specific vision in mind of how things need to turn out or will turn out? Or do you think that, they have a a vision and it's a no matter what, it will work out because the world will sort of bend around it? I mean, in other words, you think that they place their vision in context, or they simply have a vision and they have that tunnel vision of that thing? And gonna be it.[0:23:51] Andrew Huberman: Let's use you for an example, with Netscape. I mean, that's how I first came to know your name. When you were conceiving Netscape, Do you think, okay, there's this search engine and this browser, and and it's going to be this thing that looks this way and works this way and feels this way. Did you think that? And also think about, you know, that there was gonna be a gallery of other search engines, it would fit into that landscape of other search engines?[0:24:20] Andrew Huberman: Or were you just projecting your vision of this thing as this unique, and special Brainchild.[0:24:27] Marc Andreessen: Let me let me give the general answer, and then we can talk about the specific example. So the general answer is with with entrepreneurship, creativity, innovation is what economists call decision making under uncertainty. Right. And so then both parts are also important. Decision making, like, you're gonna make a ton of decisions because you have to decide what to do, what not to do, and then uncertainty, which is, like, the world's a complicated place.[0:24:45] Marc Andreessen: Right. And and and in mathematical terms, the world is a complex adaptive system with feedback loops and, like, it's really I mean, it's It's it's true. You know? Isaac Asimov wrote the you know, the in his novels, he he wrote about this field called psychohistory. Right?[0:24:57] Marc Andreessen: Which is the idea that there's, like, a supercomputer that can predict the future of, like, human affairs. Right? And it's like, don't have that. Not yet? Not not yet.[0:25:04] Marc Andreessen: Not yet. Well, we're working[0:25:05] Andrew Huberman: on that later.[0:25:06] Marc Andreessen: Right. We certainly don't have that yet. And so you're just Dealing you know, military, commanders call this the fog of war. Right? You're you're you're just dealing with a situation where the number of variables are just off the charts.[0:25:17] Marc Andreessen: It's all these other people, right, who are inherently unpredictable making all these decisions in different directions. And then the whole system is combinatorial, which is these people are colliding with each other, influencing the decisions. And so I mean, look. The the most straightforward kind of way to think about this is it's just it's amazing. Like, anybody who believes in economic central planning, it always blows my mind because it's like it's just like try opening restaurant.[0:25:37] Marc Andreessen: Like, try just opening a restaurant on the corner down here and, like, 50.50 odds the restaurant's gonna work. And, like, all you have to do to run a restaurant is, like, have and serve food and like and it's like most restaurants fail. Right? And so and restaurant people run restaurants are, like, pretty smart. Like, they're, you know, they're they're they usually think about these things very hard.[0:25:53] Marc Andreessen: They all wanna succeed. And it it's hard to do that. And so to start a tech company or to start an artistic movement or to or to fight a war, like, you're just going into this, like, basically, about conceptual battleground or, you know, military terms, real battleground where there's just, like, incredible levels of complexity branching future paths. And so there there's nothing it's it's, you know, there's nothing predictable. So what we look for is basically the the the sort of drop the the really good innovators.[0:26:18] Marc Andreessen: They've got a drive to basically be able to cope with that and deal with that, and they they basically do that in 2 steps. So one is they try to preplan as much as they possibly can, and and and we call that the process of navigating the we call the idea maze. And so the idea maze basically is I've got this general idea, and it might be the Internet's gonna work or search or whatever. And then it's like, okay. In their head, they have thought through of like, okay.[0:26:37] Marc Andreessen: If I do it this way, that way, this third way, here's what'll happen, then I have to do that, then I have to do this, then I have to bring in somebody to do that. Here's the technical challenge I'm gonna hit. And they've got in their they got in their heads as best anybody could. They've they've got as complete a sort of a map of possible futures as they could possibly have. And and this is where I say you ask them increasingly detailed questions, that's what you're trying to kinda get them to kinda chart out is, okay, how far ahead have you thought and how much are you anticipating all of the different twists and turns that gonna take okay.[0:27:04] Marc Andreessen: So then they start on day 1, and then, of course, what happens is, you know, now they're now they're in it. They're in now they're in the fog of war. Right? They're in true true uncertainty. And now that idea may is maybe not helpful Practically, but now they're gonna be basically constructing on the fly day by day as they learn and discover new things and as the world changes around them.[0:27:19] Marc Andreessen: And, of course, it's a feedback loop because they're gonna change you know, if their thing starts to work, it's gonna change the world, and then the fact the world is changing is gonna cause, you know, their plan to to, you know, to change as well. And so, yeah, the great the great ones, basically, they they course correct. You the the great ones course correct every single day. You know, they take stock of what they've learned. You know, they they modify the plan.[0:27:37] Marc Andreessen: The great ones tend to think in terms of hypotheses. Right? Like a scientific sort of mentality, which is I tend to think, okay. I'm gonna try this, like, I'm gonna go into the world. I'm gonna announce that I'm doing this for sure.[0:27:48] Marc Andreessen: Right? Like, I'm gonna say, like, this is my plan. Gonna tell all my employees that. I'm gonna tell all my investors that. I'm gonna put a stake in there, and it's my plan.[0:27:54] Marc Andreessen: I'm gonna try it. Right? And even though I sound like I have complete certainty, I know that I need to test to find out whether it's gonna work. And if it's not, then I have to go back to all those same people. I have to say, well, actually, we're not going left, we're going right.[0:28:05] Marc Andreessen: And they have to run that loop Thousands of times. Right? And they had, you know, to get through the other side. And this this led to the creation of this great term pivot, which has been very helpful in our industry because the the the word when I was when I was young, the word we used up. Yeah.[0:28:18] Marc Andreessen: And TIFFIT, like, sounds like so much better. It sounds like so much more professional. But, yeah, you, like, make mistakes. You you you it's just it's just too complicated And you course correct, you adjust, you evolve. Often these things, at least in business, the businesses that end up working really well tend to be different than the original plan.[0:28:35] Marc Andreessen: But that's that's part of the process of a really smart founder basically working their way through reality, right, as as as they're executing their plan.[0:28:42] Andrew Huberman: The way you're describing this has parallels to a lot of models in biology and the practice of science, you know, random walks, but that aren't truly random, pseudorandom walks in biology, etcetera. But one thing that is becoming clear from the way you're describing this is that I could imagine a great risk to early success. So for instance, somebody develops a product. People are excited by it. They start to implement that product, but then the landscape changes, And they don't learn how to pivot to use the, less profane version of it.[0:29:13] Andrew Huberman: Right? They don't learn how to do that. The in other words, the, and I think of everything these days, or most everything in terms of reward schedules and dopamine reward schedules because that is the universal currency of reward. And so when you talk about the Sean Parker quote of, learning to enjoy the taste of one's own blood, that is very different than learning to enjoy the taste of success.[0:29:35] Marc Andreessen: That's right.[0:29:35] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's about internalizing success as a process of being self determined and less agreeable, etcetera. In other words, building up of those 5 traits becomes the source of dopamine perhaps in a way that's highly adaptive. So on the outside, we just the product, the end product, the iPhone, the MacBook, the Netscape, etcetera. But I have to presume, and I'm not a psychologist, but I have done neurophysiology, and I've studied the dopamine system enough to know that what's being rewarded in the context of what you're describing Sounds to be a reinforcement of those 5 traits rather than, oh, it's going to be this particular product or the company is gonna look this way or the logo is gonna be this or that.[0:30:16] Andrew Huberman: That all seems Like, the peripheral to, what's really going on, that great innovators are really in the process of of establishing neural circuitry that is all about reinforcing the me Yeah. And the process of being me.[0:30:32] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Yeah. So this this goes to yeah. So this is, like, extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation. So the the Steve Jobs kinda zen version of this, right, or the sort of hippie version of this was the journey is the reward.[0:30:42] Marc Andreessen: Right.[0:30:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah.[0:30:42] Marc Andreessen: He always he always told he always told his employees that it's like look like you know, everybody thinks in terms of these big public markers like the stock price or the IPO or the product launch or whatever. He's no. It's it's actually the the process itself is the point. Right? And and and if you had to your point, if you have that mentality, then that's that's an intrinsic motivation, not an extrinsic motivation.[0:30:59] Marc Andreessen: And so that's the kind of intrinsic motivation that that can keep you going for a long time. Another way to think about it is competing against yourself. Right? It's like, can I get better at doing this? Right.[0:31:08] Marc Andreessen: And can I prove to myself that I can get better? There's also a big social component to this, and this is one of the reasons why Silicon Valley punches so so far above its weight as a place. There's a psychological component which is also goes to the comparison set. So a phenomenon that we observed over time is the leading, tech company in any city, will aspire to be as large as the previous leading tech company in that city, but often not larger. Right?[0:31:32] Marc Andreessen: Because they they sort of have they have a model of And as long as they beat that level of success, they've kind of, you know, checked the box. Like, they've made it, you know and and then they but then in contrast, you're in Silicon Valley and you look around and it's just like Facebook and Cisco Cisco and Oracle and, you know, Hewlett Packard and[0:31:47] Andrew Huberman: Gladiators.[0:31:48] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. And you're just, like, looking at these, you know, giants. And and, you know, many of them are still you know, Mark Zuckerberg's still, you know, going to work every day and, like, trying to trying to do you know? Like and and so, like, these people are, like, a you know, the the role models are, like, alive. Right.[0:31:59] Marc Andreessen: Right. They're they're, like, right there. Right? And it's so clear, like, how much better they are and how much bigger their accomplishments are. And so what what we find is Young founders in that environment have much greater aspirations.[0:32:10] Marc Andreessen: Right? Because they just again, it could maybe maybe at that point, maybe it's the social status. Maybe there's there's an extrinsic component to that. But I or maybe it helps calibrate that internal system to basically say, actually, you know, no. The opportunity here is not to build a local you know, which we may call local maximum form of success, but Let's build to a global maximum form of success, which is which is something as big as we possibly can.[0:32:30] Marc Andreessen: Ultimately, the great ones are probably driven more internally than when when it comes down to it. And that is where you get this phenomenon where you get people who are, you know, extremely successful and extremely wealthy who very easily could punch out And move to Fiji and just call it, and they're still working 16 hour days. Right? And so, obviously, something explains that that has nothing to do with external rewards. And and I think it's it's it's an internal thing.[0:32:52] Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one.[0:33:23] Andrew Huberman: I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better, and It also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer, a g one. If you'd like to try AG one, go to drinkagone.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you Five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:33:45] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drink a gone.com/huberman. I've heard you talk a lot about The inner landscape, the inner psychology of these folks, and I appreciate that we're going even deeper into that today. And we will talk about the the landscape around whether or not Silicon Valley or New York, whether or not there are specific cities that are ideal for certain types of pursuits. So I think there was an article written by Paul Graham some years ago about, the conversations that you overhear in a city will tell you everything you need to know about whether or not you belong there, in terms of your, professional pursuits. Some of that's changed over time, and now we should probably add Austen to the mixes, because it was written some time ago.[0:34:24] Andrew Huberman: In any event, I wanna return to that, but I want to focus on an aspect of this intrinsic versus extrinsic motivators In terms of something that's a bit more cryptic, which is, one's personal relationships.[0:34:38] Speaker 2: You know,[0:34:38] Andrew Huberman: if I think about the, catalog of innovators in Silicon Valley, some of them, like Steve Jobs, had complicated personal lives romantic personal lives early on, and it Sounds like he worked it out. I don't know. I didn't, I wasn't their, couple's therapist, but, you know, he, when he died, he was in a marriage that For all the world seemed like a happy marriage. You also have examples of innovators who have had many partners, many children with other partners. Elon comes to mind.[0:35:05] Andrew Huberman: You know? I don't think I'm disclosing anything that isn't already obvious. Those could have been happy relationships and just had many of them. But the reason I'm asking this is you can imagine that for the innovator, the person with these traits who's trying to build up this This thing, whatever it is, that having someone or several people, in some cases, who just truly believe in you when the rest of the world may not believe in you yet or at all Right. Could be immensely powerful.[0:35:36] Andrew Huberman: And we have examples from cults that, embody this. We have examples from politics. We have examples from tech innovation and science. And I've always been fascinated by this because I feel like it's the more cryptic and yet very potent form of allowing someone to build themselves up. It's a combination of Inner psychology and extrinsic motivation because, obviously, if that person were to die or leave them or, cheat on them or, you know, pair up with some other innovator, which we've seen Several times recently and in the past, it can be devastating to that person.[0:36:10] Andrew Huberman: But what are your thoughts on the role of personal and, in particular, romantic relationship as it relates to people having an idea, and they're feeling that they can really bring that idea to fruition in the world.[0:36:22] Marc Andreessen: So it's a real mixed bag. You have lots of examples in all directions, and I think it's something like it's something like that something like following. So first is we talked about the personality So these people, they tend to be highly disagreeable.[0:36:33] Andrew Huberman: Doesn't foster a good romantic relationship.[0:36:35] Marc Andreessen: I would disagree with people. It can be difficult to be in relationship[0:36:38] Andrew Huberman: with them. Heard of that once or twice before. A friend may have given me that[0:36:41] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Right? And, you know, maybe you just need to find the right person who, like, help him as that and is willing to you know, there's there's a lot of relationships where, like, you it's always this question about relationships, right, do you wanna have the same personality, you know, growth profile, the same behavioral traits basically as your partner? Or do you actually wanna have you know, is is is it an opposites opposites thing? And, know, look.[0:36:57] Marc Andreessen: I'm sure you've seen this. There are relationships where you'll have somebody who's highly disagreeable who's paired with somebody who's highly agreeable. And it actually works out great because 1 person just gets to be on their soapbox all time when the other person is just like, okay. Right? And it's fine.[0:37:08] Marc Andreessen: Right? It's fine. It's good. You know, you put 2 disagreeable people together, you know, maybe sparks fly, and they have great conversations all the time, and maybe they come to hate each other. Right?[0:37:16] Marc Andreessen: And so, so anyway, so these people, if you're gonna be with one of these people, you're fishing out of the disagreeable end of the pond. And, again, when I say disagreeable, I don't mean you know, these are these are normal distributions. I don't mean, like, 60% disagreeable or 80% disagreeable. The people we're talking about are 99.99% It's agreeable. Right?[0:37:31] Marc Andreessen: So these are ornery ornery people. So so so part of it's that. And then, of course, they have the other personality traits. Right? They're they're, you super conscientious.[0:37:39] Marc Andreessen: They're super driven. As a consequence, they tend to work really hard. They tend to not have a lot of time for, you know, family vacations for other things. You know, they're not they would and they don't enjoy them if they're forced to go on them. And so, again, that thinking Frey in a in a relationship.[0:37:50] Marc Andreessen: So so there there's a so there's a fair amount in there that's loaded. Like, somebody's gonna partner with 1 of these people needs to be signed up for the ride, And that's that's a hard thing. You know? It's a a hard thing to do. Or you need a true partnership with 2 of these, which is also hard to do.[0:38:04] Marc Andreessen: So I think that's part of it. And then, look, I think a big part of it is, you know, people achieve a certain level of success, and you know, either in their own minds or, you know, publicly, and then they start to be able to get away with Right? And they start to be able it's like, well, okay. You know, now we're rich and successful and famous, and now I deserve you know? And and this is where you get into I I view this now in the realm of personal choice.[0:38:25] Marc Andreessen: You get in in this thing where people start to think that they deserve things, and so they start to behave in, you know, very bad ways. And so then they blow up their personal worlds as a consequence, and maybe they regret it later and maybe they don't. Right? It's always a always a question. So yeah.[0:38:39] Marc Andreessen: So I think there's that. And then I don't know. Like, yeah, some people just need maybe the other part of it is some people just need more emotional support than others, and I don't know that that's a big I don't know that that tilts either way. I know I know some of these people who have, like, great loving relationships and seem to draw very much on having this kind of firm foundation to rely upon. And then I know other people who are just like their personalizer, just a continuous train wreck, and it doesn't seem doesn't seem to matter.[0:39:02] Marc Andreessen: Like, professionally, they just doing what they're doing. And and and maybe there's, maybe we could talk here about, like, you know, whatever is the personality trait for risk taking. Right? Like, some people are so incredibly risk prone that they need to take risk in all aspects of their lives at all times. And and if if if part of their life gets stable, they find a way to blow it up.[0:39:20] Marc Andreessen: And that some some of these people you could describe in those terms also.[0:39:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Let's talk about that. Yeah. Because I think risk taking and sensation seeking is something that fascinates me, for my own reasons and in my observations of others. Does it dovetail with these 5 traits in a way that can really serve innovation in ways that can benefit everybody?[0:39:43] Andrew Huberman: The reason I say to benefit everybody is is because There is a view of how we're painting this picture of the innovator as this, like, really cruel person. But oftentimes, what we're talking about are innovations that make the world far better for billions of people. Yeah.[0:39:58] Marc Andreessen: That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, we're everything we're talking about also is not just in tech or science or or or in in business. It's also everything we're also talking about is true for the arts.[0:40:05] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. Right? So and you have a history of, like, artistic expression as, you know, you have you have people with all these same kinds of traits.[0:40:09] Andrew Huberman: Well, I was thinking about Picasso in his in his regular turnover of lovers and partners, and he was very open about the fact that it was one of the sources of his productivity, slash creativity. He wasn't shy about that. I I suppose if he were alive today, it might be a little bit different. He might be judged a little differently.[0:40:26] Marc Andreessen: Right. Or that was his story for, you know, behaving in a pattern that, you know, was very awful for the people around him and he didn't care. Right?[0:40:32] Andrew Huberman: Right. Maybe they left him.[0:40:33] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Like, you know, who knows? So so so, you know, there's there's puts and takes to all this. But, but no. Okay.[0:40:38] Marc Andreessen: So I have a theory. So here here's a theory. This this is one of these. I keep a list of things that will get me kicked out of a dinner party, topics at any given point in time.[0:40:45] Speaker 2: Do you[0:40:46] Andrew Huberman: read it before you go in?[0:40:47] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. I just I yeah. So I I have it on[0:40:51] Speaker 2: on auto[0:40:51] Marc Andreessen: recall so that I can I can get out of Thanks? But, so here here's the thing that get me kicked out of dinner party, especially these days. So, think of the kind of person where it's, like, very clear that they're, Super high to your point. There's there's somebody with super high output, whatever domain they're in. They've done things that have, like, fundamentally, like, changed the world.[0:41:08] Marc Andreessen: They've brought new whether it's businesses or technologies or art, you know, works of art, you know, entire schools of of creative expression, in some cases, to the world. And then at a certain point, they blow themselves to smithereens. Right. And they do that either through, like, a massive, like, financial scandal. They do that through a massive personal, you know, breakdown.[0:41:25] Marc Andreessen: They do that through some sort of public expression that causes them a huge amount of problems. You know? They say they say the wrong thing, maybe not once, but several 100 times and blow themselves to smithereens. And and and there's this, you know, there's this kind of arc there's this moral arc that people kinda wanna apply, which is like the Icarus, you know, the the, you know, flying too close to the sun, and, you know, he had it coming, and he needed to keep his ego under control, and you you get kind of this, you know, kind of this this this judgment that applies. So I have a different Theory on this.[0:41:52] Marc Andreessen: So the term I use to describe these people and a lot of and and by the way, a lot of other people who don't actually blow themselves up but get close to it, which is a whole another set of people. I call them martyrs to civilizational progress. Right? So so and we're backwards. Civilizational progress.[0:42:07] Marc Andreessen: So look. The only way civilization gets moved forward is when people like this do something new. Right? Because civilization as a whole does not do new things. Right?[0:42:16] Marc Andreessen: Groups of people do not do new things. Right? These things things don't happen automatically. Like, by by by default, nothing changes. The only way civilization will change on any of these axis ever happens is because one of these people stands up and says, you know, no.[0:42:29] Marc Andreessen: I'm gonna do something different than what everybody else has ever done before. So the This is the this is progress. Like, this is actually how it happens. Sometimes they get lioness or awarded. Sometimes they get crucified.[0:42:39] Marc Andreessen: Sometimes the crucification is literal. Sometimes it's just, you know, symbolic, but, like, you know, the the the the the they are those kinds of people. And then and then and then murders, like, when when they go down in flames, Like, they have and and, again, this is where it really screws the people's moral judgments because everybody wants to have this sort of super clear story of like, okay. He did a bad thing and he was punished. And I'm I'm like, no.[0:43:00] Marc Andreessen: No. No. No. No. He was the kind of person who was going to do great things and also was going to take on a level of risk and take on a level of sort of extreme behavior such that he was going to expose himself to flying too close to the sun.[0:43:12] Marc Andreessen: Wing's mouth crashed the ground. But but but it's a package deal. Right. The the the reason you have the Picassos and the Beethovens and all these people is because they're willing to take these extreme level of risks. They they they are that creative and original, not just in their art or their business, but in everything else that they do, that they will set themselves up to be able to fail.[0:43:29] Marc Andreessen: Psychologic you know, a psychologist would probably would probably say, you know, maybe, you know, to what extent do they actually, like, have a death wish? Do they do they actually you know, at some point, do they wanna punish themselves? Do they wanna fail? That I don't know. But you see this.[0:43:40] Marc Andreessen: They they they they deliberately move themselves too close to the sun. And and and you can you can see it when it's happening because, like, if they get too far from the sun, they deliberately move back towards Right? They, you know, they they come right back and they they they want the risk. And so anyway, like, I I I yeah. So Murders to civilizational progress, like, this is how progress happens.[0:43:58] Marc Andreessen: When these people crash and burn, the national, you know, inclination is to judge them morally. I tend to think we should basically say, look. Like and I and I don't even know if this means, like, giving them a moral pass or whatever. But it's like, look. Like, this is how civilization progresses, and we need to at least understand that there's a self sacrificial aspect to this that that that may be tragic and and often is tragic, but it it is it is quite literally self sacrificial.[0:44:20] Andrew Huberman: Are there any examples of great innovators who, were able to compartmentalize their risk taking, to such a degree that they had what seemed to be a morally impeccable life Yeah. In every domain except in their business pursuits.[0:44:36] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. That's right. So some people are very some people are very highly controlled like that. Some people are able to, like, very narrowly and I I don't I don't really wanna set myself an example in a lot of this, but I I will tell you, like, as an example, like, I I never I I will never use debt in business, number 1. You know?[0:44:50] Marc Andreessen: Number 2, like, I have the most placid personal life you can imagine. Number 3, I'm not I'm I'm the last person in the world who's ever gonna do an extreme sport. I mean, I'm not even gonna go on the sauna ice bath. Like, I'm not I'm not doing any of this. Like, I don't they're doing it.[0:45:02] Marc Andreessen: I'm not snow skiing.[0:45:03] Andrew Huberman: No obligation to do the ice bath.[0:45:04] Marc Andreessen: I'm not on the Titan. Not, you know, I'm not going down to see the Titanic Goodness.[0:45:07] Andrew Huberman: You weren't[0:45:08] Marc Andreessen: I'm not doing any of this. I'm not doing any of this stuff. I have no interest. I don't play golf. I don't ski.[0:45:11] Marc Andreessen: I I have no interest in any of this stuff. Right? And so, like, there are and I know people like this, right, who are very high achievers. It's just like, yeah, they they're they're they're completely segmented. They're extreme risk takers in business.[0:45:20] Marc Andreessen: They're completely buttoned down on personal side, they're completely buttoned down, you know, financially. They're, you know, they they're scrupulous with following every rule and law you can possibly imagine. But but they're still fantastic innovators. And then I know many others who are just like, they've their life is on fire all the time in every possible way. And whenever it looks like the fire is turning into embers, they figure out a way to, like, relight the fire.[0:45:40] Marc Andreessen: Right? And they just really want to live on the edge. So I I think that's maybe I think that's an independent variable. And again, I would apply the same thing. I think the same thing applies to the arts.[0:46:00] Marc Andreessen: You know, never had any aberrant behavior at all in his personal life. You know, fam family man, tons of kids. Apparently, you know, pillar of the community. Right? And so, like, if Bach could be Bach And yet not, like, burn his way through, you know, 300 mistresses or whatever.[0:46:13] Marc Andreessen: You know, maybe you can too.[0:46:15] Andrew Huberman: So in thinking about these 2 different categories of innovators, those that take on tremendous risk in all domains of their life and those that take on tremendous risk in a very compartmentalized way. I don't know what the percentages are, but I have to wonder if in this modern age of the public being far less forgivable, What I'm referring to is cancel culture. Do you think that we are limiting the number of innovations in total. Like, by just simply frightening or eliminating an enormous category of innovators because They don't have the confidence or the means or the, strategies in place to regulate, so they're just either bowing out or they're getting crossed off. Getting canceled 1 by 1.[0:46:58] Marc Andreessen: So do you think the public is less tolerant than it used to be or more tolerant?[0:47:03] Andrew Huberman: Well, the systems that, I've I'm not going to be careful here. I think the, the large institution systems[0:47:12] Marc Andreessen: Yes.[0:47:13] Andrew Huberman: Are Not tolerant of what the public tells them they shouldn't be tolerant of. And so if there's enough noise, There's enough noise in the mob. I think institutions bow out. And here, I'm referring not just to they they essentially say, okay. The let the cancellation proceed.[0:47:30] Speaker 2: Right.[0:47:31] Andrew Huberman: Or they then maybe they're the maybe they're the gavel that comes down, but but they're not the the lever that got the thing going. And so I'm not just thinking about universities. I'm also thinking about advertisers. I'm thinking about, the big movie houses that, cancel a film that a given actor might be in because they had something in their personal life that's still getting worked out. I'm thinking about people who, are in a legal process that's not yet resolved, but the public has decided they're a bad person, etcetera.[0:47:56] Marc Andreessen: My question is, are we really talking about the public? I agree with your question, and I'm gonna come back to it. But I I I'm gonna I'm gonna so I'm gonna examine one part of your question, which is is this really the public we're talking And and I would just say exhibit a is who is the current front runner, for the Republican nomination, today. The public, at least on one side of the political aisle seems very on board. Right?[0:48:19] Marc Andreessen: Number 2, like, look, you know, there's a certain musician who, like, you know, flew too close to the sun, blew himself to smithereens. He's still hitting all time highs on, music streams every month. The public seems fine.[0:48:32] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[0:48:32] Marc Andreessen: Like, I I think the public might I I would argue the public is actually more open to these things than it actually maybe ever has been. And we we could talk about why that's a case. I think it's a it's a differentiation, and this is what what your question was aiming at, but it's a differentiation between the public and the and so so so I've my view is everything that you just described as an elite phenomenon, and actually the public is very much not on board with it.[0:48:52] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[0:48:53] Marc Andreessen: And and and so what's actually happening is the division the what what's happened is the public and the elites have gapped out. The the the the public is more forgiving of of of what Previously might have been considered kind of ever an extreme behavior. Right. It was it was oh, f Scott Fitzgerald, there are no second acts in American lives. It turns out completely wrong.[0:49:09] Marc Andreessen: Turns out their 2nd acts, 3rd acts, house. Apparently, you can have a limited number of acts. The public is actually up for it.[0:49:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, I think of somebody like Mike Tyson. Right? I feel like he's every you know, his life exemplifies, everything that's amazing and great and also terrible about America.[0:49:24] Marc Andreessen: If we took Mike Tyson to dinner tonight at any restaurant anywhere in the United States, What would happen?[0:49:29] Andrew Huberman: He would be loved.[0:49:30] Marc Andreessen: Oh, he would be like Adored. He would be the outpouring of enthusiasm and passion and love would be incredible. Like, it would be unbelievable. Is this is a great example? Like, it just like the and and, again, I'm not even gonna draw more.[0:49:42] Marc Andreessen: I'm not even gonna say I agree with that or disagree with that. I'm just like, we I think we'd all intuitively know that the public is just, like, 100%, like, absolutely. Like, he's a legend. Like, he's a legend. He's a living legend.[0:49:50] Marc Andreessen: I[0:49:50] Andrew Huberman: love Mike.[0:49:51] Marc Andreessen: He's like a cultural touchstone. Absolutely. And then you see it when he shows up in movies. Right? He shows I don't remember the I mean, the big breakthrough where I figured this out with respect to him because I don't really follow sports, but when he showed up in that it was at that first hangover movie, and he shows up.[0:50:02] Marc Andreessen: And then then, you know, as it was I was in a theater and, like, the The audience just goes bananas crazy. They're so excited to see him.[0:50:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He evokes delight. I always say that Mike Tyson is the only person I'm aware of that can wear A shirt with his own name on it, and it somehow doesn't seem, wrong. In fact, it just kind of makes you like him more.[0:50:20] Speaker 2: Yeah.[0:50:21] Andrew Huberman: It's it his ego feels very contoured in a way that, he knows who he is and who he was, and and yet there's a there's a humbleness woven in, maybe As a consequence of all that he's been through, I don't know. But, yeah, people love Mike.[0:50:36] Marc Andreessen: Public loves him. Now exactly. Now, you know, if he shows up to, like, lecture at Harvard, Right? Like, I think you're probably gonna get a different reaction.[0:50:42] Andrew Huberman: I don't know. Well I don't know.[0:50:43] Speaker 2: Well I[0:50:43] Andrew Huberman: mean, David Simon, you know, the the guy who wrote The Wire gave a gave a talk at Harvard, and And it sounded to me based on his report of that, which is very interesting, in fact, that People adore, people who are connected to everybody in that way. Like, I feel like everybody loves Mike from from Above his status, the sides, below his status, he's just sort of he he occupies this this halo of of love and adoration.[0:51:12] Marc Andreessen: Okay. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. And then, look, the the other side of this is the is is the elites, and you kind of alluded to this with the institution.[0:51:18] Marc Andreessen: So so, basically, it's like the people who are, like, at least nominally in charge or feel like that they should Yeah.[0:51:23] Andrew Huberman: I wanna make sure we define elite. So you're not necessarily talking about people who are wealthy. You're talking about people who have authority within institutions.[0:51:29] Marc Andreessen: So the ultimate definition of an elite is who can get who fired. Right? Like, that's the the ultimate tech. Who can get who fired, boycotted, blacklisted, ostracized? Like, when push prosecuted, jailed?[0:51:41] Marc Andreessen: Like, when push comes to shove Mhmm. Right. I think that's always the question. Who can destroy whose career? And, of course, you'll notice that that is heavily asymmetric When they when these fights play out, like, there's very clear which side can get the other the other side fired, which side which side can't.[0:51:54] Marc Andreessen: And so yeah. So look. I think we we live in a period of time where the elites have gotten to be stream in a number of dimensions, and I'm and, you know, and that I think is characterized by, for sure, extreme groupthink, extreme sanctimony, extreme, you know, moral, you know, I would say dudgeon, you know, extreme you know, this this weird sort of modern puritanism, and then an extreme sort of morality of, like, punishment and terror, I guess, they're perceived enemies. But but I wanted to I wanted to go through that because I actually think I actually think that's a very different phenomenon. I think what's happening to the elites is very different than what's happening in the in the population at large.[0:52:25] Marc Andreessen: And then, of course, I I think there's a feedback loop in there, which is I think the population at large is not on board with that program. Mhmm. Right? I think the elites are aware that the population is not on board program. I think they judge the population negatively as a consequence that causes the elites to harden their own positions.[0:52:39] Marc Andreessen: That causes them to be even more alienating to the population. And so they're, You know, they're in sort of an oppositional negative feedback loop. And, yeah, it's gonna be and, you know, it's and but, again, it's a sort of question, okay, who who can get who fired? And so, You know, elites are really good, at getting, like, normal people fired. Ostracized, banned, you know, hip pieces in the press, like, whatever.[0:52:59] Marc Andreessen: You know, for normal people to get elites fired, they have to really light band together, right, and really mount a serious challenge, which mostly doesn't happen, but but but might be starting to happen in some cases.[0:53:08] Andrew Huberman: Do you think this power of the of the elites over, stemmed from social media Sort of going against its original purpose. I mean, when you think social media, you think you're giving each and every person their own little reality TV show, their own voice, And yet, we've seen a dramatic uptick in the number of cancellations and firings related to immoral behavior based on things that were either done or amplified on social media. Right. It's almost as if, the public is holding the wrong, end of the knife.[0:53:41] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So the way to describe it so so I so I use these 2 terms and they're somewhat interchangeable, but elites and institutions. Then there there's so many are interchangeable because who runs the institutions? The elites. Right?[0:53:51] Marc Andreessen: And so it's it's a it's a sort of a self self reinforcing thing. Anyway, institutions of all kinds, institutions, everything from, you know, the government, bureaucracies, companies, nonprofits, foundations, NGOs, you know, tech companies, you know, on[0:54:02] Andrew Huberman: and on and on.[0:54:03] Marc Andreessen: Like, you know, people who are in People who are in charge of big complexes and that that had carry a lot of basically power and influence and capability and money as a consequence of their positional authority. Right. So, you know, the head of a giant foundation may never have done anything in their life that would cause somebody to have a high opinion of them as a person, but they're in charge of this, you know, gigantic multibillion dollar complex and have all Power of the results. So that's just to define terms, at least institutions. So it's actually interesting.[0:54:29] Marc Andreessen: Gallup, has been doing polls on the following on the question of of trust in institutions, which is sort of a, therefore, proxy for trust in elites, basically since the early 19 seventies. And what you find and and they do this across all the Categories of big institutions, you know, basically, every every everyone I just talked about, a bunch of others, big business, small business, banks, newspapers, broadcast television, the military, police. And so they've got, like, 30 categories or something. And, basically, what you see is almost all the categories basically started in the early seventies at, like, or 70% trust, and now they've oh, it it basic almost across the board, they've just done it. They had a complete, basically, linear slide down for 50 years, basically, my my whole life.[0:55:09] Marc Andreessen: And, you know, they're they're they're now bottoming out. You know, congress and journalists bottom out at, like, 10%. Right? Like, the 2 the 2 groups everybody hates are, congress and journalists. And then it's like a lot of other big institutions are, like, 20 in their twenties, thirties, forties.[0:55:24] Marc Andreessen: Actually, big business actually scores fairly high. Tech actually scores quite high. The military score is quite high, but basically everything else has really caved in. And so so this is sort of my fundamental challenge to everybody who says and you you didn't do this, but you you'll hear the the simple form of this, which is social media caused the current trouble. And let's call this an We could collapse in faith and institutions and and elites.[0:55:45] Marc Andreessen: Let's call that part of the current trouble. Everybody's like, well, social media caused that. I was like, well, no. Social media social media is new. Right?[0:55:52] Marc Andreessen: In the last you know, social media is effectively new practically speaking since 2010, 2012 is when it really took off. And so if the trend started in the early 19 seventies, and and and and, Martin Gurri, wrote, I think, the best book on this called The Revolt of the Public where he do this in detail, and and he he he does he does say that, social media had a lot to do with what's happened in the last decade. But he says is, yeah, if you go back, you look further. It was basically 2 things coinciding. One was just a general change in the media environment.[0:56:21] Marc Andreessen: And in particular, the 19 seventies is when you started to and especially in 19 eighties is when you started to get, specifically talk radio, Mhmm. Which was a new outlet. And then you also start you also got cable television. And then you also by the way, it's actually interesting. In the fifties, sixties, you had paperback books, was another one of these, which was an outlet.[0:56:37] Marc Andreessen: So you you you had, like, a fracturing in the media landscape that started in the fifties through the eighties. And then, of course, the Internet, like, blew it wide open. Having said that, if the elites and the institutions were fantastic, you would know it more than ever. Information is more accessible. And so the other thing that he says and I agree with is The the public is not being tricked into thinking that at least institutions are bad.[0:56:57] Marc Andreessen: They're they're they're learning that they're bad. Right? And and and the mystery and therefore, the mystery of the Gallup poll is why those numbers aren't all 0. Right? Which is, you know, arguably, you know, in a lot of cases where they should be.[0:57:07] Andrew Huberman: I think one reason that[0:57:09] Marc Andreessen: Oh, and by the way, he he thinks this is bad. So he he and I have a different view on it. So here's where he and I disagree. He thinks this is bad. So he he's he basically says you you can't replace elites with nothing.[0:57:18] Marc Andreessen: You can't replace institutions with nothing if if if because what you're just left with is just gonna be wreckage. Can left with us completely, basically, you know, atomized out of control society that has no ability to marshal, you know, any sort of activity in any direction. It's just gonna be a doggy dog awful, you know, world. I have a very different view on that, which we can which we can talk about.[0:57:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'd love to I'd love to hear your views on that. Yeah. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals.[0:57:50] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etcetera, mean, and Behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health. InsideTracker's Tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APOB and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and Energy regulation. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.[0:58:39] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. The the quick question I was gonna ask before we go there is I think that one reason that I and many other people sort of reflexively assume that social media caused the the demise of our faith and institutions Is well, first of all, I wasn't aware of this, lack of correlation between the The decline in faith and institutions and and the rise of social media. But secondarily, that we've seen some movements that have, essentially rooted themselves in tweets, in comments, in posts They get amplified, and those tweets and comments and posts come from everyday people. In fact, I can't name 1 person who initiated, a given, cancellation or movement because it was the sort of dog piling or mob, adding on to some person that was essentially anonymous. So I think that for many of us, we we have the bottom use neuroscience language as sort of a bottom up and a perspective.[0:59:40] Andrew Huberman: Oh, you know, someone sees something, in their daily life or experiences something in their daily life, and they tweet about it Or they comment about it or they post about it, and then enough people dogpile on the accused That, it picks up force, and then the elites feel compelled, obligated to cancel somebody. And that tends to be the narrative. And so I think the logical conclusion is, oh, you know, social media allows for this to happen, whereas, normally, someone would just be standing on the corner shouting or Calling lawyers that don't have faith in them and, you know, you get the like, the Erin Brockovich model of a, you know, you know, that turns into a movie, but that's a rare case of this woman who's got this idea in mind about how, big institution is is doing wrong, or somebody is doing wrong in the world and then can leverage big institutions. Excuse me. But the way that you describe it is that the elites are, are leading this[1:00:34] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah.[1:00:35] Andrew Huberman: This shift. Yeah. So 100%. So what is the role of the public in it? I mean I mean, just to give it a concrete example.[1:00:43] Andrew Huberman: If, for instance, no one Tweeted or commented a me too, or no one tweeted or commented about, some ill behavior of some, I don't know. University faculty member or, business person, would the elite have come down on them anyway?[1:01:01] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah. So what's happening so would would would I I based on what I've seen over the years, is is it's it's there is so much astroturfing right now. There there are entire categories of people who are paid to do this. Some of them we call journalists. Some of them we call activists.[1:01:16] Marc Andreessen: Of them we call, you know, NGO, you know, nonprofit. Some of them we call university professors. Like, some of them we call grad students. Like, whatever. They're paid to do this.[1:01:23] Marc Andreessen: You know, I don't know if you've ever looked into the misinformation, industrial complex. There's this whole universe of basically these funded groups that basically do quote, unquote, you know, quote, unquote, misinformation. And and they're Constantly mounting these kinds of attacks. They're constantly trying to gin up this kind of basically panic to cause somebody to get fired. Like[1:01:40] Andrew Huberman: So it's not grassroots.[1:01:41] Marc Andreessen: No. It's the opposite of grassroots. No. It on almost always when you trace these things back, it was a it was a journalist, it was an activist, it was a it was a it was a public figure of some kind. These are entrepreneur there there's an these are entrepreneurs in a in a sort of a weird way.[1:01:55] Marc Andreessen: Like, they're they're basically they're they're paid. They're they're job mission calling law, it's all wrapped up together. Like, they're true believers, but they're also getting paid to do it. And there's a giant funding com I mean, there's a very large funding complex for this coming you know, certain high high profile, people who put huge amounts of money into this.[1:02:10] Andrew Huberman: Is this well known?[1:02:11] Marc Andreessen: Yes. Well so, I mean, it is in my world. So this is what the social media companies have been on the receiving end of for the last decade. Is it's this it's it's base it's basic it's basically a political media activism complex with very deep pockets behind it and you've got people who basically literally people who sit all day and watch the TV network on the other side or watch the Twitter feeds either side and they wait they they basically wait. It's like every politician this has been the case for a long time now.[1:02:34] Marc Andreessen: Every every politician who goes out and gives stump speeches, you'll see there's always somebody in the crowd with the camcorder or right now with the phone recording them. And that's somebody from the other campaign He was paid somebody to just be there and, like, record every single thing the politician says so that so that when Mitt Romney says whatever the 47% thing, they've got it on tape. And then they clip it, and they and they try to make it viral. So the this stuff is and, again, like, look. Like, these people believe what they're doing.[1:02:55] Marc Andreessen: I'm not saying it's even dishonest.[1:02:56] Speaker 2: Like, these people believe what they're doing. They think they're fighting a holy war.[1:02:56] Marc Andreessen: They think they're protecting democracy. It's like these people believe what they're doing. They think they're fighting a holy war. They think they're protecting democracy. They think they're protecting civilization.[1:03:01] Marc Andreessen: They think they're protecting whatever it is they're protecting. But but they and then they know how to use the tools. And so they they know how to they they know how to try to gin up the outrage. And then by the ways, sometimes it works since, you know, Social cascade. Sometimes it works.[1:03:13] Marc Andreessen: Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes they cascade. Sometimes they don't. But if you follow these people on Twitter, like, this is what they do every day. They're constantly trying to like light this fire.[1:03:22] Marc Andreessen: Right.[1:03:22] Andrew Huberman: Oh. Wow. I assume that it was just really bottom up, but it sounds like it's sort of a mid level, and then it and then it captures the elites, and then the thing takes on a life of its own.[1:03:31] Speaker 2: By the[1:03:31] Marc Andreessen: way, it also intersects with the trust and safety groups at the social media firms, right, who are responsible for figuring out who gets promoted, who gets banned Right across this, and you'll notice 1 large social media company has recently changed hands and has implemented a different kind of set of trust and safety. All of a sudden, a different kind of boycott movement has all of a sudden started to work that wasn't working before that. And and another kind of boycott movement is not working as well anymore. And so there's inter like, for sure, there's an intermediation happening. Like, look.[1:03:57] Marc Andreessen: The the stuff that's happening in the world today is being intermediated through social media because social media is the defining media of our time. But there are people who know how to do this and and and do this for a living. So so no. I I very much view this as a, I I view very much the, like, cancellation wave, like, this whole thing. It's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's an elite phenomenon.[1:04:15] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. And when it appears to be a grassroots thing, it's it's it's either grassroots among the elites, which, know, it's it's possible because there's, you know, fairly large number of people who are, like, signed up for that, you know, that particular crusade. But there's also a lot of astroturfing that's taking place inside that. The question is, okay. At what point does the population at large get pulled into this?[1:04:32] Marc Andreessen: And and maybe that maybe there are movements at certain points in time where they do get pulled in and then maybe later they get solution. And so then there's some question there. And then there's another question of, like, well, if the population at large is gonna decide what these movements are, are they gonna be the same movements as that the elites want? You know, the elites how are the elites gonna react when the population actually, like, fully expresses itself? Right?[1:04:51] Marc Andreessen: And so there's and like I said, there's a feedback loop between these the more extreme elites get. They tend to push the population to more extreme views on the other side and vice versa. So it ping ping pongs back and forth. And so, yeah, this is yeah. This is our world.[1:05:02] Andrew Huberman: Yep. This explains a lot. Yeah. I wanna make sure that I[1:05:06] Marc Andreessen: Matt, Tayebi so that Mike, Schallenberger, Matt Tayebi, a bunch of these guys I've done a lot of work. The the the just if you just look at it, it was called the misinformation industrial complex. Mhmm. You'll find a network of money and power that is really quite amazing.[1:05:18] Andrew Huberman: I've seen, more and more Shellenberger showing up. Right?[1:05:22] Marc Andreessen: And he's just looking. So on this stuff, he and he and Taipei there, and they're just they're literally just like tracking money.[1:05:27] Speaker 2: Mhmm. I it's[1:05:27] Marc Andreessen: just like it's it's very clear how the money flows, including, like, a remarkable amount of money out of the government, you know, which is, of course, like, in theory, very concerning.[1:05:35] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting.[1:05:36] Marc Andreessen: The government should not be funding programs that take away people's constitutional rights, and yet somehow that is what's been happening.[1:05:44] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting.[1:05:45] Marc Andreessen: Yes.[1:05:46] Andrew Huberman: I wanna make sure that I hear your ideas about why the decline in confidence in institutions and is not necessarily problematic. Is this going to be a total destruction and burning down of the forest that will lead to new life? Is that your view?[1:06:02] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Well, so this this is the thing. And and look, there's a question if you're there's a couple questions in here, which is looks like how how bad is it really? Like, how bad are they? Right?[1:06:11] Marc Andreessen: And I I, you know, and I think they're pretty bad. A lot of them are pretty actually bad. And so so so that's 1 big question. And then, yeah, the other question is, like, okay. If an institution has gone bad or a group of elites gone bad, like, can can it's this wonderful word reform.[1:06:24] Marc Andreessen: Right? Can can can they be reformed? And everybody always wants to reform everything, and yet somehow, like, nothing ever Whatever gets reformed. Right? And so people are trying to reform, you know, housing policy in the Bay Area for decades, and, you know, we're not building.[1:06:35] Marc Andreessen: We're building fewer houses than ever before. So somehow reform movements seem to lead to more Just just just more bad stuff. But, anyway yeah. So if you have an existing institution, can it be reformed? Can it be fixed from the inside?[1:06:44] Marc Andreessen: You know, like what's happening in universities. Like, there's a lot of there are professors at Stanford as an example who very much that they can fix Stanford. Like, I I don't know what you think. It doesn't seem like it's going in productive directions right now.[1:06:56] Andrew Huberman: Well, I mean, there are many things about Stanford that function extremely well. I mean, it's a big institution. It's certainly got its issues like any other place. They're also my employer. Mark's giving me some interesting looks.[1:07:06] Andrew Huberman: He wants me to get a little more vocal here. No.[1:07:08] Marc Andreessen: No. You don't have to.[1:07:09] Andrew Huberman: No. No. I I mean, I think that You didn't mean to put[1:07:11] Marc Andreessen: you on the spot.[1:07:11] Andrew Huberman: I mean, one of the things about being a researcher at a big institution like Stanford is well, first of all, it meets the criteria that you described before. You know, you look to the left, you look to the right, or anywhere Above or below you, and you have excellence. Right? I mean, I've got a Nobel Prize winner below me whose daddy also won a Nobel Prize, and There is scientific offspring is likely to win. I mean, you it it inspires you to do bigger things than, than 1 ordinarily would no matter what.[1:07:36] Andrew Huberman: So there's that, and that's great, and that persists. There's all the, bureaucratic red tape about trying to get things done and how to implement decisions is very hard, And there are a lot of reasons for that. And then, of course, there are the things that, you know, many people are aware of are there are, public accusations about people in positions a great leadership, and that's getting played out. And it's and the whole thing becomes kind of overwhelming and a little bit opaque when you're just trying to, Like, run your lab or live your life. And so I think one of the reasons for, this lack of reform that you're referring to[1:08:07] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm.[1:08:07] Andrew Huberman: Is because, there's no position of reformer. Right? So deans are dealing with a lot of issues. Provosts are dealing with a lot of issues. Presidents are dealing with a lot of issues and and then some, in some cases.[1:08:20] Andrew Huberman: And so, you know, we don't have a dedicated role of reformer. Someone to go in and say, listen. There there's just a lot of fat on this, and we need to trim it, or we need to Create this or do that. There's a there just isn't a system to do that, and that's, I think, in part because, universities are are built on old systems and they're you know, it's like Build it's like the New York subway. Like, this is still it's amazing.[1:08:41] Andrew Huberman: It still works as well as it does, and yet it's got a ton of problems also. Yeah.[1:08:45] Marc Andreessen: Well, look. So so so the point the point we could we could debate the the university specifically. But the the the point is, like, look. If you do think institutions are going bad, then you have to make it number 1, you have to figure out if you think institutions are going The population largely does think that. Mhmm.[1:08:56] Marc Andreessen: And then at the very least, the people who run institutions ought to really think hard about what that means.[1:09:00] Andrew Huberman: But people still strive To go to these places and I still hear from people who, like, for instance, did not go to college or talking about how a university degree is useless. They'll tell you how proud they are that their son or daughter is going to Stanford or is going to UCLA or is going to or banish champagne. I mean, it's almost like To me, that's always the most, you know, shocking contradiction is like, yeah, like, these institutions don't matter, but then when people wanna hold up a card that says why their kid is great Right. It's it's not about how many push ups they can do or that they started their own business most of the time. It's they're going to this university, and I think, well, what's going on here?[1:09:35] Marc Andreessen: So think the median voter in the United States can have their kid go to Stanford?[1:09:38] Andrew Huberman: No. No. No. And and and Do you[1:09:40] Marc Andreessen: think the median voter in the United States could have their kid admitted to Stanford even with perfect SAT?[1:09:45] Andrew Huberman: No. No. No. You're We're it in this day and age, the competition is so fierce that it requires more.[1:09:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So, like so first of all, again, like, we're we're dealing here yes. We're dealing with there with a small number of very elite institutions. People may admire them or not. Most people have no connectivity to them whatsoever.[1:10:02] Marc Andreessen: In the statistics, in the polling, universities are not doing well. Know, the the population at law yeah. They may have fantasies about their kid going to Stanford, but, like, the reality of it is they have a very, very, say, collapsing view of these institutions. So so anyway, so this this actually goes straight to the the question of alternatives then. Right?[1:10:17] Marc Andreessen: Which is, like, okay. If you believe that there's collapsing faith in the institutions, if you believe that it is merit, at least in some ways, if you believe that reform is effectively impossible, then you are faced would would and we could debate each of those, but, like, the population at large seems to believe a lot of that. Then there's a question of, like, okay. Like, can can it be replaced? And if so, like, are you better off replacing these things, basically, while the old thing still exist, or do you actually need to, basically, the field to be able to have a new thing exist.[1:10:43] Marc Andreessen: The universities are a great case study of this because of the student because of how student loans work. Right? And the and the way student loans work is to To be able to be a unit to be to be an actual competitive university and compete, you need to have access to federal student lending. Because if you don't, everybody has to pay out It's completely out of reach for anybody other than, you know, a certain class of either extremely rich or foreign students. So you need access to federal student loan facility.[1:11:04] Marc Andreessen: To get access to federal student loan facility, you need to Accredited university. Guess who runs the accreditation council?[1:11:11] Andrew Huberman: I don't know.[1:11:12] Marc Andreessen: The existing universities. Right? So it's a 0. 0. Right?[1:11:25] Marc Andreessen: And so as long as that system is in place and as long as they have the government wired the way that they do as long as they control who gets access to federal student loan funding, like, of course, there's not gonna be any competition. Right? Of course, there can't be a new institution that's gonna be able to get to scale. Like, it's not possible. And so if you actually wanted to create a new system that was better in the you know, I would argue dozens or hundreds of ways that could obviously be better if you're starting today.[1:11:49] Marc Andreessen: It probably can't be done as long as the existing institutions are actually intact. And and this is my counter against to to Martin, which is like, yeah. We look. We're we we we if we're gonna tear down the old, there may be a period of disruption before we get to the new, but we're never gonna get to the new if we don't turn on the old.[1:12:02] Andrew Huberman: When you say counter to Martin, you're talking about the author of Revolt of the[1:12:05] Marc Andreessen: Pauline? Yeah. Martin Gurry. Yeah. What Martin Gurry says is He he said, basically, what Martin says Martin says is as follows.[1:12:11] Marc Andreessen: The elites deserve contempt, but the only thing worse than these elites that deserve contempt would be no elites at all. Right? And and and because and he basically says on the other side on the other side of the destruction of the elites and the institutions is is nihilism. Basically left with nothing. And then, by the way, there is a nihilistic streak.[1:12:28] Marc Andreessen: I mean, there's a nihilistic streak in the in the culture and the politics today. There are people who basically would just say, yeah. Just tear tear the whole system down. Right. And they're they're without any particular plan for for what follows.[1:12:37] Marc Andreessen: And so you you I I think he he makes a good point and that you wanna be careful that you actually have a plan on the other side that you think is actually achievable. But but the the but, again, the counterargument to that is if you're not willing to actually tear down the old, you're not gonna get to the new. Now What's interesting, of course, is this is what happens everyday in business. Right? So, like, the entire way like, how do how do you know that the capitalist system works?[1:12:59] Marc Andreessen: The way that you know is that the old companies, when they're no longer, like, the best at what they do, they get torn down and then they ultimately die and they get replaced by better companies.[1:13:07] Andrew Huberman: I haven't seen a Sears in a while.[1:13:09] Marc Andreessen: Exactly. Right? And we know what's but so interesting is we know in in capitalism and a market economy, we know that that's the sign of health. Right. That that's the sign of how the system is working properly.[1:13:19] Marc Andreessen: Right? And in fact, we get actually judged by antitrust authorities in the government on that basis. Right? It's like the the best defense against antitrust charges is no. People are, like, coming to kill us and they're doing, like, a really good job of it.[1:13:29] Marc Andreessen: Like, that that that's how we know we're doing our job. And in fact, in business, we are Specifically, it is specifically illegal for companies in the same industry to get together and plot and conspire and plan and have things like these accreditation bureaus. Like, we would get if if I created the equivalent in my companies of the kind of accreditation bureau that the universities have, I'd get straight to federal prison. And a trust violation Sherman Act straight to prison. People have been sent to prison for that.[1:13:50] Marc Andreessen: So in the business world, we know that you want everything subject to market competition. We we know that you want creative destruction. We know that you want replacement of the old with with superior new. Just once we get outside the business, we're like, oh, we don't want any of that. We want we want basically stagnation and log rolling.[1:14:05] Marc Andreessen: Right? And inside you know, and basically, you know, institutional, you know, you know, incestuous, like, you know, entanglements and conflicts of interest, you know, as far as the eye can see. And then we're surprised by the results.[1:14:14] Andrew Huberman: So let's play it out, as a bit of a thought experiment. So let's say that, one small Banding together of people who wanna start a new university where free exchange of open ideas, where unless somebody has, You know, egregious behavior, violent behavior, you know, truly sexually inappropriate behavior against somebody, you know, that committing a crime. Right? They're allowed to be there. They're allowed to be a student or a faculty member or administrator.[1:14:43] Andrew Huberman: And let's just say this, accreditation bureau allowed student loans for this particular university or let's say that there was an independent source of funding for that university such that students could just apply there. They didn't need to be part of this, You know, this elite accredited group, which is it sounds very mafia like, frankly. Not necessarily violent, but certainly coercive in this in in, in the way that it walls people out. Let's say that then there were 20 or 30 of those or 40 of those. Do you think that over time, that model would overtake the the existing model?[1:15:17] Marc Andreessen: Isn't it interesting that those don't exist? Right. Remember the Sherlock Holmes, The Dog That Didn't Bark? It[1:15:24] Andrew Huberman: is interesting. Those don't exist.[1:15:26] Marc Andreessen: Right. So there's there's 2 possibilities. 1 is, like, nobody wants that, which I don't believe.[1:15:31] Andrew Huberman: And[1:15:31] Marc Andreessen: then the other is, like, the system is wired in a way that will just simply not allow it. Mhmm. Right? And you you did a hypothetical in which the system would allow it. And I I my response[1:15:39] Speaker 2: that is no course. The system won't[1:15:40] Andrew Huberman: allow that. Or the people that band togethers, you know, have enough money or or or get enough resources to say, look. We can, you know, we can afford to give loans to, you know, 10,000 students per year. You know, 10,000 isn't a trivial number when thinking about the size of a university. And,[1:15:52] Marc Andreessen: And, you[1:15:53] Andrew Huberman: know, they most of them hopefully will graduate in 4 years, and there'll be a a turnover. And, do you think that the Great future innovators would tend to orient toward that model, more than they currently do toward the traditional model. I mean, what I'm trying to get back to here is how do you think that the current model thwarts innovation, as well as maybe some ways that it still supports innovation? Certainly, cancellation and the the risk of cancellation from the way that we framed it earlier is going to, discourage risk takers, of the category of risk takers that take risk in every every domain that really like to fly close to the sun and sometimes into the sun. Right.[1:16:33] Marc Andreessen: Or are doing research that is just not politically. Right.[1:16:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Looking into issues that How old You're right. That, that, you know, we can't even talk about on this podcast probably without without causing a distraction of what we're actually trying to talk about.[1:16:46] Marc Andreessen: That gives up the whole game right[1:16:47] Andrew Huberman: there. Exactly. Yeah. So the, you know, I keep a file, and it's a written file, because I'm afraid to put it in into electronic form of all the things that I'm afraid to talk about publicly. Yeah.[1:16:58] Andrew Huberman: Because I come from a lineage of advisers where all 3 died young, and I figure if nothing else, I'll die, and then, you know, I'll make it into the world. And, you know, when, Let's say 5, 10 years, 20 years. And, if not, you know, I know with certainty I'm gonna die at some point, and then we'll we'll see where all those issues stand. In any event,[1:17:14] Marc Andreessen: Is that list getting longer over time or shorter?[1:17:16] Andrew Huberman: Oh, it's definitely getting longer.[1:17:17] Marc Andreessen: Isn't that interesting?[1:17:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's get it's getting much longer. I mean, There are just so many issues that I would love to explore on this podcast with experts and, that I can't explore Just be even if I had a panel of them[1:17:32] Speaker 2: Yep.[1:17:33] Andrew Huberman: Because of the way that things get soundbited and segmented out and taken out of context, It's like the whole conversation is lost. And so, unfortunately, there are an immense number of equally interesting conversations, that I'm excited to have, but it is it is a little disturbing.[1:17:48] Marc Andreessen: Do you remember Lysenkoism? No. Oh, so, Lysenko. Famous, in the history of the Soviet Union, this is a famous thing. So there was a geneticist named Lysenko.[1:17:57] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.[1:17:58] Andrew Huberman: That's why it sounds familiar, but I'm not I'm not[1:18:05] Marc Andreessen: the field of genetics, the soviets did not approve the field of genetics of course, they believed in the creation of the new man and, you know, total equality, and genetics did not support that. And so if you were doing, like, traditional You were, you know, in a bit, you know, at the very least fired, if not if not killed. And so this guy, LaSenka, stood up and said, oh, I've got Marxist genetics. Right? I've got, like, a whole new field of genetics that It's politically compliant.[1:18:25] Marc Andreessen: And then they actually implemented that in the agriculture system of the Soviet Union. And it's it's the origin of one of the big reasons that the Soviet Union actually fell, which was they ultimately couldn't feed themselves.[1:18:34] Andrew Huberman: So create a new notion of biology as it relates to genetics.[1:18:37] Marc Andreessen: Politically correct. Biology. Right? And so then so and they they they not only created it, they taught it. They they mandated it, they required it, and then they implemented it in agriculture.[1:18:45] Marc Andreessen: Interesting. So so yeah. So it's it's I I never understood. There there was a bunch of things in history I never understood until the last decade, and that's one of them.[1:18:51] Andrew Huberman: Well, I censor myself at the level of deleting certain things, but I don't contort what I do talk about.[1:18:57] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.[1:18:57] Andrew Huberman: So I tend to like to play on, Lush open fields. Yeah. Just makes my life[1:19:03] Marc Andreessen: a lot better. This goes to the rot. This goes to the rot. And I'll come back to your question. But, like, this goes to the rot in the existing system, which is we we've and by the way, I'm no different.[1:19:09] Marc Andreessen: Like you. Like, I'm not I'm trying not to light myself on fire either. But, like, the the rot in the existing system and by system, I mean, the institutions and the elites. The the rot is that the set of things that are no longer I mean, that list is, like, obviously expanding over time. And, like, that's a real like, historically speaking, that doesn't end in good places.[1:19:27] Andrew Huberman: Is it is this group of a particular generation that we can look forward to the time when they eventually die off?[1:19:33] Marc Andreessen: It's 3rd of the boomers plus the millennials. So good we[1:19:35] Andrew Huberman: got a while.[1:19:36] Marc Andreessen: Good good news, bad news. Mean, Gen X is weird. Right? Gen I'm Gen Gen X. Gen X is weird because we we kinda slipped in the middle.[1:19:41] Marc Andreessen: We're we're kinda we we were kind of the, I don't like, I don't know how to describe it. We were the kind of nonpolitical generation, kind of sandwiched between the Boomers and the Millennials. Mhmm. Gen z is a very, oh, I think, open question right now, Which way they go, I could imagine them being actually, like, much more intense than the millennials. On all these issues, I can also imagine them reacting to the millennials and being far more open minded.[1:20:01] Marc Andreessen: Don't know which[1:20:02] Andrew Huberman: way it's gonna go yet.[1:20:03] Marc Andreessen: It's gonna go. Might be different groups of them.[1:20:05] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I'm Gen X also. I'm 47. You're[1:20:07] Marc Andreessen: 5050. Yeah. Right.[1:20:08] Andrew Huberman: So more or less same. So grew up with some John Hughes Films, and so where the the jocks and the hippies and the punks and the we're all divided. They were all segmented, but then it all sort of mish mashed together A few years later, and I think that had a lot to do with, like you said, the sort of apolitical[1:20:25] Speaker 2: Yeah.[1:20:26] Andrew Huberman: Aspect to Our generation If[1:20:27] Marc Andreessen: we just knew we the Gen X just knew the boomers were nuts. Right? Like, all the I mean, this is, like, the the the canonical right? The one of the great sitcoms of of of the era, It's Family Ties, right, with the character Michael p Keaton. Mhmm.[1:20:39] Marc Andreessen: And he was just like, this guy is just like, yeah. My boomer hippie parents are crazy. Like, I'm just gonna, like, go into business and, like, actually do something productive. Like, there there was something, like, iconic that character in in our culture. And, you know, people like me were like, obviously, you go into business.[1:20:50] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. You don't go into, like, political activism. And then, you know, it's just like, man, that came whipping back around with the next generation. So just to touch real quick on university thing. So look, there are people trying to do and I'm actually gonna do a thing this afternoon with the University of Boston, which is which is which is which is one of these.[1:21:03] Marc Andreessen: And so there are people trying to do new universities. You know, I I like I would say, it's certainly possible. I hope they succeed. I'm pulling for them. I I think it'd be great.[1:21:10] Marc Andreessen: I think it'd be great if there were a lot more of them.[1:21:12] Andrew Huberman: Who founded this University?[1:21:13] Marc Andreessen: This is a whole group of people. I don't wanna, freelance on that because I don't know originally who the idea was.[1:21:18] Andrew Huberman: University of Austin, not UT Austin.[1:21:20] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So this is not UT Austin. It's called it's called University of Austin or they call it I think it's u a t[1:21:25] Speaker 2: or[1:21:25] Marc Andreessen: what is it? UATX. Mhmm. And so, and there's a lot of very sharp people associated with it. And, then they're they're they're gonna try to very, very much exactly like what you're describing.[1:21:35] Marc Andreessen: They're gonna try to do a new one. I would just tell you, like, the wall of opposition that they're up against Profound. Right? And part of it is economic, which is can they ever get access to federal student lending? And I you know, I I hope that they can, but I've I've I've you know, it seems nearly inconceivable the way the system's rigged today.[1:21:51] Marc Andreessen: And then, you know, the other is just like they're gonna they they already have come under. I mean, any any anybody any anybody who publicly associates with them who is in traditional academia immediately gets on fire. Right? And there's, like, you know, cancellation campaigns. Like, so they're up against a wall of social ostracism.[1:22:04] Marc Andreessen: Wow. They're up against a wall of, you know, press attacks. Wow. They're up against a wall of, you know, people just, like, doing the thing, pouncing on any anytime anybody says anything, they're gonna try to, like, bring the place down.[1:22:14] Andrew Huberman: This reminds me of, like like, Jerry Springer episodes and Geraldo Rivera episodes where, you know, it's like if a teen listened to, you know, like Danzig or Marilyn Manson type music or Metallica that they were considered a devil worshipper. Oh, that's right. Like, we right. Now we just laugh. Right?[1:22:33] Andrew Huberman: We're like, that's crazy. Right? People listen to music with all sorts of lyrics and ideas and looks, and and, like, that's crazy. But, you know, there were People legitimately sent to prison, I think with the West Memphis three. Right?[1:22:46] Andrew Huberman: These kids out in West Memphis that looked different, acted different, were accused of murders that Eventually, it was, made clear they clearly didn't commit, but they were imprisoned because of the music they listened to. I mean, this sounds very similar to that. I remember seeing bumper stickers free the West Memphis 3, and I thought this was some crazy thing. You look into it, and this isn't, it's a little bit niche, but, I mean, these were real lives, and there was a active, witch hunt for people that looked different and acted different. And yet Now we're sort of in this inverted world where, on the one hand, we're all told that we can express ourselves however we want, but on the other hand, you can't get a bunch of people together to take classes where they learn biology and sociology and econ in Texas.[1:23:33] Andrew Huberman: Wild.[1:23:33] Marc Andreessen: Yes. Well, so the, you know, the simple explanation is it's this is Puritanism. Right? So this is the original American Puritanism That just, like, works itself out through the system in different ways at different times. You know, there's this phenomena there's a religious phenomenon in America called the the great awakenings.[1:23:47] Marc Andreessen: Is just there there there will be these periods in American history where there's basically religiosity fades, and then there will be the snapback effect where you'll have this, basically, this, you know, frenzy, Basically, of of religion. You know, in the old days, it would have been, you know, tent revivals and people speaking in tongues and all this stuff. And then in the modern world, it's it's, you know, it's of the form that that we're living through right now. And so, yeah, it's just basically these waves of sort of American religious. And, you know, remember, like, religion in our Time.[1:24:12] Marc Andreessen: Religious impulses in our time don't get yeah. Because we live in we live in more advanced times. Right? We live in scientifically informed times. And so religious impulses in our time don't show up as overtly religious.[1:24:21] Marc Andreessen: Right. They show up in a secularized form. Mhmm. Right? Which, of course, conveniently is is is therefore not subject to the first amendment, separation of church and state.[1:24:28] Marc Andreessen: Right? As long as the church is secular, There's no problem. Right? And so but but we're we're acting out these kind of religious scripts over and over again, and we're in the middle of another religious frenzy.[1:24:37] Andrew Huberman: There's a phrase that I hear a lot, And, I don't necessarily believe it, but I want your thoughts on it, which is the pendulum always swings back.[1:24:46] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Not quite.[1:24:47] Andrew Huberman: Well, so that's how I feel too because, you know, I'll take Boy, that would[1:24:51] Marc Andreessen: be great.[1:24:51] Andrew Huberman: Take any number of things that we've talked about, and, you know, gosh, it's so crazy, you know, the The way things have have gone with institutions or it's so crazy the way things have gone with social media or it's so crazy, fill in the blank. And people will say, well, know, the pendulum always swings back. Like like the like it's the stock market or something.[1:25:10] Marc Andreessen: Right.[1:25:10] Andrew Huberman: You know, after every crash, there'll be an eventual boom Right. And vice versa.[1:25:15] Marc Andreessen: By the way, that's not true either. Right? Right. Most most stock markets, we have, of course, survivorship, but it's all survivorship. Everything is survivor.[1:25:20] Marc Andreessen: It's all everything you just said is obviously survivorship bias. Right? So If you look globally, most stock markets over time crash and burn and never recover. The American stock market doesn't always recover.[1:25:30] Andrew Huberman: Right. I was referring to[1:25:31] Marc Andreessen: the American stock market. Right? Globally. But the reason everybody refers to the American stock market is because it's the one that doesn't do that. The other 200 or whatever, right, that crash and burn and never recover.[1:25:40] Marc Andreessen: Let's go check-in on the, you know, on Argentina stock market right now. Like, I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.[1:25:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. My father is Argentine and immigrated to the US in 19 sixties, so he would Definitely agree with you.[1:25:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Like, it doesn't come it doesn't come you know? Like, when when when their stocks crash, they don't come back. So and then, you know, like, saying, oh, ism, like, the Soviet Union never recovered from, like, saying, oh, ism. It never came back.[1:26:00] Marc Andreessen: It led to the end of the country. You know? Literally, the things that took down the Soviet Union were oil and and wheat. The the wheat thing, you can trace the crisis back to Lysenkoism. And so, yeah.[1:26:09] Marc Andreessen: No. Look. I it it and no one swings back is true only in the cases where the pen and no one swings back. Everybody just conveniently forgets all the other circumstances where that doesn't happen. One of the things people you see this in business also.[1:26:21] Marc Andreessen: People have a really hard time confronting really bad news.[1:26:25] Speaker 2: I don't[1:26:25] Marc Andreessen: know if you've noticed that. I think every doctor who's listening right now is like, yeah. No shit. But, like like, there are situate have you seen business? There are situations that It's a Star Trek.[1:26:35] Marc Andreessen: Remember, Star Trek, the Kobayashi Maru, simulator. Right? So the big lesson to become a Star Trek captain is you had to go through the simulation called the Kobayashi Maru, and the point was It was the only way to actually get through. And then there was a debate whether to fire him or make him a captain, so they made him a captain. And, like, you know, the problem is in real life, like, we we you you do get the Kobayashi on a regular basis.[1:27:03] Marc Andreessen: Like, there are actual no win situations that you can't work your way out of. And as a leader, you can't ever cop to that. Right? Because you have to, like, carry thinks forward, and you have to look for every every possible choice you can. But, like, every once in a while, you do run into a situation where it's really not recoverable.[1:27:16] Marc Andreessen: And at least I found people just, like, cannot cope with that. And so and so what happens is they basically then they they basically just, like, exclude it from their memory that it ever happened.[1:27:25] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you brought up simulators because I wanna make sure that we talk about, the new and emerging landscape of AI, artificial intelligence. Yeah. And I could try and smooth our Conversation about moment ago, with the this one, by creating some clever segue, but I'm not going to. Except I'm going to ask, Is there a possibility that AI is going to remedy some of what we're talking about? Let's make sure that we earmark that discussion a little bit later.[1:27:55] Marc Andreessen: Sure.[1:27:56] Andrew Huberman: But first off, because some of, the listeners of this podcast might not be as familiar with AI as perhaps they should be. We've all heard about artificial intelligence. People hear about machine learning, etcetera, but, it'd be great if you could define for us what AI is. People almost immediately hear AI and think, okay. Robot's taking over.[1:28:17] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna wake up, and I'm gonna be, you know, Strapped to the bed, and my organs are gonna be pulled out of me. The robots are gonna be in my bank account. They're gonna kill all my children and, and dystopia, for most. Clearly, that's not the way it's gonna go. If you believe that machines can augment human intelligence, and human intelligence is a good thing.[1:28:41] Andrew Huberman: So, Tell us what AI is and, where you think it can take us both good and bad.[1:28:49] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So So so there was a big debate when the computer was first invented, which is in the 19 thirties, 19 forties. This people like Alan Turing and John von Neumann and these people. And the big debate at the time, was because they knew they wanted to build computers. They they had the basic idea.[1:29:04] Marc Andreessen: And, you know, there had been, like, calculating machines before that, and there had been, like, have been these looms that you basically program to punch cards. And so there was, like, a there was a prehistory to computers that had to do with building sort of increasingly complex calculating machines. They they were kind of on a track, but they knew they were gonna be able to build, they call it, general purpose computer that could basically, you could program in the way that you program computers today. But they had a big debate early on, which is should the fundamental architecture of the computer be based on either, a, like, calculating machines, Like, cash registers and looms and, right, and and other things like that. Or should it be based on a model of the human brain?[1:29:36] Marc Andreessen: And they actually had this idea of computer's model on the human brain back then. And this was this concept of so called neural networks. And it's it's actually fairly astonishing from a from a research standpoint. The original paper on neural networks actually was published in 1943. Right.[1:29:50] Marc Andreessen: So so so they didn't have our level of neuroscience, but, like, they actually knew about the neuron, and they actually had a theory of, like, neurons interconnecting and synapses and information processing in the brain even even even back then. And a lot of people at the time basically said, you know what? We should basically have the computer from the start bit model after the human brain because, like, if we could if the computer could do everything that brain can do, like, that would be the best possible general purpose computer. And then you could have it do jobs, and you could have it, you know, create art, and you could have it do all kinds of things like humans can do. It turns out that didn't happen, in our world.[1:30:20] Marc Andreessen: What happened instead was the industry went in the other direction. It went basically in the model of the calculating machine or the cash register. And I I think practically speaking, that kinda had to be the case because that was actually the technology that was was practical at the time. But but that's the path. So what what we all have experiences with up to and including the iPhone in our pocket is computers built on that, basically, calculating machine model, not the human brain model.[1:30:42] Marc Andreessen: And so what that means is computers as we have come to understand them, that, you know, they're basically like, you know, mathematical savants, you know, at best. Right. So they're, like, they're really good at, like, you know, doing lots of mathematical calculations. They're really good at executing these extremely detailed computer programs. They're hyperliteral.[1:30:59] Marc Andreessen: One of the things you learn early when you're a programmer is as a pro as the human programmer, you have to get every single instruction you give the correct because it will do exactly what you tell it to do. And and and bugs in computer programs are always a mistake on the part of the programmer.[1:31:12] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[1:31:12] Marc Andreessen: You never blame the computer. You always blame The the programmer because that that that's the nature of the thing that you're dealing with.[1:31:17] Andrew Huberman: One down score off in the whole thing.[1:31:19] Marc Andreessen: Yes. Yeah. And it's the it's the programmer's fault. And[1:31:22] Speaker 2: if you[1:31:22] Marc Andreessen: talk to any programmer, they'll agree with be like, yeah. If there's a problem, it's it's my fault. I I I did it. I I can't blame the computer. The computer has no judgment.[1:31:28] Marc Andreessen: It has no ability to interpret, synthesize, You know, under develop an independent understanding of anything. It's just it's literally just doing what I tell it to do step by step. So so for 80 years, we've had this just, You know, with this very kinda hyper literal, you know, kind of kind of model computers, these are called, technically, these are what are called Von Neumann machines based after the mathematician John Von Neumann. They run-in that way. And, like, they've been very successful and very important, and our world has been shaped by them.[1:31:52] Marc Andreessen: But there was always this other idea out there, which is, okay, how about a completely different approach, which is based different approach, which is based based much more on how the human brain operates, or or at least our our our kind of best understanding of how the human brain operates. Right? Because those aren't the same thing. It basically says, okay. What what if you could have a computer?[1:32:07] Marc Andreessen: Instead of being hyper literal, what if you could have it actually be conceptual, right, and creative and able to synthesize information, Right? And able to draw judgments and able to, you know, behave in, you know, in ways that are not deterministic but are rather, you know, Creative. Right? And and so and and and and the and the applications for this, of course, are endless. And so, for example, the self driving car, The only way that you can make a you you you cannot program a computer with rules to make it a self driving car.[1:32:35] Marc Andreessen: You have to do what Tesla and Waymo and these other companies have done now. You have to use AI. Right. You have to use this other architecture, and you have to basically teach them how to recognize objects in images at high speeds the same way basically, the same way the human brain does. And so those are those are so called neural networks running inside.[1:32:49] Andrew Huberman: So, essentially, let the machine operate based on priors. You know, we we almost clipped a, a boulder going up this Particular drive, and so, therefore, this shape that previously the machine didn't recognize as a boulder, it now introduces to its catalog of boulders. Is that is that Yeah.[1:33:06] Marc Andreessen: Well, good good good example or let's even it may even even starker for self driving car. There's something in the road. Is it a small child or a or a plastic shopping bag being blown by the wind? Very important difference. Mhmm.[1:33:17] Marc Andreessen: If it's a shopping bag, you you definitely wanna go straight through it because if you deviate off course, you might, you know, hit you know, you're gonna make a fast, know, it's the same it's the same challenge we have when we're driving. Like, you don't you don't wanna swerve over a shopping bag because you might have something that you didn't see on the side. If it's a small child, for sure you wanna swerve. Right? And so but it's very but, like, in in that moment and, you know, small children come in different, like, shapes and descriptions and are wearing different kinds of clothes.[1:33:38] Andrew Huberman: They might tumble onto the road the same way a bag would tumble[1:33:41] Marc Andreessen: by the way, they might not be you know, they might be wearing a Halloween mask. Right? So the face they might not have a recognizable human face. Right? Or it might or it might be a kid with, you know, one leg.[1:33:50] Marc Andreessen: Right? You definitely wanna not hit those. Right? Like, so there that so you you can't this is what basically we figured out is you can't Apply the rules based approach of a Von Neumann machine to basically real life and expect the computer to be in any way understanding or resilient to change it to basically things happening in real life. And is why there's always been such a stark divide between what the machine can do and what the and and what the human can do.[1:34:12] Marc Andreessen: And so, basically, what's happened is in the last decade, that type of computer, the neural network based computer has started to actually work. It started to work actually first interestingly in vision. Mhmm. Recognizing objects and images, which is why the self driving car is starting to[1:34:24] Andrew Huberman: Face recognition.[1:34:25] Marc Andreessen: Face recognition. I mean,[1:34:26] Andrew Huberman: when I was started off in visual neuroscience, which is really my original home, in neuroscience, the idea that a computer Where a camera could do face recognition better than a human was, like, a very low probability event, based on the technology we had at the time. Based on the understanding of the face recognition cells and the fusiform gyrus. Now you would be smartest to put all your money on the machine.[1:34:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.[1:34:51] Andrew Huberman: You know, you wanna find faces in airports even with masks on and, you know, at profile versus straight on. Machines can do it far better than Most all people I mean, they're the super recognizers, but even they can't match the best machines. Now 10 years ago, What I just said was the exact reverse. Right. That's right.[1:35:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:35:10] Marc Andreessen: Right. So fake faces, handwriting, right, and then voice. Right. Being able to understand voice. Like, if if you use just as a user, if you use Google Docs, it has a built in voice transcription.[1:35:19] Marc Andreessen: It's sort of the best industry leading kind of voice transcription. You use voice transcription in Google Docs, it's breathtakingly good. You you just speak into it, and it just, like, types what you're what you're saying.[1:35:28] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's good because in my phone, every once in a while, I'll say I need pick up a few things, and it'll say, I need to pick up a few thongs. And so Well Apple needs to get on board, whatever the voice recognition is that Google's using.[1:35:39] Marc Andreessen: Maybe it knows you better than you think. So so That[1:35:43] Andrew Huberman: was not the topic I was avoiding discussing. You know?[1:35:45] Marc Andreessen: No. So that's on the list. Right? That's on your your list. So, so, look, there there's actually this there's there's a reason actually why Google's so good and Apple is not right now with that kind of thing and it actually goes to actually the it's actually an ideological thing of all of all things.[1:35:59] Marc Andreessen: Apple does not permit pooling of data, for any purpose, including training AI, whereas Google does. And and Apple's just, like, stake their brand on privacy and among that is sort of a pledge that they don't, like, pull your data. And so all of Apple's AI is, like, AI that has to happen, like, locally on your phone, whereas Google's AI can happen in the cloud. Right? It can happen across pool data.[1:36:19] Marc Andreessen: Now by the way, some people think that that's bad because they think pooling data is bad. But but that that's an example of the shift that's happening in the industry right now, as you have the separation between the people who are embracing the new way of training AIs and the people who basically, for whatever reason, are not.[1:36:32] Andrew Huberman: You excuse me. You you say that some people think it's bad of privacy issues, or they think it's bad because of the, reduced functionality of that AI.[1:36:40] Marc Andreessen: Oh, no. So you're you're definitely gonna get so so, So there's 3 reasons AIs have started to work. One of them is just simply larger datasets, larger amounts of data. So so so, specifically, the reason why objects and images are now the reason machines are now better than humans at recognizing objects images or recognizing faces is because modern facial recognition AIs are trained across all photos on the Internet of people. Billions and billions and billions of photos.[1:37:04] Marc Andreessen: Right? An unlimited number of photos of people on the Internet. Attempts to train facial recognition systems 10 or 20 years ago, They'd be trained on, you know, thousands or tens of thousands of photos.[1:37:12] Andrew Huberman: So the input data is simply much more vast.[1:37:15] Marc Andreessen: Much larger. And this is the reason to get to the conclusion on this. The this is the reason why chat gpt works so is try GPT. One of the reasons try GPT works so well is it's trained on the entire Internet of text. And the entire Internet of text was not something that was available for you train an AI on until it came to actually exist itself, which is new in the last, you know,[1:37:33] Andrew Huberman: basically decade. So in the case of face recognition, I could see how having a much larger input data set Would be beneficial if the goal is to recognize Marc Andreessen's face because you are looking for signal to noise against everything else. Right? But in the case of ChatGPT, When you're pulling all text on the Internet and you ask chat GPT to say, construct a paragraph about, Marc Andreessen's prediction of the future of human beings over the next 10 years, and the, likely to be most successful industries. You can chat JPT that.[1:38:06] Andrew Huberman: If it's pulling across all text, how does it know what is authentically Marc Andreessen's text? Because in the case of face recognition, you have a, you've got a standard to work from, a a verified image versus everything else. In the case of text, you have to make sure that what you're starting with is verified text From your mouth. So, which makes sense if it's coming from video, but then if that video is, deep faked, all of a sudden, what's True. Your your your valid Marc Andreessen is of question, and then everything chat GPT is producing that is then of question.[1:38:45] Marc Andreessen: Right. So I would say there's a before and after thing here. There's, like, a before there's, like, a before chat gpt and after gpt question. Right? Because the existence of gpt itself chain changes Changes the the answer.[1:38:55] Marc Andreessen: So before chat gpt, so the reason the version you're using today is trained on data up till September 2021 is what they're they're cut off with the training. So up till September 2021, and then most of that was written by people under their own names. Some of it wasn't, but a lot but of it was. And and and why do you know it's for me is because it was published in a magazine under my name or it's a podcast transcript and it's it's under my name. And and generally speaking, if you just did a search on, what are things Marc Andreessen has written and said, 90 plus percent of that would be would be correct.[1:39:23] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. And there look. Somebody might have written a fake, you know, parody article or something like that, but, like, Not that many people were spending that much time writing, like, fake articles about, like, things that I said right now.[1:39:32] Andrew Huberman: So many people can pretend to be you.[1:39:34] Marc Andreessen: Exactly. Right. And so generally you could you can kinda get your arms around the idea that there's a corpus of material associated with me or, by the way, same thing with you. There's a corpus of of YouTube transcripts and other your your academic papers and talks you've given. Can kinda get your hands around that.[1:39:45] Marc Andreessen: And that's that's how these systems are trained. They they they take all that data collectively. They put it in there. And and that's why this works as well as it does. And that's why if you ask chat GPT to Speak or write like me or like you or like, you know, somebody else.[1:39:56] Marc Andreessen: It it will actually generally do a really good job because it it has that it has all of our prior, text in its in its training data. That's it. From here on out, this gets harder. And, of course, the reason this gets harder is because now we have AI that can create text. We have AI that can create text at industrial scale.[1:40:12] Andrew Huberman: Right? Is it watermarked as AI generated text?[1:40:14] Marc Andreessen: No. No. No. No.[1:40:15] Andrew Huberman: Not how hard would it be to do that?[1:40:16] Marc Andreessen: I think it's impossible. I I think it's impossible. There are people who are trying to do that. Is a hot topic in the classroom. I was talking to a friend who's got, like, a 14 year old kid in a in a in a class, and there's, like, these recurring scandals.[1:40:25] Marc Andreessen: It's like every kid in the class is using ChatGPT to, like, write their essays to help them write their essays. And then the, the the teacher is using one of there's a tool that you can use that it purports to be able to tell you, you know, whether something was written by Chegg GPT, but it's, like, only right, like, 60% of the time. And so there was this case where the student wrote an essay where their parents sat and watched them write the essay, And then they submitted it, and this tool got the conclusion incorrect. And then the student feels outraged because he got unfairly cheated, but the teacher is like, well, you're all using the tool. It turns out there's another tool that basically you feed in text and it actually, it sort of, it's it's a it's called they they call it a summarizer.[1:41:02] Marc Andreessen: What it really is is it's a cheating mechanism to To basically, just shuffle the words around enough so that it sheds whatever characteristics were associated with AI. So there's like a an arms race going on in educational settings right now around this exact question. I don't I don't think it's possible to do there are people working on the watermark. I don't think it's possible to do the watermarking, and I think it's just kind of obvious why it's not possible to do that, which is you can just read the output for yourself. It's it's really good.[1:41:25] Marc Andreessen: How are you actually gonna tell the difference between that and something that a real person wrote? Mhmm. And then by the way, you can also ask JetGPT to write in different styles. Right? So you can tell it, like, you know, right in the style of a 15 year old.[1:41:36] Marc Andreessen: Right? You can tell it to write in the style of, you know, a non native English speaker. Right? Or if you're a non native English speaker, you can tell it to write in the style of Bigger. Native English speaker.[1:41:44] Marc Andreessen: Right? And so it it the tool itself will help you evade. So I I I I don't think that I there's a lot of people who are gonna want to distinguish, right, quote real versus fake. I I think those days are I think those days are over.[1:41:56] Andrew Huberman: Genie's out of the bottle.[1:41:57] Marc Andreessen: Genie's completely out of the bottle. And and by the and by the way, I actually think this ahead. This doesn't map to this doesn't map to my worldview of how we use this technology anyway, which which we can come back to. So there's that. So so so is that.[1:42:08] Marc Andreessen: So and and then there's the problem, therefore, of, like, the so called deep fake problem. So then there's the problem of, like, deliberate, basically, manipulation. And that's, like, you know, one of your one of one of your many enemies, one of your increasingly faultless of enemies Yeah. Like mine, Who basically is like, wow. I know how I'm gonna get him.[1:42:24] Marc Andreessen: Right? I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna create so I'm gonna I'm gonna use it to create something that looks like a Hebrewman transcript, and I'm gonna have him say all things now. Or a[1:42:31] Andrew Huberman: video.[1:42:31] Marc Andreessen: Or a video or a video.[1:42:32] Andrew Huberman: I mean, Joe Rogan and I were deep faked in a video. I don't wanna flag people to it. I won't so I won't talk about what it was about, but where it for all the world, looked like a conversation that we were having, and we never had that specific conversation. Yeah.[1:42:48] Marc Andreessen: That's right. So that's gonna happen for sure. And so there there's gonna so what there's gonna need to be is there's need to be basically registries where, basically, you you in like, in your case, you will you will, submit your legitimate, content into a registry under your unique cryptographic key. Right? And then, basically, there will be a way to check against that registry to see whether the real thing, and I think this needs to be done for for sure for public figures.[1:43:08] Marc Andreessen: It needs to be done for politicians. It needs to be done for, you know, music.[1:43:11] Andrew Huberman: What about taking what's already out there and Being able to authenticate it or not. In the same way that, many times per week, I get asked, is this your account? About some a direct message that somebody got on Instagram, and I Always tell them, look. I only have the 1 account. Yeah.[1:43:26] Andrew Huberman: This one verified account. Although now with the advent of pay to play verification, Makes it a little less potent as a, you know, security blanket for, knowing if it's not this account, you know, then it's not me. But in any case, these Accounts pop up all the time pretending to be me, and I'm I'm, you know, relatively low on the on the scale. Not not, not low, but relatively low on the scale to say, like a, you know, like a Beyonce or something like that who has, you know, hundreds of millions of followers. So, is there a system in mind where People could go in and and verify text, you know, click yes or no.[1:44:01] Andrew Huberman: This is me. This is not me. And even there, there's the opportunity for people to fudge, To eliminate things about themselves that they don't want out there by saying, no. That's not me. It wasn't, I didn't actually say that or create that.[1:44:11] Speaker 2: Yeah.[1:44:11] Marc Andreessen: No. That's right. And so yeah. So technologically, it's actually pretty straightforward. So the the way to implement this technologically is with public key it's called public key cryptography, which is the basis for how, you know, cryptography information is secured in the world And and so, basically, what you would do the implementation form of this would be you would like you would pick whatever is your most trusted channel.[1:44:26] Marc Andreessen: Let's say let's say it's your YouTube channel as an example where just everybody just knows that it's you on your YouTube channel because you've been doing 10 years or whatever, and it's just obvious. And you would just publish, like, in the about me page on your YouTube. You would just publish your your your public cryptographic key that's unique to you. Right? And then anytime anybody wants to check to see whether any piece of content is actually you, they go to a registry in the cloud somewhere, and they basically submit.[1:44:48] Marc Andreessen: They basically say, okay. Is this him? And then they can basically you to see whether somebody with your public key, you had actually certified that this was something that that that you made. Now who runs that registry is an interesting question. If that registry is run by the government, we will call that the ministry of truth.[1:45:04] Marc Andreessen: I think that's probably a bad idea. If that registry is run by a company, we would, you know, call that basically the equivalent of, like, a credit bureau or something like that. Maybe that's how it happens. The problem with that is that company now becomes hacking target number 1, right, of every bad person on earth. Right?[1:45:18] Marc Andreessen: Because you can you know, if anybody breaks into that company, you know, they can they can they can fake all kinds of things.[1:45:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They own the truth.[1:45:23] Speaker 2: Right.[1:45:24] Marc Andreessen: They own the truth. Right?[1:45:24] Speaker 2: And and[1:45:25] Marc Andreessen: by the way, insider threat also their employees can monkey with it. Right? So you have to really trust that company. The third way to do it is with a blockchain. Right?[1:45:31] Marc Andreessen: And so this with the the crypto blockchain technology, you could have a distributed system, basically distributed database, in the cloud that is run through a blockchain, and then it it it it it implements this cryptography in the certification process.[1:45:42] Andrew Huberman: What what about quantum Internet? Yeah. Is that another way to encrypt these things? I know, most of our listeners are probably not familiar with quantum Internet, but, put simply, it's a way to, secure communications on the Internet. Let's just leave it at that.[1:45:54] Andrew Huberman: It it's sophisticated, and we'll probably do a whole episode about this at some point. But maybe you have a succinct way of describing quantum Internet, but, that would be better. And if so, please please offer it up. But is quantum Internet going to be one way to secure these kinds of, data and and[1:46:10] Marc Andreessen: Maybe in in in the in the future, years in the future. We don't yet have working quantum computers in practice, so it's not it's not currently something you could do, but maybe maybe in a decade or two.[1:46:18] Andrew Huberman: Tell me I'm gonna take a stab at defining quantum Internet in one sentence. It's a way in which if anyone were to try and peer in on a conversation on the Internet, it essentially, would be futile because of the way that, quantum Internet, changes the way that The communication is happening so fast and so many times in any one conversation. It's essentially changing the translation or the language so fast that there's just no way to keep up with it. Is that more or less accurate?[1:46:42] Marc Andreessen: Con conceivably. Yeah. Not yeah. Not yet, but, yeah, someday.[1:46:45] Andrew Huberman: So going back to AI, you know, most people who hear about AI are afraid of AI. Well, cool. Well, I I think most who who aren't[1:46:54] Marc Andreessen: informed This goes back to our elites versus masses thing.[1:46:57] Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting. Well, I heard you say that You know? And this is from a a really wonderful tweet thread that we will link in the show note captions that that you put out, not long ago and that I've read now several times, and that everyone really should take the time to read it. It probably takes about, 20 minutes to read it carefully and to think about each piece, and it's I highly recommend it. But you said, and I'm quoting here, let's address, the 5th, The one thing I actually agree with, which is AI will make it easier for bad people to do bad things.[1:47:32] Speaker 2: Yep.[1:47:32] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Yeah. Well, so so yes. So, well, so so so so yeah. So so first of all, there is a general freak out happening around AI.[1:47:38] Marc Andreessen: I think it's primarily it's one of these again. It's an elite driven freak out. I don't think the man on the street knows knows, cares, or one way or the other because it's not a relevant concept, and it's probably just sounds like science fiction. So there there's there's I think there's there's an elite driven freak out that's happening Right now, I think that elite driven freak out has many aspects to it that I think are incorrect, which is not surprising. I would think that given that I think the elites are incorrect about a lot of things.[1:48:00] Marc Andreessen: I think they're very wrong about a number of things they're saying about AI. But that said, look. It's a it's a this is a very powerful new technology. Right? This is like a new general purpose, like, Thinking technology.[1:48:10] Marc Andreessen: Right? So, like, what if machines could think? Right? And what if you could use machines to think? And what if you could have them think for you?[1:48:16] Marc Andreessen: There's obviously a lot of good that come from that, but also people you know, like, criminals could use them to plan better, you know, crimes. You know, terrorists could use them to plan better terror attacks and so forth. And so these are going to Tools that bad people can use to do bad things for[1:48:30] Speaker 2: sure.[1:48:31] Andrew Huberman: I can think of some ways that AI could be leveraged to do fantastic things, like, In the realm of medicine, an AI pathologist perhaps can scan 10,000 slides of histology and find the 1 microtumor cellular aberration that would turn into a full blown tumor, whereas the, Even mildly fatigued or well rested human pathologists, as great as they come, might miss that.[1:49:01] Marc Andreessen: Right.[1:49:01] Andrew Huberman: And perhaps The best solution is for both of them to do it and then for the human to verify what the AI has found and vice versa. Right.[1:49:08] Marc Andreessen: That's right. Right? Yeah.[1:49:09] Andrew Huberman: And that's just one example. I mean, I can Come up with thousands of examples where this would be wonderful.[1:49:15] Marc Andreessen: So I'll give you another one by the medicine. So you're talking about some an analytic result, which is good and important. The other is, like, the machines are gonna Much better bedside manner. They're gonna be much better at dealing with the patient. And we already know there's already been a study.[1:49:27] Marc Andreessen: There's already been a study on this. So there was already a study done on this, where, the there was a a a study team that scraped thousands of medical questions off of an Internet forum, and then they had real doctors answer the questions, and then they had Busy GPT 4 answer the questions, and then they had another panel of doctors score the responses. Right? So there there there were no patients experimented on here. This was a test contained within within the medical world, but it and then they the the the the panel of the judges, the panel of doctors or the judges, scored the answers in both factual accuracy, and on, bedside manner, on empathy.[1:49:58] Marc Andreessen: And the GPT 4 was, was, was equal or better on most of the factual questions analytically Already, and it's not even a specifically trained medical AI, but it was overwhelmingly better, on empathy.[1:50:12] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Right?[1:50:13] Marc Andreessen: And so and and, you know, it yeah. I don't think yeah. I don't I've do you you treat patient do you treat patients directly in your work? No. I don't.[1:50:18] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So We[1:50:19] Andrew Huberman: do we run Clinical trials[1:50:21] Marc Andreessen: Right.[1:50:22] Andrew Huberman: But I don't I don't do any direct clinical.[1:50:24] Marc Andreessen: So I I you know, I've I've I've no direct experience with this, but from the surgeons I've from like, if you talk to surgeons or you talk to people who Praying surgeons, what they'll tell you is, like, surgeons need to have an emotional remove from their patients in order to do a good job with the surgery. The side effect of that and by the way, look, it's a hell of a job to have to go in and tell somebody gonna die, right, or that they have so they're never gonna recover. They're never gonna walk again or whatever it is. And so there's a degree there's sort of something inherent in that job where they need to keep an emotional reserve from the patient, Right? To be able to do the job and it's expected of them as professionals.[1:50:53] Marc Andreessen: The machine has no such limitation. Like, the machine could be as sympathetic as you want it to be as long as you want it to be. It could be infinitely sympathetic. It's happy to talk to you at 4 in the morning. It's happy to sympathize with you.[1:51:03] Marc Andreessen: It's and and by the way, it's not just It's sympathizing you in in a way that, oh, it's just lie you know, it's just making up words to lie to you to make you feel good. It can also sympathize with you in terms of Helping you through all the things that you can actually do to improve your situation. Right? And so, you know, boy, like, if you'd be, you know can you keep a patient actually on track with a physical therapy program? Can you a patient on track with a nutritional program.[1:51:23] Marc Andreessen: Can you keep a patient off of drugs or alcohol?[1:51:26] Speaker 2: Right?[1:51:26] Marc Andreessen: And if they have a machine medical companion that's with them all the time that they're talking all the time that's infinitely patient, infinitely wise, right, infinitely loving. Right? And and it's just gonna be there all the time, and it's gonna be encouraging, and it's gonna be saying, you know, you did such a yesterday. I know you can do this again today. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an obvious fit here.[1:51:44] Marc Andreessen: These things are gonna be great at CBT, and that's that's already starting. But you can already use The Chat GPT is a is a CBT therapist if you want. It's actually quite good at it. And so so there's there's a universe here that's it goes to what you said. There's a universe here that's opening up, which is what I believe is it's it's partnership between man and machine.[1:52:00] Speaker 2: Right?[1:52:01] Marc Andreessen: It's it's a symbiotic relationship, not an adversarial relationship. And so the the exactly. The doctor is going to pair with AI to do all the things that you described, but the patient is also going to pair with AI. And I and I think it's good. I think I think this this Partnership that's gonna emerge is gonna lead among other things to actually much better health outcomes.[1:52:17] Marc Andreessen: I mean,[1:52:18] Andrew Huberman: I've relied for so much of my life on excellent mentors.[1:52:22] Marc Andreessen: Right.[1:52:23] Andrew Huberman: From a very young age and still now, in order to make best decisions possible with the information I had. And rarely were they available at 4 in the morning, sometimes, but not on a frequent basis. And they fatigue like anybody else, and they have their own Stuff like anybody else, baggage events in their life, etcetera. What you're describing is a sort of AI coach or therapist of sorts That hopefully would learn to identify our best self and encourage us to be our best self. And, when I say best self, I don't mean that in any kind of pop Psychology way.[1:53:00] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I could imagine AI very easily knowing, you know, how well I slept the night before and what types of good or bad decisions I tend to make at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when I've only had 5 hours of sleep or maybe just less REM sleep the night before, it might encourage me to take a little more time to think about something. Yeah. Might give me a little, tap on the wrist through a device that no one else would detect too. You know, refrain from something. You know?[1:53:23] Marc Andreessen: Never gonna judge you. It's never gonna be resentful. It's never gonna be upset that you didn't listen to it. Right? It's never gonna go on vacation.[1:53:30] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. It's gonna be there for you. Like, I I think this is the this is the way people are going to live. It's gonna with kids, and then over time, it's gonna be adults. And the the way people are gonna live is they're gonna have a exactly friend, therapist, companion, mentor, coach, teacher, Right, assistant.[1:53:43] Marc Andreessen: And that that that that or or by the way, maybe multiple of those. It may be that we're actually talking about 6, like, different personas interacting, which is a whole another possibility. But gonna have Committee. A committee. Yeah.[1:53:52] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Committee. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.[1:53:53] Marc Andreessen: Actually, different personas. And may and, by the way, when there are difficult decisions to be made in your life, maybe what you wanna hear is the argument among the different personas. And so you're just gonna get you're just gonna grow up. You're just gonna have this in your life, and you're gonna always be able to talk to it and always be able to learn from it always be able to help it make you know? And, like, it's just it's going to it's it's gay.[1:54:12] Marc Andreessen: It's it's gonna be a symbiotic relationship. It's gonna I think it's gonna be a much better way to live. I think people are gonna[1:54:16] Andrew Huberman: What modalities will it include? So I can imagine, my phone has this, engine in it, this AI companion, And I'm listening in headphones as I walk into work, and it's giving me some, not just encouragement, some warnings, some, thoughts that, things that I might ask Marc Andreessen today that I might not have thought of, and so on. I could also imagine it having a more human form. I could imagine it being, tactile, having some haptics or tapping to remind me so that it's not gonna enter our conversation in a way that that it interferes or distracts you, but I would be aware. Oh, right.[1:54:51] Andrew Huberman: You know, things of that sort. I mean, how many different modalities are we going to allow These AI coaches to approach us with. And is anyone actually thinking about the hardware piece right now?[1:55:03] Marc Andreessen: Because[1:55:03] Andrew Huberman: I'm hearing a lot about the software piece. What does the hardware piece look like?[1:55:07] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So the entrepreneur this is where Silicon Valley is gonna kick in. So the entrepreneurial community is gonna try all of those. Right? And by the way, the big companies and and and startups are gonna try all those.[1:55:15] Marc Andreessen: And so there's obviously, there's big companies that are working. You know, the the big companies that have talked about a variety of these, including, you know, heads up displays, AR, VR, You know, kinds of things. You know, there's lots of people doing voice. You know, the the voice thing is voice is a real possibility. It may just be an an earpiece.[1:55:29] Marc Andreessen: There's a new startup that just unveiled a a a new thing, where it's actually they, actually project. So you'll have, like, a pendant you wear on, like, a necklace, and it actually, Projects, like, literally, like, project images, like, on your hand or, like, on the table or on the wall in front of you. So, like, maybe that's how it shows up. Yeah. There are people working on so called haptic or touch based, kinds of things.[1:55:48] Marc Andreessen: There are people working on actually picking up, nerve signals, like, out of your arm, right, to be able to, to be able to, There's people there's, you know, there's some science for being able to do, basically, like, subvocalization. So maybe you could pick up, you could pick up that way. Bone conduction. You know? So, yeah, these are all going to be tried.[1:56:08] Marc Andreessen: So so so that's 1 question is the physical form of it. And then and then the other question is software version of it, which is like, okay. What's the level of abstraction that you wanna deal with these things in? Like, did you right right now, it's like a question answer paradigm In so called chatbot. Like, ask question, get an answer, ask a question, get an answer.[1:56:23] Marc Andreessen: Like, well, you want that to go for sure to more of a fluid conversation. You want it to build up more knowledge of who you are, you don't wanna have to explain yourself the 2nd time and so forth. And then you wanna be able to tell it things like, well, remind me this, that, or, you know, be sure and tell me when x. But then maybe over time, more and more, you want it actually deciding when it's gonna talk to you. Right?[1:56:40] Marc Andreessen: And when it thinks it has something to say, it says it, and, otherwise, it stays silent.[1:56:44] Andrew Huberman: And and normally, at least in my head, unless I make a concerted effort to do otherwise, I don't think in complete sentences. So, presumably, these these AI, these machines could learn my style of fragmented internal dialogue. And I'll maybe have an earpiece, and I'm walking in and and I start hearing something, but at some you know, advice, etcetera, encouragement, discouragement. But at some point, those sounds that I hear in an earphone are very different than seeing something or hearing something in the room. We know this based on The neuroscience of musical perception and language perception, hearing something in your head is very different.[1:57:27] Andrew Huberman: And I could imagine at some point that the AI will cross a precipice where If it has in line wiring to actually control neural activity in specific brain areas, and I don't mean very precisely, even just stimulating a little more prefrontal cortical activity, for instance, through the earpiece. You know, a little ultrasound wave now can stimulate prefrontal cortex in a noninvasive way.[1:57:45] Marc Andreessen: That's[1:57:46] Andrew Huberman: being used clinically and experimentally, that the AI could decide that I need to be a little bit more, context aware. Right? Right. This is something that is beneficial for those listening that are trying to figure out how to navigate through life. It's like, you know, know the context you're in and know the catalog of behaviors and words that are appropriate for that Situation and not others.[1:58:07] Andrew Huberman: And, you know, this would go along with agreeableness perhaps, but strategic agreeableness. Right? Context is important. There's nothing diabolical about that. Context is important.[1:58:17] Andrew Huberman: But I could imagine the AI recognizing, we're entering a particular environment. I'm now actually gonna ramp up activity in prefrontal cortex a little bit in a certain way that allows you to be more situationally aware of yourself and others, which is great Unless I can't necessarily short circuit that influence because, you know, at some point, the AI is actually then controlling My brain activity and my decision making and my speech. Yeah. Right? I think that's what people fear is that once we cross that precipice, that we are giving up control to the Artificial versions of our human intelligence.[1:58:52] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:58:52] Marc Andreessen: And, look, I think we have to decide. I mean, we we collectively and we as individuals, I think have to decide exactly how to do that. And and this is the big thing that I believe about There's just a much more, I would say, practical view of the world than a lot of the panic that you hear. It's just like these are machines. They they they're able to do things that increasingly are like the things that people can do in some but these are machines.[1:59:09] Marc Andreessen: We build the machines. We decide how to use the machines. Mhmm.[1:59:12] Speaker 2: When we[1:59:12] Marc Andreessen: want the machines turned on, they're turned on. When we want them turned off, they're turned off. And so yeah. So I I think that's absolutely the kind of thing that the individual should always be in charge of.[1:59:19] Andrew Huberman: I mean, everyone was and I have to imagine some people are still afraid of CRISPR, of gene editing. But gene editing stands revolutionize our treatment of all sorts of diseases. You know, inserting and deleting particular genes in adulthood, right, not having to, recombine in the womb a new a new organism is an immensely powerful tool. Right. And yet the Chinese scientist who did CRISPR on humans, This has been done.[1:59:43] Andrew Huberman: Actually, did his postdoc at Stanford with Steve Quake, then went to China. Did CRISPR on babies mutated, something I believe it was the HIV one of the HIV receptors. I'm told it was with the intention of augmenting human memory. Mhmm. It had very little to do, in fact, with, limiting susceptibility to HIV per se, to do with the way that that receptor is involved in human memory.[2:00:06] Andrew Huberman: The World demonized that person. We actually don't know what happened to them, whether or not they have a laboratory now or they're sitting in jail. It's unclear. But In China and elsewhere, people are doing CRISPR on humans. We know this.[2:00:19] Andrew Huberman: It's not legal in the US and, other countries, but It's happening. Do you think it's a mistake for us to fear these technologies so much that we back away from them and end up 10, 20 years behind Other countries that could use it for both benevolent or, malevolent reasons.[2:00:38] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So there's always and, you know, it's the detail the details matter, so it it's technology by technology. But I'd say there's there's 2 things. There's you always have to think in in these questions, I think, in terms of counterfactuals and opportunity cost. Right?[2:00:48] Marc Andreessen: And so so CRISPR is an interesting one. CRISPR, you manipulate the human genome. Nature manipulates the human genome. Mhmm. If you Yeah.[2:00:57] Marc Andreessen: Like, in all kinds of ways.[2:00:58] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. When you pick a spouse and you have a child with that spouse Oh, boy.[2:01:00] Marc Andreessen: You're doing genetic recombination. You are really yes. Yeah. You are quite possibly I mean, you know, if you're Genghis Khan, you know, you're determining the future know, humanity, right, by those like like, yeah. Nature I mean, look.[2:01:12] Marc Andreessen: Mutations, like so this is the old this is the old question of, like, basically, you know, this is all state of nature or state of grace. Like, you know, basically, is nature good, and then therefore, artificial things are bad, you know, which is kinda shot a lot of people have, like, ethical views like that. I'm always of the view that, like, nature's a bitch and wants us dead. Like, nature's out to get us, man. Like, nature wants to kill us.[2:01:33] Marc Andreessen: Right? Like, nature wants to, like, involve all kinds of, like, horrible viruses. Nature wants Plagues, nature wants to, like, do, you know, weather you know, like, nature nature wants to do all kinds of stuff. I mean, look, the the original nature religion was the original religion. Right?[2:01:44] Marc Andreessen: Like, that was the original thing people worshiped. And the reason was because nature was the thing that was out to get you, right, before you had scientific and technological methods to be able to to be able to deal with it. So So so the idea of not doing these things to me is just saying, oh, we're just gonna turn over the future of everything to nature, and I don't think that that there's no reason to believe that that leads in a particularly good direction or bad, you know, that that that that that's not a value neutral decision. And then the related thing that comes from that is this always this question around what's called the percussionary principle, which shows up in all these conversations on things like CRISPR, which basically is this it's this principle that basically says the inventors of a new technology should be required to prove that it will not have negative effects before they roll it out. This, of course, is a very new idea.[2:02:26] Marc Andreessen: This is actually a new idea in the 19 seventies. It's actually invented by the German greens in the 19 before that, people didn't think in those terms. People just invented things, and rolled them out. And we got all of modern civilization by people inventing things and and and rolling them out. The German greens came up with the precautionary principle for one specific purpose.[2:02:44] Marc Andreessen: I'll bet you can guess what it is. For the It was to prevent Famine? Nuclear power. Oh. It was to shut down attempts to do a civilian nuclear power.[2:02:54] Marc Andreessen: And if you fast forward 50 years later, you're like, wow. That was a big mistake. Right? So what what what they said at the time was you have to prove that nuclear reactors are not gonna melt down Mhmm. And cause all kinds of problems.[2:03:04] Marc Andreessen: And, of course, as an engineer, can you prove that that will never happen? Like, you can't. Like you you can't rule out, like, things that might happen in the future. And so that that philosophy was used to stop nuclear power, by the way, not just in Europe, but also in the US And around much of the rest of the world, if you're somebody who's concerned about carbon emissions, of course, this is the worst thing that happened in the last 50 years in terms of energy. We actually have the silver bullet answer to unlimited energy with 0 carbon emissions, nuclear power.[2:03:29] Marc Andreessen: We we choose not to do it. Not only we do we choose not to do it, actually shutting down the plants that we have now, right, in California. We just shut down, you know, the the big plant. Germany just shut down their plants. Germany's in the middle of an energy war with Russia, Right?[2:03:41] Marc Andreessen: That we are informed as existential for the future of Europe.[2:03:44] Andrew Huberman: But unless the risk of nuclear, power plant meltdown has increased, and I have to imagine it's gone the other way Yeah. What is the rationale behind shutting down these plants and not expanding?[2:03:54] Marc Andreessen: Because nuclear is bad. Right? Nuclear is icky. Nuclear is nuclear. Nuclear has been tagged.[2:03:58] Andrew Huberman: It just sounds bad.[2:04:00] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.[2:04:00] Andrew Huberman: Nuclear.[2:04:00] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go nuclear. Yeah.[2:04:02] Marc Andreessen: Nuclear. Well, so what what happened We didn't[2:04:04] Andrew Huberman: shut down postal offices and you hear go postal.[2:04:06] Marc Andreessen: So what what happened was so so nuclear technology arrived on planet Earth as a weapon. Right? So it arrived in in the form of the the first thing they did was in the middle of World War two. So the first thing they did was the atomic bomb they dropped on Japan, and then and then there were all the debates that followed around nuclear weapons and And there's a whole conversation to be had, by the way, about that because there's different views you could have on that. And then it's in, like, fifties sixties where they started to roll out civilian nuclear power, and then there were there were melt there were accidents.[2:04:29] Marc Andreessen: There was, like, you know, 3 Mile Island melted down and, you know, and then Chernobyl, you know, melted down in Soviet Union. And then even recently, you know, melted down. And so, you know, there have been meltdowns. And so I think it was a combination of it's a weapon. It is sort of icky.[2:04:43] Marc Andreessen: Scientists sometimes with the it factor. Right? It's sort of it's, you know, it's radioactive. It glows green. You know?[2:04:49] Marc Andreessen: And by the way, it becomes a you know, It becomes like a mythical fictional thing, and so you have all these movies of, like, horrible, you know, supervillains powered by, like, nuclear energy and all this all this stuff.[2:04:57] Andrew Huberman: Well, the intro to the Simpsons, right, is the nuclear power plant and the 3 eyed fish and the, you know, all the all the negative implications of this nuclear power plant run by, at least on the Simpsons, idiots, and that is the, you know, the dystopia where people are unaware of Just how bad it is.[2:05:17] Marc Andreessen: And who owns their nuclear power plant? Right? This is, like, evil, you know, this is, like, evil capitalist. Right? Like so it's, like, connected to, like, you know, capitalism.[2:05:23] Marc Andreessen: Right?[2:05:24] Andrew Huberman: And then blaming Matt Groening for the demise of a particular He certainly didn't help. No. He didn't.[2:05:30] Marc Andreessen: Right? But it's literally this amazing thing where if you're just, like, thinking if you're just thinking, like, rationally, scientifically, you're like, okay. We wanna get rid of carbon. This is the obvious way to do it. So so okay.[2:05:39] Marc Andreessen: Fun fact. Richard Nixon, the 22 things that really matter on this. So one is he defined in 1971 something called Project Independence, which was to create a 1000 new state of the art nuclear plants, civilian nuclear plants in the US by 1980 and to get the US completely off of oil, and cut the entire US energy grid over to nuclear power electricity, cut over to electric cars, the whole thing, like detached from carbon. You'll notice that didn't happen. Why did that not happen?[2:06:04] Marc Andreessen: Because he also created the EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which then prevented that from happening. Right? And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not authorize a new nuclear plant in the 40 years.[2:06:13] Andrew Huberman: Why would he hamstring himself like that?[2:06:15] Marc Andreessen: You know, he got distracted by Yeah.[2:06:18] Speaker 2: Yeah. He had By by[2:06:19] Marc Andreessen: Water k. Yeah. In Vietnam. Yeah.[2:06:21] Andrew Huberman: I think Ellsberg just died recently. Right? The guy who released the Pentagon Papers. Yeah.[2:06:25] Speaker 2: So[2:06:26] Marc Andreessen: You know, it's[2:06:26] Andrew Huberman: this thing complicated.[2:06:27] Marc Andreessen: It's the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's this thing.[2:06:29] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. He didn't you know, like, he left office shortly thereafter. He didn't have time to, you know, fully figure this out. I don't know whether he would have figured it out or not. Know, look, Ford could've figured it out.[2:06:36] Marc Andreessen: Carter could've figured it out. Reagan could've figured it out. Any of these guys could've figured it out. It's like the most obvious and knowing what we know today, it's the most obvious thing in the world. The Russia thing is the amazing thing.[2:06:44] Marc Andreessen: It's like Europe is literally funding Russia's invasion of Ukraine by paying them for oil. Right? And they can't shut off the oil because they won't cut over to nuclear. Right? And then, of course, what happens okay.[2:06:53] Marc Andreessen: So then here's the other kicker of what happens, right, which is they won't do nuclear, but they wanna do re renewables. Right? Sustainable energy. And so what they do is they do, solar and wind. Solar and wind are not reliable because it sometimes gets dark out and sometimes the wind doesn't blow.[2:07:08] Marc Andreessen: And so then what happens is they fire up the coal plants. Right? And so the the actual consequence of the precautionary principle for the purpose it was invented is a massive spike in use of coal.[2:07:17] Andrew Huberman: That's taking us back over a 100 years.[2:07:19] Marc Andreessen: Yes. Correct. That is the consequence of the Krasnaya principle. Like, that's the consequence of that mentality. And so it's a failure of a principle on its own merits for the thing it was designed for, and then, you know, there there is a whole movement of people who want apply it to every new thing.[2:07:33] Marc Andreessen: And and and and this is the hot topic on AI right now in in in Washington, which is like, oh my god. These people have to prove that this can never get used for bad things.[2:07:39] Andrew Huberman: Sorry. I'm hung up on this nuclear thing, and and, I wonder, can it just be renamed? I mean, Seriously, I mean, there is something about the naming of things. We know this in biology. Yeah.[2:07:52] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, you know, Lamarckian evolution and things like that are bad these are Bad words in biology, but we had a guest on this podcast, Oded Rishavi, who's over in Israel, who's shown, you know, inherited traits. But If you talk about it as Lamarckian, then it has all sorts of negative implications, but he's the the his discoveries have important implications for everything from inherited trauma to treatment of disease. I mean, there's all sorts of positives that await us if we are able to reframe our thinking around something that, yes, indeed, could be used for evil. But that has enormous potential, and that is an agreement with nature.[2:08:26] Andrew Huberman: Right? This fundamental truth that, at least to my knowledge, no one Is revising in any significant way anytime soon. So what if it were called something else? It could be. Nuclear.[2:08:36] Andrew Huberman: It's it's called, you know, Sustainable. Right? I mean, it's amazing how marketing can can shift our perspective of robots, for instance, or, anyway, I'm sure you can come up with better examples than I can, but, Oh, is there a, good solid PR firm working from the nuclear side?[2:08:55] Marc Andreessen: Thunbergian? Greta Thunberg.[2:08:57] Andrew Huberman: So So Thunbergian. Thunbergian.[2:09:00] Marc Andreessen: Like, if she got if she was in favor of it Yeah. Which, by the way, she's not. She's dead set against it.[2:09:04] Andrew Huberman: She said that.[2:09:05] Marc Andreessen: A 100%. Yeah.[2:09:06] Andrew Huberman: Bay based on Based on I mean Bergean principles.[2:09:09] Marc Andreessen: The prevailing the prevailing ethic in environmentalism for 50 years is that nuclear is evil. They they won't consider it. There are, by the way, certain environmentalist who disagree with this. And so Stewart Brand is the one that's been the most public and he has impeccable credentials in[2:09:20] Andrew Huberman: And he wrote the Polar's catalogs?[2:09:22] Marc Andreessen: Polar's catalog guy. Yeah. And, he's written a whole bunch of really interesting book sense. And he he wrote a recent book that goes through in detail. He's like, yes.[2:09:28] Marc Andreessen: Obviously, the Correct environmental thing to do is nuclear power. And we should be we should be implementing project independence. We should be building a 1,000 we should specifically, we should he didn't say this, but this is what I would say. We should hire Charles Koch. We should hire Koch Industries.[2:09:42] Marc Andreessen: Right? And they should build us a 1,000 nuclear power plants. Right? And then we should give them the presidential medal of freedom for saving the environment.[2:09:48] Andrew Huberman: And that would put us independent of our reliance on oil.[2:09:50] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Then we're done with oil. Like, we're just think about what happens. We're done with oil, zero emissions, we're done with the Middle East, we're done. We're done.[2:09:57] Marc Andreessen: We we're not drilling. We're not drilling on American land anymore. We're not drilling on foreign lands. Like, we have no military entanglements in places where we're drilling. We're not, you know, despoiling in Alaska, we're not nothing.[2:10:07] Marc Andreessen: No offshore rigs. No nothing. We're done. And you basically just you build state of the art plants, engineered properly. You have them just completely contained.[2:10:13] Marc Andreessen: When there's nuclear waste, you just entomb the waste, Right. In concrete. So it it it just sits there, you know, forever. It's just very small, you know, footprint, you know, kind of thing, and you're just done. And so this is like the to me, it's like scientifically, technologically, this is just like the most obvious thing in the world.[2:10:29] Marc Andreessen: It's a massive tell on the part of the people who claim to be pro environment that they're not in favor of this.[2:10:33] Andrew Huberman: And if I were to say, tweet that I'm pro nuclear power because it's the more sustainable form of power, if I if I hypothetically did that today Yep. What would happen to me in this[2:10:43] Marc Andreessen: in the a crypto fascist. You know? Interesting. Dirty evil capitalist. Know, monster, how dare you?[2:10:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm unlikely to run that experiment. I was just curious. That was what we call a Gedanken experiment or experiment or[2:10:56] Marc Andreessen: a terrible actor, you're a terrible human being. We do that. We were looking for evidence that you're a terrible human being, and now now we know it. Right? It's a this is a great example of of the it's, I I gave Andrew a book on the way here with this.[2:11:06] Marc Andreessen: My favorite new book is, like, title of it is when reason goes on holiday. Mhmm. And this is a great example of it is that the people who are who who who the people who simultaneously say they're environmentalists they're anti nuclear power, like, the the positions simply don't reconcile, but that doesn't bother them, like, at all. So let's be clear. I predict none none of this will happen.[2:11:24] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. I need to learn more about nuclear power.[2:11:27] Marc Andreessen: Long coal.[2:11:28] Andrew Huberman: Long coal.[2:11:28] Marc Andreessen: Long coal. Invest in coal.[2:11:30] Andrew Huberman: Because you think we're just gonna revert.[2:11:32] Marc Andreessen: It's the energy source of the future. Well, because it can't be solar on wind because they're not reliable, so you need something. Mhmm. And if it's not nuclear, it's gonna be either like oil, natural gas, or coal.[2:11:42] Andrew Huberman: And you're unwilling to say bet on nuclear because you don't think that, the Socio political elitist trends that are driving against nuclear are likely to dissipate anytime soon.[2:11:53] Marc Andreessen: Not a chance. I I can't imagine. It would be great if they did, but the the the that it's they they are the the the the powers to be are very locked in on this as a position. And, look, they've been saying this 50 years, and so they'd have to reverse themselves off of a bad position they've had for 50 years. People really don't like to do that.[2:12:10] Andrew Huberman: One thing that's good about this and other podcast is that young people listen, they eventually will take over. Yeah.[2:12:15] Marc Andreessen: And by the way, I will say also, there there are nuclear entrepreneurs. So there are actually a there are a bunch I'm a funny young kid. There are a bunch of young entrepreneurs who are basically not taking an answer. And they're trying to develop it. In particular, there's people trying to develop new very small form factor, nuclear power plants With a variety of possible use cases.[2:12:32] Marc Andreessen: So, you know, look. Maybe, you know, maybe they show up with a better mousetrap when people take a second look, but we'll see.[2:12:39] Andrew Huberman: Or just rename it. So my understanding is that you think we should go all in on AI with The constraints that we discover we need in order to rein in safety and things of that sort, not unlike social media. Yeah. Not unlike The Internet.[2:12:56] Marc Andreessen: Not unlike what we should have done with nuclear power. Mhmm. Yeah.[2:13:00] Andrew Huberman: And in terms of the, Near infinite number of ways that AI can be envisioned to harm us. How do you think we should cope with that, psychologically? You know, because I can imagine a lot of people listening to this conversation are thinking, okay. That all sounds great, but there are just too many what ifs that are terrible.[2:13:18] Speaker 2: Right?[2:13:19] Andrew Huberman: You know? What if the machines take over? What if you know? The silly example I gave earlier, but, you know, what if one day I could log in to my, you know, hard earned bank account, and it's all gone? You know, the AI version of myself, like, ran off with someone else and with all my money.[2:13:34] Andrew Huberman: Right? Right now right? My AI coach abandoned me For somebody else after it learned all the stuff that I taught it[2:13:41] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.[2:13:42] Andrew Huberman: It took off with somebody else. Yeah. Stranded. You know? And it has my bank account numbers.[2:13:47] Andrew Huberman: Like, this kind of thing.[2:13:49] Marc Andreessen: You could really make this scenario horrible Right.[2:13:51] Andrew Huberman: If you kept going. Yeah. Well, we can throw in a benevolent, example as well, to counter it. But, it's just kind of fun to think about where the human mind goes.[2:14:00] Marc Andreessen: Right. Right? Yeah. So first, I I say we gotta separate the real problems from Problems. And so there's a lot there are a lot of science fiction scenarios I think are just not real.[2:14:07] Marc Andreessen: And the ones that you decided as an example, like, it's not that's not what is gonna happen, and I can explain why gonna happen. So you you should there there's a set of there's a set of fake ones. The fake ones are are ones are the ones that just aren't, I think, technologically grounded, that aren't rational. It's the AI is gonna, like, wake up and decide to kill us all. It's like yeah.[2:14:22] Marc Andreessen: It's gonna develop the kind of agency where it's gonna steal our money, you know, money and our spouse and everything else, our kids. Like, that's just that's not how it works. And then there's also all these concerns, you know, destruction of society concerns, and this is, you know, misinformation, hate speech, deep fakes, like, all that stuff, which I I don't think is a real is a is actually a real problem. And then there's a people have a bunch of economic concerns around, you know, what's gonna take all the jobs Right. All of those kinds of things, we could talk about that.[2:14:46] Marc Andreessen: I don't think those those are those are I don't think that's actually the thing that happens. But then there are 2 actual real concerns that I actually do very much agree with, and one of them is is what you said, which is, bad people doing bad things. And there's there's a whole set of things to be done inside there. The big one is we should use AI to build defenses against all the bad things. Right?[2:15:05] Marc Andreessen: And so for for example, there's a concern. AI is gonna make it easier for for bad people to build pathogens. Right. Design pathogens in labs, which, you know, bad people bad scientists can do today, but this is gonna make it easier easier to do. Well, obviously, we should have the equivalent of an operation warp speed Operating, you know, in perpetuity anyway.[2:15:20] Marc Andreessen: Right? But then we should use AI to build much better biodefenses. Right? And we should be using AI today to design, like, for example, full spectrum vaccines against every form a pathogen. Right?[2:15:29] Marc Andreessen: And so and so defensive mechanism. Hacking, you can use AI to build better defense tools. Right? And so you should you should have a whole new kind of security suite wrapped around you, wrapped around your data, wrapped around your money where you're you're you're having AI, repel, attacks. Disinformation, hate speech, deep fakes, all that stuff, you should have an AI filter when you use the Internet where it you know, you shouldn't have to figure out whether it's really me or whether it's a made up thing.[2:15:52] Marc Andreessen: You should have an AI assistant that's doing that for you.[2:15:55] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I mean, these these little banners and cloaks that you see on social media, like, this has been deemed misinformation. You know, if you're me, you always click.[2:16:02] Marc Andreessen: Right. Right. Right.[2:16:03] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because you're like, what's behind the scrim?[2:16:05] Speaker 2: Right.[2:16:05] Andrew Huberman: And then, or this is a I don't always look at the the this image is Is gruesome type thing. Sometimes I just pass on that. But if it's something that, seems debatable, of course, you look.[2:16:17] Marc Andreessen: Well, and you should have an you should have an AI assistant with you when you're on the Internet, and you should be able to tell that AI assistant what you want. Right? So, yes, I want the full I want the full experience to show me everything. Thing. I want it from a particular point of view, and I don't wanna hear from these other people who I don't like.[2:16:30] Marc Andreessen: By the way, it's gonna be my 8 year old who's using this. I don't want anything that's gonna cause a problem, and I want and and AI based filters like that that you program and control are gonna work much better, and and be much more honest and straightforward and clear and so forth than than what we have today. So so anyway so so basically what I want people to do is think every time you think of, like, a risk of how it can be used, just think of, like, okay, we can use it to build a countermeasure. And the great thing about the countermeasures is they can not only offset AI risks, can offset other risks. Right?[2:16:55] Marc Andreessen: Because we already live in a world where pathogens are a problem.[2:16:58] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[2:16:58] Marc Andreessen: Right? We ought to have better vaccines, anyway. Right? We already live in a world where there are cyber hacking and cyber terrorism. They're already live in a world where there is bad content on the Internet, and we have the ability now to build much better AI powered tools to deal with all those things.[2:17:12] Andrew Huberman: I also love the idea of the AI physicians. Yeah. You know, getting decent health care in this country is So difficult. Even for people who have means or insurance. I mean, the number of phone calls and waits that you have to go through to get a referral To see a specialist, I mean, it's it's absurd.[2:17:28] Andrew Huberman: Like, I mean, the process of is absurd. I mean, it makes one partially or frankly ill just to go through the process of having to do all that. Don't know how anyone does it. And granted, I don't have, the highest degree of patience, but I'm pretty patient, and it drives me insane, to even just get a remedial care. But, so I can think of a lot of, benevolent uses of AI, and I'm I'm grateful that you're bringing this up and, here and that you've tweeted about it in that thread, again, we'll refer people to that, and that you're thinking about this.[2:17:59] Andrew Huberman: I have to imagine that in your role as investor, nowadays that you're also thinking about AI quite often, in terms of all these roles. And so does that mean that there are a lot of, young people who are really bullish on AI and are going for it. Yeah. Okay. This is here to stay.[2:18:16] Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay. Yeah.[2:18:17] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah. Yeah.[2:18:18] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Unlike CRISPR, which is sort of in this liminal place where biotech companies aren't sure if they should invest or not[2:18:24] Speaker 2: Right.[2:18:24] Andrew Huberman: In in, in CRISPR because it's unclear whether or not the governing bodies are going to allow gene editing.[2:18:30] Speaker 2: Right.[2:18:30] Andrew Huberman: Just like it was unclear, 15 years ago if they were gonna allow gene therapy, but now we know they do allow gene therapy and immunotherapy.[2:18:36] Marc Andreessen: Right. Okay. So there is a fight. Now having said that there is a fight, there's a fight happening in Washington right now over exactly what should be legal or not legal. And there's quite a bit of I think, attached to that fight right now because there are some people in there that are being telling a very effective story to try to get people either outlaw AI or specifically limited to a small number of big companies, which think it's potentially disastrous.[2:18:57] Marc Andreessen: By the way, the EU also is, like, super negative. You know, the EU has turned super negative on basically all new so they're moving to try to outlaw AI, which if they succeed Outlaw AI. Just like flat out don't want it.[2:19:07] Andrew Huberman: But that's like saying you're gonna outlaw the Internet. I don't see how you can stop this training.[2:19:11] Marc Andreessen: They're not a big fan of the Internet either. So, like, they're I I think they regret the the EU has a very this especially the EU bureaucrats, people who run the EU in Brussels have a very negative view on a lot of modernity.[2:19:24] Andrew Huberman: But what I'm hearing here, You know, calls to mind things that I've heard people like David Goggins say, which is, you know, there's so many, lazy, undisciplined people out there that nowadays it's easier and easier to become exceptional. I've heard him say something to that extent. It almost sounds like there's so many countries that are just backing off of, particular technologies because it just sounds bad from the PR perspective, that, you know, it's creating great kind of low hanging fruit opportunities for people to barge forward and countries to barge forward if they're willing to embrace this stuff.[2:19:54] Marc Andreessen: It is, but number 1, you have to have a country that wants to do that. And and that those exist, and there there are countries But and then the other is, look, they they need to be able to withstand the attack from, stronger countries that don't want them to do it. Right? So, like, EU, like, the EU has, you know, nominal control over, like, whatever whatever it is, 27 or whatever member countries. So, like, even if you're, like, whatever, the Germans get all fired up about whatever.[2:20:15] Marc Andreessen: Like, Brussels can still, in a lot of just, like, flat out, basically, control them and tell them not to do it. Right? And then the US, I mean, look, we have, you know, we have a lot of control over a lot of the world.[2:20:24] Andrew Huberman: But it sounds like we sit somewhere sort of in between. Like, right now, people are developing AI technologies in US companies. Right? So it is happening.[2:20:33] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Today, it's happening. But like I said, there's a set of people who are very focused in Washington right now about trying to either ban it outright, or trying to, as I said, limit it to a small number of big companies. And then look. China's got a whole the the the other part of this is China's got a whole different kinda take on this, right, than we do.[2:20:49] Marc Andreessen: And so they're, of course, going to allow it for sure, but they're gonna allow it in the ways that that Their their system wants it to happen, right, which is much more for pop population control, and to implement authoritarianism. And then, of course, they they they are going to spread their Technology and their vision of how society should run across the world. Right? So we're we're we're back in a cold war dynamic like we were with the Soviet Union where there are 2 different systems that have fundamentally different views On on issue you know, concepts like freedom and and individual choices, freedom of speech, and so on. And, you know, we know where the Chinese stand.[2:21:19] Marc Andreessen: We're still figuring out where we stand. Mhmm. And there are a lot of so I'm having a lot of schizophrenic. I'm having specifically a lot of schizophrenic conversations with people in DC right now where if I talk to them in China, it doesn't come up. They just, like, hate tech.[2:21:30] Marc Andreessen: They hate American tech companies. They hate AI. They hate social media. They hate this. They hate that.[2:21:34] Marc Andreessen: They hate crypto. They hate everything, and they just wanna, like, punish and, like, Ban and, like, they're just, like, very, very negative. But then if we have a conversation half hour later and we talk about China, then the conversation's totally different. Now we need a partnership the US government and American tech companies to defeat China. It's it's it's it's, like, the exact opposite discussion.[2:21:51] Marc Andreessen: Right?[2:21:51] Andrew Huberman: Is that fear or competitiveness? On China specifically? On on in terms of the the US response in Washington, when, you know, you bring up these technologies like, You know? I'll lump CRISPR in there, things like CRISPR, nuclear power, AI. It all sounds very cold.[2:22:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Very dystopian to a lot of people. Yeah. And yet There are all these benevolent uses as we've been talking about. And then you say you raise the issue of China, and then it sounds like this big, you know, dark cloud emerging.[2:22:17] Andrew Huberman: And then all of a sudden, You know, it's we need to galvanize and and, develop these technologies to counter their effort. So is it fear of them, or is it competitiveness or both?[2:22:28] Marc Andreessen: Well, so without them in the picture, you just have this it's basically it's it's there's an old Bedouin, was it saying as, me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin. Me and my brother, my cousin against, you know, the world. Right? Like so so with it it's it's actually it's evolution in action. The way I think would think about it is if there's no external threat, Then the conflict turns inward.[2:22:47] Marc Andreessen: And then and then at that point, there's a big fight between specifically tech and then I was just say generally politics. And my interpretation of that fight is it's a fight for status. It's it's fundamentally a fight for status and for power, which is, like, if you're in politics, you like this you like the status quo of how power and status work in our society. You don't want these new technologies to show up and change things because change is bad. Right?[2:23:08] Marc Andreessen: Change change threatens your position. It threatens your you know, the respect that people have for you and your control over over things. So I think it's primarily a status fight, which we could talk about. But the the China thing is just like a straight up geopolitical us versus them. You know, like I said, it's like a cold war scenario.[2:23:23] Marc Andreessen: And, you know, look, 20 years ago, the prevailing view in Washington was we need to be friends with China. Right? And we're gonna be trading China. And, yes, they're a totalitarian dictatorship, but, like, if we trade with them over time, they'll become more democratic. In the last 5 to 10 years, it's become more and more clear that that's just not true.[2:23:39] Marc Andreessen: And now there's a lot of people in both political parties in DC who very much regret that and want to change too much more of a sort of a cold war footing.[2:23:47] Andrew Huberman: Are you willing to comment on TikTok and technologies that emerge from China that are in, widespread use within the US? Like, how much you trust them or don't trust them? I can, go on record myself by saying that early on when TikTok was released, we were told as Stanford faculty that we should not and Could not have TikTok accounts nor WeChat accounts. Right.[2:24:09] Marc Andreessen: So, sir, there are a lot of really bright Chinese tech entrepreneurs and engineers who are trying to do good things. Totally Oh, absolutely. Positive about that. So I I think the the the many of the people mean mean very well. But the the Chinese have a specific system, and the system is very clear and unambiguous.[2:24:25] Marc Andreessen: And the system is everything in China is owned by the party. It's not it's not even owned by the state. It's owned by the party. It's owned by the Chinese Communist Party. So the Chinese Communist Party owns everything, and they control everything.[2:24:33] Marc Andreessen: The way, it's actually illegal to this day. It's illegal for an for an investor to buy equity in a Chinese company. There's all these, like, basically, legal machinations that people do to try to do something that's, like, economic cool into that, but it's actually still illegal to do that. The Chinese have no intention. The Chinese Communist Party has no intention of letting foreigners own any of China, Like, zero intention of that, and they they they regularly move to make sure that that doesn't happen.[2:24:55] Marc Andreessen: So so so so so they own everything. They control everything. So I wait.[2:24:58] Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt you, but People in China can invest in American companies all the time.[2:25:02] Marc Andreessen: Well, they can subject to US government constraints. There there is a there is a US government system that attempts to mediate that Called CFIUS, and there are more and more there are more and more limitations being put on that. But if you can get through that approval process, then legally, you can do that, whereas the same is not true with respect to China. And so, so they so they just have a system. And so if you're if you're the CEO of a Chinese company, it's not Optional.[2:25:27] Marc Andreessen: If you're the CEO of ByteDance or CEO of Tencent, it's not option your your relationship with the Chinese Communist Party is not optional. It's required. And what's required is you are a unit of the party, And you and your company do what the party says. And when the party says we get full access to all user data in America, you say yes. When the party says you change the algorithm to optimize to a certain social result, you say yes.[2:25:48] Marc Andreessen: Right? So so it's just it's whatever it's whatever it's whatever Xi Jinping and his party cadres decide, and that's what gets implemented. You're the CEO of a Chinese tech company, there is a political officer assigned to you who has an office down the hall. And at any given time, he can down the hall. He can grab you out of your staff meeting or board meeting, and he can take you on the hall, and he can make you sit for hours and study Marxism and Xi Jinping thought and quiz you on it and test you on it.[2:26:11] Marc Andreessen: Wow. And you'd better pass the test. Right? Like, so so it's like a straight political control thing. And then, by the way, if you get crosswise with them, like, you know.[2:26:22] Andrew Huberman: So when we see, tech founders getting called up to congress for, you know, What looks like interrogation, but it's probably pretty light interrogation compared to what happens in other countries.[2:26:33] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. It's it's a it's a it's state it's state power. They they just they just have this view of top down power and they view it's that their system and they view that it's necessary for lots of historical and moral reasons that they've defined, and that's how they run. And then they've got a view that says how they wanna propagate that vision outside the country. And they have these programs like Belt and Road, right, that basically are intended to propagate kind of their vision worldwide.[2:26:52] Marc Andreessen: And so They are who they are. Like, I will say that they don't lie about it. Right? They're they're very straightforward.[2:26:58] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:26:59] Marc Andreessen: They give speeches. They write books. You can buy Xi Jinping just he goes through the whole thing. They have they have their tech 2025 plan. I've read you know, it's, like, 10 years ago.[2:27:05] Marc Andreessen: It's their whole AI agenda. It's all in there.[2:27:07] Andrew Huberman: And is there a goal that, You know, in 200 years, 300 years that China is the superpower controlling everything?[2:27:14] Speaker 2: How about[2:27:14] Marc Andreessen: yeah. Or 20 years, 30 years, or 2 years, 3 years. Yeah.[2:27:17] Andrew Huberman: Well, they got a Horizon.[2:27:18] Marc Andreessen: I mean, look. They're they're yeah. They're they're I mean, if if you're it's like you know? I don't know. Everybody's a little bit like this, I guess.[2:27:23] Marc Andreessen: But, yeah, if you're they wanna win.[2:27:25] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[2:27:25] Andrew Huberman: Well, the the CRISPR in humans example that I gave earlier was interesting to me because first of all, I'm a neuroscientist, and they could have Edited any genes, but they chose to edit the genes involved in, the attempt to create super memory babies,[2:27:40] Marc Andreessen: right,[2:27:41] Andrew Huberman: which presumably have grown to super memory adults. And whether or not they succeed in that isn't clear. Those babies are Alive and presumably by now walking, talking as far as I know. Whether or not they have super memories isn't clear. But China is clearly Unafraid to augment biology in that way, and I believe that That's inevitable.[2:28:08] Andrew Huberman: That's gonna happen elsewhere, probably first for the treatment of disease. But at some point, I'm assuming people are gonna augment biology To make smarter kids. I mean, people, not always, but, often will select mates based on the traits they would like their children to inherit. So this happens far more frequently than could be deemed, bad because either that or people are bad because people do this all the time. Selecting mates that have Physical and, psychological and cognitive traits that you would like your offspring to have.[2:28:36] Andrew Huberman: CRISPR is a more targeted approach, of course. You know, the reason I'm kinda giving this example and and examples like it is that I feel like so much of the way that, governments and the and the Public react to technologies is to just, you know, take that first glimpse, and it just feels scary.[2:28:53] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.[2:28:54] Andrew Huberman: You think about the old Apple ad of the, You know, 1984 ad. I mean, there was one very scary version of the personal computer and computers and robots taking over and everyone like automatons. And then there was The Apple version where it's all about creativity, love, and peace, and it had the pseudo psychedelic California thing going for it. Again, great marketing Seems to convert people's thinking about technology such that what was once viewed as very scary and dangerous and dystopian is like an oasis of opportunity. So why are people so afraid of new technologies?[2:29:30] Marc Andreessen: So this is the thing I've tried to understand for a long time because the history is so Clear. And the the history basically is every new technology is greeted by what's called a moral panic. And so it's basically this, like, historical freak out of of some kind that causes people to basically predict the end of the world. And you you go back in time and actually this historical sort of effect. It it happens even in things now where you just go back and it's ludicrous.[2:29:51] Marc Andreessen: Right? And so You mentioned earlier the satanic panic of the of the eighties and, you know, the concern around, like, heavy metal music. Right before that, there was, like, a freak out around comic books, You know, in the fifties, there was a freak out around jazz music in the twenties thirties. You know, it's devil music. You know, there was a freak out.[2:30:06] Marc Andreessen: The arrival of bicycles caused some moral panic in the, like, sixties, 18/70. Bicycles? Bicycles. Yeah. So there was this thing at the time.[2:30:12] Marc Andreessen: So bicycles were the first, they were the first very easy to use personal transportation thing that basically let kids travel Between towns, you know, quickly, without any overhead. You know? You have to take take take care of a horse. Just jump a bike and go. And so it it there was a historical panic specifically around at I'm young women, who for the 1st time were able to venture outside the confines of the town to maybe go have a boyfriend in another town.[2:30:36] Marc Andreessen: And so the magazines at the time ran all these stories on this, phenomenon medical phenomenon called bicycle face. And the idea of bicycle face was the exertion caused by pedaling a bicycle would cause your face your your face would grimace, and then if if you run the bicycle for too long, your face would lock into place. Right. And then Sorry.[2:30:52] Andrew Huberman: I'm just Right. And then[2:30:53] Marc Andreessen: you would be you would be unattractive and therefore, of course, unable to then, you know, get married. Cars, there was a moral panic around car red flag laws. There are all these laws that created the the automobile. Automobile freak people out. So there are all these laws.[2:31:07] Marc Andreessen: If in the early days of the automobile, in a lot of places, you had to, you would take a ride in automobile. And automobiles, they broke down all the time. It would be you the only rich people had automobiles. So it'd be you and your mechanic in in the car, right, for when it broke down. And then you had to hire another guy, to walk 2 100 yards in front of the car with a red flag, and he had to wave the red flag.[2:31:27] Marc Andreessen: And so you could only drive as fast as he could walk because the red flag was to warn people that the the car was coming, and and then and then in I think it was Pennsylvania. They had the most draconian version, which was, they were very worried about the car Scaring the horses. And so there was a lot that said if you saw a horse coming, you need to stop the car. You you had to disassemble the car, And you had to hide the pieces of the car behind the nearest hay bale. Wait for the horse to go by.[2:31:51] Marc Andreessen: Oh. And and then you could put your car back together. So so anyways, this example is, electric lighting. There was a panic around, like, whether it's just gonna come, like, completely ruin. You know, this is gonna completely ruin, like, the romance of the dark, and it was gonna cause, you know you know, a whole new kind of like terrible civilization where everything is always brightly lit.[2:32:06] Marc Andreessen: So there's just, like, all these examples. And so it's like, okay. What on earth is happening that this is always what happens? And so I finally found this book that I think has a has a good model for it. The book is called Men, Machines in Modern Times, and it's written by this MIT professor, like, 60 years ago.[2:32:20] Marc Andreessen: So it it predates the Internet, but it uses a lot of, historical samples. And what he says basically is he says there's there's actually a 3 stage response. There's a 3 stage societal response to new Allergies. It's very predictable. He said stage 1 is, basically just denial.[2:32:34] Marc Andreessen: Just ignore. Like, we just, like, don't pay attention to this. Nobody takes it seriously. We just like, there's just a blackout on the whole topic. He says stage, that's stage 1.[2:32:42] Marc Andreessen: Stage 2 is rational counterargument. So stage 2 is where you line up all the different reasons why this can't possibly work. Possibly ever get, you know, cheaper, you know, this, that, or, you know, not fast enough or whatever the thing is. And then he says stage 3, he says, is when the name calling begins. So he said stage 3 is like when right.[2:33:00] Marc Andreessen: Right. So when they failed to ignore it and they failed to argue society out of it I love it. They moved to the name calling. Right? And what's the name calling?[2:33:08] Marc Andreessen: The name calling is this is evil. This is moral panic. This is evil. This is terrible. This is awful.[2:33:11] Marc Andreessen: This is gonna destroy everything. Like, don't you understand, like, you know, all this, know, it's just it's just like this is this is horrifying. And and you, you know, the person working on her, are being reckless and evil and, you know, all all this stuff, and you must be stopped. And and he said the reason for that is because, basically, fundamentally, what these things are is they're a war over status. It's a it's a it's a war over status and therefore a war over power and and then, of alt alt ultimately money, but the stat status human status is the thing.[2:33:35] Marc Andreessen: And so and and because what he says is what what is the societal impact of a new technology? The impact of a new technology is it reorders status in society. So the people who are specialists in that technology become high status, the people who are specialists in the previous way of doing things become low status, and, generally, people don't adapt. Right? Generally, if you're the kind of person who is high status Because you're an you're you're an evolved adaptation to an existing technology, you're probably not the kind of person that's gonna enthusiastically try to replant yourself onto a new technology.[2:34:04] Marc Andreessen: And so the and so this is, like, every politician who's just, like, in a complete state of panic about social media. Like, why are they so freaked out about social media? It's because they all know that the whole nature of modern politics has changed. Entire battery of techniques that you used to get elected before social media are now obsolete. Obviously, the best new politicians of the future are gonna be a 100% creations of social media.[2:34:21] Andrew Huberman: And podcasts.[2:34:22] Marc Andreessen: And podcast. And we're[2:34:23] Andrew Huberman: seeing this now as we head towards the next presidential election that podcasts, clearly are going to be very heavily in that next election because long form content is a whole different landscape.[2:34:34] Marc Andreessen: So this is exact so this is the rogue this is the so far so Rogan near Rogan's had, like, what? Like, had, like, Bernie. He's had, like, Tulsi. He's had, like, a whole series of things.[2:34:41] Andrew Huberman: Most recently. And that's created a lot of controversy.[2:34:44] Marc Andreessen: Centuries. But also my understanding, it's like he's I'm sure he's invited everybody. I'm sure he I'm sure he'd Biden. I'm sure he'd love to have Trump on. I'm sure he'd[2:34:50] Andrew Huberman: to ask him. I mean, I think that, you know, every podcaster has their own ethos around who they invite on and why and how. Yeah. So I certainly can't speak for him, but, but I have to imagine that any opportunity to have true long form discourse that would allow people To really understand people's positions on things, I have to imagine that he would be in favor of that sort of thing.[2:35:14] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Or somebody else would. Right? You you know, some some other top top Catherine Donnelly Wood. Right?[2:35:17] Marc Andreessen: And so so there's such if my point my exactly. I totally agree with you. But my point is if if you're a politician, if you're if you're, let's say, a legacy politician, Right. You have the option of embracing the new technology. You can do it anytime you want.[2:35:29] Marc Andreessen: Right? You you but you you don't. They're not. They won't. Like, they won't do it.[2:35:33] Marc Andreessen: And why won't they do it? Well, okay. First of all, they wanna ignore it. Right? They wanna pretend that things aren't changing.[2:35:38] Marc Andreessen: You know, second is they want, like, to have rational counter arguments for, like, why the existing system works the way that it does and this and that, the existing media networks. And, like, here's how you'd, like, do things, and here's how you give speeches, and here's the clothes you wear and the tie and the thing and the pocket square. And, like, you've got cool it's how you succeeded was coming up to that system. So you've got all your arguments as to why that won't work anymore. And then and then we've now proceeded to the the the name calling phase, which is now it's evil.[2:35:59] Marc Andreessen: Right? Now it's evil for somebody to show up in, you know, on a on on a stream, God forbid, for 3 hours and actually say what they think. Right? It's gonna destroy society. Right?[2:36:07] Marc Andreessen: So it it it's exactly right. It's like it's it's a it's a classic example of this pattern. Anyway, so more Morrison says in the book, basically, this is the forever pattern. Like, this will never change. This will this is one of those things where you can learn about it and still not if the entire world could learn about this and still nothing changes Because at the end of the day, it's not it has it's not the tact that's the question.[2:36:27] Marc Andreessen: It's the it's the reordering of status.[2:36:30] Speaker 2: I have a[2:36:31] Andrew Huberman: lot of thoughts about the podcast component. I'll just say this because I wanna get back to, the topic of innovation of technology. But On a long form podcast, there's no, safe zone. You know? The person can get up and walk out, but if The person interviewing them, and certainly Joe is, the best of the very best, if not the most skilled podcaster in the in the entire universe at Continuing to press people on specific topics when they're, you know, trying to bob and weave and wriggle[2:37:03] Speaker 2: real[2:37:03] Andrew Huberman: loud, he'll just keep, You know, either drilling or alter the question somewhat in a way that forces them to finally come up with an answer of some sort. And I think that probably, puts Certain people's cortisol levels through the roof, such that they just would never go on there.[2:37:20] Marc Andreessen: Well, I think there's another deeper question also or another question along with that, which is how many people actually have[2:37:26] Speaker 2: Say. Yeah.[2:37:27] Andrew Huberman: Real substance.[2:37:28] Marc Andreessen: Right? Yeah. Like, how many people can actually talk in a way that's actually interesting to anybody else for any length of time? Mhmm. How much substance is there really?[2:37:35] Marc Andreessen: And, like, a lot of historical politics was to be able to manufacture a facade where you honestly as far as I you can't tell, Like, how how deep the thoughts are. Like, even if they have deep thoughts, like, it's it's kept it's kept away from you. They would certainly never cop to it.[2:37:47] Andrew Huberman: It's going to be an interesting next what is it about, you know, 20 months or so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.[2:37:53] Andrew Huberman: Selection.[2:37:54] Marc Andreessen: Panic in the name calling have already started. So, yeah, it's[2:37:55] Andrew Huberman: been Yeah. I was gonna say this list of 3 things, denial, You know, the counterargument and name calling, it seems like with AI, it's already just jumped to numbers 23.[2:38:06] Marc Andreessen: Yes.[2:38:07] Andrew Huberman: Right. We're already at 23, and it's kinda leaning 3.[2:38:09] Marc Andreessen: Yes. Yeah. Yes. That's correct. Because there So it is unusual just because It had so tech new technologies that take off, they almost always have a prehistory.[2:38:17] Marc Andreessen: They almost always have a 30 or 40 year history where people tried and failed to get them to work before they took AI has an 80 year prehistory, so it has a very long one. Mhmm. And then it it it just it all of a sudden started to work dramatically well, like, seemingly overnight. And so it it went from basically it as far as most people were concerned, it went from it doesn't work at all to it works incredibly well in one step, and that almost never happens. Like, obviously, this thing is gonna be like the obviously, in my life, this is gonna be the best thing ever.[2:38:51] Marc Andreessen: Like, this is amazing. There's all these ways that I can use it. And then it and then, therefore, immediately, you're like, oh my god. This gonna transform everything. Therefore, step 3.[2:39:00] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Right. Straight to the name calling. Exactly. In the face of all this, there are innovators out there.[2:39:07] Andrew Huberman: Maybe they are aware they are innovators. Maybe they are already starting companies, or maybe, they are just some, young or older person who has these 5 traits in abundance or doesn't, but know somebody who does and is Partnering with them in some sort of idea. And you have an amazing track record at identifying these people, I think in part because You have those same traits yourself. I've heard you say the following. The world is a very malleable place.[2:39:39] Andrew Huberman: If you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. That's a remarkable quote, because it says at least 2 things, to me. 1 is that, you have a very Clear understanding of the inner workings of these great innovators. We talked a little bit about that earlier, These 5 traits, etcetera. But that also you have an intense understanding of the world landscape.[2:40:11] Andrew Huberman: And the way that we've been talking about it for the last hour or so is that it is a really intense and kind of oppressive landscape. You've got countries and organizations and elites and, journalists, you know, that are trying to not necessarily trying, but are suppressing the innovation process. I mean, that's sort of the the picture that I'm getting. So It's like it we're trying to innovate inside of a vice that's getting progressively tighter, and yet this quote argues that it is the the Person, the boy or girl, man or woman who says, well, you know what? That all might be true, but My view of the world is the way the world's gonna bend, or I'm gonna create a dent in that vice that allows me to exist the way that I want.[2:40:55] Andrew Huberman: Or you know what? I'm actually gonna uncurl the vice the other direction. And so, I met once picking up a sort of, pessimistic glass Half empty, view of the world as well as a glass half full view. And, so tell me about that, and and tell if you would, could you Tell us about that from the perspective of someone listening who is thinking, you know, I've got an idea, and I know it's a really good one because I just know.[2:41:22] Speaker 2: Mhmm.[2:41:22] Andrew Huberman: I might not have the confidence of extrinsic reward yet, but I just know. There's a seed of something. What does it take to foster that? And, how do we foster real innovation in the landscape that we're talking about?[2:41:36] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So part is I think you just I one of the ways to square it is I think you you as the innovator need to be signed up to fight the fight. Right? So and and and again, this is where, like, the fictional portrayals of startups, I think, take people off or even scientists or whatever because they the when when when there's great success stories, they get kind of prettified, after the fact, and they made they get made to be, like, cute and fun. And it's like, yeah.[2:41:55] Marc Andreessen: No. Like, if you talk to anybody who actually did any of these things, like, no. There was it was just like the these things are always just, like, brutal exercises and just, like, sheer willpower fighting, you know, fighting fighting forces that are trying to get you. So, so so part of it is you just you have to be signed up for the fight, and this kinda goes to the conscientiousness thing we're talking about. We also my partner, Ben, uses the term courage a lot, right, which is some combination of, like, just stubbornness, but coupled with, like, a willingness to Take pain, and not stop, and, you know, have people think very bad things of you for a long time, until it turns out, you know, you hopefully prove yourself prove yourself correct.[2:42:28] Marc Andreessen: And so you you have to be willing to do that. Like, it's a it's a con these are it's a it's a contact sport. Like, it's these aren't easy roads. Right? It's a contact sport.[2:42:34] Marc Andreessen: So you have to be signed up, for the fight. The advantage that you have as an innovator, is is that this at the end of the day, the truth actually matters, and all the arguments in the world. Classic Victor Hugo quote is there's nothing more powerful in the world than an idea whose time has come. Right? Like, if if it's real.[2:42:54] Marc Andreessen: Right? And and this is just pure substance. If the thing is real, if the idea is real, like, if it's a legitimately good scientific discovery, you know, about how nature works, if it's a new invention, if it's a new work of art and if it's real, you know, then you you you do at the end of the day. You have that on your side. And all of the People who are fighting you and arguing with you and telling you no.[2:43:15] Marc Andreessen: They don't have that on their side. Right? It's it's not like they're they're showing up with some other thing, and they're like, my thing is better than your thing. Like, that's not the main problem. Right.[2:43:23] Marc Andreessen: The main problem is, like, I have a thing. I'm convinced. Everybody else is telling me it's stupid, wrong. It should be illegal, whatever the thing is. But at the end of the day, I still have the thing.[2:43:32] Marc Andreessen: Right? And so and so so at the end of the day, like, yeah, the the the truth really matters. The substance really matters if it's real. It's real I'll give you an example. It's really hard historically to find an example of a new Technology that came into the world that was then pulled back.[2:43:45] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. And, you know, you and we could you know, nuclear is maybe maybe an example of that. But even still, there are still, you know, nuclear there are still nuclear plants like running Today, you know, that that that still exists. You know, I would say the same thing as scientific. Like, at least I many of you do this.[2:43:58] Marc Andreessen: I don't know. I don't know of any scientific discovery that was made, and then people like I I know I know there are areas of science that are not politically correct to talk about today, but every scientist knows the truth. Right? Like, the the truth is still the truth. I mean, even the geneticists in the Soviet Union who were forced to buy endless egoism, like, knew the whole time that it was wrong.[2:44:15] Marc Andreessen: Like, that that I'm completely convinced of.[2:44:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They couldn't delude themselves, especially because the basic Training them one gets in any field establishes some core truths upon which even the crazy ideas have to rest. And if they don't, as you pointed out, things fall to pieces. I would say that even the technologies that, did not pan out and in some cases were disastrous, but that were great ideas at the beginning are starting to pan out. So the example I'll give is that, most people are aware of the Elizabeth Holmes Theranos Debacle, to put it lightly.[2:44:49] Andrew Huberman: You know? Analyzing, what's in a single drop of blood as a way to analyze hormones and diseases The antibodies, etcetera. I mean, that's a great idea. I mean, it's a terrific idea as opposed to having a phlebotomist come to your house or you have to go in and you get tapped with know, and then pulling vials and the whole thing. There's now a company, born out of Stanford that is doing exactly what She sought to do, except that at least the courts ruled that, she fudged the thing and is that's why she's in jail right now.[2:45:19] Andrew Huberman: But the idea of getting A wide array of markers from a single drop of blood is an absolutely spectacular idea. The biggest challenge that company is going to confront is the idea that it's the next Theranos. But if they've got the thing Yeah. And they're not fudging it[2:45:35] Speaker 2: Yeah.[2:45:35] Andrew Huberman: As it apparently Theranos was, I think Everything will work out a la Victor Hugo.[2:45:42] Marc Andreessen: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Because who wants to go back?[2:45:45] Marc Andreessen: Like, when when if they if they if they if if they get to the work, if it's real Mhmm. Gonna be this is the thing. The the opponents the opponents, they're they're not bringing their own ideas. Like, they're not bringing their own ideas.[2:45:56] Speaker 2: Like, they're not bringing their[2:45:56] Marc Andreessen: own, my idea is better than yours. Like, that's not what's happening. They're bringing the silence or counterargument, right, or name calling. Right? Well, this[2:46:05] Andrew Huberman: is why I think, people who need to be loved Probably stand a, reduced chance of success. Oh, yeah.[2:46:11] Speaker 2: Yeah.[2:46:12] Andrew Huberman: And maybe that's also why having people close to you that do love you and allowing that to be sufficient Can be very beneficial. This gets back to the idea of partnership and family around innovators, because if you feel filled up by those people local to you Yep. You know, in your home Yep. Then you don't need people on the Internet saying nice things about you or your ideas because you're good[2:46:33] Speaker 2: Yeah.[2:46:34] Andrew Huberman: And you can forge forward. Another question about innovation is the teams that you assemble around you. And you've talked before about, the sort of small squadron model, you know, sort of David and Goliath, Examples as well where, you know, a small group of individuals can, create a technology that frankly outdoes what a, You know, a giant like Facebook might be doing or what, any other large company might be doing. There are a lot of theories as to why that would happen, but I know you have some unique theories. Why do you think small groups can defeat large organizations?[2:47:11] Marc Andreessen: So the conventional explanation is, I think, correct, and it's just that, large organizations have a lot of advantages, but they just have a very hard Time, actually executing anything because of all the overhead. So so large organizations have communication overhead. Right? The the number of people who have to be consulted, who have to agree on things gets to be staggering. The amount of time it takes to schedule the meeting gets It's been staggering.[2:47:34] Marc Andreessen: Mhmm. You know, you get these really big companies and they have some issue they're dealing with, and it takes, like, a month to schedule the premeeting to, like, plan for the meeting, which is gonna happen months later, which is then gonna result in a post meeting, which will then result in a board presentation, which will then result in a planning off-site. Right? And so[2:47:48] Speaker 2: they're like[2:47:48] Andrew Huberman: I thought academia was bad, but what you're describing is giving me I[2:47:51] Marc Andreessen: Saf Kafka was Kafka was a documentary. Yeah. Like, the the this is this is yeah. So the it it's just like these these are I mean, look, you'd have these organization. At a 100,000 people or like, you're an you're more of a nation state than a than a than a than a company.[2:48:03] Marc Andreessen: And you've got all these competing internal you know, it's the Bedouin thing I was saying before you got all these internal like, most big companies, your internal enemies are, like, way more dangerous to you than anybody on the outside.[2:48:11] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Can you elaborate on that?[2:48:13] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're you're big the big at a big company, the big competition is for the the next promotion. Right?[2:48:18] Marc Andreessen: And and and the enemy for the next promotion is the next executive over in your company. Like, that's your enemy. The other the competitor on the outside is like an abstraction. Maybe they'll matter someday. Whatever.[2:48:28] Marc Andreessen: I gotta beat that guy inside my own company. Right? And so the the internal warfare is at least as intense as the external warfare. And so yeah. So it's just it's I mean, this is just all the, you know, iron law of all these big big bureaucracies and how they function.[2:48:40] Marc Andreessen: So if if a big bureaucracy ever does anything productive, I think like a miracle. Like, it's like a miracle to the point where there should be, like, a celebration. Like, there should be parties. There should be, like, ticker tape parades for, like, big large organizations that actually do things. Like, that that's Great.[2:48:53] Marc Andreessen: Because it's, like, so it's so rare. It doesn't happen very often. So anyway, so that and that's the conventional explanation. Whereas, look, small small companies, small teams, you know, there's a lot that they can't do because they can't you know, not operating at scale, and they don't have global coverage, and, you know, all these kind of you know, they don't have the resources and so forth. But at least they can move quickly.[2:49:10] Marc Andreessen: Right? They can organize fast. They can have it you know, if there's an issue today, they can have a meeting today. They can solve the issue today. Right?[2:49:16] Marc Andreessen: And everybody they need to solve the issue is in the room today, Right. So they can just move a lot faster. I think that's part of it, but I think there's another deeper thing underneath that that people really don't like to talk about that takes us back full circle to where we started, which is just the Sheer number of people in the world who are capable of doing new things is just a very small set of people. And so you're not gonna have a 100 of them in a company or Thousand or 10,000, you're gonna have 3, 8 or 10, maybe. And some[2:49:43] Andrew Huberman: of them are flying too close to the sun.[2:49:44] Marc Andreessen: Some of them are blowing themselves Right. So some of them are Right. So IBM, I actually first learned this that I so my first actual job job was at IBM when it was and when it when IBM was still on top of the world right before it came the early nineties. And so when I was there, it was 440,000 employees, which and, again, if you inflation adjust, like, today for that same size of business, inflation adjusted, market size adjusted, it would be it's equivalent today of, like, a 2 or 3,000,000 person organization. It was like a it was a nation state.[2:50:09] Marc Andreessen: There were 6,000 people in my division. You know? We were next door to another building that had another people in another division. So you just you could work there for years and never meet anybody who didn't work for IBM. The first half of every meeting was just IBMers introducing themselves to each other.[2:50:22] Marc Andreessen: Like, it it was just mind boggling in the the level of of complexity, but they were so powerful, that they had, years before I got there in 1985, they were 80% of the market capitalization of the entire tech industry. Right? So so they were at a level of dominance that even, you know, Google or Apple today is not even close to, Right. At the time. So that that's how powerful they were.[2:50:41] Marc Andreessen: And so they had a system and it worked really well for, like, 50 years. They had a system which was If most of the employees in the company were expected to basically rigid follow rules. So they dressed the same, acted the same, they did everything out of the playbook. You know, they they were trained very specifically. But they had this category of people they call wild ducks.[2:50:59] Marc Andreessen: And this was an idea that the founder, Thomas Watson, has come up with, wild ducks. And the wild ducks were they often have the formal title of an IBM fellow, and they were the people who could make new things. And there were 8 of them, and they got to break all the rules. And they got to invent new products. They got to go off and work on something new.[2:51:17] Marc Andreessen: They didn't have to report back. They got to people off of other projects to work with them. They got, you know, budget when they needed it. They they reported directly to the CEO. They got whatever they needed.[2:51:27] Marc Andreessen: He them in doing it, and they were glass breakers. And, you know, and they showed, the the one in Austin at the time was this guy, Andy Heller, and he would show up in, you know, jeans and cowboy boots And, you know, amongst an ocean of men in, you know, blue suits, white shirts, red ties, and put his cowboy boots up on the table. And it was fine for antiologists to do that, and it was not fine for you to do that. Right? And so they very specifically identified.[2:51:48] Marc Andreessen: We we haven't we haven't we have, like, a, Like, almost like an aristocratic class within our our company that gets to play by different rules. Now the expectation is they deliver. Right? They they their job is to embed the breakthrough product, but we, IBM management, know that the 6,000 person division is not gonna bet the next product. We know it's gonna be crazy Andy Heller and his, in his cowboy boots.[2:52:08] Marc Andreessen: And so I I was always, like, very impressed. Like and, again, like, ultimately, IBM had its issues, but, like, that model worked for 50 years. Right? Like, worked incredibly well. And I I think that's Basically, the model that works.[2:52:18] Marc Andreessen: And so it's but it's a paradox. Right? Which is, like, how do you have a large bureaucratic regimented organization, whether it's academia or government or business or anything that has all these rule followers and and all these people who are jealous of their status and don't want things to change, but then still have that Spark of of of creativity. I would say mostly it's impossible. Like like, mostly it just doesn't happen.[2:52:41] Marc Andreessen: Those people get driven out. Right. And and in tech, what happens is those people get driven out because we will fund them. Mhmm. These are the people we fund.[2:52:47] Marc Andreessen: Right?[2:52:47] Speaker 2: I was[2:52:47] Andrew Huberman: gonna say, I I gather that you are in the business of Finding and funding the wild ducks.[2:52:52] Marc Andreessen: The wild ducks. That's exactly right. And and, actually, this is actually to to close the close the loop. This is actually, I think, the simplest explanation for why IBM ultimately caved in and then HP of in the eighties also came you know, these I've been a HP kind of were model they were these incredible monolithic, incredible companies for 40 or 50 years, and then they kind of both came down in the eighties nineties. And I and I actually think it was the emergence of venture capital.[2:53:12] Marc Andreessen: It was the emergence of a parallel funding system where the wild ducks or in HP's case, their their superstar People could actually leave and start their own companies. And, again, it goes back to university discussion we're having is, like, this is what doesn't exist at the university level. Mhmm.

Right. Exactly. Right.[2:53:34] Andrew Huberman: Which clearly have picked up some, some momentum, and I Yeah. I would hope that these other wild duck models will, will, move quickly. Yeah.[2:53:42] Marc Andreessen: But the one thing you know. Right? And you you know this. Like, the one thing you know is the people on the other side are gonna be mad as hell.[2:53:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're going to well, I think, they're past denial.
