I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere. Jeff Cavalier holds a master of science in physical therapy and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist. He did his training at the University of Connecticut Storrs, One of the top 5 programs in the world in physical therapy and sports medicine.[0:00:30] Andrew Huberman: I discovered Jeff Cavaliere over 10 years ago from his online content. His online content includes information about how to train for strength, how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth, how to train for endurance, as well as how to rehabilitate injuries to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition, and supplementation. I've always found his content to be incredibly science based, incredibly clear, sometimes surprising, and always incredibly actionable. Is therefore not surprising that he has one of the largest online platforms for fitness, nutrition, supplementation, and injury rehabilitation. Jeff has also worked with an enormous number of professional athletes and has served as head physical therapist and assistant strength coach for the New York Mets.[0:01:15] Andrew Huberman: Again, the content that Jeff Cavalier has posted online has been so immensely useful to me over the years that I was absolutely thrilled to get the chance to sit down with him Ask him about everything from how to train in terms of how to split up the body parts that you train across the week, how to integrate Strength training and endurance training, when to stretch, how to stretch. Indeed, we talked about nutrition. We talk a bit about supplementation. We talk about how to really avoid creating imbalances in muscle and in neural control over muscle. So one thing that's really wonderful about Jeff is he really has an understanding of not just how muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments work together, but how the nervous system interfaces with those.[0:01:55] Andrew Huberman: We talked about the mental side of training, including when to bring specific Concentration to the muscles that you're training and when to think more about how to move weights through space and think more about the movements overall. I'm certain that you'll find the conversation that we held to be immensely useful and informative for your fitness practices and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general And how to set up a lifelong fitness practice, one that will give you the strength that you desire, one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire, one that will set you up For endurance and cardiovascular health, basically an overall fitness program. I really feel this is where Jeff Cavalier shines above and beyond so many of the other PTs fitness so called influencers that are out there. Again, everything is grounded in science, everything is clear, and everything is actionable. And while we do cover an enormous amount of information during today's episode, if you want to dive even deeper into that information, you can go to athleanx .com, where you'll find some of Jeff's programs.[0:02:53] Andrew Huberman: You can also find him at athleanx on YouTube. There, you will find videos, for instance, like the how to repair Or heal from lower back pain, something that I actually followed directly long before I ever met Jeff, has over 32,000,000 views, and that is not by accident. It's because the protocols again are surprising and actionable. They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery.[0:03:15] Jeff Cavaliere: So I'm[0:03:15] Andrew Huberman: immensely grateful for that content. And it extends into everything from, again, hypertrophy, endurance, and strength training, and so on. Again, it's athleanx.com as the website, athleanx On YouTube and also AthleanX on Instagram. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce that we partnered with Momentous Supplements. We've done that for several reasons.[0:03:34] Andrew Huberman: First of all, the quality of their supplements is exceedingly high. Second of all, we wanted to have a location where You could find all of the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast in one easy to find place. You can now find that place at livemomentousdot com/huberman. In addition, Momenta supplements ship internationally, something that a lot of other supplement companies simply do not do. So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US or you live abroad.[0:03:58] Andrew Huberman: Right now, not all of the supplements that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed, But that catalog of supplements is being expanded very rapidly, and a good number of them that we've talked about, some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus, and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there. Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com/hubron. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:04:34] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG one. I started taking AG one way back in 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking AG one and the reason I still take AG one twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational health needs for mental health, physical health, and performance. As I mentioned earlier, it has vitamins and minerals that cover any deficiencies I might have In my diet, it also has probiotics, and the probiotics are key for supporting the so called gut microbiome. The gut microbiome are trillions of little microbacteria that live in our gut From our throat all the way down to the base of our gut that support everything from our immune system to our hormone health to the so called gut Brain axis, that is our gut and our brain are in direct communication with one another in ways that support our mood, our ability to think, and overall brain health.[0:05:23] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs, make it very easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Vitamin d three and k two are essential For an enormous number of aspects of your mental health, physical health, and performance by impacting things like hormone regulation, calcium regulation, and cardiovascular health. Again, go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim that special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.[0:05:56] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with heating and sleep tracking and, importantly, cooling capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast and on another podcast About the close relationship between temperature and sleep. That is your body temperature has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in order Fall asleep and waking up involves heating up of your body by about 1 to 3 degrees. Now some people run cold during the night. They need to heat their Sleeping environment.[0:06:21] Andrew Huberman: Other people run too hot during the night. I'm one such person. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night if I get warm at all. With 8 Sleep, I'm able to cool my sleeping environment a very precise way, even so precise that I can control the temperature at the beginning, middle, and end of the night so that I fall asleep easily, stay deeply asleep, and wake up feeling better than I've ever felt before. The PodPro cover by 8 Sleep is their most advanced solution on the market for thermal regulation.[0:06:46] Andrew Huberman: It pairs dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking if you wanna use that. Also has this nice feature that it'll vibrate in the morning to wake you up. I rather like that vibration feature too. You can add the cover to any mattress and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as a 110 degrees Fahrenheit. So again, it can be customized to your sleep needs.[0:07:05] Andrew Huberman: If you wanna try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman and check out the ProPod cover and save $150 at checkout. They currently ship within the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman to save $150 at Check out. Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca. Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality.[0:07:27] Andrew Huberman: Company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA Eyeglasses and Sunglasses is made with performance in mind. That said, the aesthetics of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses is superb. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order to be able to see clearly. Roca understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses in a manner such that When you move from, say, a shady area to a brightly lit area or when you are in different lit environments indoors, you can always see with crystal clarity. And they won't Slip off if you sweat.[0:08:03] Andrew Huberman: In fact, they were originally designed for exercise. You can wear them while running or cycling, but they have a terrific aesthetic. So unlike a lot The so called performance or exercise glasses that are out there that make people frankly look like cyborgs, in my opinion. Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses look terrific. Be proud to wear them to work or out to dinner or when you exercise.[0:08:22] Andrew Huberman: If you wanna try ROKA glasses, you can go to ROKA. Com, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's Roka, r o k a.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. And now for my discussion with Jeff Cavalier. Jeff, such a pleasure for me[0:08:39] Jeff Cavaliere: to have you here. I'm glad to be here. It's amazing.[0:08:42] Andrew Huberman: Now I'm a long time consumer of your content. I've learned a tremendous amount about fitness, Both in the weight room, cardio, nutrition, things that I've applied for over a decade. So for me, this is particularly meaningful. And my goal here is really to ask a bunch of questions to which I'm interested in the answers, but also, for which I know the audience is really curious about. So one of your mantras is, you know, if you wanna look like an athlete, train like an athlete.[0:09:13] Andrew Huberman: And I think that's something really special that sets aside What you do from what a lot of other, very well qualified people do. And in terms of The use of weights and resistance, whether or not it's body weight or weights in the gym or pulleys versus cardio. You know, in terms of overall health, Aesthetics and athleticism. Is there a way that you could point to, you know, the idea that maybe people should be doing, You know, 50% resistance training and 50% cardio, maybe it's 70 30, maybe it's 30 70. And and here, I'm talking about the typical person who would like to maintain or maybe even, add some muscle mass, Probably in particular areas for most people as opposed to just overall mass, although we'll talk about that later.[0:09:59] Andrew Huberman: And people wanna maintain a relatively low body fat percentage being good cardiovascular health, what's the sort of contour of a basic program that anybody could think about as a starting place?[0:10:11] Jeff Cavaliere: I I think it's like a 60 40 split, which would be leaning towards, weight training, you know, strength and and and, And then, you know, the conditioning aspect be about 40%. So if you look at it over a course of a training week, I mean, 5 days in a gym would be a great Tasking. Obviously, not in the gym. It could be done at home. But 3 days strength training, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.[0:10:31] Jeff Cavaliere: Conditioning, Tuesday, Thursday. You know, 2 days. It's a it's a pretty Easy roundabout way to split that up, of course, depending upon training goals. And as you said, the aesthetic goals, like, that will shift dramatically. But if you wanna see the benefits of both, that's probably the the effective dose for strength training and the effective dose for conditioning at the bare minimum level.[0:10:51] Jeff Cavaliere: Again, being a much better performer conditioning wise, you're gonna wanna do more than that.[0:10:55] Andrew Huberman: And in terms of the duration of those workouts, What's your suggestion? I I've been weight training for about 30 years, running for about 30 years, and mainly for health, And have found that if I work hard in the gym or at resistance training for more than 60 minutes or so, It's very hard for me to recover. I start getting colds. I start getting weaker from workout to workout. But amazingly, at least to me, if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes 10 minutes of warm up and 50, 50 minutes or so of really hard work for resistance training, And I keep the cardiovascular work to about 30 to 45 minutes.[0:11:34] Andrew Huberman: I feel great, and I seem to make some progress at least some place in the workout from workout to workout.[0:11:39] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. I mean, it's those are good numbers because those are kinda numbers that we usually preach. We try to keep our workouts to an hour or less, if possible. Now depending upon The split that you're following, if you're on a total body split, there's just gonna be more that has to be done in a given amount of time, that and, again, if you're training primarily for strength, that could prolong the workout because the longer rest time is in between sets. But in general, when you're not Focused on that one aspect, but the overall health picture, then you can get the job done in in under in under an hour.[0:12:08] Jeff Cavaliere: And, again, I always say On top of if if you wanna look like an athlete, train like an athlete is you can either train long or you could train hard, but you can't do both. And I really believe that The focus for me, I have a busy life. I have a lot of other things that I do, believe it or not, and it's like, I I wanna go hard, and I wanna go get out. And I find that my body also responds to that. I think a lot of guys' bodies respond to that.[0:12:29] Jeff Cavaliere: And, particularly, as you start to get older, I think it's the it's the length of the workout that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you're doing, Particularly if you're warmed up properly, like you said, I found personally that my warm up has had to become more of an integral part of my my workout than it ever has before. I never I could get in the gym when I was 20, and I'm going right over. I'm doing 1 set, 2 sets. I'm in, and I am ready to go. You know?[0:12:55] Jeff Cavaliere: And I never do another workout, warm up set for any of the other Exercise I do the rest of the day. That's not that's not true anymore. You know? And I found that as long as I'm willing to sort of give myself a little bit of a warm up, The intensity is not what bothers me. You know?[0:13:08] Jeff Cavaliere: I'm I'm I'm very much in control of the weights that I use, and it it doesn't bother me. But if I start to go pretty long, I start to feel achy or I start to have problems. So, again, depending upon age, that also plays a factor in the length. But, again, I think everybody can achieve, on a standard program, can achieve the results that they want within an hour.[0:13:27] Andrew Huberman: In terms of Splits. You mentioned splits. And so for those who aren't familiar with this, term, splits, it's really, which body parts are you training on which days? Seems like Almost everybody follows a weekly workout schedule, although the body, of course, doesn't care about the week. Right?[0:13:42] Andrew Huberman: There's no reason to think that once every 7 days or twice every 7 days makes sense physiologically. It's just The body doesn't work that but that's the way life is structured. I've seen you discuss, you know, 3 days a week, whole body workouts. Mhmm. I've heard of splits like a pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another day, a day off, repeat.[0:14:03] Andrew Huberman: I mean, there's so many variations on this. What are some general themes that we can throw out there? And in order to avoid the the huge matrix of possibilities, you have some wonderful content that points those, and we will cap in our Captions show notes will link out to some of those that are different ways to design splits. But in terms of giving people a logic of how to think about splitting up body parts, Oh, what's governing the the split? What what are the rules and the logic that dictate a split?[0:14:30] Jeff Cavaliere: For me, the first rule is, will you stick to it? Right? Like, if you because there are split I don't I don't particularly like full body splits. I was actually talking to Jesse about that the other day. Like, I don't necessarily like To have to train everything now, of course, the volumes will come down per muscle group.[0:14:45] Jeff Cavaliere: But if you don't like To do that and you actually don't look forward to your workout because you're dreading having to do everything and feeling maybe too fatigued by the time your workout's over, Or the fact that those generally do take a little bit longer and don't fit into your schedule, I don't care how effective the split is. A split not done is not effective. So you need to find one that fits. So maybe you go into an alternative option like, a push pull legs like you mentioned. And That could be done either 1 cycle through the week, on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split, or it could be twice in a week so you're actually training 6 times, You know, where where you repeat it.[0:15:20] Jeff Cavaliere: You know, pull push legs, pull push legs, or or, you know, you know, however you wanna do it with either a day off in between the 3 days or at the end of the 6 days. And, again, that actually impacts your schedule. I've broken that down before where it's, you know, if you put it in between the 3 days, it's good because you're giving yourself an extra rest day in between, But it starts to shift that day off every week as we wrap around. So for those guys that were choosing that 7 day schedule at a convenience in our heads, you know, it starts to mess with that off day. So others like to just keep it predictably, let's say, on a Sunday and train 6 days in a row.[0:15:52] Jeff Cavaliere: But that's a but that's a a better way to maybe Group similar muscle actions together, which I think I I definitely prefer that because if I'm going to be training, you know, pulling movements, At least there there's a synergy between them, and I feel like I'm looking to achieve one goal that day. And then, I mean, quite honestly, could go back to the bro split days, and these those still work effectively. There's a reason why they worked in the past. Like, I think that science shows that there's smarter ways to do them these days. Like, you can you can come back and hit a related muscle.[0:16:27] Jeff Cavaliere: So you could do, Let's say biceps on one day and then come back 2 days later and do back realizing, again, synergy between the the exercises there. Your biceps are gonna get restimulated again. So you could figure out ways to make that work, but the thing that I think is is effective there is that tends to be one of the ones that people like the most Because they can go in, they get their pump, they feel good, the it's it's pretty solely focused on 1 muscle group.[0:16:51] Andrew Huberman: Is that the definition of a bro split? One Once[0:16:54] Jeff Cavaliere: a group a day. Yeah.[0:16:55] Andrew Huberman: I see. So it's very much geared towards strength and aesthetics, really maximizing[0:16:59] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Chest Probably probably more more aesthetics than strength. Yeah. You're just Hence the bro.[0:17:04] Andrew Huberman: With the bro name. Right.[0:17:05] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. But but, again, like, you know, in here, I am a science guy, and I I could appreciate the benefits of a bro split, especially because, again, like, what To what to what end? You know, who who's who's goal are we are we trying to achieve here, theirs or or ours? You know? Like, I mean, if If I'm applying my standards and my goals or even, like, athletic ideals, but they just wanna get in shape, then it's perfectly fine to to do a To do a bro split in that instance, if you're sticking to it again and you're seeing the results that you wanna see from it.[0:17:34] Jeff Cavaliere: But they're able to, You know, really keep their focus on 1 muscle. They get to focus on you know? Like, look. A lot of times people struggle with the the way of, an exercise feels until their 2nd or third Set. Like, they don't have that proprioceptive ability to kinda lock in on an exercise.[0:17:49] Jeff Cavaliere: So spending a few not only sets in the same, You know, exercise, but then doing another exercise in the same muscle group helps them to dial in a little bit better and get more out of their training.[0:17:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That raised a really Interesting, I think, important question. Early on when I started, resistance training, which was when I was 16 in high school, I Got in touch with, and I was learning from Mike Mentzer.[0:18:10] Jeff Cavaliere: Right? Me too. So, so interesting. Yeah. Crazy.[0:18:13] Andrew Huberman: When and Mike was very helpful. Very, very helpful. We got to be friendly.[0:18:16] Jeff Cavaliere: I was like read his book. I didn't get a chance to be, so I'm jealous right now.[0:18:20] Andrew Huberman: I back then, no Internet. I, You know, I paid by Western Union type thing to to send him some money For[0:18:26] Jeff Cavaliere: the back of the magazine.[0:18:27] Andrew Huberman: He got on the phone with me, and and my mother at the time was like, why is this grown man calling the house? And he gave me a a very straightforward split, which was shoulders and arms. One day, he had to be taking 2 days off and then training legs, and then 2 days off and then chest and back, etcetera.[0:18:41] Jeff Cavaliere: And and that and that's a variation of a bro split too, where you're sort of, know, breaking them down that way, chest and back or chest and bias. You know? Yeah.[0:18:47] Andrew Huberman: And it worked very well for me. I probably would've because of my age, I think, and because it was the I was untrained. I think it largely untrained. I think it would have grown on on many different programs, but it worked very well for me. I eventually just just, made that in every other day thing.[0:19:01] Andrew Huberman: So shoulders, arms, day off, legs, day or two off because if we hit legs right, at least for me Okay. I'm not training[0:19:06] Jeff Cavaliere: the next day.[0:19:08] Andrew Huberman: And then I'm not doing much of anything athletic the next day, and chest back and repeat and so on. And the reason I found that helpful is I almost always recovered between workouts. The the 6 day a week program of push, pull legs, push, pull legs, to me, seems excruciating, from 2 standpoints, 1 is, at least with my recovery abilities or lack of recovery abilities, I can't imagine coming back feeling fresh. And the other one is if I if I'm in the gym more than 4 days a week, I really start to fatigue it about the whole psychological experience of it. Whereas if I'm in there 3 or 4 days a week Yeah.[0:19:43] Andrew Huberman: In other words, if I put a day off in between each workout, I really want to be there, and I get in there with with a lot of fire. And I'm also doing other things on the off days. So I think that I'd love that you mentioned the the split that you'll stick to Yeah. And that you can bring the intensity to, because I think that that's really important. I sometimes hear about 2 a day training.[0:20:03] Andrew Huberman: I've done 2 a day training twice in my lifetime. Both times, I got sick. 2 days later[0:20:07] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. That is[0:20:08] Andrew Huberman: That's correlation, not causation. Yeah. You know? But, Is there ever an instance where 2 a day weight training makes sense for the nondrug assisted, typical recovery ability Person.[0:20:21] Jeff Cavaliere: I I actually I I think it makes sense in some scenarios, but it doesn't make sense practically for a lot of people's schedules. So, like, If you could break down let's say you were gonna do even a, you know, a a some version of a of a total body session or maybe, like, you're gonna do a an upper lower split. Right? You could do an upper workout and do the anterior chain or the pushing portion of that in 1 session and then come back and do the Polling session later on at night, if you had the opportunity to, the thing that you benefit from there is the freshness of focus. Again, like, Something in my head sack is sacrificed by the time you get towards the latter half of whatever workout you're in.[0:21:01] Jeff Cavaliere: It's the same point you made before. Like, you start to approach that 50 minutes an hour, you know, mark, you are either losing focus. You're losing energy. You're losing contract viability. You're losing something.[0:21:11] Jeff Cavaliere: And if you're relegating whatever it is, the pulling portion of that to the end of that workout, something suffers so that okay. And that if they realize that's happening, then maybe you them up the next time you do the workout where the pulling portion of the upper workout goes first, and then the pushing goes later, so you're at least not Just continuing that cycle. But at the same time, if you were able to kinda split them up, you get a chance to kinda take a break. You could have that freshness of focus again, you could actually get a better effort in because, again, I think effort drives the results. So if the effort is not compromised, then you should be able to do that.[0:21:44] Jeff Cavaliere: But systemically, is that a problem? And I think that it is a problem for a lot of people. It's just hard to it's hard to rev the engine up a lot of times, you know, in the day. You know, you warm that thing up once. It's like that car in the winter.[0:21:55] Jeff Cavaliere: You get it going once. You're lucky. Okay. Now you gotta drive it the rest of the day. But, you know, it it you put it in the garage And try to start the next day, it it's it's a problem.[0:22:04] Jeff Cavaliere: So, you know, young people can get away with a lot more than than older people could.[0:22:08] Andrew Huberman: You know? I've never had a strong recovery quotient, but if I stick to this one day off in between, every once in a while, 2 days in a row, training maybe I have to travel, and I wanna make sure I get all the workouts in kind of thing. I seem to be okay. I like your example of warming up the car, spoken like a true East Coast, East Coast, for those of us from the West Coast, I don't know. I took a moment there, but, no.[0:22:28] Andrew Huberman: I we we folks on the East Coast and the Midwest get it and certainly from from Europe. In terms of the mixing up of cardiovascular training and resistance training, same day, different day, which one should come first? Which one could should come second? If one's Main goals, again, everyone listening has different goals, are most people would like to either maintain or gain some muscle. I don't know many people that wanna lose muscle.[0:22:56] Andrew Huberman: Maintainer gains some muscle usually in specific locations on their body. Most people would like to be a bit leaner or a lot leaner. There are a few people out there that are Either naturally lean or don't want or actually just wanna gain weight. But assuming that people wanna get leaner, put on some muscle, maintain muscle, and wanna have a healthy heart and a healthy brain, which basically requires a healthy cardiovascular system. How would you incorporate cardiovascular work into the overall weekly regimen.[0:23:23] Jeff Cavaliere: So, again, I I I think that the, you know, the bare minimum is probably twice a week in terms of cardiovascular if you wanna have some semblance of cardiovascular conditioning. But I think most people who actually need it more or wanna pursue it more than that are gonna need more time to do that. So, at some point, it can't just be relegated to a day off or a day off from the from the weight training workouts. So At some point, it has to occur on the same day. You know?[0:23:48] Jeff Cavaliere: And in that case, I just like to put it, if that is your not your primary goal, but you're looking more For the just the overall picture, you know, the aesthetics you mentioned putting muscle on in certain areas, then I would put it at the end of the workout because you don't wanna in any way compromise The weight training work workout. And as we've sort of referenced a couple times already, the the intensity of those workouts is important. And We know there's a strength component to those workouts also that is going to, you know, be a helpful stimulus for growth. So the conditioning, the cardio, that stuff done prior to any training you know, strength training workout is likely going to impair your ability to perform at your best. So unless it's just done for a quick little warm up in the beginning, but then it's not sustained long enough really to be a benefit for cardiovascular conditioning.[0:24:34] Jeff Cavaliere: So I just like to, you know, put that at at the end realizing that even if my effort level is Lower. My output is lower. If it's still placing a demand on my cardiac output to get that conditioning effect because I'm fatigued, it still has a demand on my cardiac output, so it's still achieving its goal, but it didn't interfere with my main goal of being able to increase my performance in the gym.[0:24:58] Andrew Huberman: Got it. And in terms of the form of cardiovascular training, I've seen you, do a number of, I have to say, very impressive, high intensity interval type Work. So burpee type work or push ups with, you know, with crunches mixed into them. Anyway, people can see your videos to to I didn't describe those, in the best way. But, rather than, on the treadmill or out jogging for 30, 45 minutes, is that because you prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type, training, or is it because you live in cold Connecticut, like, and you don't wanna be out jogging on the roads in the middle of winter?[0:25:34] Andrew Huberman: What[0:25:35] Jeff Cavaliere: I think all of the above. I mean, those are factors, you know, from a personal level, but I think that if if you are if we could blend Function across these realms and not have such a delineation between this is my weight training and this is my conditioning, but figure out a way to To blend them together, I always think that you've get you've got a better opportunity to get that more well rounded result. And I like to kinda mix up that straight conditioning work and also some of the footwork, you know, drills. Like, we have we we have some high expectations for guys that come into our programs, Like, to just do some footwork drills, like ladders, like ladders or or line drills or something. And you know what happens?[0:26:15] Jeff Cavaliere: People become intrigued and interested. Like, I never I haven't tried this since, High school. You know? And they become interested in just the challenge of it. And then as we become almost distracted by the challenge, We're now, like, finding ourselves conditioning.[0:26:28] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? And and I always think that's an important part that sometimes you gotta draw people in, to get to show them what they might be interested in. And from the output or the effect of it, I just think that when you're able to blend some of some you know, still maintain some of that Strength training into the exercise. So as you mentioned, let's say I'm doing some kind of a push up or a burpee. I mean, there is there is a, An anaerobic component to that that is going to be helpful, that than rather than just walking or just jogging.[0:26:57] Jeff Cavaliere: Not just not to say that that isn't an effective means for strict cardiac conditioning. It's a it's one of the ways that we've had for, you know, centuries, you know, to do it. But I just think that if we can blend it, then it becomes maybe a little bit more interesting, and you get some of those crossover benefits. It doesn't become so segmented in terms of what we're trying to do.[0:27:17] Andrew Huberman: I love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning. That's not something that I've thought of before, and And it's simply because I've overlooked it, but it makes sense because my sister who's reasonably fit, although I'm always trying to get her to[0:27:31] Jeff Cavaliere: do a bit more. Mhmm.[0:27:32] Andrew Huberman: She always asked me, you know, what should I take? And I'm a I'm a believer in supplements for certain people in certain instances, but I keep telling her, you know, it's the behaviors are going to and nutrition are gonna have the the greatest outsized positive effect, and she loves things like, dance classes and things that, or kickboxing, these kinds of things, which so it makes sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect and kinda trick them into doing more cardio[0:27:58] Jeff Cavaliere: Right.[0:27:58] Andrew Huberman: So to speak, that that's terrific. Also, the neuroscientist in me just has to say, forgive me, that anytime you're engaging the, you know, the 2 sets of motor neurons, the ones in your brain, the upper motor neurons, and the ones in your spinal cord. Anytime you're engaging those upper motor neurons, which are for deliberate, well controlled action, You're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So, I'm now I need to incorporate some actual skills into my training. Going back to weight training a bit, one of the most important things I learned from you, so, over the years was that When training to increase muscle size, to really think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles.[0:28:41] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[0:28:42] Andrew Huberman: I also heard this from, my friend, Ben Pokalski, who's a very well accomplished he was a bodybuilder. Now he's into other aspects of fitness, teaches fitness, but Don't move weights, challenge muscles, unless you're trying to power lift or something of that sort, which I'm not. Immensely helpful. But the other thing that I learned from you That, combined with that was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get Stronger much more easily. Maybe even we'll recover better because of our ability to contract them really hard.[0:29:12] Andrew Huberman: And this, what I call the cavalier test, which is, At least if if I could paraphrase the so for instance, if I can, it's always the bicep, isn't it? Let's use the let's use the calf or the bicep. If you can If you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, like, it almost feels like a cramp or a cramp, or you can flex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a little bit. Almost feels like it's nodding up. That's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load if you're doing the movement properly.[0:29:43] Andrew Huberman: Right. And that's the feeling to actually aim for each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition. For me, this completely transformed my results. Mhmm. This was, I think, maybe 5, 6 years ago that I first heard this from you.[0:29:55] Andrew Huberman: Body parts that for me lagged behind that I thought maybe genetically weren't gonna work for me Immediately just started growing. Yeah. Right? And I was getting stronger and stronger, and I thought this is really something so much so that I dedicated a portion of my research Along with in collaboration with another group to try and understand what's happening in these upper motor neurons in the brain that can engage the muscles even more. And that it's not just about progressive overload or putting a pump into the muscle, That it's really this mind muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results and that you can get better at it.[0:30:32] Andrew Huberman: So, forgive me for paraphrasing. Your incredible content around this made a tremendous difference for me and a number of other people that I've passed that along to. But, what can you first of all, how did you arrive at that? Because we hear about the mind muscle connection, but I really heard it first from you. How did you arrive at this kind of cramped test, the cavalier test as I'll call it.[0:30:52] Andrew Huberman: It's always weird when people name things after themselves in science, but other scientists can name things. So there is now officially the cavalier test is whether or not You can cramp the muscle in the absence of load just flexing it to the point where it hurts a little bit. That would be an an in a good indication that you could grow that muscle well. How did you come[0:31:09] Jeff Cavaliere: up with this? I mean, it just it honestly, it's something that that made sense to me because during my Workouts even as a as a young kid just starting out, like, I always wanted to know what is it working. You know? A lot of people ask that question more so than you think. Like, what is this supposed to work?[0:31:26] Jeff Cavaliere: And a lot and and I don't know if you've ever noticed, but, like, when people ask that question if they're if they're being trained by a trainer, and the trainer say, well, just do this. Do this exercise, and they'll show you how to do it. But then they'll say, but what is it supposed to work? Where am I supposed to feel this? Right?[0:31:40] Jeff Cavaliere: People, Did they just inherently ask that question? A lot of people will. I was one of those that did that, and I asked that question not because I knew what I was doing, but just because I don't know. I wanted to know what was supposed to be doing the work. Once you do that and you start to seek that out and say, okay.[0:31:56] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, the bicep is what's supposed to be doing the work, Then I wanna make sure the bicep's doing the work. Right? So then I would just sort of really, like, tweak the movement to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable or get Stronger contraction, knowing if that's supposed to do the job, it wasn't until PT school that I'm, you know, learning, oh, well, you know, flexion of the elbow is the brachialis and the bias, and the bias is responsible for like, you start to I learned other components of it, but all I wanted to know was to bring my arm up in a curl, what is supposed to do the job. So I would seek out ways to make that happen better. And when I was able to do that, I could feel the stronger contraction.[0:32:33] Jeff Cavaliere: And I just I don't know what it I just I was no visionary. I just felt like I I knew that that was gonna be better for me if the muscle I was trying to grow was being stressed more effectively. So When I was, attempting to do this across different exercises, I would notice that what I could do potentially on a Curl where my arm is up you know, where you're asking me to flex my bicep, that position, I couldn't do if I was, you know, doing a concentration curl, or I couldn't Carry over to a cable curl, and that shouldn't really change. Right? Because the function is still largely the same.[0:33:08] Jeff Cavaliere: There's still elbow flexion. There's still supination. Like, Why am I not able to do it there? And that's where it sort of clued into me that, like, you your mind muscle connection on not just Your mind with 1 muscle, but on every exercise matters, and it varies from exercise to exercise. And even if you don't gain muscle size doing that, although I think it's very hard not to, especially if you're not used to doing that.[0:33:32] Jeff Cavaliere: There there's a term I like to call muscularity, You know, which is a difference. Right? It's the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle. That improves dramatically. You know?[0:33:41] Jeff Cavaliere: If you can learn how to just start to Engage that muscle better. The muscularity, the the resting tone of that muscle is harder. It's more it's more, at attention, it's just more it it's it's more alive. You know? And it's all driven from being able to connect Better neurologically with the muscle that you that you're trying to train.[0:34:01] Jeff Cavaliere: I've talked about a lot. Inefficiency is really what you're trying to Seek in movements when you're trying to create hypertrophy, when goal when strength is your goal, efficiency of the movement is what you're looking for. You're looking to have Muscles tie together and work well efficiently, the chest, the shoulders, the triceps to get a bar off of your chest or in a bench press. You're not looking to Make it a very inefficient, you know, leverages for your chest to try to grow your chest in a bench press. You're trying to let the whole package come together for a greater output.[0:34:32] Jeff Cavaliere: When you're trying to go and create muscle hypertrophy or even this muscularity that I talk about, you need to seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable. Right. If you don't feel the discomfort, then you're doing something wrong. And, I struggle to this day on certain muscle groups to still do that even knowing what I'm trying to work And knowing what the goal of everything I'm preaching here, it's very difficult for some muscles and for certain people to do this on certain muscles. But As you mentioned, practice does help.[0:34:58] Jeff Cavaliere: And the more you become, you know, consistent and deliberate with what you're trying to do, the more of an of a result you actually get.[0:35:05] Andrew Huberman: It's a couple of really poor boys I'd like to to, delve into further. First of all, My hunch was always that the muscle groups that grew easy most easily and that I could contract hardest without any, The the first time I did the cavalier test got 10 out of 10. We give it a 10 out of 10 scale.[0:35:25] Jeff Cavaliere: You know,[0:35:25] Andrew Huberman: it could just, like, cinch isolate those muscles, cinch them, grow them easily. I mean, there's certain why parts. I don't wanna say which ones because it doesn't really matter, that I always felt like if I just did push ups, they would grow, and these muscles are far away from any of the muscles that are supposed to[0:35:37] Jeff Cavaliere: be involved[0:35:37] Andrew Huberman: in push ups, It has to do with the sports that I played when I was younger. So I swam. I played soccer. I skateboard.[0:35:51] Jeff Cavaliere: Yep.[0:35:51] Andrew Huberman: And then later, I boxed. And so, The muscles involved in those sports were always very easy to engage later when I went into the gym. Yeah. So I guess, Perhaps a call to parents, you know, having kids do a lot of dynamic activity, seems like it might be a good idea. The other thing is This issue of of muscularity, I am so glad you brought that up.[0:36:12] Andrew Huberman: There are an I have to imagine a large number of listeners who don't wanna get bigger. They don't wanna take up a larger clothing size. They don't want to take up more space. In fact, some of them would like to take up less space, but they They want that quality that you're describing, which is the you know, oftentimes, you hear it more in the, here, I'm stereotyping a bit, but I with kindness. You know, you hear From women who are having weight training, they say, I don't wanna get big often.[0:36:38] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes they do, but most most women that I've helped weight train or talked about weight train say, I don't wanna get big. I wanna get tone. Right. I think what they're referring to is this quality that of muscularity 100%. This idea that at at resting or at close to rest or anytime someone reaches out and grabs a glass that that muscles almost look like they're kind of twitching underneath the skin, and yet it's not saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.[0:37:00] Andrew Huberman: Right. So this thing of muscularity or or resting tone, you know, has a physiological basis. I think it's how readily the nerves are communicating with the muscles. And you're saying that by learning to engage the muscles more actively, the resting tone or muscularity can improve. Have you seen that both in men and women?[0:37:20] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Oh, yeah.[0:37:21] Andrew Huberman: And and do you think this is something that takes, upkeep, maintenance, or that you you know, once you develop that in a muscle, you can just kinda let it coast?[0:37:29] Jeff Cavaliere: So I think, like, everything, it it requires upkeep. You know, use or lose it, I do believe, firmly. But, like, I think that it's the the development of the connection's gonna be harder than the maintenance connection. As I said, I still struggle to this day myself with, you know, unnamed muscle groups, you know, also. You know?[0:37:47] Jeff Cavaliere: But, like, You know, there's just there's there's just certain, areas that are harder for your brain for whatever reason to just develop That that connection, that that type of level to create create that extra strong contraction. But I think that it with Proper dedication and focus, and I'll go right out and say, you know, Cavs is one of the areas that I don't I don't necessarily have a great connection with. And I also obviously must not care so much because I don't put in the time and effort to create that connection as I could. So I think what might happen is, you know, yeah, there could be a struggle there, but then with with struggle comes disinterest. You're like, well, screw it.[0:38:25] Jeff Cavaliere: I'm a I'm a I'm a CAF not, and I'm not gonna do anything about it. You know? So I think if you put the the the required effort in and the time and repetitions that you will develop that. And once you do develop it, it's gonna stick around A lot longer than it would had you not invested any time into it at all, you know, not requiring as much of that. But, I mean, I I don't know.[0:38:43] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, you know, you mentioned Now when you train, it's like you're you're just this is just part of how you train now. Like, you're going hard. You're trying to, you know, really forcefully contract. You're not just moving the weight, I say, from point a to point b, but you're, like, trying to contract the weight through that range. That is a mindset that I try to Put into what everything I'm doing, unless, of course, I'm focused on a strength exercise where I'm just trying to lift a greater amount and use all the muscles together.[0:39:12] Jeff Cavaliere: But when the goal is inefficiency for hypertrophy, I am really trying to create that contraction, and it's just part of my training. So I guess that, you know, that for consistency's sake, as long as I'm training, it's happening. You know? As if I if I get away from training, then it's not happening at all. But, you know, even there, I probably, another embarrassing admission probably, you know, will mindfully do it throughout the day even with no weight in my hand, you know, in certain muscle groups, whether it be my abs or my arm or shoulders are something.[0:39:40] Jeff Cavaliere: I'm doing something just to sort of engage the muscles. And I do think that some of that sort of, inane practice actually helps the time you go back into the gym, you just kinda keep that you keep that that that connection going.[0:39:52] Andrew Huberman: Well, it certainly obeys all the rules of neuroplasticity. You know, the The fire together, wire together mantra, which is the words of my colleague, Carla Schatz, hold true for all aspects of neural function, including nerve to muscle. So these flexing throughout the day or the the, deliberate isolation of of contracting a muscle throughout the day is without question engaging neuroplasticity. And if you were to do fewer of those repetitions, you're gonna get less engagement of the nerve to muscle connection. I can say this with with, with a smile and and with confidence because One of the first things all neuroscience students learn is about the neuromuscular junction because it's a it's a really simple example of where the more times the nerve fires and gets the muscle to contract, The stronger that connection gets, receptors are brought there, etcetera, etcetera.[0:40:35] Andrew Huberman: There's a whole bunch of mechanisms for a topic of another, podcast, but, Basically, that practice throughout the day is, makes total sense and works. Yeah.[0:40:45] Jeff Cavaliere: And there and there's no there believe me, there's no science behind that in terms of, know, the application of it, you do it when you catch yourself doing it, you know, from time to time. You know? But it is definitely something that's easily done Discretely and, you know, you you wind up doing I actually I think in a in a recent video when I I I did talk about, growing your arms by just Improve you know, improving the connection. Not that that connection itself is applying any load or or, you know, resistance that's significant to create overload for growth, But it's the development of that connection that I then take back with me into the gym at a more effective level that takes every exercise I do there and makes it more effective.[0:41:22] Andrew Huberman: That's like sharpening the blade Yeah. So to speak. Yeah. Certainly obeys the laws of of of nerve to muscle physiology. Want to just touch on a a couple of things.[0:41:33] Andrew Huberman: If the goal is to challenge muscles and one is dividing their body into, let's say, you know, a 3 or 4 day a week split or so or maybe up to 6. How do you know when a muscle is ready to be challenged Again, I've heard, okay, every 48 hours is, you know, protein synthesis increases, and then we'll get into this, and then it drops off. But, Frankly, if I train, my legs hard, I can get stronger from workout to workout or at least better in some way, workout to workout, leg workout to leg workout, training them once every 5 to 8 days. If I train them more often, I get worse. So the whatever that 48 hour to 72 hour thing is, somehow my legs don't obey that, but, You know?[0:42:19] Andrew Huberman: Or maybe something else is wrong with me, but I'm sure there are many things else wrong with me. But, how do you assess recovery at the local level, meaning at the Level of the muscles. So we'll talk about soreness and getting better, stronger, more repetitions, etcetera. And then at the systemic level, the level of the nervous system. And I'd love for you to tell us about the, the tool that, again, I learned from you, which is actually using a physical scale because it turns out this is that We'll let you tell what the tool is, but that tool is also actively being used for assessing cognitive decline and cognitive Maintenance and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's and dementia.[0:42:57] Jeff Cavaliere: Makes total sense. Makes total sense. I I I alright. So Regarding the the, the first part of the question, like, you know, how do you how would you kinda dictate when a muscle's recovered? So I do think that what you're experiencing is totally real, that different muscles recover at different rates.[0:43:17] Jeff Cavaliere: And I've always been so Fascinated by this concept, I talked about internally with my with my team. But, like, I feel like what we really need, the holy grail to to Training is going to be when we're able to crack the code on an individual basis when a muscle is recovered, and that is going to dictate its training schedule. And the fact that you might have a bicep that could be trained, you know, via via a pulling workout, a regular bicep that Workout. Forget the split at the moment. You might have a bicep that's able to be trained that can be trained again the next day, You know?[0:43:52] Jeff Cavaliere: And then the next day and then maybe you need a day off after that, but, like, you know, in that, that can vary from person to person for sure, and it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person over the course of time, as you mentioned, because the systemic recovery is gonna impact all those muscles anyway. But let's say you're systemically recovering, Every muscle itself is going to have a, a, you know, a recovery rate. And I think what's fascinating is that when you talked about before we like Train this week or we have, like, the way our mind looks at training. Well, if that was the case with the biceps, that bicep is a slave to the rest of your Training split. You know, where it's like, why does it have to be also at the end of every 8th day or, you know, or whatever When it might respond better to something much more frequently and your legs are also being thrown into that mix, there's a Mike Mentzer concept where he's like, you know, training, you know, One set and be done for 14 days.[0:44:46] Jeff Cavaliere: I mean, you know, it there's there's there's such variability between muscle groups, and you're you're linking them all together. I I think that coming back and using muscle soreness as a guideline for that is is one of the only Tools we have in terms of the local level, you know, we don't really have you know, being able to measure, let's say, CPK levels inside of a muscle would Amazing, you know, at at a local level to see how how recovered that muscle is, but that becomes fairly invasive. At least, to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive. So What are our tools? I mean, I I think that at the basic level, that's the one that most people can relate to and easily identify and then use that as a guideline.[0:45:27] Jeff Cavaliere: And if you're training when you're really sore, it's probably not a great idea, and, yeah, it's probably a good indication that that muscle is not recovered. But at least hearing what you and I are saying here might be a to the person to say, yeah. It is possible that it's not recovered just because 48 hours is the recommendation or just because research points to muscle protein synthesis needing a restimulation. Well, maybe not. Maybe you're not necessarily there yet.[0:45:49] Jeff Cavaliere: You're in that and for that muscle, you're not there yet. So it's all really interesting stuff. But as far as the you know, recovery. I think there's a lot of ways, you know, people talk about resting heart rate measured in the morning, all different kinds of of, you know, Core temperature and things like that that might become altered in a state of of, nonrecovery, but grip strength is very, very much tied to Performance and recovery. And when I was at the Mets, we used to actually take grip strength measurements as a baseline in spring training all the time.[0:46:24] Jeff Cavaliere: Now, obviously, as a baseball player, you're gripping a bat, you're a pitcher, you're gripping a ball. Like, you know, grip having good grip strength is important. So if you've noticed that we had a very weak grip, It's just a good focal point of a specialized training component for the[0:46:35] Andrew Huberman: Do you do this every day with those guys?[0:46:37] Jeff Cavaliere: No. We would do in in spring training, we do sort of a baseline entry level Measurement, and then we would we would measure it throughout the season, maybe once every 2 weeks or 3 weeks. And and and, you know, the the idea there was to to man to, you know, manage the Recover. Measure the recovery. But I just gave it away.[0:46:53] Jeff Cavaliere: You know, there to to to do the you know, to determine overall recovery, your grip strength is pretty highly correlated. So We have found that with with one of those scales, those old fashioned bathroom scales at, like, the Bath and Beyond or wherever you can get, which, by the way, Almost impossible. I believe Jesse and I were searching for the last scale to put in that video, and we almost couldn't find 1 because everything is, like, digital and every you know? It's like this I'm looking at the old fashioned dial Controls.[0:47:17] Andrew Huberman: It's like old Macintosh computers. There's a there's a huge market for them in old phones. Kids, keep your phones now. In 30 years, the The lame phone now is worth[0:47:26] Jeff Cavaliere: a lot of money. A lot. So, you know, I wound up, you know, finding 1, and it's a great A tool for just squeezing the the the, the scale with your hands and seeing what type of output you could get. And I think we we all can relate to this when you just visualize. Imagine the last time you were sick or that were you or just try this, you know, next time you wake up in the morning.[0:47:49] Jeff Cavaliere: When you first wake in the morning, you're still groggy. Try to squeeze your hand. Try to make a fist as hard as you can. You're gonna sit there angry at your fist because it won't contract as hard as you know it can. You don't have the ability to just create the output, and that is because in that state, you're still sleepy.[0:48:06] Jeff Cavaliere: You're still fatigued. You know? You're You're not even awake at the, you know, the the whole level at this point. Well, that is the that is Still, an actual phenomenon that happens that, you know, a a lack of recovery or a lack of wakefulness or whatever you wanna say is is gonna lead to a decreased output there. So when you start to measure that on a daily basis, you can get a pretty good sense of where you're at.[0:48:29] Jeff Cavaliere: And I think when people start to see a drop off of 10% or so or or even greater of of their grip output. You really should skip the gym that day because I don't think there's much you're gonna do there That's going to be that that beneficial even if it is the day to train legs or whatever day it is.[0:48:46] Andrew Huberman: I I love this tool. It's simple. It's low cost if you can find such a scale. I guess you could also find one of those grippers that, and you could do this in a very non quantitative way. But better would be a scale where you could actually measure Yeah.[0:48:59] Andrew Huberman: How hard you can squeeze this thing at a given time of day, it draws to mind just a little, neuroscience factoid. In the world of circadian neurobiology, one of the Consistent findings is that in the middle of your nighttime, you know, they'll wake people up, and they'll say, do this test. Right. In the laboratory, they use a different, apparatus, but it's essentially the same thing. And in the middle of the night, grip strength is very, very low.[0:49:20] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[0:49:21] Andrew Huberman: And, you know, midmorning, grip strength is high. And as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon, grip strength goes higher and higher and higher, and then it drops off. There's rhythm and grip temperature. So you probably wanna do this at more or less the same time each day if you're gonna use it, but it I think it's brilliant and, in its simplicity and its Directness to these upper motor neurons because that's really what it's, assessing your ability. Again, it's about the ability to contract the muscles hard.[0:49:43] Andrew Huberman: If you can't do that, you're not gonna get an effective word. Yeah.[0:49:45] Jeff Cavaliere: And they they also I mean, there Certainly, there are more sophisticated tools too as a as a PT. You know, we have, hand grip dynamometers. You know, we can and we can measure one side at a time too. You know? I'm not really I'm I'm Getting a little bit blinded by the fact that both hands are squeezing into that scale, and I don't get really a left right comparison.[0:50:02] Jeff Cavaliere: But even at that level, that could give you a little bit more detail, but that comes at a cost. Those are pretty expensive devices. But if it's listen. If you're an athlete, you know, the the 200, $300 it cost to have one of those would be well worth, you know, the added investment. Well and[0:50:16] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure some of our listeners will want 1 too because there are a lot of, tech geeks out there. Not tech industry geeks, but people who like like tech gear. What's it called again?[0:50:25] Jeff Cavaliere: Is it hand grip dynamometer? Hand grip dynamometer. Dynamometer. Dynamometer. Dynamometer.[0:50:28] Andrew Huberman: Set up set by Jeff with a with a great East Coast accent by me in a terrible, botched The West Coast version. Thank you. We'll we'll, put that in the show notes also. No. I think recovery is key.[0:50:41] Andrew Huberman: We always hear about sleep. You grow when you sleep and, incidentally, your brain you stimulate learning when you're awake, obviously, but the reordering of neural connections Happens in sleep. This is why sleep is the way to get smarter, provided you're also doing the learning part. Sleep's a way to get stronger, provided you're also doing the training part. You've had some really inter you've put out interesting content over the years in terms of, even sleep position.[0:51:04] Andrew Huberman: One of the major changes that I made To my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of[0:51:10] Jeff Cavaliere: the bed. Right.[0:51:11] Andrew Huberman: And I'll tell you, this had a profound impact several things. First of all, my feet have always been the bane of my existence. Broke them a bunch skateboarding. They I and I noticed when I'd run, I'd get shin splints, and then I started to notice that my feet sort of, you're the PT. They were kind of floppy and then, you know, as if I was pointing my toes slightly all the time at rest if I was, and I realized that based on listening to you previously, that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tight.[0:51:37] Jeff Cavaliere: Right. Right? Right.[0:51:37] Andrew Huberman: I mean, one other thing in the hotel.[0:51:39] Jeff Cavaliere: Get a feed in.[0:51:39] Andrew Huberman: And I started, releasing the the sheets at the end of the bed. Yeah. And I also started doing some tibialis work. Yeah. Front of shins work, essentially, Changed everything.[0:51:49] Andrew Huberman: My back pain from running. My shin splints disappeared. My posture improved. Although I my audience will tell me that it still needs improvement. There are always 5 or 10 people that want[0:51:57] Jeff Cavaliere: sit up straight.[0:51:58] Andrew Huberman: Actually had chairs sent our mailing address. Very nice chairs. Right? So I'm trying my I'm trying there. But this is fascinating.[0:52:06] Andrew Huberman: Right? The position that one sleeps in, I, fortunately, have never had any shoulder issues, knock on wood, but maybe you could just talk talk to us a little bit about Sleep and sleep position for sake of waking position and movement. This this, I think, is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep. This podcast has done a lot of episodes about keeping the room cool, getting sunlight in your eyes, etcetera, how to get into sleep. Mhmm.[0:52:31] Andrew Huberman: But You've talked about, physically, what positions might be better to sleep in. So, please please, enrich us.[0:52:39] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. I mean, First of all, the you know, some people's opinions of of that type of content is that, you you know, you sleep in the the position that's most comfortable so you ensure that you're sleeping. Oh, great. I I understand that. We all wanna sleep.[0:52:52] Jeff Cavaliere: That's the goal when we put our head on the pillow is to actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning and not know what the hell happened unless you had a dream. But, you know, Beyond that, there are certainly physical components to sleep that. That is why a lot of times people wake up and say, like, That that you can incur pretty serious injuries in sleep. People will wake up and have, like, a shoulder that did not bother them at all be humming the next day or even for Weeks after, because of the one sleep position they put themselves in in a prolonged way and they happen to have a deep sleep even through the discomfort, That can do actually some some some damage. So it's understandable that the body can incur some strain and stress if you're sleeping in the wrong way.[0:53:31] Jeff Cavaliere: One of the things I say right off The bad is sleeping on your stomach just doesn't really have many benefits. You know? You're you're putting yourself into a position that is Depending upon the the the orientation of your your mattress or how many pillows you're using, but you're basically putting yourselves into, excessive extension of the lumbar spine, which for most people isn't very good. If you're if you're a disc patient, I guess that might be helpful, you know, for for relocating the disc. But, I mean, for the most part, your hands are then usually not at your sides, but they're up under your arms, so you've them into sort of internal rotation up over elevation in your head.[0:54:08] Jeff Cavaliere: It's just not a great position. You also have to crank your neck from one side or the other in order to breathe, or you can be your face down straight into the pillow. So I would skip that one. And there's some people that are total belly sleepers, And I and I would just say, listen. I don't think that is the the most helpful long term way for you to sleep.[0:54:26] Jeff Cavaliere: Try to adopt a different position. Sleeping on your side oftentimes is is also brought along with that, the legs, knees coming up towards the chest, Prolonged hip flexion. Listen. We're doing enough of that during the day. Enjoy what we're doing right now.[0:54:41] Jeff Cavaliere: Right. We don't need to do another 10 hours or 8 hours or something at night like that. You know? And It just is reinforcing you know? And as we said too, you know, let's say you trained that day.[0:54:51] Jeff Cavaliere: You're just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight, You know, where where the body is healing and trying to create some, you know, changes in your body, one of the reasons why I recommend Stretching or static stretching prior to going to bed. A lot of people don't really wanna do it at that point because it could take 10 minutes, 5, 10 minutes depending upon how many muscles you have to stretch, but, You know, it's good to sort of try to establish this longer length temporarily prior to going into a state where you're gonna be not moving and recovering and and and creating new, changes in the muscles. So, you know, that kinda I don't say it doesn't rule out the the side sleeper. The side sleeper could be very, very helpful for somebody that has apnea or, you know, other other conditions. So, again, it's not An all or nothing approach, but it just it's something that you need to pay attention to.[0:55:40] Jeff Cavaliere: When you are on your back, like you were talking about, and your feet are Wedged underneath a tight sheets at the end of the bed. And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up, don't prefer our beds to have really loose sheets the end of the bed. It's hard to make the bed in the morning. Right. So it's like you you you're gonna wanna have, you know, them tight.[0:55:59] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, I'm I'm I'm saying as you experienced, you know, you're gonna have These these, you know, prolonged plantarflexion, that's going to likely lead to shorter, You know, calves over time, because you're lacking all that length for that long period of time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just, You know, hang out where they are. Now the resting position of the ankle is not in dorsiflexion. It's gonna be still in some player flexion, but not being driven down and pulled down into that position. And I think what happens actually is people who get uncomfortable that way even in their sleep will shift away from that by turning either onto their side or their stomach. So There's definitely an impact of the body position in sleep and figuring out the best way that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest, But have a mind fly towards what it's doing to your body and choose the one that's least, you know, abrasive to your body is the way you should go.[0:56:55] Andrew Huberman: Terrific. And, again, it's really helped me, and, I'm a big believer based on good science out of Stanford and elsewhere, that, you know, as much as we could be nasal breathers in sleep, we probably should be. I don't know if you've done any content, yet about, you know, taping the mouth shut with some medical tape. But, You know, the the the benefits of nasal breathing and sleep are pretty tremendous, but it takes a little bit of training Yeah. What people do, and the training is very simple.[0:57:19] Andrew Huberman: It's a little little piece of medical tape. So, Again, a topic for another time. I'm glad you mentioned stretching. I was gonna ask about stretching a little bit later, but let's talk about stretching. When is the best time to stretch for particular Types of results.[0:57:33] Andrew Huberman: And maybe you could define some of the different types of stretching. So you just mentioned a, a little bit of, would you call it light stretching or, Okay. I'm completely naive here on stretching, so let me just say, I can think of stretching where I hold the stretch and really try and, Lengthen in air quotes, folks.[0:57:50] Jeff Cavaliere: I don't[0:57:50] Andrew Huberman: want the PTs jumping all over it.[0:57:52] Jeff Cavaliere: I don't[0:57:52] Andrew Huberman: know what it is, but nutrition and the PTs online are really they got pitchforks in both hands. Academic That's[0:57:58] Jeff Cavaliere: a recent that's a recent evolution, I think, for sure. And not the nutrition as much, but the PTs have become a little bit angry these days. I see.[0:58:04] Andrew Huberman: Well, I always say with feelings of powerlessness Comes aggression. Remember that, folks. So, in any in any case, they're stretching where I'm I'm, you know, Trying to consciously, lengthen, again, in air quotes, the muscle. I'm not, yanking on the limb or bobbing up and down. Maybe you could define the different types of Stretching for people.[0:58:25] Andrew Huberman: Maybe give us some rough guidelines about whether or not to do it cold or warm before training, after training, etcetera.[0:58:31] Jeff Cavaliere: So, Yeah. There there's obviously there's a lot of different types of stretching there. It could get even to, you know, PNF stretching and things that are a little bit more, You know, niche, but, like, in general, the 2 basic forms of stretching are active stretching and passive stretching. Your Or, you know, your dynamic work. And and and your passive stretching is done with the goal of trying to create an increase, in, the flexibility of the muscle.[0:58:57] Jeff Cavaliere: So whether you're actually increasing the length of that muscle, you know, more so what you're doing is increasing the resist or decreasing the resistance of that muscle to wanna day at a certain level of flexibility. So when we can sort of take the brakes off and allow that muscle to to allow us more range of motion, We're inherently in increasing flexibility without necessarily having to increase the length of that muscle. That is usually done At a time far away from your workout because they have shown where this type of stretching done prior to an activity. And It could be, like a structured activity like, oh, like lifting, or it could be a little bit less structured like competing in a sport in a in a spontaneous type way That there is a period of recalibration that is needed after doing this because you're disrupting the length tension relationship with the muscle That causes you to not necessarily be able to rely on these, I've talked about before, stored motor engrams in your mind in terms of This is the pattern for how I swing a golf club, say. You know?[1:00:01] Jeff Cavaliere: And now introducing a little bit of flexibility or added flexibility or range because of the Stretching I did before, it takes maybe a whole or 2 or 3 to match up again. Oh, this is the this is what he's trying to do, that golf thing I that I remembered again. Like, it's not remembering that every component, like, I have to bend my right wrist back 10 degrees, and then I have to bend my elbow, and I have to Like, your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency. So and when I have to start matching up that stored pattern with what's feeling new because of the increased range, I can impair performance. And, again, it could happen even in a a gym workout where you're talking about your 1st, 2nd set, 3rd set, where maybe the repercussions aren't as big because they'll just Do a few extra sets.[1:00:43] Jeff Cavaliere: But in performance, if you screw up your 1st 3 rounds, you're playing on a PGA tour and you shoot you know, you're you're 6 over after 3, you're you're you're done. You know? So I think it matters there. As far as the dynamic you know, so we so we relegate that, as I mentioned, sort of towards the end of the day when it's not going to impact performance, But even maybe have the additional benefit of creating the the feeling of length or the increase or decrease in resistance to this length, at a time when I know my body is going to try to tend to heal and heal shorter, never longer, but heal shorter. So if I can introduce a little The extra, length or or decreased resistance to to that length, it's a better time to do it.[1:01:21] Jeff Cavaliere: So I think it promotes a A better recovery. If[1:01:25] Andrew Huberman: I wanna do Sorry to interrupt. So stretching later in the day, because I I'm I'm intrigued by this concept of heal shorter. Yeah. So part of the healing and recovery process means a shortening of the muscles. This is the tensing up in sleep.[1:01:37] Andrew Huberman: Could you elaborate just a bit on that? And then sorry to break your flow, but then to continue No.[1:01:41] Jeff Cavaliere: Just, basically, you know, what what's been shown is that when when The the repair process, muscular repair from, let's say, strength training during the day, the repair process usually results in a muscle that is Slightly shorter rather than increased in length. You know? It's just a it's you know, muscles prefer to sort of, you know, ratchet their way down into that The that, contraction and then, you know, maintain that that that more comfortable length tension relationship. So When you're sleeping, it it tends to, you know, on the side of shorter rather than longer when, ideally, we don't really want that. We wanna maintain as much of that length because with more length, we actually have more leverage.[1:02:21] Jeff Cavaliere: Right? That muscle has more leverage to contract. If it was all the way contracted, you know, you really can't, obviously, we don't generate much force in a muscle already maximally contracted. So I think we we wanna do something that we whatever we can, whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal that could allow us to Do this prior to sleep, and, again, it's just making a a a conscious choice to do it at a time of the day that makes a little bit more sense. Dynamic stretching is really not done for that purpose of trying to create any type of of feeling of, Act or or increasing the the potential length, as you said, of the muscle, but more so the readiness of the muscle to perform.[1:03:00] Jeff Cavaliere: And Increasing you know, exploring the ends of that range of motion in a more dynamic way so you're not hanging out there and disrupting that laying tension relationship, but just sort of Touching the ends of those barriers so that when you feel movement again, it feels looser. It feels more ready. And and, obviously, at the same time, warming up, Blood flow, all the benefits we get from just warming up in general. So, like, you know, that's that's the series you've probably seen a bunch of times, but, like, You know, leg swings and and, you know, butt kicks and, you know, lunge walking lunges and all types of[1:03:34] Andrew Huberman: drills touches.[1:03:34] Jeff Cavaliere: Toe touches, all those kind of drills, those active stretching drills or, you know, lunging with rotations up for the upper body to try to get some of the thoracic spine involved too. Those are the drills that people will do prior to training that are both excitatory in terms of just the nervous system, but also Helpful for just the general warm up the body because the blood flow, but from a muscle readiness standpoint, not impairing the performance While at the same time exploring the increased ranges, because as you know, the 1st toe touch you do is not as high as the last toe touch For me,[1:04:06] Andrew Huberman: it doesn't even include[1:04:06] Jeff Cavaliere: the toe. Right. Right. The shin touch, the[1:04:09] Andrew Huberman: knee touch. Attempt. Right.[1:04:10] Jeff Cavaliere: Right. So, like, you know, those those are going to improve with each subsequent rep, I think that's what people actually like, you you when you could see those those actual changes from rep 1 to rep 7, You just feel ready. You feel more alert and ready to go in your workout. So the dynamic type of stretching, and I mentioned earlier on, you know, like, What I've had to do to sort of increase my warm up focus, you know, I I think that's more of what I try to do these days. I try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that, you You know, everybody's not ready.[1:04:40] Jeff Cavaliere: When I was when I was working with Antonio Brown, I remember, like, he would spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes on all dynamic work. And I've never seen anybody spend that long on their dynamic work, but, like, he said he just didn't feel right and ready To go unless he did a lot of that. And, I mean, you know, his his dynamic stretching routine would be a workout for most everybody. You know? It it's crazy how how much he did.[1:05:04] Andrew Huberman: These pro athletes are amazing, and, you've, had the great fortune of working with and improving their their abilities. But I can only imagine, because I also imagine he's pretty strong in the gym also.[1:05:16] Jeff Cavaliere: I mean, you know, I I and so it always amazes me the guys that make it to that level No matter what sport they do, they're so gifted in everything. You know? Like, David Wright used to make me laugh all the time with the Mets because No matter what I ping pong. You know? Like, anything, he because of his hand eye coordination.[1:05:34] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, anything, you know, Great at jump rope. I remember he hadn't done a lot of jump rope, and I I I think jump rope is one of the best things you could do from a conditioning standpoint. Actually it's fairly interesting. It's not just you know, it's not too harsh on the joints depending you know, even though it's a ballistic move. And he wasn't I have to admit.[1:05:54] Jeff Cavaliere: I you know, if you listen to this, he's gonna wanna kill me, but I I I was better at him, than jump roping. One of the only things I could do. And then I gave him about 5 days, and he completely blew me out of the water to the point where I could never keep up with him anymore. He made it look effortless. It's like that's where the athlete and someone comes out, no matter what they pick up, they're good at it.[1:06:13] Jeff Cavaliere: And I think that when you see guys like this in the gym, like, their strength levels tend to be pretty good, and their and their abilities, their coordination, their their everything just tends to sort of be good at that level. You know? And then it sort of amazes me why those guys can go pick up a golf club, You know? And go shoot 72, you know, and and having never really played, you know, they're just they're just naturally good at whatever they do.[1:06:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I have a couple I'm I'm smiling because I have a couple really close friends who did a number of years, some several decades in the SEAL teams. And I don't know that their Skill level at everything is so high as as you're describing for athletes, but their level of competitiveness is beyond Right. Iocean swim with 1. There's no chance that I'm gonna Right.[1:06:51] Andrew Huberman: You know, outswim Pat ever, ever. He actually goes back and forth sometimes just to check up on me, which I appreciate. Thank you, Pat. I haven't drowned yet, but the but in addition to that, you know, we could play horseshoes, and it's like this switch that just flips on. Like, gonna murder me.[1:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Of course. He's a very nice guy. Right? In general, they tend to be very nice, but but the level of competitiveness Well, they're they're of unreal. They're selected for it.[1:07:13] Jeff Cavaliere: They're trying to beat themselves. They're not even trying to beat you. Right. I'm not even in the competition. Competition.[1:07:17] Jeff Cavaliere: You're not even there. Yeah. Exactly. You know?[1:07:19] Andrew Huberman: Thank you.[1:07:19] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Now[1:07:20] Andrew Huberman: I won't feel[1:07:21] Jeff Cavaliere: so bad.[1:07:22] Andrew Huberman: Or worse. It's true. It's it's a remarkable thing. I'm glad you mentioned jump roping. I used to skip rope for warm up for boxing.[1:07:29] Jeff Cavaliere: You know?[1:07:29] Andrew Huberman: And that was typical, like, three 3 3 minute rounds or something like that. But I I'm glad you brought it up because, skipping rope is something that, Obviously, has a cardiovascular component. There's the conditioning component. There's timing, and and it is kind of interesting. Right?[1:07:43] Andrew Huberman: You can it's frustrating when you don't get it, especially when it whips you on the ear if you're using a proper rope. I'm just curious if you could just give us a quick, skipping rope 1 on 1. Do you like to see people jumping with, both feet and toes? We'll we'll link to a video of I'm sure if there was 1 and I missed it. Do like to see people doing high knees?[1:07:59] Andrew Huberman: Do you like people basically, like, shuffling? You wanna see people doing double dutch? What do you wanna see people doing over time?[1:08:05] Jeff Cavaliere: All of the above, maybe not the double dodge, but all all of the above. I mean, I think that that's the cool thing about it. Right? Like, once we sort of master the skill because for all of us, that first Jump with the 2 feet going together is a challenge because you just gotta time that rope, you gotta time your jump, and then we get bored as we Often do as humans, we get bored with what we can do and wanna take on new challenges, so then it becomes 1 leg at a time or then it becomes side to side hops. Right?[1:08:29] Jeff Cavaliere: And all of those things are beneficial, I I believe, neurologically to enhancing the ability to do the skill as a whole, but also just because I'm I'm such a Believer in training in all 3 planes. So, like, just doing straight up and down versus now I can do frontal plane side to side motion, then I can even do small little twists or corkscrews, we call them. It requires a different you would know more about better than I do. There it requires Different neurological patterns to be able to coordinate that because you're changing the orientation of your body in space. So it's not just that I'm changing the exercise, but I'm changing how my body interprets that exercise because what's happening to my body in space.[1:09:08] Jeff Cavaliere: So I I love, you know, whatever people wind up doing, but, I am amazed. There are people I just started following this young woman on Instagram who is, Like, I'll I'll give her a plug out. I think it's like Anna Skips or something, and she is ridiculous. Like, I I watch her, and I'm, like, mesmerized at what can do with the rope. You know?[1:09:28] Jeff Cavaliere: It's it's, like it's an extremely athletic endeavor, believe, when it gets to be at that level, in the speed, in the precision, in the, You know? And and, you know, I think one of the goals that you wanna be able to have is to where you're feeling as if you're almost Effortlessly dancing without a rope, like, where you're just bouncing off of the ball of your foot. And it's an important skill to learn too whether you go back to run Or or, you know, or even even jog. Right? Just like, you know, more casual running.[1:09:57] Jeff Cavaliere: Learning how to land is so important. One of the drills that people should try is, like, try to jump on your heels. So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, Alright. And just jump from your heels and land on your heels. You'll feel it in your jaw.[1:10:12] Jeff Cavaliere: You'll literally feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels. There is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels. Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot when they when they run, And you're just your body is not built to absorb the forces like the ball of your foot could. It's really built as a spring. And the and the foot is To me, as a physical therapist, the foot has always been one of the most you know, you talk about having bad feet.[1:10:35] Jeff Cavaliere: I have flat feet. It looks like I got flippers if I took my if I took my shoes off. Like, I'm I'm wearing scuba fence. There is no there is no adaptability of that foot to the surface. You You know, when you when it's completely caved and flattened like that, the job of this of the foot is to be adaptable.[1:10:53] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, there is maybe there is some adaptability because it's so floppy, But at the same time, at some point, that critical juncture where you're gonna then step through and you need to be able to push off, the foot has to actually changes in the midfoot itself To become a rigid lever is what they call it. You're you're going from a mobile adapter to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the midtarsal joint to become Solid so that you can push off of it with leverage. If you lack that capability, all those stresses that are supposed to be borne by the Go up into the ankle, into the knee, into the hip, into the low back. So learning how to land and and start to train your your body to to, experienced ground reaction forces the right way is so critical to all other function and all other disability up the chain, And jumping rope is, like, one of the best ways to learn how to do that.[1:11:46] Andrew Huberman: Great. I I own a jump rope. I love doing it in the morning While I get sunlight in my eyes, it's actually a a protocol I picked up from Tim Ferriss[1:11:55] Jeff Cavaliere: Mhmm.[1:11:55] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned because, you know, Listeners of my podcast, you know, I'm like a broken record with Get Sunlight in Your Eyes, even through cloud cover. It just sets your sleep rhythms and your waking rhythms, the yada yada, on and on. But sometimes it'd be kind of boring for people, and I wanna get them off their phone. So jumping rope is also just a great way to wake up. So jumping rope can be a The cardio workout, the 15 or 30 minutes.[1:12:19] Andrew Huberman: Definitely.[1:12:19] Jeff Cavaliere: And there and there's sort of that hybrid that we're talking about before of, like, No. You're not you're not necessarily dropping down on the ground and doing burpees, but I just look at it as a more athletic endeavor because of the coordination involved Than just simply walking or jogging.[1:12:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And you it's not much of a, equipment requirement. No. Super simple. Cost.[1:12:37] Andrew Huberman: You could even use a rope or Or something if you although I[1:12:41] Jeff Cavaliere: We we even instruct people that they can use no rope and just pretend, you know, and just move the arms. Right? And just slightly zero cost. You're never gonna hit the rope, which is good, but, you know, at the same so you're never gonna know if you're doing it wrong, but at least you can you can move through the and get the same benefits through the feet. I love it.[1:12:55] Andrew Huberman: I love it. I told myself before sitting down with you today that I wasn't going to focus on specific exercises because there's such a wealth of Credible content that you put out there that people could just put into YouTube or elsewhere and arrive at the proper way to do a chin or a dip or for whatever purpose. But there's 1 exercise and one particular motion that I'd like to, discuss for a moment because I believe that Learning about this cautionary note from you is one of the reasons that I've maintained steady training for 30 years with no major injury, knock on wood. Mhmm. And that's the upright row.[1:13:34] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. You know, one thing that whether or not people weight train or not,[1:13:38] Jeff Cavaliere: Are you censor this podcast? Are you censoring? Do we beat this out or no? Oh, I dude, how'd[1:13:43] Andrew Huberman: you do you get beef about this?[1:13:44] Jeff Cavaliere: No. No. You know what? I We always get beef in in any social media platform where we're put out, but, like no. I guess some I get some from it, but I'm I'm, I'm fully prepared to defend myself.[1:13:55] Andrew Huberman: So the But here here's the reason for asking about this. I never really cared much for upright, Rose. It's not an exercise I tend to do, but, one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues, in every Child I see and every adult I see is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now. So folks think, if you stay I think I learned this from you all. So if you stand up Most people, the thumbs are gonna be pointing toward one another because most people are starting to look somewhere between a, a non, human primate[1:14:32] Jeff Cavaliere: Mhmm.[1:14:33] Andrew Huberman: And a melted candle. Yeah. It you know, bent at the hips, Satara from too much sitting. We're all sitting. We're in inward rotation, but I learned from you that the upright road compromises, some important aspects of our shoulder, mechanics and could be actually, sort of a dangerous movement in some ways.[1:14:50] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it, but so I've always made it a point Now on the basis of of this advice to, a, not do upright rows, but I wasn't doing them before, but to really strive for, external rotation[1:15:03] Jeff Cavaliere: Mhmm.[1:15:04] Andrew Huberman: On things like bench dips, on on a number of different things. Whenever I can, I try and go into external rotation and provide that you know, without looking like an idiot walking around with my palms facing outward? Please tell us about internal, external rotation. The upright row is one aspect of that. But why this is so important, not just for weight training, But as in terms of posture and mechanics and and not looking like a a melted candle or partially melted candle.[1:15:31] Jeff Cavaliere: I actually love it. I I I I I'm happy to talk about it because I love I love the shoulder as a joint. I think PTs tend to fall in love with certain areas, and the shoulder is one of the Cool areas for me is, like, the foot is, but, like, the shoulder has the most mobility in the body of any of any joint, but it's also got the least stability. Right. There's always that trade off of mobility and stability.[1:15:52] Jeff Cavaliere: So your stability comes from, you know, certain Muscle groups and one of the ones that the only muscle group that actually externally rotates the shoulder is gonna be the rotator cuff. Okay? And unless you are devoted to Training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externally rotate the shoulder, you're not training that function. And it's so easy for us in everyday life, especially those that aren't training, to not ever really undergo any of those stresses that could be beneficial to counteracting What happens freely and naturally, which is internal rotation. So when you think about the imbalance created just by nature and how we live our lives, internal rotation Far, far, far outweighs external rotation, so you need to address it.[1:16:37] Jeff Cavaliere: And the reason why you need to address it is because you need to normalize those biomechanics can't access the shoulder if you want their long term health, and one of the functions of the shoulder is to raise our arm up over our head. And if we do that from an internally rotated position, We're going to have a higher likelihood of creating stress inside that joint. Funny thing is I talked about before my my PT brethren can be somewhat, angry these days. I don't know what happened, but fairly angry. You know, they wanna they wanna discredit the existence of something like, shoulder impingement, which I I don't know how I mean, certain study look at we both we all read studies, and we we studies will say one thing one day and potentially conflict Entirely in a different direction.[1:17:19] Jeff Cavaliere: Some studies will point to the nonexistence of a of a of of a shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, we have, thankfully, digital motion X rays that will literally show the impingement occur in real time, in real function. And that's one of the limitations I'm off on a tangent here, but, like, those types of X rays or that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays, like, gives us such insight that we never had before because we're taking X rays or someone laying down on a table. You know, when I wanna see what happens when he actually raise my arm up over my head in function, and they and the tools now exist to do that. We see the the the problems occurring because in order to get normal mechanics and free up the joint maximally inside, you need external rotate as you raise the arm up.[1:18:02] Jeff Cavaliere: So if your muscles aren't firing and they're not necessarily, As strong as the internal rotation bias that pulls them in, you're asking for trouble every time you do that. Well, this exercise is literally putting you in elevation and internal rotation. And if you were to walk into a PT office and someone said, I think he's got impingement. Will you diagnose him? There's a test called the Hawkins Kennedy Test, and I would put you in the position.[1:18:27] Jeff Cavaliere: I know we're not visible at this point through the podcast, but I'll put you in this position here where I have your arm elevated And your hand pretty much under your chin pushing downward on that to create that internal shoulder rotation. Pretty much the exact position that we're in when we're holding a bar in in an upright row. Some will say, well, just don't go so high. Go only up to the level of the chest, but you're still in this internally rotated position. The the thing that I think frustrates me the most about the exercise is that I have an alternative, and the alternative does the same thing in terms of helping the muscles grow by simply fixing the biomechanics of the but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows.[1:19:03] Jeff Cavaliere: So instead of the elbows being higher than the hand, which drives you into internal rotation, If the elbow is lower than the hand, the hand being higher here, I'm in external rotation, and I could do something called a high pull and still get the same abduction of the arm and still get the same benefits of the shoulders, the delts, and the traps without having to undergo any of the stresses that would come from The somewhat awkward movement of an upright row.[1:19:27] Andrew Huberman: And for those listening, we'll put a link to a short clip of what this looks like. But, basically, what Jeff is doing and tell me if I'm describing this, incorrectly or correctly, Jeff, is, taking your 2 thumbs and pointing behind you and, and, you know so elbows up kind of near the chin and and pointing behind you. Like, go ahead it that way. Like, somebody directing the airplane, like, come back,[1:19:45] Jeff Cavaliere: come back, come back. Yep.[1:19:46] Andrew Huberman: I forgot what they call that. I think it's called semaphoran is the action of, like, where they direct the Planes or something, the flags or whatever. Someone will, of course, tell me I'm wrong about that too, which is why I say these things because I like I like being told what the what the correct answer is. In any case, so this replaces the the upright row and and probably does a number of other important things as well.[1:20:07] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Well, again, I you know, listen. I I when I Without naming names or programs or anything like that, when I got involved in when I got involved in in, AthleanX when I first started, you know, my online And, presence, there was a very, very, very popular, program that was out there that I just for fun, I wanted to, As a PT, this is the the the nerdy things we do, but I wanted to evaluate the the workout structure. And I went and I looked at every rep over the course of a week, And there were something like, you know, 890 repetitions or something done, and 0 of them were dedicated to external rotation of the shoulder. So if you think about it, I mean, yeah, it was a very popular program that was done by a lot of people.[1:20:49] Jeff Cavaliere: There is no there was no focus at all, no dedicated focus towards creating A balance to an action that is so predominant. And remember, it's not just because we sit with bad posture, but the fact that our Chest can internally rotate. Our lats can internally rotate. There's, like, muscle other big muscles that participate in things that we do every day that will Further, internally rotate the shoulder. The only weapons we have for external rotation are those little rotator cuff muscles and 3 of them actually, 3 of the 4, And the job is to sort of actively and consciously train them through really the boring exercises.[1:21:26] Jeff Cavaliere: Right? Like, you've seen them with the band. You you you you anchor a band to a pole. You stand with the band in the opposite hand. So if it's anchored to the pole on my left side, I've got the band on my right side, and you see people where they kinda rotate their hand towards the back.[1:21:39] Jeff Cavaliere: Again, kind of what you were saying, but at a lower elevation, taking the back of my hand and trying to point it to somebody behind me. Well, you know, that that is that this is one of the ways to train the muscle. It's a it's just a one function of the shoulder, external rotation of the shoulder, and you need to do it. And, again, it it's not that if somebody was doing more external rotation work, could they absorb the upright row better? Probably because as they elevated the arm, they probably have a little bit more of a contribution from the rotator cuff that to what one of the functions is to Centralize the head of the humerus inside of the glenoid, you know, the capsule.[1:22:18] Jeff Cavaliere: So as it rises up, it stays central as opposed to migrating up, because the deltoid likes to pull up. So if the rotator cuff has some ability to counteract the upward pull of the delt, Then it can maintain a more healthy relationship with overhead movement. So just realizing that that that that function is only gained through doing these exercises, you know, we we would probably dedicate more time there, but the rotate the upright role might be better absorbed by that person because they have a little bit more strength. But, again, Why? Because if you have an exercise that does the same thing for what you're trying to do muscularly to build the muscles that it affects, Why wouldn't you just do it where you can still see x and and actually pick up more repetitions of external rotation?[1:23:02] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? So you're getting none of the harm, all of the benefits. I see zero reason to ever do the upright row, and people will argue. This is the way they argue that I've done this for 30 years, and I've never hurt myself. And I always say, yeah.[1:23:16] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Like, I listen. The goal is to not hurt yourself ever. So even if you it's sort of like, you know, the Championship game. You know, you might play the game of your life, but if you lose, you lost.[1:23:28] Jeff Cavaliere: And when you get into the end of the, you know, the record books, you're still lost. So even if you had the game of your life, you lost. I don't care if you do it for 30 years, no pain. You're still doing it, and there's no pain. I'm giving you an option that's gonna give you the same results And the exercise that you're seeking, that's why you're doing the exercise without the the possibility of having the, you know, the the the bad outcome come from it.[1:23:48] Jeff Cavaliere: So, You know, I get a little bit, you know, defensive of of of the of the move, but I feel like it's like, why would you do that? You know?[1:23:54] Andrew Huberman: No. It makes it makes sense. Being able to train for a long period of time and feel good. You know? No I I'm proud to say you know?[1:24:01] Andrew Huberman: And I don't have the kind of genetics, so, like, we don't have a lot of impressive athletes in our family tree or anything. There's, know, some fit individuals, some less fit individuals, but I really believe it's about putting in the work consistently over time. And the the more the more often you can wake up not In pain, the better. And so, you know, I think that being an external rotation as often as possible is good. This is actually a good friend who's a A yoga teacher told me there's also a problem with the yogis.[1:24:27] Andrew Huberman: You know, a lot all the downward dog stuff. For those listening, you can think of inward rotation as, like, Thumbs down. Mhmm. Just think thumbs down. Emergent isn't bad, but less thumbs down, more thumbs up is external rotation.[1:24:38] Andrew Huberman: So for for those just listening, maybe that gives a A visual. The more exercise you can do in external rotation, the better it seems on average. I'd love to chat with you just a a little bit more about biomechanics, and, and this is a personal thing that I that, again, your Content really helped solve for me. One is I thought I had lower back pain, thought I had sciatica Mhmm. So badly that on a few trips, I, work trips years ago when I was doing a lot more international travel.[1:25:09] Andrew Huberman: I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes. I mean, like, excruciating pain. I didn't wanna take medication. Wanna do back surgery. In the end, turns out it wasn't a back injury at all.[1:25:19] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And one of the things that helped Fix it was this just learning about this thing called the medial glute. Yeah. And you, had a video that said fixed back pain, and then you, quite Accurately say that some back pain isn't really about the back at all Mhmm. And, and had me do an exercise or or allowed me to try an exercise where I Lay on my side and essentially pointing my, my toe down, top toe down, almost like pointing a toe down, and then Would slowly lift the the leg up while pointing the toe down.[1:25:50] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I got it incorrect here. And then holding that, and there's a there's a muscle that sort of sits at the top of the glute. It kind of Peaks out every once in a while. You can feel it there with your thumb, which is, I think, that you had pushed back on it Yeah. A bit, creating that mind muscle Link again and, and there with proprioception, the actual feeling of a muscle literally with a with a limb.[1:26:10] Andrew Huberman: We know For the based on the neural circuits for movement, that that enhances the contractile ability of a muscle. So, like, if you touch your bicep, You literally can contract it more more strongly, and this makes total sense based on, neuromuscular physiology. So it's had me do that repeatedly. I started doing that in my hotel room, and the pain started to disappear. And then it came back again in the afternoon, so I did it again in the afternoon.[1:26:35] Andrew Huberman: So this is something I did for 3 or 4 days, and lo and behold, my back pain's gone. I handed this off to my father because he, like me, has a slightly lower right shoulder. I think Our gate is probably thrown off by this. It's probably genetic, and who knows? He handed off to somebody.[1:26:51] Andrew Huberman: You know, it turns out that We don't suffer from back pain. And in fact, now I don't suffer from anything because I I was doing this exercise, which I think is helping my lower my medial glute. Two reasons why I raised this. 1, I know a lot of guys who have this right side sciatica because people keep the wallet there is one idea, or left side sciatica. There are a lot of people, male and female, who think they have back pain when they don't actually have back pain.[1:27:14] Andrew Huberman: And the other thing is that is about a general question about biomechanics or Statement about biomechanics. I had a feeling that a lot of what people think is back pain or knee pain or neck pain or headache or shoulder pain is actually, The consequence of something that's happening above or below that site of pain.[1:27:33] Jeff Cavaliere: Right.[1:27:33] Andrew Huberman: And, this is a whole landscape of of stuff related to PT and and and recovery and and pain management. But, maybe you just, educate us a bit on this and why this works, what is the medial glute, Why did it make my so called back pain disappear, and, how should people think about pain? And I like to use this as a segue to get into a little bit deeper discussion about pain and recovery.[1:27:55] Jeff Cavaliere: Sure. So there there this is definitely like a a a big cornucopia of PT stuff here, but, like, I and this is what I love. So First of all, that video, that is it it's my proudest video that I have, and the reason being is that I it's helped so many people. Like, we we get on that video every day. I don't even know how many of you just got now 30 some odd million or it's there's a lot[1:28:17] Andrew Huberman: of We will link to it. Yeah. There's a lot of shows.[1:28:20] Jeff Cavaliere: And and Quite honestly, it was a it was a little bit of an afterthought video in terms of the its its, its origin. I think that that day, maybe Jesse was having some problems or something like that, a little bit of low back pain, and and I showed him, and it helped right away. I was like, well, you know, we can make a video on it because this this will help people. You know? Not not everybody.[1:28:38] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? If you have Real disc problem is not gonna help, you know, because you're not changing the structural problem that's there. But as you said, a lot of people don't. You know? And and even disc issues, you know, a lot of them are nonoperative, so you'd wanna try these things first.[1:28:55] Jeff Cavaliere: As far as what you sort of experience, sometimes as that glute medius really tightens down, and that's that's again from poor biomechanics up and down the kinet chain, It can actually press on the sciatic nerve and give you what they call a pseudosciatica, you know, where it it it you're it's not like you're You're making it up. It's not like you're not feeling that pain over that same sciatic distribution, but it's not caused from a disc. It's not caused from something mechanical There, it's caused by the fact that this gluteus medius has has posturally become a problem for you or weak, you know, because you don't train it, And you need to address it. So, like, unlike not unlike any other muscle in the body, there are common trigger points in common areas where The muscle will become tightened or painful or spasmed, and you can basically apply pressure to these areas To and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure by pushing down through there and then contracting the muscle, which is why You go through that action of you know, we I think we call it toast stabber, but, like, stabbing down and lifting up and stabbing down and lifting up, Taking that that glute medius through its function so that it's basically kinda working underneath the downward pressure of the finger.[1:30:09] Jeff Cavaliere: And that tends to help you to almost, you know, need out what might be the that trigger point. And that's why people can see immediate relief there because once the trigger point lets go, it feels like and that's the what the comments are in that video. Like, My god. I'd I couldn't walk. I've been on my hotel floor.[1:30:27] Jeff Cavaliere: I did this, and I'm fixed. And meanwhile, then, you know, it could Come back because your body is like, well, I I like being more like this. This is how I've been, you know, in, in ingrained to be. So it might come back, but then when you do another Round of it and another round of it, and then finally it starts to say, alright. I'm not gonna do that anymore.[1:30:43] Jeff Cavaliere: Kinda eases up, and you can relieve yourself of those of those trigger points. You could do that up and down The back, there's other people that get that in that sort of inside their shoulder blade, you know, that that same type of cramping in another area. But Once that takes place, well, then the job that I think people have is, like, become educated that, you know, the glute medius is different than the glute Maximus. See, like, their functions are are different. You know?[1:31:08] Jeff Cavaliere: You have to work on not just extending the hip, but also abduction of the hip, external rotation of the hip. Same thing as in the in the shoulder. And this actually segues nicely into what into the whole concept you were talking about. Like, The body is like a mirror image. The hip is like the shoulder.[1:31:24] Jeff Cavaliere: Right? The ankle is the wrist. The foot is the hand. Like, they're they're they the knee is the elbow. They're 2 hinge joints.[1:31:30] Jeff Cavaliere: They function that way. Well, with the shoulder, you've got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion, but the stability is lacking. Well, the same thing with the hip. Like, you've got mobility, but if you don't fully stabilize it by training all of the muscles of the hip and if you don't Strength in the external rotation of the hip, then, you know, you've you're you're gonna have issues. Like, it's that biomechanically gonna work the same way.[1:31:55] Jeff Cavaliere: If you think of the body as a series of, you know, bands, you know, pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, You know, you're being pulled into one direction or the other just by the balance of tension from 1 weak area to 1 dominantly tight area, and You need to make sure that you can sort of balance this out in order to eliminate some of the adaptations and compensations that happen. So What I say when we look at sort of the the, the the body as a whole, most often, wherever you're feeling the pain is Absolutely not to blame. There's not to blame. It is somewhere above or below as you hinted at. You know, you're talking about the the knee is my my favorite of it.[1:32:38] Jeff Cavaliere: Whenever you have knee pain, patellar tendonitis, which I I've I have forever. I've had, you know, bad, bad cases of patellar tendonitis where Squatting is very difficult for me. It's not the knee. The knee is the knee is literally a hinge joint that that you know, there's a there's a minor rotation capabilities in the knee, but it's a hinge joint. And it's being impacted by the hip and the ankle and in the foot.[1:33:01] Jeff Cavaliere: As I said before, how critical the foot is. If you thought of the of the knee Being the, like, the middle of a train track where the femur down your thigh and your shin down below your knee where the train track, What would happen if the foot collapses at the bottom? All of a sudden, that train track on the bottom gets torqued just a little bit. Well, who's gonna feel that the most? The area where it's torquing, which is at the knee.[1:33:25] Jeff Cavaliere: So the stresses are gonna be felt there. Meanwhile, the problem is the foot Or the problem is the ankle. People that are chronic ankle sprainers, you know, are almost always gonna wind up having back pain because the ankle sprain causes weakness in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain because now once I distort the ankle and the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain Its ability to hinge smoothly, so it torques on the femur to do that. Well, the femur is now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis, And the pelvis is out of whack, so it's really it's really as fascinating. Like, it's one of my favorite things about how the body works is, like, how interconnected it is and how one little thing somewhere causes repercussions somewhere else.[1:34:08] Jeff Cavaliere: And the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say, okay. I know where my symptom is, but I gotta find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else because it is gonna be usually either above or below. Mostly, usually, below because usually translates up the kinetic chain. But, usually, it's gonna be below, where the real source is. So people with low back pain usually have hip issues, Weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, it's almost always below.[1:34:35] Jeff Cavaliere: When you get into really high performance athletics though, It it almost works the other way, like, where we have pitchers who can't I mean, I I'm always fascinated by guys that have, Tommy John issues, you know, in their elbow. Right? Pitchers. Like, if you can't externally rotate the shoulder that we talked about again, the ability to get your shoulder back in the external rotation. Well, your arm has to get to a certain position for release of the baseball.[1:35:03] Jeff Cavaliere: And if it can't get there because you can't externally rotate the shoulder to get there, then the elbow has to sort of torque more in order to allow the arm to get back further. And it will try to take some of that motion from a joint that's not really again, another, you know, the hinge joint really capable of doing that. So it starts to stress that media level ligament To get a little bit further back because the shoulder is not working, and that just ultimately places strain on the elbow. So when you see a guy that has, Pain that floats around, a pitcher that floats around their arm, all that is is sort of this balance of compensation. Once his shoulder elbow starts hurting, Then he can't do the get the rain you know, the range from the elbow, so he tries to dig a little bit further back into external rotation, and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed.[1:35:46] Jeff Cavaliere: And then he feels that's inflamed. So then, by the way, during that time period, it takes some of the strain off the elbows so the elbow feels better. Then he decides, okay. Now I got the external rotation, but I'm getting too much of that. So now I start straining the elbow again, and it keeps going through this cycle.[1:35:59] Jeff Cavaliere: So your body is very smart, and it's gonna compensate every single time. It's gonna find the compensation, but there's no guarantee So that conversation doesn't leave you with a whole host of other issues.[1:36:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's fascinating. In another lifetime, I would have gone and been a PT, although it sounds like the community Among PTS online,[1:36:18] Jeff Cavaliere: they're I don't know what they listen. They're they're we're good people, but it's like[1:36:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Scientists and neuroscientists can get into pretty intense battles. You know, in coming from the academic community, you know, the the etiquette is so different online because I would say, you know, I think in person, people would probably behave a bit differently.[1:36:32] Jeff Cavaliere: Your hand and say hello.[1:36:33] Andrew Huberman: You shake your hand and say hello, and and, and there's also look. I'll I'll just be very direct about this. There are a lot of people online for whom Their only content is pointing out the, misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people. There's like the it or it's like the bulk of their identity, which to me is sort of a sad existence, but, you know, there's always more to gain by thinking about what's possible and what's new and what's good.[1:36:56] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[1:36:56] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, to each their own, demise, or when.[1:37:00] Jeff Cavaliere: I mean, question questioning what's out there is healthy. It's just normal. It's great. It actually sparks conversation. As you said, some people's existence is solely to find things to, you know, nag about and and not actually with the goal being to advance anything, but rather just to, Yeah.[1:37:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. In in the world of science, being skeptical but not cynical is is encouraged. But, I would say that the longer that somebody's in a career path, it's certainly in science or medicine, and they realize how hard it is to, you know, to do studies once they publish a few studies, generally, they they sort of, get a a better understanding of how how the various things are done. Yeah. In any case, Another, along the lines of of pain and pain relief and and misunderstandings about the origins of pain in the body, one of the great, tools that I I I picked up from your content, which is benefit, I know in a huge number of people is I think I used to hold, weights sometimes in the the tips of my fingers as opposed to in the meat of the palm of my hands, and I had elbow pain.[1:38:01] Jeff Cavaliere: And[1:38:01] Andrew Huberman: I always thought that I felt it most on tricep exercises and pushing exercise, and I thought was doing those exercises wrong. Turns out, I toward the end of my pull ups or my bicep work, I was letting the weight or the bar drift into my fingertips[1:38:13] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[1:38:14] Andrew Huberman: And the mere, Shift to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms has completely ameliorated that For reasons that you point out, and maybe you could just share with us why that is, you have this kind of finger pull exercise. You know, usually, when someone says pull my finger, it's like a bad middle school or elementary school joke, but[1:38:34] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, listen. I won't say push your finger.[1:38:36] Andrew Huberman: Right. Right. You[1:38:37] Jeff Cavaliere: know, the the yeah. This is fascinating. This is, because it just shows again how intricate the body is and how responsive or overresponsive can be to something so little. And, you know, what you're talking about is that when you grip a bar, whether it be through a curl or whether it be through and and this is mostly Pulling exercises because the tendency for the bar is gonna be to fall out of your hand, not like with a pushing exercise where it's kinda you know, you're you're pushing your hand into the bar. So on a bench press, say, that bar can drift just by gravity.[1:39:07] Jeff Cavaliere: We don't want doing its thing or fatigue of the the hand grip strength Can start to drift further away towards the the distal digits, right, through those through those last couple knuckles that we have on our hands. And Though our hand can still hold it there, the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads, and that can start at a very, I'm not gonna say light, but, like, you know, it could start at, you know, dumbbell weight, you know, 40 pounds, 30 pounds, know, even £25 or some depending upon their overall strength levels. But then when you start to apply it to something like your body weight with a chin up, Right? Because that's natural for the bar to somewhat kinda float down towards your fingertips. And it actually is a little bit easier to perform the exercise with that sort of, Like, false grip, little hook grip at the end because you're not gonna engage the forearms into the exercise.[1:40:01] Jeff Cavaliere: You're not gonna start pulling down. But at the same time, while it could help you to perform them better by getting the back more activated, if you have weakness in these muscles because not a it's not a that happens to every it's not one of those upright road type things where I think this is happening to everybody. This is happening to people that have these inherent weaknesses in this this, in in these these muscles, you or or haven't done enough of the gripping in the 4 in in the meat of the hand, you know, for long enough, But it starts to put that stress on these muscles that are ill equipped to do this and it to handle this, and it starts to it's particularly on that 4th finger, You know, which is part of the muscle we call the FDS, the flexor digitorum, that is just too much for it to handle, and that comes all the way down and meets right at the medial elbow, right on that Spot that you can say feels like someone's knifing you right in the middle in that medial elbow. In in medial epicondylitis or they call it golfer's elbow is something that A lot of us deal within the gym.[1:40:59] Jeff Cavaliere: It's one of the most common inflammatory conditions people get from the gym, and it all comes from this Positioning of the dumbbell or barbell or hand on a pull up bar over time. So the easiest thing to do is just Grip deeper so that what you're doing is you're using, you know, more leverage from the palm to encapsulate the bar or the dumbbell or whatever, and you're not Putting that pressure really distally right on that last digit because that's where the that FDS muscle is most Strain. So you you're just almost eliminating that from the equation. And and and it's one of those exercises that The load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly so that, like you know, maybe it's only capable of handling 30 pounds. And then when you're doing a chin up and it goes and it drifts so far That it's now you let's say you're a 200 pound guy.[1:41:49] Jeff Cavaliere: You've got, let's say, a 100 pounds through 1 arm and a 100 pound this is simple simplified math that obviously is offset by other muscles, but £100 to 1 arm, 100 pounds to there. Well, a £100 off of a muscle that can handle 30 is not gonna take many repetitions to strain it, And you're gonna feel that maybe by the time that set's over or certainly by the time that workout's over or the next day you wake up and you've got that notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels that, the best thing would be to determine, okay, what exercises were I doing that were pulling and where the bar could have drifted deeper They're into they're further from the meat of my palm into my fingers and figure out a way to deepen that grip. When that happens, though, the best thing to do With most of these inflammatory conditions is not do any of that stuff for a little while. Not ever, just for a little while.[1:42:35] Jeff Cavaliere: There's always things that you can do around it. I'm not saying ever do I say, like, don't go to the gym or don't find something you can do, but I'm saying That particular exercise that you feel the pain on while you're doing it, never a smart idea to do that exercise when It's inflamed. If you are doing exercise and it hurts, you probably shouldn't do the exercise because another, you know you know, reason, For the variability of exercises, there there's so many other options that you can do that will train similar muscles or even the same motion and not cause that stress. So, I mean, a cable a cable curl would be much easier to do that on than, let's say, a chin up where you don't have the control over the weight like you do by moving a pin on a stack. So, you know, I think that that that is a common thing that people find, and the best thing to do is just figure out how How deep are you gripping that bar?[1:43:25] Jeff Cavaliere: You're gonna find that, oh my god. I didn't realize that because it was just even though you you might start a set in a good position, and then it drifts away as you go.[1:43:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think that's what was happening to me, and I'm very conscious of this now. Again, for me, it's I haven't had this elbow pain at all. So, That's great. You know, very fortunate.[1:43:42] Andrew Huberman: So, again, a a debt of gratitude to you. Never I thought there's something wrong with my elbow, basically. Then I thought maybe it was tennis elbow. I don't even play tennis. So, there you go.[1:43:53] Andrew Huberman: Other aspects of recovery and variables for recovery, think, you and I both put out content about the use of cold, and I think we can summarize it by saying, yeah. It does seem like cold water immersion immediately after Hypertrophy or strange workouts might be a problem, but a cold shower is probably not a problem. What about heat? Do you do you personally use heat and cold, Saunas, hot, you know, hot baths, hot compresses, you and by you, I mean, you personally and and athletes, that you coach or people that you coach, what are your thoughts on the use of heat and or cold?[1:44:28] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, I think, you know, It it might just be an inherited practice from the days of, you know, trainers of of, you know, since, Babe Ruth. You know? But we we in baseball, we used a lot of cold Following performance, you know, just because the the idea would be there there is some especially pitchers, you know, there is some inflammation, that is abnormal. You know, the arm is not really designed to do what they do, especially at the at the speed that they move it and everything else. So we would use, you know, ice as a pretty Standard practice after that, but not not a lot of heat.[1:45:00] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? And I don't need to use a lot of heat. And, of course, from the recovery or the the the healing aspect, That actually becomes rather, personal preference they've found now, after, let's say, the first 12 to 24 hours, you know, where you're really trying to control inflammation of what you know might be an injury. But then it then it can kinda shift the personal preference because The heat can bring blood to the area also, and then the, you know, the the the cold has its sort of anti, inflammatory effects. So, like, there's a there's a balance between Which one's working better for you?[1:45:30] Jeff Cavaliere: So there's really no standard anymore for heat or cold in that way. But from a standpoint of, Like, post workout healthy status, I haven't used much heat or cold in terms of what we do. We, you know, we cover the topic of the cold showers and To try to dispel the myth of the, you know, even people saying that there's giant testosterone releases and, you know, all kinds of stuff that, You know, listen. We hear all kinds of things because people want like, I think the idea of just turning the water cold and being in it for 30 seconds and then all of a sudden magically growing 3 times your size is intriguing for a lot of people, and they and that's why they ask these questions because they're like, that would be a hell of a lot easier than going to the gym and training hard. But, like, I'm always fascinated by some of the stuff that that you talked about.[1:46:13] Jeff Cavaliere: In fact, we started to talk about some of the stuff in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance, and that was you know? Like, There there's some untapped territory there that I think you're you're finding out about.[1:46:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. What would be fun would be to bring the cool Mitt Technology from Stanford. This is Craig Heller, my colleague Craig Heller's, lab at Stanford. He's done really important and, amazing work in this area, but then it moved on some other things. He's also working on Down syndrome, and he works on a number of other really important topics that scientists often do.[1:46:42] Andrew Huberman: But I have Test to the cool MET technology. No relationship to the company, by the way. We'd love to come out to your facility, and and, we can do the Blind, type studies.[1:46:52] Jeff Cavaliere: Like a blue blocker test.[1:46:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And, and see how that goes, in in with somebody advanced As advanced trained as you, that that's probably the best thing to do. So, content for the future.[1:47:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think heat and cold are are kinda staples in the ET World, and I it does seem like people use them, slightly differently, but they are they are kind of the macronutrients of of recovery there along along with sleep. I would I do have a question about precision of record keeping. Do you keep a training journal? Do you recommend people keep training journals?[1:47:27] Andrew Huberman: Are you neurotically fixed to, you know, cadence of movement? And, are you looking at the you have a buzzer going off for night when it's 90 seconds rest? Is it 90 seconds rest? I confess I have my slow workouts and my faster workouts.[1:47:39] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[1:47:40] Andrew Huberman: And they scale with whether or not I'm training heavier with longer rest[1:47:43] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[1:47:43] Andrew Huberman: Or whether or not maybe midway through a workout, I'll shift over to doing higher repetition, lower rest. This is kind of, My, you know, crude way of of keeping time, but I'm not you know, will be just to kinda watch the clock. But I'm not Neurotically fixed to the buzzer, nor am I on social media during my workouts, which is actually a way to really improve workouts is to just not Be on social media.[1:48:07] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. I I can't claim that I'm not guilty of that. Sometimes I am on social media, but sometimes I'm trying Post something[1:48:13] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's different. It's your[1:48:14] Jeff Cavaliere: it's your profession.[1:48:15] Andrew Huberman: It's your profession.[1:48:16] Jeff Cavaliere: But, I mean, I I, I I'm not I'm not, necessarily, chained to some sort of protocol in terms of how I do. I think by this point, I've been doing this a long time. And not only is it something that I've done for a long time, but it's it's a passion of mine, something I really enjoy. So I probably inherently have the ability to stick to these these, Guidelines in terms of rest time, to know what I lifted, you know, even 6 months ago on a lift and and and how it felt Without journaling it, but I recognize the value it has to a lot of people. It goes back to that whole my muscle connection idea that we talked about in the beginning.[1:48:57] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, There's a lack of awareness for all aspects of training, especially maybe isn't like your interest level. You know, we're talking you and I From a a a position of interest. Like, this is what we do. We we enjoy just how our bodies work and understanding how they work. Some people don't care.[1:49:13] Jeff Cavaliere: They just want the end result. But journaling and keeping track of that raises awareness to where, like, oh my god. I would I I have been on, you know, Instagram for the last 7 minutes, I was supposed to be back at my next set in 90 seconds. Like, there is a training effect of that. You know?[1:49:28] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, you you you know, if you're training For a metabolic overload, you've blown that opportunity because you haven't you know, your rest time was very, was very important to that protocol working as it should. If you were training for strength, maybe the extra few minutes doesn't matter so much. When you get back on the bar, you might find I mean, you might find that it's a better for your body to rest even longer than you've been told, 3, 4 minutes, 5 minutes. And so in that way, maybe it helps. But I think that anything you can do to increase your awareness of your performance and also give yourself some objective goal.[1:50:04] Jeff Cavaliere: Whenever we have an objective goal, it's a lot easier to actually obtain it. When you're just there to get a pump and you're just there to lift how you feel that day, You have to be incredibly disciplined in all other aspects of your workout in order to make that effective. You know? And I and I've done that too. I've actually been able to do that 2.[1:50:21] Jeff Cavaliere: But, again, the level of repetitions I've accumulated over the course of my life in the in the amount that I that I, you know, read about this stuff. And, I think I'm able to get away with that, but, but I think more often than not, what I'm doing is not journaling, but journaling in my head Exactly what I think people should be doing, and that is getting a specific effect from what you're trying to do. It's not so haphazard. You know? You wanna get a specific effect just like any other experiment that you're doing.[1:50:49] Jeff Cavaliere: You're doing an experiment on your own body with your own weights, which to me is one of the most empowering things someone can ever do. When they get bitten by the bug for, You know, exercising and and training, and, yeah, I like to use the word training rather than exercise because there's a purpose behind it. But when they get bitten by that training bug And they start to see actual changes and results. You know how empowering that is? Because we can't chain we can't really control that many things in our life, unfortunately.[1:51:13] Jeff Cavaliere: Is there some things that happen to us that we really wish never happened, and those are not something that we can do anything about. But this is one thing that we can do our best to we can't Avoid disease entirely. We can't predict when we're gonna die. We can't, you know, do those things, but we can certainly decide to show up into the gym that day And get a workout in or go for a run or do something. And by doing that, you're giving yourself, I think, a better chance at a higher quality of life.[1:51:38] Jeff Cavaliere: So Anything you could do to increase your awareness of it and keep you on track with that is, like, I'm endorsing fully. Couldn't agree more. I could not agree more. The There is[1:51:48] Andrew Huberman: a topic. It's sort of a dreaded topic, but I think it's an important one, and that's the topic of nutrition.[1:51:53] Jeff Cavaliere: Yes.[1:51:54] Andrew Huberman: And rather than getting into specific meal programs, which would, You know, take take hours and and probably wouldn't even manage to scratch the surface even with hours. We could talk about principles around nutrition. What are sort of the themes that you think people should keep in mind, in when thinking about how to eat generally? And pre Training and post training are 2, particularly sensitive times for most or times that people want to know a lot about. Know, what should they eat before training, or can they train fastage?[1:52:27] Andrew Huberman: What should they eat afterwards? But just in general, what do you think are some some axioms of of of nutrition that that really hold. And I I asked this, I, because not because there's a lot of debate about this, But because you've been around this space a long time[1:52:43] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[1:52:43] Andrew Huberman: And you've seen what works for you, obviously, but for other people too. You know, what tends to work? What tends not to work? And, now how should we think about nutrition?[1:52:54] Jeff Cavaliere: I mean, look. You you've touched on it a bit, but, like, You know, nutrition can be a touchy subject for people, and and I understand where that comes from. I I've talked about before the There's a dogmatic tendency to to nutrition, and there's a reason for it because it's an area that people struggle with More than anything else, and the reason why people struggle with nutrition is because the commitment is extremely high. You know, you could Start a workout program and actually get to the gym 3 to 5 times a week. That's 5 hours based on how you and I were discussing it before.[1:53:28] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, what about the other 23 hours of each of those days? There's opportunity to eat incorrectly or unhealthily. Every one of those hours, people wake up in the middle of the night to go eat. You know? Like, there are there are things that you can do that can cause amazing amounts of damage, to your longevity, in the 23 hours, not the 1 hour, the 23 hours, so when people finally figure out a a way To make that work for them, it's very passionate, and I understand their passion.[1:53:59] Jeff Cavaliere: I do. Like, I put out. So my approach my approach is, like, I've always been sort of a low sugar, lower fat guy. I made the mistake of going no fat years ago, and paid for it. I was, like, in college.[1:54:11] Jeff Cavaliere: And, you know, back in the day, we were the same age. You know? We read the all the magazines, and our that was what we have. We didn't have Internet then, so we were we were reading magazines, and the Recommended path was to go low fat. It helps you to become hypocaloric very easily because the density of the Calories, you know, and a gram of fat versus a gram of carbohydrates or protein is 9 versus 4 for the carbs and protein.[1:54:34] Jeff Cavaliere: So if you're cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis, you're quickly cutting out calories that allows you to get leaner. Well, of course, as everything, I And I if little is good, then a lot is better. So I would cut all of them out or almost all of them. And at the age of 20 221, I'm, like, standing at a a stop at up at University of Connecticut waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus, And I couldn't even open my eyes because the light was blinding to me. It was normal sunlight.[1:55:04] Jeff Cavaliere: It was blinding to me. The photosensitivity I had, You know, learning later on after a few more courses that I took there in biology, you know, how how, you know, necessary That was for the development of healthy, you know, cells. I I realized what was going on. And not to admit other stuff. Skin was bad.[1:55:23] Jeff Cavaliere: Hair was falling out. All kinds of stuff. So I I I think that The approach to decreasing fat so it's not excessive, you know, because, again, how calorically dense it could be in having lower sugar. I don't I'm a a firm believer in sugar is really pretty toxic and, something that we would all do better getting rid of a lot of it. That is the best approach for, I believe, again, in my opinion, personally, for the overall big picture.[1:55:52] Jeff Cavaliere: Because Though the people can take exclusionary approaches to nutrition and taking carbs out or, you know, you know, eating only fats and proteins or, Again, I'm not saying it doesn't work for you. And if it's the first thing that actually allowed you to gain control of your nutrition to the point where you actually saw results and got to a healthier weight, Then I always say then do it, then do it, but just make sure it's something you can do forever and doesn't bring upon other repercussions. But I think that nonexclusionary approaches to diets are the the most sustainable for the rest of your life. When I and all I'm interested in from a nutrition standpoint is something that's sustainable. So when I preach what I preach, I've been doing this since I was 15, 14.[1:56:35] Jeff Cavaliere: You know, people say, like, how's he get so ripped? How's he get I have been doing this for 4 Since for how many years? 30 30 years? 30 clean low sugar. Yeah.[1:56:44] Jeff Cavaliere: 30 years. You know? And in the beginning, it was a slow Shift I had to make where I was like, I went from the worst diet in the whole world. I was even when I was 14 years old, My breakfast was, I talked about this so many times, but, like, enemans. I would eat enemans, you know, donuts and and Those long road.[1:57:03] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. The lobster. Yeah. And crumb doughnut took the whole[1:57:06] Andrew Huberman: out of the doughnut. Yeah.[1:57:07] Jeff Cavaliere: The crumb the crumb exactly.[1:57:08] Andrew Huberman: Why would you why would you delete the middle of[1:57:11] Jeff Cavaliere: the doughnut? There's you know, the the crumb The crumb donut there, I would you know, I[1:57:14] Andrew Huberman: would eat donut doughnut. In my I don't like sugar very much, but over the years, I've lost my appetite for sugar. Right. That's true. About the end to end zones, I can literally Smell and taste the frosting.[1:57:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And to me now, it's disgusting. But back then, it might have been appetizing.[1:57:27] Jeff Cavaliere: Would probably have, like, really good information on this, but, like, My ability to actually remember I know and I they've said smell is very, evoking of memories.[1:57:37] Andrew Huberman: Right? So there's Smell is unlike the other senses because there's a direct line literally from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain. It doesn't have to go through any intermediate[1:57:46] Jeff Cavaliere: Okay. So, you know, my ability to actually recall exact taste of all the stuff I used to love is enough to satisfy me To not in to to not engage in those things now, as crazy as that is. I like, I almost get my fill through remembering because of these strong senses of of memory Of what it was like is, oh, that used to taste so good. Okay. That's good.[1:58:08] Jeff Cavaliere: I had it. So that Fantastic. Yeah.[1:58:09] Andrew Huberman: That's well, that's that's we know the neuromodulator there. That's dopamine. Yeah. Your ability to The the dopamine release from the thought of something Yeah. Most people, when they get that dopamine release, it causes a A triggering of the desire for more.[1:58:23] Andrew Huberman: For more. Right? People think of of dopamine as pleasure. Dopamine, there's a book great book called The Molecule of More. I didn't write the book, unfortunately, but someone else did.[1:58:31] Andrew Huberman: And it's a great book, and it's really about how dopamine we think it's about pleasure, but it establishes craving.[1:58:36] Jeff Cavaliere: Okay.[1:58:37] Andrew Huberman: So you're able to satisfy that, and it's a very adaptive thing for you because You are indeed very lean. Yeah. And that's one of your kind of hallmark things. And, you know, as a professional who does this in the public space, that's important, you know, when people are out there talking Getting lean, and you look at them, and you're like, you know, may maybe you need to do the protocols. It's a huge advantage.[1:58:56] Andrew Huberman: But, yeah, I think that, it sounds like you've Cultivated practices around avoiding certain things.[1:59:03] Jeff Cavaliere: Yes. Yeah. I I mean but not, you know, avoiding certain things that I think are Easily avoided if you realize that there I mean, I think that we have enough science and literature out there to prove that the the altered path is a better path. You know?[1:59:18] Andrew Huberman: You know[1:59:18] Jeff Cavaliere: what I mean? Like, I feel like if I if I was just doing it because I wanted to be lean, I'm not quite sure it woulda held for so long. You know?[1:59:25] Andrew Huberman: And we have a guest that, whose episode has been recorded for this podcast, who runs an eating disorder clinic at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD, and And he will go on record and obesity, and he will go on record saying that these very highly palatable processed high sugar foods of the sort that we're talking about, Doughnuts and so forth, that they are actually dangerous. Right? That there are elements of the way that they engage neural circuitry, he's a neurosurgeon, that Reshape the brain in dangerous ways, and those are his words. And, we[2:00:01] Jeff Cavaliere: had tank enemas, for sure. Yeah.[2:00:03] Andrew Huberman: And it's not just enemas. I mean, I think, they're not just enemas. Right? Yeah. They're coming after us with with what?[2:00:09] Andrew Huberman: With donuts.[2:00:10] Jeff Cavaliere: Exactly. Yeah.[2:00:11] Andrew Huberman: They can't catch us. Right. True. Right? In any case, so In terms of what you do eat, how do you structure that, in terms of when you look down at a plate, you've done these[2:00:23] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[2:00:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Describe this before, but I think it's just a beautifully Simple description because I think a lot of people don't wanna do calorie counting and all this. And, you know, how do you how should people think about what to eat?[2:00:35] Jeff Cavaliere: So, yeah, I I have what I, like, what I call plate method, and it's just it's just simple because it works for me. You know? And and, again, if you're struggling with, with real eating issues, these these mechanisms become admittedly less effective because you're having maybe you have emotionally triggered eating, and you can't Stop at 1 plate. I mean, that you could get the plate right, but if the portions are out of control Plate. Right.[2:00:58] Andrew Huberman: Plate has a dimensionality of height[2:00:59] Jeff Cavaliere: to height too. Or or multiple plates, you know, like 2nd and 3rd Or plates, you know, like, 2nd and 3rd or plates, right, or plate. Right? Like, then I you know, all these things could be challenged, but what I what I say is, when you have your plate, then you just simply look at it as like a, like a clock. Right?[2:01:15] Jeff Cavaliere: And, if you just make a 920 on the clock, so 1 arm goes over to the 9 and one of the arms goes over to 20, Well, then you're basically you're gonna take the the 2nd largest portion, you know, of that, because you think you're gonna make a a line towards 12 o'clock too. And the largest portion is gonna be your fibrous carbohydrates. So that's the the the, you know, the green vegetables. Right? So whether it be broccoli or brussels sprouts or asparagus Or, you know, you know, pick your pick your favorites.[2:01:45] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? Like, those are the ones that give us a lot of the micronutrients we need. They're the ones that are generally, You know, accept it as more healthy, and they're also gonna provide the fiber that's gonna be both beneficial in terms of its, impact on insulin and also just through Filling you up. Right? And then I take the next largest portion of that, and I devote that towards protein.[2:02:06] Jeff Cavaliere: And I think it's really important, especially for anybody active. The more active you are, the more you embark on trying to build muscle. You're gonna need to have protein every meal, so I have that. And, again, You know, we're talking cleaner sources of protein, but, like, I I am you'll never find, like, boiled chicken on my plate. Like, I ditched those days when I was 16 or 15 or 16.[2:02:25] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, I realized after reading those bodybuilding magazines that maybe the low fat thing stuck for too long, but the or the no fat thing stuck for too long. But the boiled chicken and and, you know, a steamed broccoli thing, that ended quickly for me because I really I'm not gonna eat this forever. So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken or but they'll it will be it will be cooked in a way that's that's like you know, it's got maybe some sauce on it or it's got some maybe it's Tomato sauce, anything that to just make it a little bit more palatable and interesting without blowing the value of the meal. And then that last portion is where I put my starchy carbohydrates. Again, that's the part that some people will say exclude them entirely because they're not healthy or they don't work for you or they're not, you know, beneficial long term.[2:03:06] Jeff Cavaliere: For me, It's been a godsend, and and I do think I'm like most people. My body craves those carbohydrates. I choose things like sweet potatoes, which is my Favorite, you know, or I'll have, rice or I'll have pasta. I'm I'm Italian, so I like pasta. And, like, I will have those things.[2:03:24] Jeff Cavaliere: I'm not excluding them, but I don't put them in the portions that you would generally find. You know, my wife and I will go out, and we'll go to the restaurant sometimes, like, because we travel, quite a bit are used to at least with baseball too. There's a Cheesecake Factory everywhere you went, and I love Cheesecake Factory. But, like, The way they structure meals is it's all rice on the bottom and a little bit chicken on top. And, I mean, it's a plate full of rice That you wouldn't find me make a plate that way.[2:03:50] Jeff Cavaliere: I'm gonna just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms Portion control. Because those are the foods, again, probably, you know, dopamine driven that are most easily overeaten. I always ask the question, How was the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal? Like, you're getting sick of it after maybe 2 or 3.[2:04:11] Jeff Cavaliere: But you could eat a whole hell of a lot of carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates, because The they're just so satisfying, and I think those triggers, as you said, the want more, like, that's what happens. Right? You just keep even when you're feeling full, you want more. And that's the biggest danger to carbohydrates. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, Then you can still enjoy them.[2:04:33] Jeff Cavaliere: If you can't develop that discipline, for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work self around or or adopt a different eating style. And as I said, I'm never to the point where I'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach. I'm always trying to say, this how I do it, and I'm and I'm a believer in it just like everyone else is believer in their method. But I'm open to the idea that something that works for you and gets you to a A healthier weight and a sustainability, like, that is good. That's that's good for me, you know, provided it doesn't introduce other other issues.[2:05:04] Jeff Cavaliere: You know?[2:05:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Something one can do consistently. That's something I picked up from you, over the years. You know? What can you do consistently?[2:05:11] Andrew Huberman: And for me, that also meant What, when, and how can I eat? What can I eat consistently that will also allow me to be alert after lunch so I can actually get some work done?[2:05:19] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[2:05:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Or eat. I like to train fasted in the morning, but I don't do any long term fasting. It just so happens that I'm fine doing, water and caffeine in the morning and, training in the morning, and then I eat my first meal afterwards. It just but I get carbohydrates at night, so my glycogen is root is stored.[2:05:35] Andrew Huberman: I I think carbohydrates are wonderful. I just don't eat them in excess. Right. To me, it's I I feel like when, what you describe as a very rational, literally balanced approach[2:05:45] Jeff Cavaliere: Mhmm.[2:05:45] Andrew Huberman: And, obviously, there will be variations people who are dealing with obesity or diabetes or you know, I I've got friends that are on the the pure carnivore thing. I have friends that are vegan, and, it's always impressive to me when somebody can, stick to anything consistently, except when they're sticking to just behavior. Because that's there's nothing impressive about that. Well, I think that that's very helpful, because I think there's a for the typical Listener of this podcast, you know, the the online content that people see, the battles are very confusing. They're they're distracting.[2:06:19] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[2:06:19] Andrew Huberman: Because people really think, oh, there's a right way and a wrong way, and it's a it sounds like the way that one can, eat consistently over time that's healthy, certainly fewer processed and sugary foods. I think almost every[2:06:31] Jeff Cavaliere: day makes it Yeah. Almost everyone agrees on that. Right? So I I think it is a it's it's, It's calorie manipulation through some other method. Alright?[2:06:39] Jeff Cavaliere: So even even intermittent fasting, like, you know, like you said, like, I that could be It's it's for people that are grazers. Like, if you are a grazer and your real problem is portion control over the course of the day, But you can respond to a rule that says no. You're eating between here and here, that you can obey that rule. Well, you're not gonna able to graze during the times that you might be doing additional damage. So, sure, there's there's there's other hormonal benefits that people will talk about from that approach, but From a longevity standpoint and habit forming standpoint, if it's fixing the habit that you're breaking too often By eating throughout, whenever you feel like you walk by food, you know, it's good, you know, and it works.[2:07:21] Jeff Cavaliere: And, again, there it's it's it's, You know, people can will tell you you can probably eat whatever you wanna eat as long as you're eating within those that window, but I think the more responsible people Who are practitioners of that will say, no. You still wanna avoid processed sugar and and and things like that. So, and that's just the mechanism of Not really a diet. Right? But, like, it's it's I think that people I I hate this I hate to be as, like, as as basic as as it sounds with that, but it's for the exact reason that If it's that 23 hour day phenomenon that it's like you know, you said you're impressed.[2:07:54] Jeff Cavaliere: It is impressive. You know? It's so hard to control all of our behaviors and Food being one of the hardest thing one of the biggest temptations for people. You gotta learn how to control that for so long and then do it day after day after day. Whatever that mechanism is that works for you is is impressive, and and I and I'm a and I'm a I'm I'm a believer in it.[2:08:14] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? I I think that's the That's that's how I feel. I just feel like people need to be able to be given some reins to be able to to find what works for them.[2:08:23] Andrew Huberman: Well, I love to eat. And one of the beauties of weight training is I feel like I can eat plenty Yeah. For my age, and, I'm not as lean as you are, but I'm I'm, Happy with where I'm at. Yeah. I could always do better.[2:08:34] Andrew Huberman: You know? With each year, actually, I I'm getting better, probably because I'm eating cleaner, probably because I also have someone to cook for[2:08:40] Jeff Cavaliere: me now, and[2:08:41] Andrew Huberman: we like helps.[2:08:42] Jeff Cavaliere: And we like help. That too.[2:08:44] Andrew Huberman: We like healthy food, and so we're I'm very fortunate. I don't think we have any packaged food in our home. We even started making sauerkraut at home. I don't make it. Yeah.[2:08:52] Andrew Huberman: She makes it when they[2:08:53] Jeff Cavaliere: My my wife actually you know, she she, turned me on to a tip that I actually Jared, with with the the whole channel, which was like, you can you can go to, we have Stew Leonard's around our our big grocery store chain around us, and they have a catering department. And, you know, they're often used for catering big parties and, you know, big tubs of of of grilled chicken, but, like, really good grilled chicken. Again, not the boiled chicken, but, They're big tubs of sweet potatoes, and we'll, you know, we'll get a bunch of those, and she'll go over and she'll get them, then she'll sort of arrange, you know, them on plates And put the plates in and, like, I'm okay with repetitive eating. I think more people are probably okay with repetitive eating than they think. I think that When you actually break down how many different breakfast like, variations do you have?[2:09:39] Jeff Cavaliere: 3, 2?[2:09:40] Andrew Huberman: 2 or 3[2:09:40] Jeff Cavaliere: at maximum. So, like, I think when people do, there's more variety for dinner probably, but, like, you even there, you probably eat 5 different types of dinners, you know, over the course of, you know, a week or a month. Well, you know, if you have that ability to identify the things that you'd like and, again, no plan is gonna work if you're eating stuff you don't like. It's not gonna work forever. Nothing will.[2:10:00] Jeff Cavaliere: You have to really enjoy what you're eating. As long as these these, variations of this meal are something that you really enjoy And there are limited versions of them. The reproducibility of that is simple. You know? It will take some time, but if you're Fortunate enough in our case to have somebody who can prepare it for you, now that's even part out of the equation.[2:10:20] Jeff Cavaliere: You know? And it's it's it's like it it just makes it very simple. But I do think When you tally up all the costs of medical care that are that are that are spiked by having poor nutrition, and you then Offset that by what it might cost you to invest in a faster strategy like this catering trick or whatever it might be. You'd be best off figuring out a way to maybe reallocate some of your money to preparing this because you know how how important it is to your long term health and and and longevity. If you can Figure out your nutrition issues.[2:10:52] Jeff Cavaliere: If everyone listening to this podcast can figure out their nutrition issues, this whole world would be different. That is, like, are the largest sources of disease and and pain and discomfort because people really struggle with nutrition?[2:11:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And it's a it's a huge problem. Yeah. I mean, the obesity, it it is an epidemic in this country. It's very, very serious.[2:11:11] Andrew Huberman: Also, a lot of highly processed foods are are more expensive than healthier foods. When you when you really Right. Break it down, even the even the better sourced high high quality foods are right there on par less than, the processed foods, for sure. I have a couple other questions as it relates, to training, because I think that one, one thing that A lot of people wonder about and maybe we could do this in kind of a true false, method, first just to get some of these[2:11:42] Jeff Cavaliere: 5050, y'all gotta get it right at least.[2:11:44] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Men and women should train differently.[2:11:48] Jeff Cavaliere: The science of it will say false. The and, again, not not to generalize, but kind of the point you touched on earlier today. I do find That casually interested women in training will migrate more towards certain types of fitness, Like kickboxing, like dancing, like, you know Low[2:12:09] Andrew Huberman: rest circuit type?[2:12:10] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I and I think, again, whatever it is that you're going to engage in regularly is what you should do. Physiologically, no.[2:12:18] Jeff Cavaliere: And I think if if if we can get more women to feel more comfortable in the gym, Performing the same exercises and the same, in in receiving the same strength training benefits and working on progressive overload and, like, you know, we've hit the holy grail. But I think that, it's a it's a a big bridge that has to be gapped still because, you know, there's just some reality to listen. There there are very my wife is a perfect example of this. Live living a very complicated busy life. We have 2 young boys.[2:12:50] Jeff Cavaliere: They're they're twins, And her her attention and focus is there. You know? And it's like, she she doesn't do this for a living like I do. And if she can get a decent workout in, she's happy. You know?[2:13:02] Jeff Cavaliere: But she's not necessarily working on her deadlift PR. You know? And so I think that that would help her and serve her in the long term to work on increasing her her PRs and different lifts and building her strength progressively. But I I you know what? In in in her life right now, it's not necessarily in the cards to have the time to focus on that.[2:13:21] Jeff Cavaliere: So would you then Courage, you know, this other thing that she might find interesting, like some, boxing. You know? There there's a little, I don't remember the brand, but, like, one of those punchable boxing, stand up things, you know, and she enjoys it. You know? And, you know, like, Anything to get to get you moving is gonna be preferable, but I don't think that necessarily, physiologically, there's a there's a there's a difference.[2:13:44] Andrew Huberman: You start weight training pretty young.[2:13:46] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. For me.[2:13:47] Andrew Huberman: But, you[2:13:47] Jeff Cavaliere: know, I I I messed around, you know, with my brother because he was older. He was 4 years older, so I was kinda messing around with weights probably 12 or 13 with a 5 pound dumbbell. Okay. Yeah.[2:13:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You hear that, young kids shouldn't work out with the weights. I don't know what the going standard is now. They say, oh, you know, shuts down long bone growth or, growth plates, You know, this sort of thing. You've got 2 young boys, adorable kids, by the way.[2:14:08] Andrew Huberman: Nice. Yeah. One of the one of the things that is is very, heartwarming is to see You're in great shape. You're clearly extremely bright. You know your craft.[2:14:15] Andrew Huberman: You love your craft. You work with Jesse who we'll talk about as well.[2:14:20] Jeff Cavaliere: It's great to see[2:14:21] Andrew Huberman: which is great. You know, that there's a camaraderie there. Mhmm. Having great teammates as part of a business or or To work out with this just makes life better. Let's just be honest.[2:14:29] Andrew Huberman: I'm grateful to have great teammates for the podcast and my lab, of course, as well. But, To see your boys and your dogs and the the whole picture, you know, it's it's a you know, I'm sure it has a lot of, contours and complexity that we don't know about and shouldn't know about, but it's a beautiful picture. And, will they wait train? I've seen the videos of, 1 or both of them hanging from the box.[2:14:51] Jeff Cavaliere: These kids have naturals. I'm telling you that. I I don't I wonder[2:14:54] Andrew Huberman: where they get it from.[2:14:55] Jeff Cavaliere: I don't even I I, you know, I don't even encourage it. I'm not gonna be the dad who's sitting there saying, let's go, son. We are yeah. Right. Yeah.[2:15:01] Jeff Cavaliere: We got our 2 days. You know? I'm not gonna Not gonna do that, but they they have a a a natural interest in the gym. They just sometimes like to be out with daddy. So they'll come out there and, you know, I I of the 2 of us, my wife and I will be the one who has a little bit more of a longer leash to let them explore things because I was a A dummy at times too and figured out best through the mistakes I made.[2:15:23] Jeff Cavaliere: Injury. Yeah. Yeah. We in neuroscience, we[2:15:25] Andrew Huberman: call that one trial learning.[2:15:26] Jeff Cavaliere: There you go. 1 these guys are gonna be masters of one trial learning because, you know, they'll go grab, you know, the the the bars of my the handles of my jammer, yeah, that's there because it's at a lower level to them, and they're swinging around. They're doing Pull ups on it naturally. Uncoached. Nothing from me.[2:15:40] Jeff Cavaliere: 1 will walk out to a deadlift bar, stand over it naturally, never saw me do it, stands over there and just goes, and tries to pull it. So there's a there's a definitely an inclination to liking the gym, and I will fully support that. But, of course, you know, body weight will be good quite a while. Yeah.[2:15:56] Andrew Huberman: So what age do you think is reasonable for kids to start exploring a non body weight,[2:16:01] Jeff Cavaliere: weight shift? Around 13. Team. Mhmm. You know, I think around 13.[2:16:03] Jeff Cavaliere: Once puberty, I think it's okay to start to, you know, because there's so much I would even say for people that are, like, later in age who are just starting out, learn with your own body weight first. There's plenty of resistance to be had by learning how to command your body in space. So if you Have never trained before. You're gonna get very stimulated by doing lunging and reverse lunging, even learning some of the proprioception around movement through space, Pull ups, chin ups. Pull ups and chin ups are challenging for even people that have had 20, 30 years of experience in the gym.[2:16:33] Jeff Cavaliere: So there's a lot of stimulus to be had by body weight, and Jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells is actually doing yourself a disservice. You can learn better command of your body and space So when you go back to the bigger lifts, you're gonna have a easier time sort of progressively loading them and building up that foundation of strength. I'm not saying that you have to Become a master calisthenics athlete before you can touch a barbell. That's not even true. I'm just saying there's so much capacity.[2:17:00] Jeff Cavaliere: Kids are gonna be doing this anyway. And, really, just if you look at general play, They are jumping. They are lunging. They are climbing. They are pulling.[2:17:07] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, that's what they do. You know? So, why? I don't know where the avoidance of, like, structured training is for younger kids. Again, provided they're using body weight and maybe, The, you know, less ballistic movements or something like that, you know, things that are, you know, the or or certainly overloaded movements.[2:17:24] Jeff Cavaliere: I think we should encourage kids to do more. There's a lot of, obesity and and kids on the rise also, and that is incredibly, you know, disconcerting to me. So I think and and I hope it doesn't come from The advice of some that say, well, wait until you're older to start doing something. Like, that's a way worse trade off than than than engaging in something smart now.[2:17:45] Andrew Huberman: We used to get kicked out of the house when we were kids.[2:17:47] Jeff Cavaliere: Totally.[2:17:47] Andrew Huberman: My mom would kick us out.[2:17:48] Jeff Cavaliere: Right.[2:17:49] Andrew Huberman: I hung out. I had a huge pack of boys that lived on my street. You know? We but we get kicked out Side. Like, literally, you're not allowed in the Right.[2:17:56] Andrew Huberman: No television. Right. But there were video games, of course, but we were we were kicked out of the house. We had to go play. Fresco is skateboarding, soccer, and then we'd, you know, we'd find our trouble.[2:18:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But, so, post training nutrition. We're the same age. Years ago, I was sort of neurotic about the idea that I had to ingest a certain amount of carbohydrates and proteins within 2 hours, then it was 90 minutes of of training. I confess, I get if I train hard so I'm talking about the resistance training, not the running, but the resistance training, You know, 60 to 90 minutes later, I'm really hungry.[2:18:29] Jeff Cavaliere: Mhmm.[2:18:30] Andrew Huberman: But there have been days when I just skip and then the hunger passes, and then later, I eat I eat more. I might twice as much later. You know, that that's just the way sometimes schedules go. But, what are your thoughts in terms of the the nutrition science, the train the training related effects of, the post training meal. Is it something that you try to to get?[2:18:49] Andrew Huberman: Is it something that you think people should pay attention to?[2:18:53] Jeff Cavaliere: So that that science has actually probably been the the one that's changed the most in my lifetime, honestly, because I I I again, we're the same age, and I was, Falling for the same, trap, you know, where I would really be focused on like, I'm I'm I'm risking speeding tickets driving home from the gym to make sure I got an anabolic window. You know? Like, I I did all that. I really did. You know?[2:19:16] Jeff Cavaliere: But, Thankfully, that's been sort of debunked in in your body. It isn't just rushing through, you know, these certain periods of time to utilize the nutrients in our body, but are able partition them and use them over a long much greater duration. Up to now, they're saying, you know, 3 to 4 hours after training, 5 hours after training, You can still see the, you know, the benefits of of replenishment. A lot of that is just you know, I think there's a consistency element to it, that just Utilizing a post workout window or a post workout meal even if it's within 2 hours or 1 hour It's just integrating the habit of saying, listen. I just did this activity, and now I wanna replenish some of what I lost the energy that I used to to Perform, you know, the the exercises that I did.[2:20:02] Jeff Cavaliere: And just getting into the routine knowing that the the engine is ultimately fed by what we put in it And the concept of replenishing the fuel lost is still a concept that I think, again, different in mechanism, but still important in terms of fueling the overall performance. So, you know, the the the pre workout period of time gives us a chance to Actually, have a longer window because if that if those nutrients are are obtained pre workout, it's not like they're gone in that hour that you've trained. They're still there and available for your body to use. So, you know, I think it's important to get 1 of the 2, you know, right or at least make sure you're you're consistently having 1 or the 2, or you might risk going through all these periods of, having no nutrition to support your efforts. Only will your workouts potentially suffer in terms of the output, but then you're also not providing your body any ability to capitalize Done on, an opportunity to feed it and refuel and recover.[2:21:02] Jeff Cavaliere: So, I'm not very dogmatic about, what Specifically to to eat pre or post, you know, workout, but I do think you should have protein, surrounding your your training whether that be Ahead of time or after, protein could be a little bit hard to digest for some people. So if you do that pre workout and then you're finding your workout's Slogging because you don't feel good, then suddenly you put that after your meal. But this whole concept of the urgency of time has thankfully been removed, and we can just learn to eat a little bit more, you know, responsibly and drive more responsibly so we're not, know, trying to rush home from the gym and risk, you know, killing people on the way. You know? I I think I think it's, but I think it's great because I think that That was something that it just showcases a a belief that people had for so long that has since been proven to be not that important.[2:21:56] Jeff Cavaliere: And there's a there's a there's a tip of the cap towards research in a good way where it's like, alright. I think we could all agree that this isn't necessarily true anymore. And look at yourself and say, Oh my god. I did that so often. Yeah.[2:22:10] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, I I bit that 1 hook, line, and sinker, but, but then realized, okay. We we could always make a change. And the good thing about nutrition is Those changes can happen the very next time you go to eat, you know, and you'll start to see the benefits of that. So I'm, I'm I'm not a big believer in that Strict approach to pre or post workout. I mean, even as far as pre workout supplements, lot of people don't take them.[2:22:34] Jeff Cavaliere: A lot of people don't like them. They don't take them. They don't like they're not necessarily even being used as the new nutritive side of the pre workout. They're just more new used to fuel the workout.[2:22:45] Andrew Huberman: Stim for me, it's, water and, some form of caffeine.[2:22:49] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. I mean, it's whatever you know? Again, I think it's important. I do think it's important to maintain a high level of output. So if your prework nutrition requires a stimulant in order to help Do that.[2:23:02] Jeff Cavaliere: Or if your prerecorded nutrition is causing you to have a harder time to train because you're feeling fuller Stomachache or something else, then then that that's not achieving what you're trying to do. The ultimate goal is to still be able to perform at the highest level. So whatever your nutrition is required to allow you to still do that, That is probably the most important factor of all of it.[2:23:19] Andrew Huberman: Great. I love the very clear and rational approach. Don't ingest anything right before your workout or near Your workout, that's going to make your workout worse. Oh, I mean, even Yeah. It's so simple, and yet you don't hear this because I think people will think, oh, they must have a pre workout.[2:23:33] Andrew Huberman: They must have a post workout.[2:23:34] Jeff Cavaliere: Again, like, even if there The the benefits that are to be had from whatever is being suggested is gonna be easily offset by the fact that you can't perform at an output capable of driving any Change. Yeah. So that that would pretty much negate the fact that there you know, there's no you're not outweighing those benefits of whatever nutrient nutritive approach you took And it's it's struggling through your workout.[2:23:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. For me, the best pre workout is a good night sleep, hydration, caffeine, music.[2:24:00] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Yeah. There you go. I mean, it's it's a very simple formula. You know?[2:24:03] Andrew Huberman: Works. And then post war, I do I do find I get quite hungry and wanna eat quite a bit more and and[2:24:08] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, that's a natural response. The body is going to and most people wanna do that, and I think it should be fed. I work out, as you know? Again, a lot of my postings on Instagram will happen at 10 o'clock at night, 10:30 at night, 11 night because I am actually training there, and that's where I'm taking those little breaks in between sets to actually film or post something. Mhmm.[2:24:25] Jeff Cavaliere: But, like, I then go inside. I ate dinner. So I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night. You know? It's not necessarily ideal.[2:24:31] Jeff Cavaliere: I'm not recommending that as a tool for anybody. I think it dispels one thing. I've never been a believer in Can eat carbs after 6?[2:24:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. No. That makes no sense to me.[2:24:40] Jeff Cavaliere: Zero sense.[2:24:40] Andrew Huberman: On all the new all all the science of metabolism that I've seen,[2:24:44] Jeff Cavaliere: there's[2:24:44] Andrew Huberman: no I think as long as you can Sort of like napping. I talked to Matt Walker, one of the great sleep researchers, wrote why we sleep, etcetera, you know, and has his own podcast about Sleep, tremendous researcher, public communicator about sleep. And he said, you know, naps are fine provided they don't interrupt your ability to sleep well at night. Right. Simple.[2:25:00] Andrew Huberman: Right. Tell me when sleep from 8 to 9 PM and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem. Other people, they take a 30 minute nap after lunch, and they can't sleep at night.[2:25:07] Jeff Cavaliere: Right.[2:25:08] Andrew Huberman: Same thing with caffeine's a little different because Matt would argue the architecture of sleep can be disrupted, etcetera. But if you can eat dinner late, you eat carbohydrates late, Actually, need carbohydrates at night in order to be able to sleep. Whenever I've done a low carbohydrate type regimen in the evening, I have a hard time falling asleep. I'm just too alert.[2:25:25] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah.[2:25:25] Andrew Huberman: And so so I eat carbohydrates in at in the[2:25:28] Jeff Cavaliere: evening to re restore glycogen, but also in order to make sure that I can fall asleep. I I actually can again, obviously, it's already late at night by the time I'm done eating, but, like, I can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes of finishing My meal, you know, because I I I I do think that they have that same effect on me. But I'm never bike I don't I'm not bothered by the feeling of fullness. I'm not I'm unable to sleep because of a feeling of fullness, but I do like, I I do like the fact that I'm I feel as if I'm At least replenishing what was lost through my hard training, and I do like to back it up with a a dinner. I don't need to eat smaller amounts.[2:26:04] Jeff Cavaliere: Some people can't have that My I will say after a hard leg workout, I don't have the same appetite that I do after, let's say, you know, an upper body workout. It it can really disrupt my my whole Feeling of of of well-being.[2:26:17] Andrew Huberman: You wanna eat less after you train your legs?[2:26:19] Jeff Cavaliere: I do. Yeah.[2:26:20] Andrew Huberman: Oh, wow. I'm the I'm the opposite. No.[2:26:22] Jeff Cavaliere: I no. Because I just feel like I could feel sick to my stomach. Know,[2:26:24] Andrew Huberman: you're you're clearly training harder. I've I've seen the way you train you do train very intensely.[2:26:28] Jeff Cavaliere: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I I think it's important. I mean, I think that, Again, it's that trade off between if you're not gonna train for a long period of time, then you're gonna wanna train harder.[2:26:38] Jeff Cavaliere: And, again, I I actually feel like Contrary to what people might think as you age, you're better off training harder for shorter period of time. You know, it It's always within the the realm of of of safe training. I mean, I think that's what I I like to think this is what I bring to the table, like an approach that's smarter So I can train harder, you know, like, not doing the dumb things I did when I was a kid. And with that, you know, trade off being a harder trainer, I think I get the results that I want because I'm able to really push it and then back off. And and, again, the the the meal feels like a almost a a A physiological reward for the hard effort I put in the gym knowing that I'm I'm also replenishing and and and setting the stage for the next day to be another successful day of training, know?[2:27:25] Jeff Cavaliere: Or maybe not, you know, depending upon how many times a day a week I I train. You know? But, yeah, I I I I think that it's, It's a lot less it's a it's a lot I hate to say, but it's a lot less scientific than we wanna make it. And as it Seems to be coming back oftentimes like the thing that works for you is really the most important thing because, ultimately, getting your ass in there and doing what you do is is really the thing that Provides the best benefit.[2:27:50] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. And it can you know, there are many things that I would say are hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere, but one of one of them is certainly consistency. You you make it happen one way or another.[2:28:00] Jeff Cavaliere: Huge. I mean, consistency really is the the determinant, and I and I know that that is the hardest Part for people that are and why people tend to look for the shortcut because consistency is the part that, you know, that becomes the biggest challenge. But, If you could find listen. If you could find the I I mean, you know, through what I've been trying to encourage here is, like, if you could find the nutrition approach, if you could find the training approach, if you could try find the training split, if you could try All those things that encourage you to wanna go to the gym. Like, you're locked in at the point where you said you actually look forward to going and doing your workout.[2:28:33] Andrew Huberman: I I love it. Right. I look forward to I mean, it's it's, You know, actually, this morning, one of our, one of our teammates for the podcast, I I gotta work out, and halfway through, I just turned to him and I said, never figure out why that feels so good, but it feels so good. I just I really enjoy it, and it lets and I love to eat, and it lets me eat.[2:28:49] Jeff Cavaliere: And I[2:28:49] Andrew Huberman: love the way it makes me go afterward. Yeah. I don't understand this concept of not enjoying the gym. Cardio is a little different. I I always load the 1st 10 or 20 minutes of a jog.[2:28:58] Andrew Huberman: I mildly loathe the middle 3rd, and by the end, I think this is the greatest thing ever. Why don't I do it all the time? And then that feeling evaporates before the next time I do it. Yeah.[2:29:07] Jeff Cavaliere: Unfortunately, I didn't Remember it either? You hit it again. Exactly. Yeah. I I I, I think if people could if if if we had 1 gift we could give to everybody, it would be the love of fitness.[2:29:18] Jeff Cavaliere: Right. If they could be bestowed the love of fitness, it would change the entire world. You know? But I think when you hear things like this that, like, hey. That work, and that will work too, and that this will work too, you know, rather than the dogmatic one way only approach, which could become discouraging for people.[2:29:37] Jeff Cavaliere: Then I think it becomes a little bit uplifting. Like, well, I've never tried that. I've actually never tried a total body split, or I've never tried, you know, that style of eating. Like, It it becomes encouraging that you might wanna explore, and then you might finally get locked in and say, I really like this, and then you're off and running.[2:29:52] Andrew Huberman: Let's, Some of what I so enjoy about your content, I we would be remiss if we didn't, just briefly discuss, Jesse. One of the great pleasures for me in in watching your content and learning from it over the years is that you took on a you decide to mentor somebody[2:30:08] Jeff Cavaliere: Right.[2:30:09] Andrew Huberman: Jesse. And There's a there's some poking fun back and forth between the 2 of you, which is very amusing, but I have to say it inspired me to do something, early on in developing this podcast as I have a A young intern who, has helped me with some of the research, and he's a budding he's interested in science. He's about to go off to college, but he also got really into fitness. So we watched the videos of you guys. He was helping me get the Instagram content out early on.[2:30:32] Andrew Huberman: And one thing that was just it was it's such a pleasure to be able to pass along knowledge, and and, of course, learning from him. Nice. This is always the way it works.[2:30:39] Jeff Cavaliere: We learn from teaching,[2:30:40] Andrew Huberman: and we learn from students. But it's been great to see Jesse's progress. It's amazing. I've gotten to meet him in person, just now, and and, he's he has grown. He's changed physically, and and I think that you mentioned a love of fitness.[2:30:53] Andrew Huberman: I think that In a one of the best ways to be consistent is to take on the responsibility of teaching others once one has proficiency in something. So, maybe you just tell us a little bit about how that's going. How how is Jesse doing, and, where where where does he need a little more work? Where is he thriving? I'm impressed by the progress.[2:31:12] Jeff Cavaliere: Well, we have a I mean, physically, we can obviously see the the the changes. You know, the list of things to work on are is is immense. It's so long for him to continue to improve. But, No. Actually, you know, in reality, Jesse the story of Jesse was that I I knew Jesse prior to starting even AthleanX.[2:31:28] Jeff Cavaliere: And a matter of fact, I think the funny thing is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel was a video that he shot as, I don't know, a 13 year old or something. I said, could you just film this for a second? I was over there, you know, training, members of the family. So, he then off went off to college, went into film, Realize he had much, greener pastures at AthleanX instead of, becoming the next Scorsese or something, and he decided to come, work with me. And, You know, the expectations in the beginning were just to edit videos or just to, you know, help with various aspects of of, like, my day to day that I don't think I was, know, equipped to really handle and grow the business anymore.[2:32:09] Jeff Cavaliere: So, then, you know, look at by by virtue of being in that environment, there's an interest. I think If I worked in a gym, I might become interested in working out. And though that mine is not a commercial gym, it's sitting right behind my office, you know, window. There became an interest in wanting to work out a little bit, and it wasn't even an intentional experiment, You know, to put Jesse there, I just thought thought that he's a very likable person. He has a very funny personality.[2:32:38] Jeff Cavaliere: He's also the everyman. You know? In some ways, you know, as I'm sure maybe you experience sometimes, like, I'm the guy that this is comes naturally for me is what people will say. This is what you do for a living. Like, this is what you like, there's there's an element of disconnect in terms of the relatability because I do do this for a living.[2:32:56] Jeff Cavaliere: I can't deny that. I do Work with professional athletes so, like, there's a level of interest in this above and beyond. But for him, he's just the kid who wants to train maybe if he Rolls out of bed before 11 AM, and, you know, doesn't have a date on Friday night. But that's the guy everybody can relate to. And watching him transform, and I love the fact that even the interest level, you know, was up and down.[2:33:20] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, it wasn't consistent for him because He was like, you know, part interested, and then maybe not interested for 3 months, and then interested in that. And I never pushed it on him. As this is again, this was no orchestrated experiment for me. Was just like, if you wanna do this, then do this. And also from a standpoint of, like, lending my help or expertise to him, Like I said with my son, I'm not gonna force it on anybody.[2:33:42] Jeff Cavaliere: I don't wanna do that to anybody. I don't think that that's ever gonna spark that desire for long term, you know, adoption. So He got more interested. He started to learn more about it. He watches the videos that we're filming.[2:33:53] Jeff Cavaliere: He films the videos that we're filming, and he's learning through what I'm saying. He's becoming more of a student of The field. And I I have to say his knowledge in the field has grown with the the growth of his physique, And he's put into practice some of the things that I say. He's put in practice some things he hears other places, and he winds up, you know, improving as he goes. And he winds up starting to love This, like, he, you know, never thought he would.[2:34:19] Jeff Cavaliere: But it's great to see anybody grow. And whether that be physically or that be emotionally or whether that be, you know, just in in their career, it's great to see somebody grow. And I I like to tease him. Funny, admission here. There are times when the jabs that I will throw at him are something that we might know ahead of time of what I'm going to say to him, people will say, you're so mean to him.[2:34:45] Jeff Cavaliere: I can't believe it. You're you know, that's so abusive. Yeah. I'm like, dude, honestly, we laugh after it's over. It's good.[2:34:51] Jeff Cavaliere: We're good. You know? So, you know, of course but, like, but[2:34:54] Andrew Huberman: He's tougher than he looks is what you're saying.[2:34:56] Jeff Cavaliere: He's tougher than he bull And he looks bald enough now.[2:34:58] Andrew Huberman: He's got the big beard.[2:34:59] Jeff Cavaliere: He's a He looks more manly than I do. I can't grow a beard. I I don't yeah. I mean, believe me, he's, he's totally alpha, and I'm, like, you know, quickly becoming, You know, the 2nd the 2nd star of this show, but, like, you know, he's definitely, contributed, and people enjoy his presence for sure.[2:35:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I certainly do. And I think that, you as you pointed out, he's a kind of a proxy and a template for for everybody. We can relate to him because, even though I've trained for many years, you know, it's it's been a struggle, you know, through graduate school, postdoc. You know, it made it happen one way or another, but with more or less attention and admittedly through, know, waxing waning levels of of motivation, although, you know, I'm fortunate that I do enjoy it.[2:35:39] Jeff Cavaliere: What I think is nice about it too is that it's it it's a realistic Expectation that we set, I think. You know, there was you're you're showcasing what the journey actually looks like, and he's been on the journey for, again, You devotedly for, let's say, the last year and a half, but on the journey for 5 years, if I could make the gains that he did Starting when I straight started training at, you know, 14, 15, and you're saying, hey. By 20, you're gonna have the strength levels he does, The physique that he does, the knowledge that you've gained, like, that seems like a blink of an eye now looking back. You know? At 46 years old, I'm like, Holy cow.[2:36:17] Jeff Cavaliere: Like, I I I think it took me 20 years, you know, 15, 20 years. So, you know, to just even start to get into a groove. For him to do it at in in a period of 5 years, it doesn't seem long, whereas there's people that will criticize his journey. Like, oh, it's just been taking So long, it's so there's such an instant gratification, you know, that people seek. Luckily, that's the minority.[2:36:38] Jeff Cavaliere: Most people are like, this is amazing. You know? But I think that it becomes very uplifting because not only is it relatable, but the journey is real and people can, and people can appreciate that. Like, this is what happen if you actually put in consistent hard work and you'll watch him transform, go back and watch the videos like you look at. We like to oftentimes throw back to videos where he appeared as, You know, smaller Jesse, but also shy Jesse.[2:37:01] Jeff Cavaliere: Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact with the camera, You know, to where now he's got his own skits and intros. You know? It's like it's it's it's funny because the confidence with the with the growth of physique came confidence too, which is great.[2:37:14] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. It's, Pretty soon, it'll be his world, and we're all living in it as they say. Well, on behalf of myself And all the listeners, I really wanna thank you, first of all, for the discussion today.

We talked about nutrition. We talked about heat, cold, training regimens. And what I love about all of this, Nelan, that you've given us is that there's a there's a backbone of logic, You know? And and some consistent themes indeed about consistency.[2:37:51] Andrew Huberman: And but the the the logical backbone, I think, is what, We'll enable people to really show up to the table and stay there, for training consistently over time. And as you said, the gift of fitness is an immense gift. I can't thank you enough. I I know you're an incredibly busy human being with kids and dogs and a and a marriage and a It's my pleasure.
