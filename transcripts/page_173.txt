I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is doctor Lisa Feldman Barrett. Doctor Lisa Feldman Barrett is a distinguished professor of psychology at Northeastern University. She also holds appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, where she is the chief scientific officer of the Center of Law, Brain, and Behavior.[0:00:32] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Barrett is considered one of the top world experts in the study of emotions, and her laboratory has studied emotions using approaches both from the fields of Ecology and neuroscience. Indeed, today, you will learn about the neural circuits and the psychological underpinnings of what we call emotions. You will learn what emotions truly are and how to interpret different emotional states. You'll also learn how emotions relate to things like motivation, Consciousness and affect. Affect is a term that refers to a more general state of brain and body that increases or decreases the probability that you will experience certain emotions.[0:01:08] Andrew Huberman: During today's discussion, doctor Feldman Barrett also teaches us how to regulate our emotions effectively, as well as how to better interpret the emotional states of others. You will also learn about the powerful relationship that exists between our emotional states and the movement of our body. In fact, much of today's discussion is both practical and will be highly informative in terms of the mechanisms underlying emotions, and It is likely to also be surprising to you in a number of ways. It certainly was surprising to me. I've been a close follower of doctor Feldman Barrett's work over many years now and have always found it to be tremendously informative.[0:01:44] Andrew Huberman: And when I say her work, I mean both her academic published papers as well as her public lectures that she's and her 2 fabulous books on emotions in the brain. The first one entitled, How Emotions Are Made, and the 2nd book, which includes information about emotions but extends beyond that entitled Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain. As you'll see from today's discussion, doctor Feldman Barrett is Not only extremely informed about the neuroscience and psychology of emotion, she's also fabulously good at teaching us that information in clear terms and in actionable ways. You'll also notice several times she pushes back on my questions. In some cases, even telling me that my questions are ill posed.[0:02:23] Andrew Huberman: And I have to tell you I was absolutely delighted that she did that because you'll see that every time she did that, it was with the clear purpose of putting more specificity on the question and thereby, more specificity and clarity on the answer, which, of course, she delivers. By the end of today's discussion, you will have both a broad and a deep understanding of what emotions are and their origins in our brain and body. You will also have many practical tools with which to better understand and navigate emotional states. And moreover, you'll have many practical tools in order to increase your levels of motivation and better understand your various states of consciousness. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:03:06] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.[0:03:31] Andrew Huberman: One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature has to drop by 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed, your body temperature actually has to increase by 1 to 3 degrees. With 8 Sleep, it's very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. It's a mattress cover that allows you to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle, and end of your night, and in doing so, allow you to fall and Stay deeply asleep throughout the night and wake up feeling extremely refreshed.[0:04:03] Andrew Huberman: I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover well over 2 years ago, and it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep. You'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman to save up to $150 off their Pod three cover. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.[0:04:28] Andrew Huberman: Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feedback using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes refer its blood sugar levels. To maintain energy and focus throughout the day, you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or dips. Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods and different food combinations, as well as food timing and things like exercise combined to impact your blood glucose levels. I started using Levels a little over a year ago, and it gave me a lot of insight into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards, as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my overall energy.[0:05:15] Andrew Huberman: And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize how I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, and so on such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day. If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Right now, Levels is offering an additional 2 free months of membership. Again, that's levels.link/huberman to get 2 free months of membership. And now for my discussion with doctor Lisa Feldman Barrett.[0:05:46] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Lisa Feldman Barrett, welcome.[0:05:49] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Oh, it's my pleasure to be here.[0:05:51] Andrew Huberman: I've wanted to talk to you for a very long time. I'd like to talk about emotions. I think Everyone has a sense somehow of what an emotion is. Feeling happy, feeling sad, feeling Excited, feeling, curious, perhaps as even emotion. I don't know.[0:06:13] Andrew Huberman: You'll tell us. What are the core components? Are those sort of macronutrients of a of an emotion? Because I know there's a debate about whether or not We should be talking about emotions versus states, but what is an emotion? We all are familiar with what one feels like to us, but from a scientific perspective, how do you define an emotion?[0:06:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, sign this is a scientist debate about this. Nobody in the last 150 years has ever been able to agree on what an emotion is. And I think from my perspective, the interesting but tricky bit is that anytime you wanna talk about what the basic building blocks are of emotion, None of those basic building blocks are specific to emotion. So, for example, there are a group of scientists who will tell you well an emotion is a Coordinated response where you have a change in, some physical state, A change in the brain, a change in the physical state, which, leads you to make a particular facial expression. So you've got physiological changes in the body, changes in the brain, changes in the face or in motor movements.[0:07:29] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: K. But that describes basically every moment of your life. Your face is always moving in some way. If it wasn't, You would look like an avatar, basically. So we're we're constantly engaged in in movements, and those movements have to be coordinated with the physiological changes in the body because whether we're whether we're in a state that we would conventionally call emotion or not because The physiology is supporting those it's supporting the, you know, the glucose and the oxygen and all the things that you need to make, movements of your body.[0:08:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And, of course, all these movements are being coordinated by your brain. So, of course, there's a coordinated set of, features, that doesn't really describe how emotions are distinct from any other experience that you have. But the The claim was for a really long time that there would be diagnostic patterns. Okay. So when something triggered fear, you would have an increase in heart rate, and you would have, a propensity to Run away or to freeze or, not just to fall asleep, although that is something animals do when they are faced with a predator.[0:08:44] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But That's not part of the Western stereotype for fear, so that wasn't what scientists were looking for. And, and also that you would make a a particular facial expression, which was presumed to be the universal expression of fear where you widen your eyes when you gasp like, that Facial set of facial movements in other cultures, like in Melanesian culture, for example, is, is a symbol of Threat, where you are threatening someone. You are threatening them with aggression, basically, is a war face. But in Western cultures, that's the The face that Western scientists believed was the, you know, the the distinctive, part of that distinctive pattern for fear. And so The way that scientists defined emotion for a long time was these kind of, states where you'd see this Diagnostic ensemble of signals, and that would mean that anytime someone showed one of those Signals, they may move their face in a particular way or their heart increased at a particular time.[0:09:51] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You'd be able to diagnose them as being in a state of fear as opposed to a state of anger or sadness or whatever. The empirical evidence just doesn't bear that out, and so it was kind of a mystery. The mystery is, how is it that you feel angry or sad or happy or, You know, full of gratitude or awe. How is it that you experience these moments, But scientists can't find a single set of physical markers That correspond with each state distinctively, right, that in in a way that you could tell them apart. That's a that was a really big puzzle for a really long time.[0:10:42] Andrew Huberman: I have to ask you about this, Perhaps myth, perhaps truth about facial expressions and emotions. Because as you were Explaining the core components of emotions, I had to think back to the classic textbook images of the different faces associated with fear, with delight, with confusion, and on and on. We we will get to that and your opinions on that, Scientifically informed opinions, of course, but there is a bit of a myth that The emotion system and the facial expression system run-in both directions. For instance, people will say, If you smile, it's harder to feel sad or anxious. I can't say that's been my experience, but I very well could be wrong.[0:11:37] Andrew Huberman: So we know that when people's emotional states change, their facial expressions often will change. Right? If you see someone crying on the street, versus somebody smiling really big, we you we can make some assumptions about what might be going on, internally for them. But put simply, is it true that changing one's facial expression can direct shifts in the brain and body, perhaps, that change our emotional state.[0:12:06] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: If you'll permit me, what I would say is that your question is ill posed. So first of all, it presumes that there's an emotion system and that there's a facial expression system. Now clearly, there's a system for moving facial muscles. Mhmm. Okay?[0:12:26] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But a movement is not the same as an expression.[0:12:30] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:12:30] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: A movement is a movement. An expression is an interpretation of of the meaning of a movement. Not all movements of the face are expressions. And this is, you know, a problem. It's a problem in science.[0:12:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: In it's often the case, I think in my experience in the science of emotion, but elsewhere too, that scientists in their efforts to make their work, meaningful to people will try to interpret their findings in in ways that, the average person would, find interesting or, the way that a physician would find interesting or a teacher or what have you to be able to use this information. But then they forget that they're actually making an interpretation, and they start to refer to their observations with The labels of interpretation. So facial movements are facial movements. People move their faces and that those movements have meaning, but they're not always to express an internal state. In fact, one might think that they're very rarely to, express an internal state.[0:13:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So I don't know that there's a facial expression system either. So that's there's certainly like I said, there are there are circuitry for moving a face, But, but what those movements mean is highly variable. And so That would be my 2nd point that where I would say, when you see someone crying on the street, you are not looking only at their face. You might be aware, that you're focusing on their face. That might be the part of the entire sensory ensemble that you are focusing your attention on.[0:14:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But your brain is taking in an entire ensemble of signals. As you know, it's taking in not just the, You know, movements of the face, the tears, or whatever, it's taking in all of the the entire sensory array, the sounds, the smells, What's going on inside your own body? Your brain is being, bombarded with signals from from all of those sources. And when it's Making a meaning out of any signal, it's doing it in an ensemble of signals. So research shows that babies' cries aren't acoustically specific to when they're tired or hungry or right?[0:14:58] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: The you can I can show you a video without context and show you someone crying, and, you might make a judgment? You might think make the stereotypical judgment in the West. Oh, that person is sad, And then we pan out and, really, you know, it's a little girl whose dad just came home from Iraq or something. Right? So brains are always Interpreting faces in context.[0:15:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: They're making guesses. This is something that I've talked about quite a bit that we don't read movements in people. We don't read Emotions in facial expressions. We make inferences about the emotional meaning of facial movements, And we do it in an ensemble of other signals, the the context, as you, if you will. And that's really what's what's happening.[0:15:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So, Do I think that, that there is feedback from the face to the brain? Sure. I mean, there's feedback from every muscle, but there's this constant conversation between The brain and the body. The brain is sending motor commands. The body is is you know, has sensory surfaces which are sending signals back to the brain.[0:16:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So If the face is influencing the brain, it's doing so in a way that's not special. It it's Doing it in a way that that works for all other parts of your body too. And I guess What I would say this is kind of a long winded answer, but over time, your brain has learned that certain patterns of signal over time recur. And so If you're smiling, if your brain is, you know, telling your your facial muscles to move in a particular way that looks like smiling, it's happening in a larger ensemble of signals, and then the brain is predicting what's gonna happen next because it's learned over time what happens next. So probabilistically so, if you think about that as cause, then sure.[0:17:08] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But it's not as it's not this simplistic kind of idea that an emotion is triggered. It causes facial muscles to move in a particular way. And therefore, if you just Pose your face in in those in that particular arrangement, it that will somehow feedback to the emotion system and change that system. Because There are no there is no emotion system in your brain, and the the causation just isn't that. It's not that simplistically mechanistic.[0:17:44] Andrew Huberman: That makes sense to me. I and, frankly, never bought the idea that just Smiling would make me feel happy, especially if my internal state was not one of happiness, like fighting the internal state. Also, In the early 2000, I think it was, there was a lot of discussion about how positioning the body in certain ways, you know, taking up more space would allow people to Feel more powerful, and they some of these studies, and, argued that there were even hormonal shifts associated with, taking up more space that were associated with feelings of empowerment, and then when shrinking of oneself was in associated with elevated cortisol states. And as I say all this, I I want to be clear that, I do not take a simplistic view of the nervous system or endocrine system, and I I didn't, I don't think that you were implying that either. Just wanna make sure that anyone listening or watching isn't thinking that, for instance, that cortisol is bad.[0:18:41] Andrew Huberman: Cortisol is wonderful and essential. You just need it regulated properly. Or that, The idea that the body and emotional states are are inextricably linked makes a ton of sense to me, but the idea that you could just, You know, grab on to one of the nodes in the now I have to be careful not to say motion system, like Position of the body, like, being hunched over makes you depressed? No. That never made sense to me.[0:19:07] Andrew Huberman: Taking up more space makes you feel more, powerful? That doesn't It it can't be that way, and yet we were told for about a decade through especially through popular press that this stuff was true. And so what I love about your work is that it includes a neuroanatomical, a psychological, A network perspective that that that there isn't 1 seat of emotions and and so on. So if we could go a little bit further Into the facial expression piece for a moment.[0:19:37] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Sure.[0:19:38] Andrew Huberman: I was taught in my psychology and neuroscience textbooks, because it was right there in front of me, That there were some core categories of facial expression that were universal across cultures that conveyed Something about the internal state of the person that the downward, you know, lips in the corner and and some and maybe even a furrowing of the brow was associated with Negative valence states like sadness, perhaps even depression, that the opposite of upward turn corners of the mouth and widening of the eyes Was delight and excitement. Some of that feels pretty true to my experience, but how do you and Other serious scientists of emotions view that somewhat classic literature now.[0:20:24] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah. So I'll just say that my, my journey here, my scientific journey, was not one of, attempting to Overturn, a century's worth of are we allowed to swear? Bullshit, basically. I mean, it's just it's like it's It's it's basically Western stereotypes enshrined as scientific, fact. And that sounds, like a pretty harsh thing to say, but I think I pretty much stand by that at this point.[0:20:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But for me, When I was a graduate student when I was an undergraduate in, in psychology and in physiology and in anthropology, you know, I also had read that Darwin said that there were these distinctive facial expressions that, were coordinated with specific emotional states specific states of the nervous system. This was Darwin's view, And I assumed it was correct, until I started to try to use that information, in the lab, and everything fell apart. You know? So when you show someone in, a laboratory, like a student or, somebody from the community, a face, a disembodied face Where there are the person's eyes are widened in the face and they're gasping like a stereotypic fear expression, Most of the time, they don't know what it is. And so I would try to use these faces and, as stimuli and experiments, and they weren't they weren't working the way that they were supposed to work.[0:22:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And there We're really going all the way back to the beginning of psychology. There were always debates about whether or not this was actually accurate. And there's a really interesting story about How Darwin came to this idea, which I can tell you about, but it it's not because he cared about emotion. And he was basically Taking his own very Western views about emotion to make some claims about Evolution, actually. So, I have more to say about that and about Why it's a problem to take anything that anybody said, even Darwin, from, you know, a 150 or so years ago or whatever it is, And treat it like it's a modern text.[0:22:57] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, he was writing at a particular time for a particular purpose, and that doesn't necessarily mean that whatever he wrote is True. But I'll just tell you what the evidence says. That there has been, in psychology, a debate, really vicious debate, actually, for probably 50 years About the nature of facial expressions and whether they're universal and whether there's this one to 1 correspondence between a particular face and, like, a facial configuration in a particular emotional state, smiling in happiness, scowling in anger, wrinkling your nose in disgust. And so in 2016, I think, the Association For Psychological Science Tasked me and some other senior scientists, with attempting to write a white paper, a consensus paper on what the literature actually shows. So what does the research actually show?[0:23:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You read all the research. You know, can you find a pattern there? Does it actually reveal anything about whether or not facial expressions are universal, particularly for emotion? And the way they do this, they have a journal for this purpose, for taking a widely held belief that is highly debated and bringing together a panel of experts who disagree with each other at the outset, and they have to work together to see if they can come to consensus over the data. And This is something that, you know, people have tried in the past, and it I mean, they're really vicious.[0:24:37] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: People have been vicious with each other Over this question. So when we brought together a a group of people so several People refuse to serve. Senior scientists refuse to serve on this panel. But[0:24:51] Andrew Huberman: Out of fear of of losing their funding or something.[0:24:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, that's a whole other conversation about why sign a certain scientist would not want to engage With, with, people who disagree with them, that's an interesting conversation to have, but, I don't think it's Simple, actually, as just they they're careerist or they they care about, you know, their money or or funding or whatever. That would be an easy answer, but I don't actually think that's going on, but that's another sort of but, anyway so, there were 5 of us who got together, all senior scientists, All from different fields. Some of us hadn't met each other before. We all knew of each other, of course, and we met over Zoom For two and a half years, this is pre COVID, because people were all over the world. Right?[0:25:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And we we read over a 1000 papers. So so I was the only one in this group of the 5 of us who my starting hypothesis was that Facial movements are meaningful, but they're not there's no one to 1 correspondence between a particular Facial configuration like a scowl and anger. Not not just that it would vary across cultures, but that it varies For you across situations, I mean, do you scowl every time you're angry? I don't scowl every time I'm angry. In fact, And I also scowl at times when I'm not angry.[0:26:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So and there are scientific reasons to think that that The that a the collection of facial expressions that people make when they're angry or when they're sad or whatever would be highly variable. So that was my starting position, and then the there were varying the 4 guys, so there was I just refer them as the guys because it was me and 4 guys. And the guys, they all, to some extent, thought that facial expressions were universal, but they had differing reasons and, for for for hypothesizing that, and they also had different commitments degrees of commitment to that per position. But we, right off the bat, sort of agreed that we it didn't matter who was right. That was just not relevant.[0:27:09] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: The only thing that mattered was that we could come to the consensus over the data. And if we couldn't, we had to really Pinpoint why. Like so what would be the critical experiments that would have to be done in order for us to come to consensus over the data? And we also agreed That, we had all kinds of contingency set up. So, you know, you've got 5 senior people who are all running big labs, And they're investing, you know, upwards of 3 years working on a paper.[0:27:40] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So if we can't come to consensus, what are we gonna do? Are we gonna write 1 paper and sort of write about the process, or are we gonna write separate papers? Or you know? But we we had all these contingencies laid out, but the Key here, I think, is that we agreed that we were not gonna be adversarial about it because it didn't matter who was right. And in fact, if somebody had to admit they were wrong and someone was gonna have admit they were wrong.[0:28:04] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I mean, it turns out all of us were wrong about something, but it we were gonna be, like, supportive of each other and and really encourage each other. Because, you know, being wrong is no one likes to be wrong, but for scientists To admit they're wrong is hard, and it's something that we should encourage each other to do, I think, more and and more publicly. And I think the people who do that are really brave. And so that was my position, and they all agreed. And the long story short here is that Two and a half years, a 1000 papers later, we all very reasonably came to consensus that there was no evidence for facial expressions of emotion being universal.[0:28:46] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And that instead, what is what there's clear evidence of is, that Facial expressions, the way that people move their faces in in in moments of expression is highly variable. Meaning, sometimes in anger, you scowl meta analyses, so statistical summaries of many, many, many studies, even in the West, show that people scowl, about 35% of the time when they're angry, which is more than chance. So it gets you a good publication in, you know, the proceedings of the National Academy. But that means 65% of the time, People are moving their faces in other meaningful ways. That's not scowling.[0:29:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So if you actually used a scowl, or even, you know, a scowl in blood pressure or, you know, just maybe not one signal, but still a couple signals. But you would be wrong More than half the time. You would miss more than half the cases. And even more importantly, I think That that's the reliability question. So there's lower reliability for, the correspondence between a scowl and anger.[0:30:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's above chance. So scowling is one expression of anger, but it's certainly not the dominant one. And there is no dominant one. It's just Highly variable depending on the situation that you're in. So sometimes when I'm angry, I sit quietly and plot the demise of my enemy.[0:30:18] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know? Sometimes I smile in anger. Sometimes I cry in anger. It really depends on the situation. But more importantly, half of the scowls that people make are not related to anger.[0:30:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: That means That the specificity is, again, higher than chance, but not that much higher than chance. So if you see someone scowling, the chances are that they might not be angry. They might be concentrating really hard, or They might have gas. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why people make a scowl. And we we found this for Every emotion category that had ever been studied, and I want you to notice what I just did there.[0:31:05] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I'm not I'm no longer referring to an emotion as if it's an entity or a thing. So anger isn't one thing. It's a category of things, a grouping of things.[0:31:15] Andrew Huberman: And if I'm not mistaken, it includes verbs. Right? That like, anger as a Set of verb actions in the in the brain and body. Yes. It is.[0:31:23] Andrew Huberman: It's a process. It's a process.[0:31:25] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Exactly. It's not a noun. It's a verb, And it's a and it's a process, but the point is that, it's it's a highly variable grouping of instances. If you're If you are talking about all instances of anger, all instances of anger that you have ever experienced or witnessed, is a highly variable grouping of instances that vary. Not they that doesn't mean they're random, but What the body does in anger depends on what the physical movements will be in anger, and that depends on the situation that you're in and what your goal is.[0:32:02] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And, and there are ways to talk about that in neuroscience terms, which are a little more precise, but the important thing to understand Down here, I think, is that we're only talking about Western cultures now. The minute that you go outside of the West To or even to the east, I mean so, you know, there are other cultures, you know, that have been studied, like, China and cultures in China, in Japan, in Korea, they all they all have access to knowledge about Western cultural practices and norms. So what happens when you go to, you know, to remote cultures, which, have much less access. So they it's not like they have no access because we we live in a globalized world. So even hunter gatherers in Tanzania, the Hadza, have access to Western practices and norms, but much less much less.[0:32:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And we did do that, and, and All bets are off there. I mean, most of the time, they don't even they don't even understand or experience Facial movements is having anything to do with emotion.[0:33:09] Andrew Huberman: So if they saw an emoji of a smiley face, would they just assume it was a Couple they might think it's a face. They're because as we both know, there's some fairly hardwired brain circuitry for the the Two eyes that and a and a line beneath it and something in the middle that's pseudo nose. That organization of of just spatial features It queues up face for both Well, that for most primates, including those.[0:33:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Interesting that you say that because, yes, of course, that's true, but it's not there at birth. What's there at birth is a preference for that configuration. Right? So it's it's like there's some and we could talk about why that's there. It's actually very controversial.[0:33:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But, but what babies what newborns orient to, they orient to that or they orient to that configuration, but it doesn't have to be a face. And then very quickly, they start learning faces because they're exposed to fate. They're I mean, really, the 1st 3 months of life is almost like a massive Continuous tutorial on what faces are because they're, you know, being fed. And[0:34:09] Andrew Huberman: When everyone's in your face, So Literally. Baby last night, and you see the baby, friends of and have a, you know, unbelievably cute baby with the big cheeks, and you want and there's this desire to See the baby smile. Right? So you do the things that and if the baby shows some sort of facial expression that makes it seem like it's a little bit, Like, resisting what you do. You you stop doing it.[0:34:28] Andrew Huberman: You change up your strategy. And then when baby cracks a smile, like, now I'm going to assume that the baby may or may not have been happy inside, Died, that little baby head. But when they do, there's a reciprocity, then we smile. Exactly. Exactly.[0:34:43] Andrew Huberman: There's a template That that's very robust.[0:34:46] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right. But I want you to notice though that so first of all, I'm not saying that, that recognizing faces, A face as a face is not hardwired. It is, but it's hardwired by not by genes alone. Right? And in fact, there's a really wonderful book called Not by Jeans Alone.[0:35:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Basically, there's cultural inheritance. We have the kind of nature that requires a nurture. We have the kind of genes that require Early learning. We have we need wiring instructions from the world to get the rest of the information that we need to be competent culturally competent in our in our in our lives, And that starts at birth. It probably starts before birth even.[0:35:26] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But, in the 3rd trimester, there's some evidence of learning fetal learning even in the 3rd trimester. So the point is not that People aren't hardwired for viewing faces or recognizing faces. It's just where does that hardwiring come from? It's not by genes alone. Genes aren't the blueprint.[0:35:44] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: The brain is expecting certain inputs from the world, and it needs that because infant brains are wiring themselves to their world. And part of that world is people making faces at them and smiling. And those people happen to also be the ones who are maintain who are maintaining that baby's nervous system. I mean, there is reward learning, right, or reinforcement learning right off the bat Because these are the people who keep you comfortable. They are the ones who feed you.[0:36:09] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: They're the ones who help you get to sleep and so on and so forth. And so you're gonna be very, very sensitive to changes in the contingencies of their behavior. Your brain, as a pattern learner, is just gonna learn those patterns. If we know that smiling more you know, smiling is a cue for happiness, it's because we've learned it. And that doesn't mean that that learning isn't hardwired.[0:36:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It just means that it that information got into your brain by cultural inheritance, Which is a part of evolutionary theory in the extended evolutionary synthesis, not in the original, you know, Not in the original, formulation that some people still kinda stick to.[0:36:53] Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one.[0:37:24] Andrew Huberman: I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better, and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer, a g one. If you'd like to try a g one, go to drink a g one dot com /huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2.[0:37:46] Andrew Huberman: Again, That's drinkagone.com/huberman. So it's far more nuanced, than it was presented to me in in those textbooks, and and it sounds like it was outright wrong on many dimensions.[0:37:58] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, can I just mention one thing, though? Please. This is really serious stuff. Like, Sometimes people think, well, you know, what's the big deal? This is such a big deal.[0:38:08] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I'll tell you why it's a big deal. Because in our culture, People believe that they can read mental states of other people by their face, and they believe it so much that it's enshrined in the legal system. And there are people who lose their lives because juries believe that they can read remorse or or the lack of it. And in fact, there was just a case, you know, last year, I believe, where, you know, the Innocence Project, got involved because there was a woman who was on death row, and what put her on death row was, a police officer's claim that he could read Her emotions by her the comportment of her face and her body. And And, you know, it was possible to get a stay of execution so that she could be retried and you know?[0:39:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So I'm not saying she was guilty or not guilty. I'm just saying what put her on death row was Evidence that would not be admissible in a scientific, way now. And there are there are lots of cases where judgments are made that end up impacting people's lives in pretty serious ways. So This is a really serious thing, and it's, it's puzzling to me why it's So it's got such traction, this idea that there are these universal, expressions that we can use to read each other. You know?[0:39:56] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's it's just not true. I mean, the science just it's so overwhelmingly I feel like, You know, scientists I don't like to use the t word, you know, the f word, fact. You know, it's a scary word, t word, truth. But I think in this case, I feel like I can I can really at least with a little t, I can I can use it? You probably Have particular facial movements that you make on a regular basis that are tells for you.[0:40:23] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I know I do. You know, my husband can Look at my actions, and he can make really decent guesses about what's going on for me upstairs. Right? But that's because he's known me for 30 years. Actually, 30 years today, I should[0:40:35] Andrew Huberman: just say that. Delusions.[0:40:36] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Maddie showed it 30 years ago today. But he's you know, brains are patterned learners. So I'm not saying that Everything is random and, like, there's no it's all noise. I'm saying that there just aren't these, you know, universal templates. They just it's not like that, and we really have to stop assuming that that that there are.[0:40:56] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm so glad that you're getting that message out there, and I'm very thankful that you highlighted the seriousness of This, these myths that have propagated. And that's a perfect segue into what I was already going to ask, which is, it's based on something that I think is in very much agreement with what you're saying. Previous guest on this podcast, I think it was our 1st guest episode, Doctor Carl Deisseroth, colleague of mine at Stanford, incredible bioengineer, really, you know, point Oh, 1% in his, you know, category of science as well as a practicing psychiatrist said something which really stuck with me Over the years, which I once heard him say, you know, we don't really know how other people feel at all. In fact, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel. And that prompted the question for me about how good or poor are we at gauging our own emotional states and in particular at labeling them both to others and for ourselves.[0:41:59] Andrew Huberman: And and so here's the the direct question. Is language sufficient to capture this incredibly complex thing that we're calling emotions? So for instance, the other day, I was in New York with my sister, then she left. I went out for a bit. I was having a pretty good day, and then I returned to the place where I was staying, and I was hit with this feeling of intense loneliness.[0:42:21] Andrew Huberman: And I don't know why. And then I had a bunch of ideas about how that related to growing up and and if I was gonna see friends the next day, and I'm an adult and so I could use some Top down regulation and say, oh, you know, maybe I'm a little tired or I didn't because I hadn't slept as well the night before. I've been pretty rested recently, and then I actually wrote in my journal. I said, you know, maybe most of feeling good is being pretty well rested and not in any physical pain. That's a big part of feeling good is the absence of fatigue and the absence of physical pain.[0:42:52] Andrew Huberman: And and then I thought, wow, that's just so Basic. There's, like, 2 building blocks. It's clearly insufficient, but then I couldn't think of a word to adequately describe The emotion that came about an hour later when I was feeling a little bit better, but not completely better. So was I lonely? Not really.[0:43:09] Andrew Huberman: Not anymore. Was I sad? Not really. But, you know, as I head headed out into the city, I was thinking, I don't really have a word for how I feel. I'm sort of okay, not great, not Low.[0:43:19] Andrew Huberman: You know? And so I think that we have emotional labels. I certainly do for peaks, you know, these peak emotional states. Super happy. I loved the time with my Sister, we do this every year.[0:43:28] Andrew Huberman: This was a particularly good year for us, to do this, and and it went really well. We're texting back and forth how great it was. I certainly know what it feels like to be really down in the in the pits. I've got language for that, but then there's this huge range in between. And so I guess the simple question is, Should we even trust language as a way to understand how we're feeling, or are there additional, if not better signals that we should Perhaps learn to elaborate, our understanding of emotions with.[0:44:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So I'm gonna give you an A simple answer, and then I'm gonna give you a more complicated answer.[0:44:07] Andrew Huberman: Great.[0:44:07] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So the simple answer is no. Language is not sufficient. Period. I think the way that you have well, I should say one language is not sufficient. So English is not sufficient, and probably French on its own is not sufficient, and probably Swahili on its own is not sufficient.[0:44:26] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Although it's very interesting that the the states that we mark with words in each Culture, some of them overlap, but a lot of them don't. And it's very, very useful to have labels of emotion concepts from other cultures that that capture configurations, or a state That we we don't really mark we don't mark those and and sort of distinctively pull them out as as different from other states.[0:44:57] Andrew Huberman: I'd love to know what some of those are.[0:44:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Oh, they're they're, I should have brought them with me. I mean, there there are some, like there's 1 there's a German word, which I can't remember the name of the word, but it's like, the experience of someone having a face that deserves a punch.[0:45:13] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure someone will tell us in the comments. Someone someone who knows German or spend time there, please put that word in in the comments, but don't don't punch anybody.[0:45:21] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: One that's My favorite is, ligut, which is, it's a Polynesian, headhunting emotion word, and it means, exuberant aggression in a group, Like soccer or or headhunting, right, where you're basically, or I should say also, In the military so when I was listening to NPR one day a couple of years ago, must have been more than that because it's in my book, so it was probably more than 7 years ago, I was listening to these guys talk, these former military personnel talk about being deployed in a war where they're with their buddies, and they're they're basically hunting the enemy. And they feel exuberant, like they're you know? And and they're it's not that they're happy, But there it's pleasant, and it's very intense, very high arousal. You know? And in the moment, It it seemed right, and then they come back, you know, and they ask themselves, like they come back, and so they're now, You know, their deployment's ended.[0:46:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Now they're back home, and they're like, am I a psychopath? Like, I enjoy killing people. What is this about? And I was thinking, no. No.[0:46:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You experienced Liggett. And if you had a word for it, you would understand that it's a groupie feeling where you're all in it together, and it's really intense. And, you know, they were experiencing the, the intensity of of, having their life on the line and and being responsible for their for their brothers, you know, and sisters in in in their troop. Or and, you know, so, the The what they would realize is is a perfectly it's perfectly within the range of normal human variation. It's just that in English, we don't have a word for it, really.[0:47:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But there are words that are concepts in other languages. Right? Or the not the other one that I like is called giggle, which is where when you see a baby who's really cute and you just wanna, like, Oh, he's[0:47:30] Andrew Huberman: not a human. Sweet. What? You're up. The kid was so cute.[0:47:34] Andrew Huberman: There's little cheeks. They're just, like, jumping at you, and you can't Oh, I wanna see you. Are delightful people too. Yeah. And Dave was just facing out because they have one of those outward facing baby things.[0:47:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And it's just sort of like yeah. Yeah. It's a[0:47:45] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And that I think[0:47:46] Andrew Huberman: Giggle, it's called? Giggle. Giggle. Oh, giggle was from the other episode that we did on Yeah. Little bit also[0:47:51] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: has to do with babies, but, yeah, in a different way. Or there's 1 in I think there's a Japanese word for the despair that you feel when you got a bad haircut. Really? Yeah. Because it's, I mean, it really is a different kind of feeling than you know, because you've gotta, like, wait for it to grow, you know, whatever.[0:48:08] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Anyways, the point being that[0:48:09] Andrew Huberman: Amazing.[0:48:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Words for us mark particular states, and they're not all the they're not always the states that other people in other cultures care about. But I there's a but the even, again, the phrasing of your question, I just wanna come back to, and I'm not trying to pick at you. But Feel free.[0:48:25] Andrew Huberman: What I love is that what what you said before when you said my question was ill posed, in your in the answer that followed, It made it very clear why, and I learned something about how the the the the not emotion system, but the things, plural, that that create emotions work. So, feel free. I I I grew up in the same culture that you did. I'm not Canadian by birth, but but in the academic culture. Yeah.[0:48:50] Andrew Huberman: You know? I mean, the the stuff that we take online, by the way, folks, is nothing compared to the kind of hazing that I experienced growing up in, in academic culture as it was done then. I don't know if it's still that way now, so, feel free. Yeah. I think I'm tougher than I look.[0:49:06] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, Nova, I think my point is that I'm trying to get at here is that when we ask questions, any of us, me too, anybody ask a question, There are certain assumptions that we're making in order to allow us to pose the question. And sometimes what I'm taking issue with is not the question itself, but it's the assumptions behind the question. Right? And this is a very classic thing in philosophy of Science, which I know I just said the p word philosophy, which scientists, you know, usually they roll their eyes back in their head and fall over when you talk about that. But I think it's really important.[0:49:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So, You know, can language is language sufficient to label or to to to gauge emotional states? Kinda sounds like and this is the assumption that people make, that there's a state in here called an emotion, and now I have to label it. I have to identify it. That is not how it works. Like, that is not what your brain is doing at all.[0:50:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And in order to explain what I think is happening and what I My best available guess, you know, like, based on what I understand, it's like not even remotely that that is just not a meaningful question at all. I do think words are important. I just don't think that they have to be insufficient by virtue of what the brain is actually doing. And the way that I come at this is just really different from a lot of my colleagues. So, really, for A 100 years at least.[0:50:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I hate when people say things like that. Like, for a 100 years. But it really is. Like, for for a 100 years at least, What psychologists and neuroscientists do have or did and are still doing is they start with a folk Experience, a folk category, a common sense experience. I feel angry.[0:50:49] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I'm making a decision. Having a memory. I'm remembering something. They start with their experience, And then they go looking for the physical basis of that experience in the brain or in, you know, in the body. I think that's really problematic Because not everybody in the world actually uses those categories or has those experiences.[0:51:09] Andrew Huberman: A lot of that has to do with the scientific publication process. For sure. One of the most important statements I ever heard is from the late Ted Jones, one of the greatest neuroanatomists of probably the last 500 years, which was the following. He said, a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a person produces a scientific paper. Yeah.[0:51:32] Andrew Huberman: And in many ways yeah. Yeah. You kinda catch it. It gets you square in the face, and you go, oh, right. Yeah.[0:51:39] Andrew Huberman: I mean, basically, Every drug disrupts if taken an hour or 2 before sleep, changes the amount of REM sleep that you get. So so I could imagine that Almost any perturbation of the language system, the body, the facial movement system could give you a, quote, unquote, effect that you could write a paper about Yep. But that doesn't mean it has any semblance whatsoever to what's happening in the world when we or other people experience emotions.[0:52:05] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And here's the here you know, there's so much in what you said that I I just wanna it's very it's very exciting to talk to you. So the first thing I'll say is that, You know, we often will identify we we as in the, you know, people, but also scientists, identify Biological signals, by what we believed them to mean psychologically. So Serotonin is is a happiness chemical. No. Serotonin involved as a metabolic regulator.[0:52:40] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It is a metabolic regulator. And whatever it's doing, it's allowing an animal to spend resources When the animal that the animal's brain isn't sure, there's a a reward at the end of that. Right? So you were saying before, you know, The absence of fatigue, the absence of discomfort, that's a that's a pleasant feeling. Right?[0:53:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well yeah. So maybe serotonin has something to do with pleasantness Because it has something to do with energetics. Right? Cortisol. Cortisol is not a stress hormone.[0:53:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's not a stress hormone. I mean, it's a hormone that is secreted more when the brain believes that there is a big metabolic outlay that's required. That's what stress is, basically. It's the brain believes there's a big metabolic outlay that's about to be required. And It matters.[0:53:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: These kind of, like, little semantic tweaks, like, they matter a lot because of how we do because of how we do research. So I would say I don't start with the categories that derive from English and my own experience. I start with The nervous system. I try to learn what is the best available evidence for how that nervous system evolved, How it developed, how it's structured. Right?[0:54:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Anatomy, to me, is very important. Some of my best hypotheses come from just learning the anatomy and realizing, oh, no. There's a connection there. That's direct. That mean that should mean something.[0:54:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know? I mean, I could give you lots of examples of, where we've had we've made discoveries solely because we noticed an an a set of anatomical connections, and We're really curious about what they might be involved with. But if you start with that premise, then You think about the brain, and I think about the brain in really different way. Right? So I don't think about the brain as a stimulus driven organ.[0:54:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I think about it more like this that the the brain is 1st of all, the brain is not running a model or or making inferences about the world. All the brain knows are signals from the sensory surfaces of its body. So your brain is modeling your retina, and it's modeling your cochlea, and is modeling the sensory surfaces of the skin. And, sure, signals, you know, are, You know, hit those surfaces, and those surfaces transduce those signals and send them up to the brain. But the brain only knows the body.[0:55:23] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And anything it knows about the world, it knows about the world through the body, through the sensory surfaces of the body. So that's the first, for me, really big important point. The second important point is that I think about the brain as being trapped in a dark silent box called your skull.[0:55:40] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:55:40] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know? And It's so weird saying these things to you. You're so much you know, you're like you're you're this really esteemed, like, neuroscientist, and here I am Explaining to you No. But how I think the brain works. It's just very, you know[0:55:53] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's important for our audience, but it's also important for me even though, yes, I I know I know these facts, but It's I believe it's always informative to go back to the fundamentals Sure. Because we forget. You know, actually, I would say that the, someone once described, the I'll call him the great because he's a great visual neuroscientist, visual neuroscientist, Tony Mavshin, who founded the department of neuroscience at NYU once said, you know, a real intellectual is somebody that can appreciate and work with a topic at multiple levels of granularity.[0:56:26] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Sure.[0:56:26] Andrew Huberman: Right. It's not about and oftentimes, the the the more expertise is associated with more focus on detail, so I love returning to the core basics. So So I I think it's wonderful. Okay. Please please Continue.[0:56:36] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So I think about the brain as being trapped in this box, and, it's receiving signals continuously from the sensory surfaces of the body, But those signals are the outcomes of some set of changes, and the brain doesn't know what the changes are. It doesn't know the causes of those signals. It just knows the outcomes. It knows the signals. That's what it's receiving.[0:56:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And so it has to guess at what the causes of those signals are in order to stay alive. And so that's in philosophy called an inverse problem. So the brain just has a massive continuous inverse problem that it has to deal with All the time.[0:57:14] Andrew Huberman: Like, it can't have it doesn't have access to all the information. No. It's just a guessing machine.[0:57:18] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's a guessing machine. So for example, you know, if you hear a loud bang, what is that loud bang? Could be a car door slamming. It could be thunder. It could be a car backfiring.[0:57:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It could be a gunshot. The brain doesn't know. It has to guess. And it's not making a guess Like, intellectual guess. The guess is a motor plan.[0:57:45] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's a plan For changing the internal state of the body in order to support motor skeletal motor movements. Do I need to run? Do I need to shut the window? Do I need to get an umbrella? Do I you know, do I need to hold my breath because the car has backfired?[0:58:02] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, what do I need to do? So where does that plan come from? Well, it comes from past experience, the experience that's been wired into the brain. But the I think that the evidence suggests that what the brain is doing is basically Reinstating bits and pieces of past experience, so remembering. Although we don't experience ourselves as remembering, but, basically, it's reimplementing ensembles of signals from the past that are similar to the present in some way.[0:58:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Now a bunch of things which are similar to each other In psychology is a category. So what the brain is doing is it's creating a it's constructing category. And in fact, We think about the brain as a continuous category constructor. It's constructing a category of possible futures, possible outcomes, Possible motor plans, and how does it know which is the right one? Because it's not just picking 1.[0:59:14] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: There's gonna be some Sample that it's re it's reimplementing, but how does it know which 1? Which is the right one? Because there can only be 1.[0:59:22] Andrew Huberman: Well, I feel like in the example of a loud noise, What I immediately thought of as you were describing that is that my system would become aware of it. I will become aware of it. But then it's a question of, Is there another loud noise? How closely are those loud noises spaced? Is it getting louder or less loud?[0:59:39] Andrew Huberman: And then and so a bunch of categories, it it's like a bookshelf with an infinite number of books. But then with the 2nd loud noise, now it's just, you know, one, wing of the library. And then with the the next thing that happens in the context, it starts narrowing, and then pretty soon you get presented with the book that says, you know, the roof is about to cave in.[0:59:57] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And and I think your your your your analogy there is pointing out 2 things. One is that, really, why why the what the brain is attempting to do is to reduce uncertainty Because uncertainty is super expensive. Now sometimes we, like, deliberately, you know, cultivate uncertainty. Right? Like, we do not you know, we deliberately try to learn things we don't you know, that we don't know.[1:00:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: We we, you know, put ourselves in novel situations. You know? We seek novelty and because it's fun and interesting and whatever. Sure. But imagine every Single waking moment of your life was like that where you didn't know you couldn't narrow things down from the library to the wing, To the bookshelf, to the, you know, the to the the particular shelf on that bookshelf to the terrify.[1:00:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah. You it would be Terrify. It would be I[1:00:49] Andrew Huberman: get that's the label I would give it. Yeah. It would be terrifying. Right. Because I couldn't plan anything or do anything because all possibilities are open.[1:00:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right. It's and it's just actually metabolically unsustainable. And, you know, there are some there are some brains that are wired in a way that they don't Predict very well. They don't create these categories very well, and so they're they're dealing with In really unbelievable amounts of uncertainty. So that's one thing I is but the part of what's The goal here, if you could say there's a goal, is to reduce uncertainty.[1:01:23] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And I'm gonna get to why this has anything to do with emotion in a minute, but I I just need to set up The ground, rules or the assumptions, you know, of what I'm what I'm working with here. So the other thing, though, that you pointed out, which I think is really important, is that the, none of this is static. It's all evolving over time. I'm right? The signals are evolving over time.[1:01:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So both the signals that are constantly hitting the sensory surfaces of the body and making their way to the brain, but also The intrinsic signals in the brain, it's all changing over time. So when we talk about context, that's important. How is the brain making a decision about similarity? Like, what are the features that are similar? It's it's not just at a single snapshot in time.[1:02:11] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's always happening dynamically over time. Right? And most of the time, though, you don't ask your you don't wait to hear a second sound. You don't you're not deliberately attempting to figure out what the sound is. Your brain is just sorting it out.[1:02:28] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right? And it's Sorting it out by narrowing down the possibilities, and there are some selection mechanisms in the brain that help it Guess better, but also the signals coming from the world, are are also helping to select which possibility, is the right one.[1:02:51] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etcetera, mean, and Behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health.[1:03:37] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APOB and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation. You'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman To get 20% off, there's this scene that comes to mind from that movie. I think it was Saving Private Ryan where, like, the the, the guys that are about to hit the ground on d day are flinching with every crack of gunfire. Like, there's everything's a stimulus to move Right.[1:04:15] Andrew Huberman: And to and and then some of the more seasoned soldiers are literally get having bullets whizzing by their head, and people are dropping dead all around them, and they're moving forward steely eyed and stable and upright. And in part, we look at that and and say, okay. They're courageous. They're seasoned. Maybe they're desensitized in certain ways, but, Actually, it fits much better with the idea based on what you're saying, it fits much better with the idea that, they have Intimate knowledge, both conscious and unconscious knowledge that something right next to them is a threat, but not a threat worth responding to.[1:04:56] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. If it were headed straight for them[1:04:58] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah.[1:04:58] Andrew Huberman: They would So quite quite understand it.[1:05:00] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Would say is is that it's, it's not, You know, I keep referring to things as signals, and, really, I'm just I'm that's, like, my generic word for a quantity of energy of some sort. You know? But Your brain, my brain, every brain is constantly making signal, noise, distinct you know, like, distinctions. Do I need to care about this? Do I do I not need to care about this?[1:05:21] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right? And We have ways of learning, and we also have ways of queuing each other. So, you know, humans use eye gaze to cue each other about what is signal and what is noise. Right? So if you and I are sitting we're let's say we were at a coffee shop, and we were in a part of town that I'd never been to before, we were sitting having coffee and, you know, a loud siren went by.[1:05:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: If you turned and looked, I'd probably turn and look Because you just cued me that that was something I need to care about. If you ignored it, I'd probably ignore it because you just cued me that I didn't need to worry about it. I didn't need to care, and we're constantly doing that with each other. And we also do it with little babies and with kids, and that's how we teach children. This is signal.[1:06:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: This is noise. This, you need to worry about. This, you can ignore. And so, yeah, your your description is perfect. So what does this have to do any of this have to do with Emotion.[1:06:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: In order to answer that part of the question, I I wanna say so, okay. You've got these signals. The brain is like has these electrical signals going on. We'll just ignore the hormonal signals for the moment because that's you know, one is complicated.[1:06:28] Andrew Huberman: So[1:06:28] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: it's got all these electrical going on. It's when it's remembering something, it's just basically reinstating a pattern of signals. And it's got these signals coming in, from the sensory services. Okay. So what's so what is the brain doing?[1:06:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's a signal processor. So what is it I don't mean a computer. I mean a signal processor in the engineering sense. So What's it what is it doing? Without getting into all the dynamics of prediction and, you know, whatever, What the brain is doing is it's, it's assembling a set of features.[1:07:02] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's some of the features that it's assembling are Very close in detail to the sensory surfaces of the body. So in primary visual cortex, there's a retinotopic map. The details there are very, very low level, like a line, an edge. You know? Same thing in primary auditory cortex.[1:07:21] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right? It's tone of topic, so there are tones. But it's very, very, very low level details. And we might there are many, many, many, many of these little features. So we would say there there's a it's a high dimensional array.[1:07:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Lots and lots and lots and lots of features. And then and let's just talk about 1 structure, just the cerebral cortex. Let's not worry about let me just But what I'm about to say is basically true of, really, the rest of the brain as well. If you take the cortex off the surface, the cortical sheet off the that wavy, you know, cortical sheet, take it off the rest of the brain, the subcortical parts, and you stretch it out like a napkin, You can see there's a compression gradient there in the architecture of the neurons. So at the primary sensory areas, there are these tiny little Pyramidal neurons that are representing these these very low level features, and they feed into bigger neurons, which Feed into bigger neurons, which feed into more bigger neurons.[1:08:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So what's happening is you've got this very detailed array Being compressed in its dimensionality until you get to the middle of the brain at the front where there are many fewer neurons, but they're bigger and they have many more connections. So it's a dimensionality reduction that's happening.[1:08:38] Andrew Huberman: So just to make sure I understand correctly and that the audience understands. The physical world obviously is, transformed by our sensory apparati, the retina, the cochlea, the The sensing neurons in our skin[1:08:53] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah.[1:08:54] Andrew Huberman: It's physical things, mechanical pressure, light, photons, sound waves. Okay. Though that's translate into neural code, which is chemical and electrical. Yep. And and those sensory inputs are are fairly vast, and these high dimension high dimensionality.[1:09:12] Andrew Huberman: So lots of different orientations of lines. A lot even, you know, even though it originates with just 3, cone photo pigments, lots of opportunity for encoding different shades of color, contrast, okay, and all of that. And so you have lots of little neurons to represent all the possibilities of the physical world that are occurring. Mhmm. But as that information is passed Further up along excuse me.[1:09:35] Andrew Huberman: I have to be careful with high the use of hierarchies because that's controversial nowadays. Mhmm. Not for political reasons, but Mhmm. For accuracy reasons. Mhmm.[1:09:42] Andrew Huberman: As that information is passed along, there's more, convergence Mhmm. Onto A smaller number of larger neurons. Mhmm.[1:09:51] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So[1:09:52] Andrew Huberman: these are neurons that have access to a lot of information, but in coarser form.[1:09:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right. So they're low we you know, it's like Like compressing an m p three. Like, how an m p three compresses information, for example. So the cortex is representing features. So and I represent I'm just using that in a generic way because that's also controversial about exactly how is the okay.[1:10:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But yeah.[1:10:12] Andrew Huberman: But it works.[1:10:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But for now, I'm using it just in a generic way. So you go from lines and edges to a shape, like a round shape to a face To, right. So you're you're basically you're you're, you're going what's happening is there are summaries Of summaries of summaries of summaries.[1:10:34] Andrew Huberman: That. I hope everyone hears that because I've been in this field of neuroscience a long time. As you move along the neuraxis from the sensory epithelium now it sounds very very nomenclature ish, but from the surface of the skin inward, you're getting Summaries. Yeah. They send more and more summaries.[1:10:53] Andrew Huberman: I think that's so important. That's a that's a, like, a gazillion Dollar statement[1:10:58] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Thank you.[1:10:59] Andrew Huberman: For understanding of the nervous system.[1:11:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So but each of those points correspond to some mental feature like a line or an edge Or a circle or a square or a face or right? But but now then you When you when you're in the midline at the front, what are those features? Well, those features are things like they're they're multimodal Summaries, meaning they're summaries of the sights and sounds and smells and right? But they and they are lower dimensional, meaning they are they're coarser. So there are things like threat, reward, pleasure.[1:11:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I mean, really abstract. That's what abstract means. It doesn't mean that those representations have no sensory or motor meaning. The the it means that Threat, for example, a summary can have many different patterns associated with it, And the brain is treating them all as equivalent.[1:12:00] Andrew Huberman: This this, to me, again, feels so, so important for people to understand because, as I'm hearing this and this word summaries is just ringing in my mind, it's so important because one of the Core components of my experience of my emotions because that's all I can really say. For sure, my Subjective interpretation and labeling of my own emotions is that they are pretty broad bins. Like I described earlier[1:12:29] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: broad bins. And so that that's where I was exactly where I was going. So what about the word anger? Where is that represented? Like well, that's, that's one of these multimodal abstractions.[1:12:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: In fact, anger is just a couple of phonemes. It's a couple of sounds. But those sounds, the sound of anger, corresponds over thousands of instances that you've learned in your life to very different patterns[1:12:59] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:12:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Of sensory motor features. That's right because what's going on in your body during anger can vary. What the way you move your face in anger can vary depending on the situation. What you see someone else doing in anger can vary in so the word anger or any word is actually just a multimodal Summary of many, many, many, many instances which are in their sensory and motor features, the sensory and motor meaning Very different.[1:13:35] Andrew Huberman: And and it seems to me are highly constrained by developmental and cultural experience. Absolutely. Because Just today, I learned that there's a word in Japan for the feeling that one has of having gotten a haircut they don't like. There's a word in Germany that pertains to the feeling of wanting to punch someone specifically because of the look on their face. Oh, really?[1:14:00] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's more You like, you they to you, it feels like they're asking to be punched in the[1:14:04] Andrew Huberman: Even so you added yet more dimensionality to it. So upon learning just those things just today, there is additional dimensionality brought in such that if I were to ever, want to punch somebody in the face simply because of the look on their face, that I wouldn't necessarily label that as anger alone. It now has another dimension to it. And so I I think I'm Finally, I think I'm finally starting to understand how the developmental and the cultural influences, plus The fact that language is a pretty crude descriptor for this neural process that you're describing.[1:14:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Absolutely. Absolutely. But, Okay. So but but before you use the word granularity, and so I'm gonna use that word too. In fact, I've you I've coined that phrase, emotional granularity.[1:14:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: This is an aside. You know? I coined that phrase almost 30 years ago, and now people study it like it's a phenomenon, which is cool in a sense. But, also, I kinda wanna keep reminding them, like, that's a word that refers to a process. It's not a thing.[1:15:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's a process. And the but the process is so when the the brain is a category constructor, how Fine grained are the categories. How precise are the categories? Right? Like, if you're using if your feature of equivalence that your brain is using is threat, You're in really big trouble because there are, like, a gazillion different sensory motor patterns that could go with threat.[1:15:39] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So your category is gonna be massive. So how does the brain figure out which of those massive number of options is the one to use in this in in this instance. If, on the other hand, you don't just wanna use sensory motor patterns As the features of equivalence or the features that you're using to say, this instance right now is similar to these past instances. If I had to search, Like, right now, what is similar to right now? It would be me sitting across the table from somebody who has a beard and is, dressed in black and you know, there there are a lot of details there that probably don't matter.[1:16:18] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right? So you you'd be searching for a specific match from the past. That's not very efficient either. So you need Something in the middle, and that be that is to say you need to have your brain has to be able to make categories that are more fine grained, But not super fine grained, but they have to be more fine grained than just threat.[1:16:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You wanna keep the in the library analogy that I made earlier, you want to keep the rest of the library accessible at some level.[1:16:46] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah. So[1:16:47] Andrew Huberman: you're not just staring at that 1 book.[1:16:49] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But if you use the category bad, this feels bad, then your brain is basically Going to be partially constructing an entire wing full of books, like, a entire wing full of options. If you use the word angry, then maybe it's a bookcase. It's constructing a bookcase full of options and a category that's a sizable bookcase. And if you were using the word frustrated, then maybe it's a shelf. The brain can learn to construct categories at different scales of gen generalizability.[1:17:29] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So if I'm in an instance and, my brain is making a guess, Is it drawing from past instances that were associated with the word anger? Were associated with the word fear? Maybe it's some combination. It's The words are just features. They're just sounds.[1:17:46] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: There are also all sorts of other features, like what was my heart doing? What what what kind of motor actions did I make? What did I see next? So the point being what I'm trying to bring here is that it's not like your brain Creates an emotional state and then labels it. What your brain is doing is creating a category of possible futures of what's gonna what it's gonna do next.[1:18:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And that state is largely determined by The what the brain is remembering[1:18:22] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:18:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And how it's drawing from that huge population, that huge library of options. Which books is it sampling?[1:18:31] Andrew Huberman: I love this so much because it explains so much that, frankly, it has Been perplexing to me and also somewhat troubling to me. Like, for instance, I, we hear about emotional intelligence, you know, and and sometimes I wonder whether or not, true emotional intelligence would be what you just described, the understanding of how this process works so that you can work with it. And I definitely wanna talk about how one can work with this knowledge because I think it's incredibly powerful in its, explanatory power, but also, it's actionable power. The other thing is that it's clear to me just based on my experience today of hearing these words from other cultures that relate to different emotional states that the system, unlike a lot of systems in the brain, I like to think is fairly plastic. Like, the moment that you know that there are additional dimensions to sadness, anger, etcetera, there's something comforting about that.[1:19:26] Andrew Huberman: What's Really unsettling is the idea that we have such broad bins that we are we would define, you know, a near infinite number of situations as just fear. That would suck. That's not a good existence, and yet I have to ask whether or not you think that as a species, not as a culture, but In our entire species, whether or not we are taking the exact opposite approach that we're sort of moving into the emoji Is that a word? I'll make it a word, then people can assault me in the comments. The of This very rich and complex system, we're starting to get into this mode of, like, I'm gonna post an angry face, and therefore, like, this is a bad I'm angry at you.[1:20:09] Andrew Huberman: This is a bad interaction. We're gonna It's it's, combat potentially combative. Or and, you know, maybe, TwitterX or Instagram or other social media sites are kind of the the epitome of this where You reduce this high dimensional space, and you you keep the the sensory stimulation very high. It's movie after movie after movie and color and sound and people Doing crazy parkour stuff and bears eating giraffes or whatever it is. It's probably not bears eating giraffes.[1:20:35] Andrew Huberman: But, like, you know what I mean? And you can see stuff that's Sexual and violent and political and emotional and sweet, and then the cats are kissing the monkey and you're like or the monkey's kissing the cat. And so it's high dimensionality in terms of sensory space. But then what do we call it? We're like, oh, this is an emoji.[1:20:52] Andrew Huberman: You assign an emoji. You're hearting something. You're giving a thumbs up or a thumbs down. So I almost feel like we we're trying to, we we're regressing to a state where we're kinda like an infant trying to figure out, like, what the hell is going on, and we're saying, you know what? You get, like, 6 categories of response.[1:21:07] Andrew Huberman: When in reality, we should probably be expanding the number of different responses that we can have in order to accurately match the way that our nervous system actually works.[1:21:18] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yes. Exactly. There are many different things we could talk about with respect to the summary that you just gave, which I I think is completely accurate. So what I would say is that if you look through even just the last, I don't know, 100 or so years, like, 19th, You know, 19th, 20th centuries, maybe, you can see that the complexity of the of people's responses expands and contracts. Right?[1:21:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So for example, this is something that I've written really speculatively about. But one of the things that I found really interesting is that, know, authoritarianism authoritarian thinking is the reduction of complexity to some things that are really, really simple. Like, you're getting rid of all the complexity to, you know, basically, these very, very coarse, low dimensional judgments, and Things become black and white. It's the avoidance of complexity, so that there can be simple single answers to things. And it happens in human culture at times, and then then there's an expansion of complexity at times too.[1:22:39] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So what predicts that? Like, what is it in the human nervous system or our collective human nervous you know, like, we're We're just a bunch of brains attached to bodies interacting with other brains and bodies. Right? So, like, what is it that causes these, ripples of and and I have some thoughts about that that are really, really, really speculative. But I think the other thing that's that's really important is that we've talked about so we'll go back to our our cortical that we've and by the way, this is just 1 compression gradient in the brain.[1:23:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: There are others too. Right? There are at least 4 others that I can think of. So this is just 1. But all compression gradients work the same way, which is that now we've talked about going from the low level details, Compressing to these multimodal summaries, these really, like, simple, features that are right.[1:23:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But that compression is What engineers would call lossy, meaning you lose the information. You lose the information. So when you go from lines and edges to a face, those neurons, they just know the face. They don't have they lose What they've thrown away, the details they've thrown away, those details are gone for those neurons that are representing[1:24:00] Andrew Huberman: a They[1:24:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: don't have access to it. We don't so we said, well, the brain is making a guess. It's making a guess about what these what this big, very, very high dimensional, You know, soup of signals in the world and in the body, like, what do they mean? Right? When the brain makes a guess, it starts With the compressed low dimensional signals, it starts with the features like anger or, like, Threat or it starts with these summaries, and then it has to infer or guess.[1:24:35] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: At every synapse, There's a guess that's being made about what the details are at the next level because what's happening is the guess is basically the brain going from these really general things to these very specific sensory motor patterns. It happens along the cortical sheet. It happens Also, down the neuro axis, down the nerve you know, from the cortex to the midbrain to the brain stem to the spinal cord, you have to go from A representation of, you know, run to the actual physical movements of Muscles, spindles, and, you know, angles of joints and things like that. So what you're doing is you're going in the other direction. You're Adding detail, you're particularizing, and the brain is guessing.[1:25:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's guessing well, if it's using anger As the general feature, well, which which instance of anger is it, and what are the specifics that are gonna happen. And[1:25:36] Andrew Huberman: And what are the what and forgive me, but and what are the adaptive Steps that I might take or not take. Because, I'm quoting a lot today, so forgive me, but in the words of the great Sherrington, Nobel Prize winning physiologist, the final common pathway is movement.[1:25:53] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: With movement. And that's And[1:25:55] Andrew Huberman: and movement is nuanced. Right? Humans, I I suppose, have Among the greatest variety of different speeds and types of movement, I think about parkour, gymnastics, think about then what, like, a a cheetah can do. Cheetahs are impressive. A gymnast is truly impressive in terms of the range of movements and speeds, etcetera.[1:26:12] Andrew Huberman: In any event, the ultimate Choice that the nervous system has to make is whether or not to move which direction, how fast, or stay still, move forward, move back. And and I just I'll just Add because I I'm hoping that you'll expand on this. It's been said before that ultimately the nervous system is trying to make decisions about yum, yuck, or meh? Like like, am I gonna move towards something? Am I gonna move away from it, or am I just gonna stay put?[1:26:39] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, that's only that's only at the the the That that's a very I would say that those are very low dimensional features. So those are those compressed features, but that's not the only thing the brain has to decide. That's just a misnomer.[1:26:51] Andrew Huberman: Well, get the I can get out of this little pickle that I just put myself in by saying that I didn't say that. No. I know you didn't. Won't quote who did because he's a very famous neuroscientist, But he tried to reduce it all. He's at Caltech.[1:27:01] Andrew Huberman: It, he's not somebody who studies emotion. He studies the visual system. But he said that, you know, that that there's a That the the neural circuits, maybe it's because these studies mice, are are essentially binned into, yum yuck and meh outputs. And and I've I've always liked it on the one hand because threes work and it's simple, but rarely is the way that we describe things the way it actually works.[1:27:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So we would, You know, in in studying humans, we would say, well, that's affect. Let affect, that's mood. Or, you know, it's just like, is it is it, should I move towards it? Is it pleasant? Should I move away from it?[1:27:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Is it unpleasant? Or, you know, is it irrelevant, basically? I don't care. Okay. Think about when you're feeling horrible.[1:27:39] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You just feel you feel you just feel you feel bad.[1:27:43] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:27:44] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: What do you do?[1:27:45] Andrew Huberman: You don't know it?[1:27:46] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You don't know because you don't have a plan of action. And that's ultimately, that is what those Those compressed, like, summary features, those very low course features, they have to be decompressed into Details. Otherwise, you don't know what to do. So, ultimately, what the brain is doing is it's sampling from the past Based on similarity to the present, to plan an action. And when I say action, I don't just mean Skeletal motor action like moving a limb.[1:28:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It you the first actions that are planned are the actions of coordinating the heart and the lungs And, you know, all of the internal actions that are required to support the motor the skeletal motor movement. So Your brain is making, is categorizing, and it's making a it's it's creating a category, and it's there are options there. Those options, The motor plans begin with, should the heart beat faster? Should it beat slower? Does blood pressure need to go up?[1:28:48] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Should the, You know, should the blood vessels constrict, or should they dilate? Should the breathing be deeper or more shallow? I mean, those are the first Plans that get made, and then milliseconds later, there are the skeletal motor plans. And then your experience of the world derives from those motor plans. Those visceromotor that is the plans for the viscera, for the internal organs, And the skeletal motor, so I'm just gonna refer to them as motor.[1:29:18] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Those motor plans actually give rise to your experience of the world. There's not some state that exists as an emotional state, which then you apply a label to. The label is, just a set of features that are useful for generalizing from the past to the present. And the Bin size or the the you know, of of what a word refers to can change. It can chain it's different for different people, and it can change in your lifetime.[1:29:53] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And you can add new bins. That is you can so for example, there's a there's a concept, giskanlok, which I probably just butchered. So if you speak Turkish, I'm sorry. But it's like, It has features of it of, like, loss and, like, people blocking your goals. So we would say it's anger and sadness together.[1:30:14] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: That's Giskin look. When you lose something and you're pissed off about it, that's a but that's a Category on its own. Right? It's just a different way of parsing that that that really detailed soup. And the more Words you know, the more words are just useful for pointing to a set of features that are similar to each other.[1:30:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So I mean by that is if I say to you, Andrew, I had pizza last night for dinner. Pizza, 2 sounds, Two syllables. That those 2 syllables sat they stand in for, like, 50 different sensory and motor features. Because I don't have to say to you, I had a food I didn't have pizza last night, but let's say I did. I had a food That was round and flat and had sauce and also cheese, and it it had mozzarella cheese and also a little Parmesan cheese, And it had mushrooms on it and a little bit of, olive and you know?[1:31:15] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I mean, that's, like, really, really, detailed and complicated, but instead, I can just say, I had pizza. Two features, 2 sounds, 2 syllables, phonemes. And with those 2 phonemes, I have just communicated to you in your brain. My brain had 50 features it was representing of details, and now I have just communicated those to you or some number of them with 2 sounds. Very efficient.[1:31:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Now, of course, You might think that I was from Chicago and had deep dish pizza, and I'll just resist. I don't wanna, Like, offend anybody from Chicago.[1:31:54] Andrew Huberman: It's not pizza.[1:31:54] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: That's not real pizza. That's not real pizza. Right? So you could then ask me, was it but you're from Chicago. Is that deep dish pizza?[1:32:05] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And then I would say,[1:32:05] Andrew Huberman: no.[1:32:06] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: No. I'm actually from Toronto, which is just like New York. And so, no, it's thin crust pizza, Which is really the only kind of pizza there is. Just saying. But, you know, but my point is that words are just stand in for They're just low these, like, low dimensional features, these these kind of gross features that stand in for many, many, many, many little detailed features, And that's how we communicate with each other.[1:32:31] Andrew Huberman: And and we are constrained by, you know, what we know in our[1:32:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yes.[1:32:35] Andrew Huberman: So and what we can say and our the extent of our vocabulary.[1:32:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Just say Little babies, 3 months old, they don't speak yet, and they don't understand language, but they can use words To learn abstract categories. So with abstract just means that the the word refers to many different patterns sensory motor features. So the word is, or the category, the things that make the instances similar, are a function, or a goal, not like the sensory motor features. So you say to a baby Very explicitly, like because if we're talking about 3 or 4 month old babies. Right?[1:33:16] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Babies can also do this implicitly too. But in experiments, you say to a baby, look, sweetie. This is a bling. And you put the bling down, and it makes A beeping noise. And then you say, now this looks different, feels different, right, smells different.[1:33:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Look, sweetie. This is a bling. It beeps. Now you take something else, Which also is different. And you say, look, sweetie.[1:33:51] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: This is a bling. Now the baby expects This to beep.[1:33:56] Andrew Huberman: By the way, folks, just listening. Lisa just, gave 3 examples. 1st with a pen, then a coffee mug, and then her very own watch. 3 very distinct objects, but all of which make, that are told the baby is told make, a bling sound, and they will Bin those 3 Yeah. Visually distinct objects functionally distinct objects into 1 single bin.[1:34:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Because they make a Because they are sharing a function, which is to beep.[1:34:24] Andrew Huberman: I think this is so is so important, and I, And if I may, I I I want to ask whether or not we can take this Credible understanding of emotions because that's really what we're talking about.[1:34:41] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, we're really talking about how the brain My my version of how the brain works and how emotions emerge out of this Right. Yeah. System, basically.[1:34:49] Andrew Huberman: And and, absolutely, you described it far better than I could, and and and anchor that to this concept of movement, like the movement is the final common path, With the understanding that the movement system and forgive me, but that we have systems in the brain and body that allow us to move, that's for sure, systems, plural, that they run-in both directions. In other words, how we feel, what we feel, our emotions has some bearing on the movements that are more or less likely for us in a given context, and our movements clearly can also influence the way that we feel internally.[1:35:27] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, it's Right. Well, I mean so if, if we just look at how things are happening, here's Here's what the anatomy tells us, that when the brain makes a guess, that guess starts as a motor plan. Starts as a visceral motor plan and a skeletal motor plan.[1:35:43] Andrew Huberman: So heart rate changes, breathing changes, blood pressure changes[1:35:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And[1:35:47] Andrew Huberman: and potentially skeletal muscle movement.[1:35:49] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right. And literal copies literal copies, efferent copies of those signals are sent to they propagate to the sensory areas Telling the brain, telling those neurons, this is the last time we made this in this context, when this other stuff just happened, The like, this temporal context. Right? The and we made these movements. Here's what we saw next.[1:36:14] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Here's what we Felt next. Here's what we smelled next. So[1:36:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think of this the image that pops to my mind, and we should explain to people what Eferent's copy is. In neuroscience and neuroanatomy, the connection to a structure is called an afferent with an a, and the connections out from a structure is called the efferent. The way I was thinking[1:36:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: even matter. It's just basically the point here is that in our experience, in our in the way the brain your brain conjures an experience. Okay? And and that experience is is that you feel something first. You see something, you feel something, you act.[1:36:49] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: That's not what's happening. What's happening is your brain is preparing the action first and the feeling what and your experience comes from that action preparation. So it's a copy. It's like, literally, you have axons that are sending motor signals down the the, you know, brain stem to the spinal cord And literal copies of those axons, like those axons have branches that collateral branches that just Send axons to other places. The same signal that is being sent to your spinal cord to move stuff In your body, that same signal is being sent to other neurons in the brain as predictions of the sensations that are gonna happen in a 2nd from now, a moment from now, probably faster than a second, but, you know, in couple milliseconds, if you move.[1:37:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And so, yes, It is the case that what you feel is linked to what you do, and what you do is linked to what you feel, but not in this Simple mechanistic way that that neuroscientists and psychologists have been using forever. You it's not like you are You are you you you're probed by a stimulus. You you see something, you hear something, and then you process it and evaluate it, and then you react to it. No. That's not what's happening.[1:38:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: What's actually happening under the hood is that based on how things are right now, your brain makes a guess or some guesses. And those guesses start as motor plans, and the consequence of those motor plans are predicted sensations. And then, of course, sensory signals are coming from the sensory surfaces, and they and Here's the really here's, to me, the really the most mind boggling thing about this whole explanation. If your Sensory neurons in your sensory areas are already so they're firing. The the the the action potentials the spiking has changed based on these Prepared motor movements.[1:38:54] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So these are sensory predictions. And, you know, when I give talks and on my website, I have some cool examples of of how this works so you can experience it yourself. You you, you know, start to experience, you know, you hear things that aren't there. You you feel vibrations in your chest that aren't there because your brain is predicting. It's predicting these sensations.[1:39:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So let's say the sensations come, the the sensory signals, I should say. Let me so the sensory signals from the sensory surfaces of the body make it to the brain. If you have if your neurons are already firing in a way to anticipate those signals, Those signals just confirm the firing, and then they're done. They don't make it any further into the brain. So when you're predicting well, your experience is constructed completely by your brain.[1:39:47] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: The signals from the sensory surfaces are there just to confirm or to change the signal. So if there's Things you didn't anticipate, then those, errors of prediction, those are the signals that are propagated and become compressed and stuff, and we have a special name for that in science. We call it learning. You know, Andy Clark is a philosopher who writes a lot about Prediction predicting brain and and so on. And he talks about normal, everyday experience as being a controlled hallucination.[1:40:25] Andrew Huberman: That's true. Yeah. I subscribed to that. It's a fairly adaptive in most circumstances Controlled hallucination, but but it has its limitations, and it I mean, what we were talking about, if I could be somewhat of a summary neuron, you can tell me if my summary is too coarse, is that first of all, that the neural systems and the brain let's just call it the nervous system because we're talking about brain and body, are incredibly dynamic. Mhmm.[1:40:53] Andrew Huberman: There's a bunch of inputs. Those inputs gets are incredibly elaborate. They get summarized. The summary prepares the body for a certain action. That's a motor commands, a premotor commands, and then some action may or may not be taken.[1:41:06] Andrew Huberman: But already, As soon as an action is taken or not taken, the whole state of the neural system is different. It's changed as a consequence of just of what just happened. Now, of course, When people hear that and when I hear that, indeed, I I feel like, wow. It's a it's a tough system to study because these are dynamical neural systems, and and We have the technology to put people in functional scanners and look at what lights up, so to speak. We have the Capacity to ask people how they feel based on questionnaires, but you can imagine that's incredibly crude.[1:41:39] Andrew Huberman: So then you give them Likert scales of, you know, rate from 1 to 10, how Happy or sad you are, and so you're adding some some depth and dimensionality to it, but it's incredibly crude. It's nothing like real experience. And If somebody's more verbal, less verbal, maybe they somaticize more or less. I mean, the example comes to mind that, you know, occasionally you learn from Social media, which often I learned from social media and someone once said, I don't think in thoughts. I think in feels.[1:42:06] Andrew Huberman: And I thought, okay. Great. You're probably also from Northern California. And I said, wait. Andrew, stop being so judgmental.[1:42:12] Andrew Huberman: What do you mean? And I asked, and he said, I experience emotions in their mind, first, as a As a bodily state, then the label comes much later. That's not how it works for me. It feels fairly more integrated of brain and body for me, But other people started chiming in. No.[1:42:30] Andrew Huberman: I think of emotion I experience emotions clearly as a verbal label. It's all in their head, and so you start to realize that we might all be encoding the world slightly differently or very differently, and it's changing in time. So then the question becomes, You know, how what are the anchor points in terms of our understanding of emotions that we can work with? And and and the following questions come to mind. Neither you nor I are clinicians as far as I know.[1:42:58] Andrew Huberman: I'm certainly not.[1:42:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I was actually trained as a clinician.[1:43:01] Andrew Huberman: Oh, there you go. I'm wrong again. But I haven't no.[1:43:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: No. No. I mean, I haven't I haven't practiced in, like, really gazillions of[1:43:07] Andrew Huberman: VRs. So You're well, you're more than qualified to answer the question I'm about to ask, which is, To me, there is a great conflict of information in the psychology, psychiatry, and let's just call it wellness and mental health space, which is when we are feeling lousy, like, not good, let's put valence on it. Just lousy. I don't want in the state that we were having an emotion that we don't want to have. There's an entire category of information that says you need to feel your feelings.[1:43:39] Andrew Huberman: You need to feel your feelings. You need to acknowledge that they're there. You need to Go into the feeling, maybe even full catharsis. You need to amplify the feelings until they, quote, unquote, leave your body. After all, Steve Jobs was into scream therapy and helped him sponge his anger.[1:43:54] Andrew Huberman: Who knows? You get these examples. He's probably the worst example because it seemed like he was angry a lot from what I hear. But then there's another category of thought, which is, no. You need to use your Ability to top down control inhibition of the cortex on lower structures.[1:44:11] Andrew Huberman: Again, I'm deliberately using crude language here To say, wait. You know? This is an emotion. Emotions pass. This is not real.[1:44:20] Andrew Huberman: This is just a limited set of, high dimensionality stuff been summarized. And you know what? Like, I don't need to feel this way. I can make myself feel differently. Maybe I'll go for a run.[1:44:31] Andrew Huberman: In fact, I always feel better after I go for a run. So Even this question as simple as should we feel our our feelings or should we not feel our feelings, And, of course, you would hope that this would be answered appropriately such that people don't go harm other people or themselves. But but assuming that they're not gonna harm other people themselves verbally or physically, then you really get yourself into a bit of a pickle. Like, We don't understand what to do with emotions Mhmm. Ours or other people's because, clearly, we don't understand emotions per se.[1:45:05] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm. So I would say I'm gonna answer your question, and then I wanna Also, pick at the word the I wanna pick at an assumption, because it it's come up actually a couple of times, and There's something super important in your descriptions that I just wanna pull out for for the listeners because this thing is really important. And you're doing it very naturally, but I think Some people it would be it it just bears commenting on. So let me just deal with the question of should we feel our feelings or use our words? You know, we say to little kids, use your words.[1:45:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Like, don't throw a tantrum. Right? But then there was also this other feeling. Well, oh, just feel. It's important to feel, and you don't wanna get it have it be pent up and, Or[1:45:46] Andrew Huberman: use your body and, like, and then, like, hit a pillow. Yeah. I mean, there's scream therapy, bite the pillow, scream the pillow, tear the pillow. Yeah. And there's you can pay $5,000 for a week of doing this.[1:45:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:45:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So And[1:45:55] Andrew Huberman: they'll tell you you're gonna feel better at the end.[1:45:57] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So Right? The answer there is it's the wrong question. Like, flexibility is Important. For everything, always. Right?[1:46:06] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So, first of all, you don't have you don't have emotions in your body. Your body doesn't keep the score. You know?[1:46:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Great book title because it's super catchy. Yeah. But with all due respect to, I think, the important work of Vanderkolk, I think it oversimplified and led people to believe that their back pain was trauma And that all trauma is somaticized. But And it's not.[1:46:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: No. It's not. But I I would go further and say, like, first of all, your body does keep the score. Your brain keeps the score. Your body is the scorecard.[1:46:42] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: That's super important. And he has done really important work, But his explanations for why things work is scientifically incorrect. It just is Because we don't feel things in our bodies. We everything we feel, we feel in our brains. We don't see in our eyes.[1:47:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: We see in our brains. Of course, we need our eyes, but we don't see in our eyes. Just like if you, you know, pinch your your hand with you know, take skin and pinch Between, you know, 2 2 fingers, the skin, you don't feel that actually in your hand. You feel it in your brain. That's the magic of the brain in a sense.[1:47:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So what I would say is it, it depends on the situation and what your goal is. Sometimes it is useful to use your words, and sometimes it is useful to go for a run. It just depends on what your goal is.[1:47:42] Andrew Huberman: Well, both those cases, you're you're, that you gave both those examples, excuse me, you're, it's a way of shifting off the emotion. I guess what I'm asking is[1:47:51] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, sometimes you don't wanna shift off the emotion. Sometimes the moat sometimes the wisest thing to do is Live in the emotion. That is, you know, sometimes, discomfort sometimes when something feels bad, it doesn't mean something is wrong. It just might mean that you're Doing something hard.[1:48:08] Andrew Huberman: Well, earlier, I wrote when you're talking about the the broad categorization of emotions, I I wrote down, you know, simple is good when it feels good. You're like, I just feel really great, But then when things feel lousy Well that's where nuance could be beneficial.[1:48:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah. Absolutely. Because we're because emotions are recipes for action. When you go from be feeling bad to feeling angry or sad, it's a recipe for action. And I would also say and this just this is an analogy, but I I sort of I stand by it.[1:48:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, when I was I had major back surgery a couple years ago, and I know something about chronic pain. It's not my area of study, but I know something about it because I've I reanalyzed some some datasets, and I've read a lot. So I'm not an expert, but, you know, I have ideas. And I thought to myself, well, I just I don't wanna end up with chronic back pain. So what I did was I made sure after I got through the 1st couple of weeks where I really needed coat on so that I could walk.[1:49:07] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, I was up and walking the same day I had surgery, if you could call it walking. It was sort of a euphemism for, like, hobbling around on a with a walker, but, I made sure that I felt the pain. That is, I dosed myself with discomfort quite deliberately because I wanted to make sure that I'm I'm I'm sorry for using, you know, Cartesian language. I don't know how else to say this. I I wanted my brain to be taking in the prediction error.[1:49:35] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I wanted my brain to to feel The to to to I wanted to focus attention on the changing dis you know, the the changing discomfort over time because it meant that my body was healing as the discomfort got less, but my brain would never feel that discomfort changing if I, took painkillers. And because the prediction error, the things that the brain doesn't predict, are teaching signals. And I think it's true also in your life. Like, sometimes you wanna feel it because You you wanna feel the discomfort because it's instructive about something, and sometimes it's not. And that's maybe that's not really an answer, but The only way that you can figure that out for yourself is to do it sometimes.[1:50:26] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: If you're always getting rid of discomfort, you never know when it's useful, and it is useful sometimes. But now I wanna get to this point, that I was making before. Like, we are talking about feeling and emotion inter like, they're interchangeable, And they're not. Right? So here's how I would say it.[1:50:45] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Your brain is always regulating your body 247, And your body is always sending sensory signals back to the brain about the sensory state of the body. And Our nervous systems aren't wired for us to experience those sensory changes that are happening in the body In any degree of detail. We're just not. And it's a good thing. Like, right now, as we talk here, Our hearts are beating and our, you know, pancreas is squishing stuff out.[1:51:22] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know? Liver is, you know, filtering and, Like, you know, oxygen concentrations are changing. Like, oh, there's a whole drama going on inside each of us and our listeners, and we're largely We're not aware, and I hope our listeners aren't aware. Because if they were, they would not be listening to anything we were saying. They'd be completely, you know, in enraptured or or in discomfort at what's going on inside them.[1:51:48] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Instead, the brain creates a low dimensional summary, this gross Kind of like barometer, which is feeling, affective feeling, we call it, or you could call it mood, but scientists call it affect with an a. Feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant, feeling worked up, feeling calm, feeling comfortable, feeling uncomfortable. It's kind of a general Barometer of the state of the body, and it's not emotion. That those feelings, those features of feeling are features of consciousness because your brain is always regulating your body. Your body's always sending signals back to the brain.[1:52:24] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: The brain is always representing them in this low dimensional way. Whether you're paying attention or not, like, whether the brain is focusing, it's, you know, applying attention to those neurons or not, The those signals are there, and even when we're not emotional. You know? Like, If you're driving on the highway and somebody cuts you off and you think, what an asshole. The assholeness of that person, that intensity of that negative affect is you experience it as a property of that person, but, really, it's coming from you.[1:52:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's it's not a property of that person. It's that's A feature of your experience in that moment. And affect is always there. Sometimes it's in the foreground. Sometimes it's in the background, but it's always there.[1:53:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And it's a summary of physical things, which is why it helps 2, if you take Ibuprofen or Tylenol, it will I mean, studies show it reduces negative feeling. If you go for a run, if you go for a walk, if you shift your attention to the outside world, then the features That of experience that are derived from the inside world diminish. That's why going for a run helps or going for a walk helps or, You know, getting sleep helps. Right? These are all things where you're changing the state of your body, And so the sensory state of your body is changing, and so your affect changes.[1:53:54] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But emotions are the story that the brain tells about what caused the sensory signals that affect derives from. So what caused those changes? What do I need to do about those changes? That's that's it's a it's a much bigger event than just These features of experience, which are all features of consciousness, which are always there. They're always there.[1:54:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And in fact, in our culture, We we pathologize people when they just experience Their bodies as physical sensations and not as emotions. Like, we say, oh, that person is so much somaticizing or somatizing. They're not. They should they're really they're they should be experiencing emotion, but, really, they're, you know, just experiencing a stomachache, and that's bad. But that's actually a judgment Call that is probably sometimes wrong.[1:54:50] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Sometimes it's probably better to experience a stomachache. Sometimes it's more productive. Part of being emotionally intelligent is knowing when not to construct an emotion. You know? Like, right before The COVID pandemic was announced officially.[1:55:05] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I was in New Zealand giving talks, And my daughter, who was who was in college at that time, was flying, literally, like, I think less than a week before the pandemic was announced, she got on a plane and flew to New Zealand to meet me because it was spring break, and I always would bring her with me on spring break. And in that and I remember really vividly, I was in New Zealand. There was only 1 case one case of COVID in New Zealand at that point, And I I got on the phone to my husband, and I said, I'm experiencing a very high level of arousal, and it's very, very unpleasant. Now my husband knows me very well, and He said, yeah. There's a lot of uncertainty.[1:56:00] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And I said, I know. Now he didn't say to me, well, you're anxious, and you just don't really know it. I because I wasn't anxious. I was feeling uncertain. And as you know or maybe people are are know That when there's a lot of uncertainty, there's also a lot of arousal because the brain is attempting to learn, and the neuromodulators that are important for Learning new things happen to also cause, a subjective sense of arousal.[1:56:30] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And some they actually also modulate your autonomic nervous system so your heart can beat faster or whatever. And our go to explanation for what that is is to experience that arousal as anxiety, but I was uncertain. And remember that how your brain the story it's telling itself, the category it's making is a plan for action. Well, what do you do in anxiety and fear? You freeze or you run away.[1:56:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: What do you do in uncertainty? You forage for information. You tolerate the discomfort and you forage for information, which is what I was doing when I called and said, what should we do? Should I meet her at the airport and turn around and come back, or we have a vacation? Like, I don't really know.[1:57:13] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And, you know, what I ended up doing was foraging for information for another couple days And then made a split second decision in the air when we were flying from 1 island to the other. And I just rerouted us, and we went home. And then the borders closed, like, 2 days later. You know? But my point is that it this is not just, you know, psychological mumbo jumbo.[1:57:40] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You can train yourself to experience Your heart pounding in your chest as determination. When when my daughter this is all in How emotions are made, these examples, but they're true. I mean, my daughter this is the this book I wrote a couple years ago. When my daughter was 12 years old, she was testing for a black belt in karate. She was 5 feet tall, not even, and she was testing against these, like, massively large adolescent boys, Okay.[1:58:09] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Who were like a foot taller than her. And her sensei, who was a 10th degree black belt, Didn't say to her, don't be afraid. He said, get your butterflies flying in formation. And I was, like, Enraptured. I was like, oh my god.[1:58:27] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: This guy is totally brilliant. That is the best, you know, Meaning to give to arousal that changes the meaning of it. What you do when you create an emotion is you're giving meaning to those affective feelings, and you have More control than you might think in how you do that. You can do it by changing the physical state that gives rise to those feelings, you can also change it by learning more how to make more categories and how to make them more fluidly, so that you do something different. And the it's not that things will necessarily feel any more unpleasant or any less or or any more pleasant, it's that the feeling becomes a source of wisdom.[1:59:23] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's a cue to do something different.[1:59:27] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. This is a case, where I absolutely believe that, knowledge about how emotions and affect and states of the brain and body work, which is what you're beautifully describing for Well, today is extremely useful in and of itself. And I think, and I it's a, Frankly, it's a it's a refreshing and welcome departure from a lot of the conversations that we normally have on this podcast where, You know, we talk a lot about protocols. We talk about tools. Right?[1:59:58] Andrew Huberman: Things that people can do, ways they can implement the knowledge. And here, the this is certainly one of those cases as well, but, It's a beautiful one and a very important one where The knowledge itself, just the knowledge of additional words for different states. I love the example of butter putting butterflies into formation because it it Inherent to that is that you're not trying to get rid of the butterflies, quite the opposite. Yeah. You're deploying them in certain ways, and there's an action step a psychological step there, of course, that's required, but that it isn't, you know, view morning sunlight for an average of 10 minutes to set your circadian rhythm, which is something that I say Over and over again, I'll go into the grave saying that.[2:00:42] Andrew Huberman: They'll probably put a window over my grave so sunlight can get in at this point, but which should be fine with me. But in any case, Knowledge is power, something that we hear, but it's not always true. Often, it's knowledge is power, but you need to do x, y, and z in a certain order. But here, what you've provided and you you're continuing to provide is knowledge that People can use that real estate within their brain. I'm deliberately not giving it a name, because it's it's distributed real estate that allows them to take an unpleasant feeling and work with it, that it has more dimensionality than we probably realize.[2:01:23] Andrew Huberman: That's becoming clear to me that rarely, if ever, is there less dimensionality.[2:01:31] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: By just shifting your attention. And you can practice this, really. So, you know, like, there's a story that I tell about when I the brief, moment when I tried to learn how to paint. You know? And so, there's an object like a cup, and you have this three-dimensional object and you wanna render it on a two dimensional canvas.[2:01:48] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So you could just try to draw the cup, And then what you get is a pretty shitty looking, you know, cup. But what What a realist painter will teach you to do is to take the cup and to break it apart into pieces of light. And then what you try to paint are the pieces of light. So you're transferring your first what you're doing is you're taking this very low dimensional course object called a cup, and you're breaking it into tiny little pieces of light[2:02:19] Andrew Huberman: Which is what the visual system does.[2:02:20] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Is what the visual system does. And so what you're doing is you're Categorizing it differently in order to emphasize the features that are more high dimensional, that are in there. Right? They're in there, in in the brain, but you can but what you're doing essentially is you're you're having the brain your brain is applying attention to basically, focus more on those details. And then you transfer the details on to the two dimensional canvas.[2:02:49] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And what you get is a pretty decent looking three-dimensional cup on a two dimensional canvas. Amazing. Unless you're me, and and then it still looks shitty. You know? And so maybe I'll I'll take it up again sometime, in the future, but my point is that you can do that with your own sensory condition of your body.[2:03:09] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: In emotion, you can deliberately focus on What your heart is doing to the to your the best of your ability that you can sense it. Right? Or you can deliberately focus on your breathing, or you could deliberately focus on what your muscles are, How they how tense they feel. You can you can change the dimensionality of your experience by the shifting of your attention.[2:03:30] Andrew Huberman: I love it. And, forgive me for giving another example, but I think it's one that will resonate with both of us and hopefully with our listeners as well, which is, the great Oliver Sacks, Neurologist and author, talked about and wrote about you know, he'd work with these patients that were either had locked in syndrome or severe autism or severe Tourette's or Parkinson's. And, you know, most people would, Even clinicians who specialize in those areas would look to those people and say that they're living in a diminished world. It's it's They lack capacities that other people have, and, and it's all about the the absence of certain abilities. And, and then what he did eventually was incredible.[2:04:14] Andrew Huberman: He loved animals, so he would spend time thinking about what it would be like, For instance, to be a bat hanging in the corner of a room and experience the room not through vision but mainly through echolocation. And he would spend a lot of time thinking about that. He also did a lot of drugs at one point in his career and stopped, yeah, because they were very destructive drugs, not just Psychedelics but also methamphetamine, so, yes, he has that, but he eventually changed his practice to trying to experience human emotion, But first, think about animal sensory experience. Mhmm. And he would do that for lots of different types of animals, octopuses and bats and all these different things, and then It allowed him, in his words, it allowed him to then interact with patients in a way where he could feel maybe even empathize a little bit with how they experienced life, and then he would write books about it in a way, and here I'm borrowing someone else's words, that storied these people into almost greater larger than life characters.[2:05:16] Andrew Huberman: And now, of course, he wasn't trying to detract from their suffering.[2:05:19] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:05:19] Andrew Huberman: But he was trying to give people an understanding of what that suffering was like through their actual experience.[2:05:25] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:05:26] Andrew Huberman: And he did, in my opinion, in the opinion many Other people, a masterful job in doing that. Job. And and it but it came through much in the same way that your art teacher said, you know, pay attention to the way the the the changes in light the the the object as opposed to trying to draw draw the object themselves that when we so the the the takeaway here that I I think we're arriving at is that that you've provided is that if we take a if we add dimensionality to our description of or experience of the sensory inputs, and there's a ton of it to reach to. Mhmm. And we maybe even come up with some new internal labels or language based labels that We can experience the world in much richer and much more adaptive ways.[2:06:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Absolutely. And I I love I love your stories, and I love this story in particular about Oliver Sacks because, it resonates with my experience when I was reading, Ed Yong's new book.[2:06:23] Andrew Huberman: Oh, At first, he wrote, the we contain multitudes, which I think won a Pulitzer. And then, what is the recent one[2:06:31] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right. With the animals.[2:06:32] Andrew Huberman: An immense world.[2:06:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: An immense world. And what I what I was thinking was, you know, it's a first of all, it's a masterful, masterful, masterful book. I I wish I had written that book. I I wrote him a fan letter. I was like, this is such an amazing book.[2:06:45] Andrew Huberman: It's an amazing book.[2:06:46] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: But because he helps you Experience so what what I wanna say is this, that there are all these animals that have different sensory surfaces than we do, And they can detect signals in the world that are that we that are not relevant to us because we don't have sensory services for them. And it reminds you, first of all, that what you experience as reality is really not in the world alone, And it's not in your head alone. It is in the transaction between the two. You know, your the neurons in your brain and in your nervous system are also part of the reality. And so reality is the transaction.[2:07:29] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Reality are the are the features that are the transaction between signals in the world and signals in your brain. And the parts of the world that some other animals experience that we will never experience, They're not really part of our reality because they don't interact with any of the anything that we have. But for those Animals, it's part of their niche. It's part of their you know, niche is just the word for the parts of the world that matter to you, basically. And I was thinking that If people read this book and you know, maybe it will help them have empathy for other people who don't have minds like theirs and who don't experience the world in the way that they do.[2:08:11] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Your description of what what, Oliver Sacks his, what his His actions were and his goals. It did occur to me that this book by Ed Yong would be a great tool For helping people to understand that the way that they experience the world, it might be different than how other people experience the world. And even a little bit of a window on that, It would be a good thing.[2:08:36] Andrew Huberman: So I'd like to ask you more about this word affect, and then I'd like to Discuss how things that we do or don't do might be useful for putting us in broad categories of affect so that we might experience particular arrays of emotions.[2:08:56] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:08:57] Andrew Huberman: So this is my attempt to understand affect in an effort to think about some actionable items.[2:09:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Absolutely.[2:09:05] Andrew Huberman: I love the word affect the way you described it as We're setting up a potential or a series of potentialities for different emotions to occur. No. I make it a point to get sunlight in my eyes in the morning to try and wake up my brain and body because indeed it does that. Broadly speaking, I make an effort to get good sleep at night because that makes everything better.[2:09:28] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Absolutely.[2:09:29] Andrew Huberman: And when I'm not sleeping well or enough, It makes everything worse.[2:09:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:09:35] Andrew Huberman: This is nonclinical, non nuanced language, but I think most people when they hear affect and they think about the examples I just gave, kind of understand, like, yeah, like, When a kid is tired of the kid, they get cranky.[2:09:50] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:09:51] Andrew Huberman: When we're sleep deprived, we get cranky. Indeed, there are times when I'm sleep deprived, and Little things grate on me. They're like a splinter just feels super annoying and maybe even painful. Mhmm. But when I'm well rested, things are going better.[2:10:05] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:10:05] Andrew Huberman: It's not that bad. Mhmm. So tell tell us more about affect because I think it's a really important anchor point[2:10:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mhmm.[2:10:12] Andrew Huberman: For us to understand emotions in ourselves and other people.[2:10:16] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Neuroscientists think about The sensory systems for touch and proprioception, which we call somatosensation, as being in the service of Motor move skeletal motor movements. You really the our sense of touch and even vision actually also works this way. And he and, actually, audition does too. These senses actually serve in, the brain's ability to, control the movements of the body, and the same thing is true, for the, Regulating the systems of the body. So brains, one of their fundamental jobs are to coordinate and Regulate the systems inside your body, your heart, your lungs, your gut, you know, all the moving parts.[2:11:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And The information, the the sensory signals that that those, organs and and tissues and so on send back to the brain, As I said before, those sensory signals are important to the brain's ability to regulate the body, But we don't feel them directly. We usually experience them as affective feelings, these very simple Physical sorts of feelings, and then we elaborate them in various ways. They they really when they get very intense, that those are the moments when the brain Creates a creates emotion out of them. So the brain's regulation of the body, body, the predictive regulation of the body is the technical term is allostasis. But when I'm explaining this to the public, I use a metaphor.[2:12:06] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And, you know, all metaphors are wrong, but some metaphors are less wrong and useful. So the metaphor that I use is, your brain is running a budget for your body, and it's not Budgeting money, it's budgeting glucose and salt and oxygen and water and all the nutrients that you need to stay alive and well. And so you can think about Withdrawals from that budget, like burning glucose or using up oxygen, You can think about deposits, like sleeping and eating. You can think about, you know, savings. So when you're with a friend who you trust and, you know, everything you do actually is just slightly less metabolically expensive.[2:12:54] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right? And you can also think about taxes. Like, if you are stressed socially stressed within 2 hours of eating a meal, that same meal will cost you hon and the equivalent of a 104 more calories in the inefficiency that you will metabolize it because of that stress.[2:13:16] Andrew Huberman: Meaning you'll burn more energy.[2:13:18] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You'll be more inefficient in metabolizing the food, So it's as if you had eaten a 104 more calories.[2:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so I had it exactly backwards.[2:13:30] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And so over the course of a year, that's £11.[2:13:33] Andrew Huberman: So when we say that people are taxing on us Yeah.[2:13:36] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: We like, it's literally true.[2:13:37] Andrew Huberman: Their their language works. Yeah. Their language works.[2:13:40] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So the way I is that you can think about affect as a quick and dirty summary of the state of your body budget. If Things are going reasonably well, then you'll feel okay. You might even feel pleasant. If you're running a deficit in your body budget, then you're gonna feel fatigued or or dressed. And that doesn't mean something is necessarily wrong.[2:14:11] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Like, for example, when you exercise, you get to a certain point where You've reached your ventilatory load. Usually, it's, like, you know, 20 minutes in or 10 minutes in or whatever, depending on how hard you're working, and you start to feel unpleasant and fatigued. But that doesn't mean that something's wrong. That just means that you're working really hard, and you have to push through it. And then, you know, when you're you know, drink water and, you know, you eat Afterwards and replenish, and then you're fine.[2:14:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right? In fact, you're better. It's it's a a way of, building a better, stronger future you. So affect is basically you know, when when things when you're feeling really worked up, it probably means that something's uncertain somewhere. So I just think about these as, like, quick and dirty ways of thinking about your your what your what your affect means.[2:14:58] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And, and then oftentimes, as we've said before, emotion regulation that is controlling emotion really, actually, it's not so much about Changing the meaning of affect, it's changing the affect. And, So it's useful to understand that affect is tied to the state of your body, or What it's tied to is your brain's beliefs about the state of your body. Your brain is modeling the state of the body, and that's interoception. That's the technical word. Enteroception is not your awareness of your body.[2:15:35] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's your brain's modeling of your body, what your brain believes to be true about the metabolic state of your body, and That's how I think about affect. That's how I think about my own affect. That's and my daughter, actually, who, You know, was depressed for so I should say depression is like a bankrupt body budget. Like, you just can't move. You you feel fatigued so fatigued that you can't move and you're very distressed.[2:16:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It's like bankruptcy. And, actually, If you I mean, depression is a metabolic illness. And if you look at the symptoms of depression, they really are about metabolic, having metabolic deficits, basically.[2:16:19] Andrew Huberman: And it's interesting that one of the hallmark features of depression, subjectively Speaking is a lack of positive anticipation about the future, which makes perfect sense Yeah. From the perspective of a depleted Grand body budget.[2:16:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yes. Exactly. You're and you're basically, think about the fact that prediction error. Right? Right?[2:16:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So if you're feeling unpleasant, you're not gonna be anticipating pleasant things. And even if those things that are in the world could give you pleasure, you won't notice them Because learning from prediction error, things that you didn't predict, is expensive. And if you don't have the resources, you're not gonna right? So It's but, anyways, my daughter came up with this, after we had this very interesting thing that happened to us on another trip. We were in Sweden because I was giving a a keynote at the Karolinska Institute, and we went I took her to Sweden.[2:17:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And this is when she was recovering from depression. And, like, you know, she is just one of the millions of young adults who you know, adolescents young adults who were experiencing depression. And, we got to Sweden, And she was very, very jet lagged. We both were. It was like one of these, like you know, we had to, like, you know, Planes, trains, and automobiles.[2:17:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It was just, you know, getting there. And she woke up the next morning, and she she looked Horrible. She felt horrible. It actually seemed to me like she was about to enter another depressive episode, and I Said to her, I basically got her out of bed. I fed her a meal.[2:17:55] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I gave her 4 Ibuprofen, and I put her back to sleep. And she got up 5 hours later, and she was absolutely fine. Her mood was fine. Now I'm not telling you that Ibuprofen is the, an antidepressant that you should take if you're depressed. But what I'm telling you is that, you know, you said something, Andrew, that was so interesting.[2:18:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: At the beginning, you said, am I fatigued? Does my body Do I have pain somewhere? Does my body hurt? You know, these are well, right. When, basically, what she was having was She was fatigued, and she was having what I would call, it's called the technical word is visceral nociception, which means Her stomach hurt.[2:18:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Her you know, everything hurt. And, sure, you know, her muscles probably hurt too, but it was really her innards. Really, she just was distressed. And The, the Ibuprofen helped her get back to sleep, and then she slept and she got up, and she was completely fine. And then we walked around Stockholm for the rest of the day talking about this which for her was like flipping on a light switch.[2:18:53] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, How Emotions Are Made, this book that I've referred to, I wrote that book for her. I wrote that book for her, but also for me because it was a way of putting down on paper all the things that I wanted her to know That and then I thought other people should know about their kids, you know, and maybe even their kids could read it. But what she did with that was she came up with a new concept called the emotional flu. And the emotional flu is when you're having a bad body budgeting day, And you're just like you didn't get enough sleep maybe or, you know, there's some stress at at work or at school that you can't get rid of otherwise. You know, my husband likes to say, well, you know, other people's opinions of you are just electrical activity in somebody's head, which I love.[2:19:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Like, that's just another way of categorizing it. It's sort of like taking apart the taking apart the cup into pieces of light. Right? And so, Whatever. There are just these moments where you feel depleted, and you could use the I mean, the we usually we often use affect to as a as a indicator of how the world is.[2:20:03] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know? If I feel bad, something must be bad wrong in the world. But You have to resist that sometimes because sometimes it there's nothing wrong in the world. It's just that you didn't get enough sleep or, you know, you need to have a little bit more, Or, you know, protein or maybe you haven't gone for a walk and you're stiff or whatever. You need to do some stretching.[2:20:20] Andrew Huberman: Are those sorry to interrupt, but I think people are going to want to anchor to a few of these, Positive steps that they can take to to, I don't wanna say replenish, but to shift affect in positive directions, sleep, movement, Nutrition.[2:20:35] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yes.[2:20:36] Andrew Huberman: And I've heard you say before that we are essentially amino acid forging machines. Yeah. So, yeah, I noticed you said protein. You And say, you need a bagel. You said protein.[2:20:46] Andrew Huberman: We could go down that rabbit hole. Maybe maybe we do, maybe we don't. But I wanna use this also just as a quick opportunity to say, as you're saying all this, one can immediately understand why Alcohol and drugs of abuse are both so compelling. Yeah. Right?[2:21:02] Andrew Huberman: You're not feeling well. Yeah. So take a you're feeling tired. A stimulant that releases dopamine and epinephrine, but you're taxing your already taxed body budget[2:21:12] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yes.[2:21:12] Andrew Huberman: In a way that then puts you in a more depleted state later Or alcohol. Like Yes. You feel lousy. Alcohol never did this for me, but friends I have who are recovered alcoholics will tell me that it was like a magic elixir. It made them feel right.[2:21:25] Andrew Huberman: That's at their language. Yes. But then, of course, there's a price to pay later because then it drops your baseline below where it was initially.[2:21:31] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Absolutely. 101110%. But I just also wanna say that so is serotonin. Like, so are so is so are SSRIs maybe. And when I say maybe, what I mean by that is if you really have a metabolic problem like, say something's wrong with your mitochondria or you're recovering from an illness And, you know, that or or there's just some metabolic problem in your body, that metabolic problem is real.[2:22:01] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: If you start to feel unpleasant, you will, I mean, feel unpleasant. It will feel your mood will be negative. If you start taking if you start taking SSRIs, which will leave more serotonin in the synapses of your, neurons Before it's re it's taken up again, that will juice the system. You will be able to spend. You'll be able to move.[2:22:27] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You'll feel like you have more energy for a while. But your nervous system is is a complex system, and so it's gonna make adjustments elsewhere to try to deal with that budgeting problem. So exactly what happens when you take drugs of abuse And what happens on the short term can happen for some people with SSRIs on the longer term where at first it starts to work and then it stops stops working and you start to gain weight and, you know, and your because your metabolism is slowing because your brain is attempting to deal with that with that budgeting problem. So it really matters what this, you know, what the source is. It could be that your brain believes you have a budgeting problem, but there really isn't one.[2:23:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: It could be that there really is 1. These things matter to how you treat it.[2:23:15] Andrew Huberman: One thing, to, just mention about SSRIs, and I, unfortunately, reasons of confidentiality, I can't cite the source on this, but let me just say that somebody who's highly informed in the in the landscape of of pharmaceutical treatments for, psychiatric challenges has told me that there's an emerging The theory among psychiatrists is kind of a collective emerging theory that, one of the reasons why nowadays You hear about so called treatment resistant depression, but you did not hear about so called treatment resistant depression prior to the advent of SSRIs is that there's a growing body of thought in the psychiatric community. The SSRIs may over time, as you're pointing out, deplete the very neural systems that subserve enhanced mood. So it's it's different than a drug of abuse that gives you a very acute effect, like methamphetamine or cocaine or alcohol, but that over time, you may actually be pulling the very neural circuits and neurochemicals that would allow for positive affect Deeper and deeper into the trenches, so to speak. And so there's a growing number of people who simply don't respond to the drugs any longer Right. Or other treatments.[2:24:27] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Right. So I wasn't trying to say the mechanism is the same. I was basically saying the theme is the same.[2:24:31] Andrew Huberman: And that's what I'm agreeing with.[2:24:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah. What happens over the short term with drugs of abuse happens over the longer term with, For some people with SSRIs because it hasn't been recognized yet that the the at the basis, depression is a metabolic problem. And when you have a metabolic problem like diabetes or obesity or, like, or, heart disease, it's not that that causes depression. It's that there's a common problem, which is that somewhere in this very complex system of your metabolism, there's There there's a drag, and it produces negative mood. And that's how you experience it.[2:25:10] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Sometimes it's good not to turn it's productive not Turn, that negative affect into, an emotion. Sometimes, you know, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes You just need to deal with the affective problem by dealing with the physical your physical state. And that's the tricky bit, Is knowing when is affect telling you something is wrong with the world, and when is it telling you that there's something wrong with your physical state that you need to attend to?[2:25:38] Andrew Huberman: I think everything to me at least starts with a good night's sleep on a consistent basis. And and every psychiatric challenge And indeed, suicide itself, is seems to be associated with and often preceded by challenges in sleeping. Oh. Changes in in in circadian rhythm. So I think, that's why, to me, sleep is the foundation of mental health and physical health.[2:26:02] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yep. Absolutely. And so when I tell people when they say, well, what can I do? I was like, well, if there's only if there's only one thing that you could pick, I would say get get a good night's sleep on a regular basis. If you could pick 2 more, I would say eat healthfully.[2:26:14] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Like, stop eating pseudo food. Don't get me wrong. Like, I love French fries. I love French fries. They're like, that's, like, God's most perfect food.[2:26:21] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I mean, really. But eat healthily, like, eat real food, and get exercise. And if you do those 3 things, I know I sound like a mother and so feel free to roll your eyes at me. But as a neuroscientist, those are the actually, Before you start with all the, you know, mentalizing Jedi tricks, you could just start with this, and that would actually take you pretty far.[2:26:45] Andrew Huberman: And and, and that will resonate very well with our audience. The basics of sleep, Exercise, food, sunlight, and social connection are the ones that we just and because those 5 are the ones that that we just keep returning to over and over again. Yeah. And I think People will say, oh, it's just simple, motherly advice, but I would I think that those 5 things, even just the one thing around sleep. Yeah.[2:27:11] Andrew Huberman: There's some work that's required to get that done, so it's not as simple. The categories are simple. Mhmm. But the work that's required to Get great sleep as often as one can on a consistent basis if you're raising kids, have a career For sure. Live in the world.[2:27:26] Andrew Huberman: There's a lot there, and so that's where I think there's there's a there's an elaboration of of things. And one needs to learn to be be flexible. Like, when you're traveling, how do you do that? When, You know, friends are visiting. How do you do that when weather's off and and so on?[2:27:39] Andrew Huberman: The the relationship piece is something[2:27:41] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: just gonna was just gonna say I'm so glad you mentioned that.[2:27:43] Andrew Huberman: I'm[2:27:43] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: so glad you mentioned[2:27:44] Andrew Huberman: that. You said before, and and this was another one of those moments I listened to you I've listened to as many of your podcasts as I possibly but it is I think it was the 1st or the 2nd one with Lex Fridman, where you said, you know, we are regulating each other's nervous systems. I will never forget that. And, you know, I imagine that you married your husband for a number of different reasons, but When people pair up with romantic partners, with friends, with coworkers, the ideal situation is one in which We are not taxed where maybe even people and just being around them or just knowing that they are in our lives It provides a sort of deposit to[2:28:26] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah. It's a savings. It provides savings. For sure.[2:28:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And then I think that's a lot of what emotional resonance To put kind of pop language on it[2:28:33] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah.[2:28:34] Andrew Huberman: Is is all about who who feels good to be around, who doesn't feel good to be around.[2:28:38] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: I would say The best thing for a human nervous system is another human, and the worst thing for a human nervous system is also another human. And so you really wanna be around the people who make you the best the best version of yourself that you could be, and That doesn't mean that you always get a savings. Like, sometimes you're sometimes you're taking care of that person, and so you're you're absorbing some of the They're burden, right, and vice versa. But I would say the research on, Social isolation and loneliness and so on shows us that, you know well, along with research on synchrony, and there's just a whole bunch of research to to suggest that, we are the caretakers of each other's nervous systems, and it doesn't matter what your opinion is. Like, it doesn't you know, it just but We just that's how we evolved as a species, and so you get to decide what kind of a person are you gonna be.[2:29:37] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know? Are you gonna be, are you gonna be a savings, or are you gonna be a tax?[2:29:43] Andrew Huberman: And in general, it seems that people who decide that they're going to be a savings tend to because people gravitate towards that and want more of that Yeah. And hopefully would provide that also. I mean, I think the reciprocity piece here feels really, Really strong.[2:29:58] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Well, that's a really interesting thing about, about the synchrony work. Right? So there's work that if you research that if you put people together who don't even know each other, but if they If they like each other and they they have a sense of trust even after a couple of minutes, they start to synchronize their physical signals. Their heart rate starts to synchronize. Their movements start to synchronize.[2:30:16] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Their heart rate probably synchronizes because their breathing starts to synchronize. Right? And it's really interesting to see what you what you typically see is that Who is pacing and who is leading? Like, 1 person is the leader, and then the other person is the pacer. And I got that language from when I learned hypnosis, by the way.[2:30:34] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: And, but it switches back and forth, like, who's the leader? Like, in a in a good in a in a what we say good. Like, in a in an interaction that looks productive, It it's switching all the time who is who is pacing and who is leading. It's not that always 1 person is Is, is in charge, so to speak, physiologically speaking.[2:30:55] Andrew Huberman: We did a series recently on mental health with Paul Contee who's a, psychiatrist and the the word narcissism came up a few times because people have a lot of questions about that. And, you know, and he, Emphasize that narcissists are not confident. They they operate from a place of of a deficit of pleasure. It's never enough and an intense envy. Although that's not how they present and they're often Usually not aware of it themselves, but it's what leads healthy people to feel as if the interactions with those people, narcissists, often can be Very compelling in the moment, but they feel very taxed afterwards and kind of confused by what happened.[2:31:30] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Yeah.[2:31:31] Andrew Huberman: And it sounds like it, ties back to this lack of synchrony. On the positive side of things, it's also clear from what you just said that When people regulate each other's nervous systems in a way where people are making little deposits and providing savings for each other or maybe things are just neutral that, those nervous systems are then in a position to, like, pay attention to other things too and and and not just try and work out the dynamics.[2:31:59] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Oh, for sure. Oh, and that's very true at work. So there's research showing that, especially in the creativity, you know, sector, innovation sector of the economy, the best predictor of performance on the job is the extent to which people feel I mean, after you account for sleep and And, you know, watering and sleeping and feeding. Right? Like, the that, the best predictor is the amount of trust that you have in your team and in your managers.[2:32:27] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Because if the world is predictable, it could still be things could be hard. Even when things are unpredictable, you have people, you know, who have your back. And so, basically, what you're doing is you're you're, They're making, you know, deposits or savings. They're causing savings in each other's body budgets, so their their resources can be spent on the harder things, which is, you know, Failing and, you know, calling having to pick yourself back up and try again, which is, you know, partly what you do when you're an innovator. So I think that there's also research to show that in your personal life, when you do random acts of kindness for people or when you're kind In general, you derive also a body budgeting benefit from that.[2:33:14] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: You know, so For a while, I had a friend who, we would meet each other for lunch once a month, and, you know, we would take turns paying. I mean, we could both Pay for ourselves, but we kinda got a double hit. You know? He paid for me 1 month, and then I would pay for him 1 month. And then you know?[2:33:32] Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: So We get the double hit of, you know, being kind to someone else and, you know, and also they got the, You know, benefit of someone being kind to them. And I'll just say, I think kindness is a I don't know that we have so many conversations about that in our culture right now, But I think kindness is very, very underrated and should be you know, like, when I'm when my when I feel like shit, I Baked bread for my neighbor who's in his seventies. Him and his wife. That's what I do when I You know, when I'm not feeling good and, you know, if I I mean, after I've taken care of the physical the possible, physical causes.
