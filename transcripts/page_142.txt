I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Susanna Soberg. Doctor Susanna Sobegh completed her doctoral thesis work at the Center of Inflammation and Metabolism and the Center for Physical Activity Research At the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Her research has focused on how deliberate cold exposure and deliberate heat exposure can be used to enhance human metabolism.[0:00:35] Andrew Huberman: She is the 1st author of a seminal study which discovered the minimum thresholds for deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure For increasing brown fat thermogenesis, which is essentially a mode of increasing heat production and metabolism in the body, and for establishing actionable protocols that can be used outside of the laboratory to improve metabolism and human health. Doctor Soper's research was published in the journal Cell reports metabolism in 2021 adding to a long and important history of research focusing on the role of cold and the role of heat In altering various aspects of the body's physiology, including hormone health, metabolism, and changes in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and epinephrine. In fact, today's discussion with doctor Soberg focuses on the role of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure on metabolism, but it also includes discussion of the effects of cold and heat on things like neurotransmitter production, namely dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine, the so called catecholamines, which strongly impact mood and metabolism. In addition, doctor Sobegh answers many common questions about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure, including, for instance, the difference between cold showers versus cold immersion up to the neck versus total body cold immersion, including whether or not going back and forth between heat and cold changes fundamentally the way that heat and cold impact metabolism, hormones, and neurotransmitter production.[0:02:00] Andrew Huberman: And we talk about almost every single nuance and variation on deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure protocols As it relates to the underlying science, in particular, how cold receptors at the level of the skin are impacted versus Cold reception and perception at the level of the brain and how all of that impacts systems of the brain and body relating to mental health, physical health, and performance. Based on her scientific research and academic training, as well as her understanding and use of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure protocols, Doctor Soberg is considered one of the world's leading experts on these topics. In fact, she is the author of a recent book entitled Winter Swimming, which is, I have to say a terrific book because it breaks down chapter by chapter the different aspects of deliberate heat and deliberate cold into its various constituent parts, including cold acclimatization, the cold shock response, dangers and safeties of cold water, The impact of cold and the impact of heat on various aspects of human health as well as specifics relating to Sauna versus ice versus cold swimming, showers, etcetera. It's a very thorough read and a very easy and accessible read That if you are interested in deliberate cold or deliberate heat exposure or both, we'll allow you to embrace those protocols with the greatest degree of confidence You're going to obtain the specific endpoints that you're interested in and to do so safely.[0:03:24] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Plunge. Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile At home self cooling cold plunge for deliberate cold exposure.[0:03:48] Andrew Huberman: I've talked numerous times on this podcast about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure. And indeed, today's episode is focused entirely on the benefits and the science of deliberate cold exposure. Plunge uses a powerful cooling filtration and sanitation unit to give you access to deliberate cold exposure in clean water whenever you want. As we'll discuss during today's episode with doctor Susanna Soberg, Deliberate cold exposure, especially deliberate cold exposure done up to the neck in water, can be used to achieve a number of important endpoints related to mental health, physical health, and performance. I've been using a plunge for more than 2 years now.[0:04:22] Andrew Huberman: I can tell you that it makes it very easy to get your deliberate cold exposure at home. It doesn't require much cleaning. In fact, it's very easy to keep clean, which is essential. You don't want bacteria and other things growing in your cold plunge. Basically, everything about the plunge is made easy so that anyone, including myself, can gather deliberate cold exposure on a regular basis at home.[0:04:41] Andrew Huberman: If you're interested in getting a plunge, you can go to plunge, Spelledplunge.com/huberman and get $150 off your cold plunge. Again, that's plunge.com/huberman for a $150 Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison, which I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available. Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA certified wild harvesting system to help balance deer populations on the island of Maui. The solution they built turns the proliferation of an invasive species into a wide range of nutrients dense products from butcher cuts and organ meats To bone broth and turkey. Their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams of protein per 100 calories.[0:05:22] Andrew Huberman: Several guests on this podcast who are experts in Nutrition have pointed to the value of getting at least 1 gram of quality protein per pound of body weight each day. With Maui Nui, that's very easy to do while eating delicious meals and getting it from a sustainable source. If you would like to try Maui Nui Venison, go to Maui Nui Venison com/huberman and get 20% off your first order. Again, that's Maui Nui Venison .com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.[0:05:50] Andrew Huberman: Thesis makes custom nootropics, and nootropics is not a word that I like because it means smart drugs. And the brain doesn't have neural circuits for being smart, rather has neural circuits for focus, neural circuits for task switching, neural circuits for creativity, and on and on. Thesis understands this and designs custom nootropics designed to get your brain and body into a specific state in order to do the mental and or physical work that's important to you, such as creativity or focus or clarity. If you'd like to try Thesis Nootropics, you simply go to their website, you fill out a brief quiz, and they will design A custom starter pack so that you can assess which things work for you more or less well, and then they'll iterate with you over the course of the next few weeks or months to come up with the ideal nootropic kit for your needs. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to take thesis.com/huberman.[0:06:38] Andrew Huberman: You can take that 3 minute quiz, they'll send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month.

The 1st live event will take place in Toronto on September 12th. The 2nd live event will take place in Chicago on September 28th.[0:07:02] Andrew Huberman: Both live events will include a lecture and a question and answer period and are entitled the Brain Body Contract, during which I will discuss tools and science related to mental health, physical health, and performance. And I should mention that a lot of that content We'll have absolutely no overlap with content covered previously on the Huberman Lab Podcast or elsewhere.

Once again, that's hubermanlab.com/tour, And use the code Huberman to access tickets. I hope to see you there.[0:07:36] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Susanna Soberg. Doctor Susanna Soberg, welcome.[0:07:42] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Thank you.[0:07:43] Andrew Huberman: So great to have you here. I feel like I should give a little bit of the backstory of how we got connected, which was that for Many years, I've been interested in cold thermogenesis. It was the topic of my senior's thesis in college, and I've, of course, followed the, popularity of Wim Hof, and we've had doctor Craig Heller, my colleague From biology department at Stanford who works on cold and its impact on physiology and sports performance. So for a long time, I've been interested in this area, But there's been a real, lack of new, let's say, high profile quality scientific information in terms of How, for instance, cold plunges and sauna, how that impacts human physiology. I know there's been some information out there, but it's been sort of scattered.[0:08:33] Andrew Huberman: And then a little over a year ago, I see this paper in Cell Reports Medicine and was immediately struck, the First of all, the fact that it was in Cell Reports Medicine. I've been on the Cell Press editorial board for a long time now. Cell Press Journals are, of course, phenomenal journals. And the title and the content of the paper was directly in line with the sorts of practices that people are very curious about and then are starting to emerge, things Sauna, cold plunges, and there was your name first on the author list. And I reached out to you through social media, and we've done a little bit of live content there together, and I've been tracking what you've been doing in the world in terms of your book and talking about the results in your manuscript and talking about the science and impact of deliberate cold exposure and sauna.[0:09:21] Andrew Huberman: And I have to say that it's been a wonderful and remarkable thing to see, And you're bringing so much quality information about this area that for a long time, I think, was kind of niche and is now becoming more and more mainstream. So gonna start off with a thank you for being here and a thank you for the work that you've done, and I'm looking forward to talking to you about it today. So My first question, to get things started is, what is happening when we get into an uncomfortably cold environment? So for instance, if I'm really hot on a hot day, jumping into a cold pool feels really good. But if I'm already kind of, at room temperature, I'm a little bit chilly.[0:10:03] Andrew Huberman: Getting into that same temperature of water doesn't feel so good. Right? There's a shock there. So if you could just walk us through what happens when we get into uncomfortably cold water, whether or not it's by way of shower or cold plunge At the level of our physiology, and if you'd like our psychology, I think that's a good place for us to start because I think it will orient people to their own experience if they do that. Yeah.[0:10:24] Andrew Huberman: And for those that haven't done it, might start to peel back some of the the layers as to what the underlying mechanisms of cold are.[0:10:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. You for that question. It's really good to just address what actually happens in our physiology when we get cold. And you can get cold in many ways. So you can Just head out for the one that gives you the most potent stressor, which is submerging into cold water.[0:10:48] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And but you could also go in outside in the cold wind. That's also gonna activate your, your sympathetic nervous system. So get all these neurotransmitter going in your body and so your your Catecholamines. Let's just address that we are taking a cold plunge, for example. So if you are very hot, For example, before you go into the cold water, it's gonna feel less it's gonna feel less stressful, but the the temperature, difference from your skin to the Cold is definitely gonna give you a a shock, but your core temperature is warmer, and that's gonna feel a little bit better.[0:11:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So that's why when people go into Sauna, for example, and go out and in into the cold water, they they they can do it easily, easier Then if they were cold beforehand.[0:11:35] Andrew Huberman: Could I just, ask you a few questions? So you you mentioned the sympathetic nervous system, which for, people listening who aren't familiar with that, is the The branch of our nervous system that's responsible for creating accelerations in heart rate, feelings of alertness, it's accompanied with stress and the stress response, but it's accompanied with waking up in the morning for that matter. So it's not always about stress. And then you mentioned the catecholamines, which, are dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. So maybe a little bit later, we'll talk about those individual neurotransmitters.[0:12:05] Andrew Huberman: But you raise a really important point, which is Something I get asked about a lot for people that are curious about using deliberate cold exposure, which is how cold should the water be. And I know it's very hard to give a straight prescription for that because I think it boils down to what you just said, which is it's really the difference between your current temperature and, really, the temperature of the surface of your skin and the temperature of the water. So if you're very warm, getting into cold feels good. If you're already cold, getting into more cold feels Stressful. Is there any way that we can start to gauge what is the best way to approach a deliberate cold exposure Protocol, I mean, should it feel uncomfortable?[0:12:47] Andrew Huberman: And that leads into the question of how do we balance the discomfort with the amount of time that we spend in. So for instance, if it's just a little bit uncomfortable, will spending more time in the cold get us the same benefit as getting into very uncomfortably cold water for a very short period of time?[0:13:02] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. That is really good question. And I definitely think that this could be, future studies on this as well to really unravel, what kind of protocols are the are the best way or also for which outcomes, of course? So if the temperature is, very cold and you feel that and you also feel very cold, then you you should stay in the water a little bit longer. So I think it's just You should get uncomfortable cold.[0:13:28] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So as long as you get uncomfortable cold, it's cold enough, and you get this, what we call, the cold shock. So the cold suck is activation of your Sympathetic nervous system and these activation of the the catecholamines, which you just mentioned before.[0:13:42] Andrew Huberman: Does the shock mean that I'm having trouble controlling my breathing? Is that a Good gauge?[0:13:47] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. You can say so because that's kinda like how we define it. So you hyperventilate, so you have a Faster, breathing rate. So that increases also because you activate your gasping reflex if you are new to this. But if you are adapted, it it kind of subsides with time and with adaptation.[0:14:08] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So what you can do is that you can train this cold exposure, and you can kinda, like, get adapted to it so you don't have this hyperventilating response every time you go out in the cold water. So this is like Building up your resilience, building building up your adaptation is gonna make this shock, like, subside a bit. So it's It's always harder in the beginning, but you should do hard things. Right? It's not something that we you shouldn't think about cold water and cold water immersion as something that is Comfortable.[0:14:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It should be hard because that's the point of it. Right? If you enjoy it, then, yeah, then I'm I'm thinking something is wrong. It's not right. You should not enjoy it.[0:14:47] Andrew Huberman: Well, this is an important point that you're making because I think that many people shy away from deliberate cold exposure because it's uncomfortable in a way that, at least from my experience, is very different than the discomfort of exercise. Because with exercise, for instance, if Running you know, running fast and breathing hard is uncomfortable. You can slow down or walk. If, you know, lifting weights is uncomfortable, you can Remove some weight or reduce the number of repetitions or stop. With deliberate cold exposure, I suppose you can be Sort of halfway in, halfway out of the water or partially underneath the cold shower, but it's very hard to titrate Mhmm.[0:15:27] Andrew Huberman: And adjust the level To it's kind of all or none, and I've seen, I should just I can tell this by anecdote. I I've done some work with military special operations. I won't say which country. This was outside the US. And these are very tough individuals.[0:15:43] Andrew Huberman: They're used to going without Sleep and doing hard, high consequence, high risk kind of work. And they were asked to do some cold water exposure Training, and I was there that day, and it was remarkable. About a third of them just went straight in and just kind of grinded through it. You know? Like, they looked stoic anyway to me.[0:16:03] Andrew Huberman: There were a few whimpers, no cries. About a 3rd Talked a lot and got really you could tell that they were agitated and anxious, but they made it through. And then about a third of them just simply would not get in past their knees or thighs. Were just it seemed like they were just dreading the whole experience. Some actually didn't actually go in completely, which was really surprising to me, and that you couldn't tell based on their physical appearance or anything else about them.[0:16:30] Andrew Huberman: They're all high performers as to who would have this response. So it seems like people vary tremendously in terms of Their ability to embrace the discomfort of the cold, is that from your studies, is that your experience as well, or or are there these weird mutants who seem to just love going into the cold for the 1st time.[0:16:47] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So some people just feel better in the cold, and some people dread the cold even more. And you can say the more people are pushing the cold away, they might feel the cold pain even more. So they they they would definitely People who are maybe the soldiers you you just talked about, they some of them might be already adapted to the goal cold. So if they are not scared of the cold, They go out and they embrace the cold in a better way. It could also be that some people have a more sensitive nervous system.[0:17:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And when you are a bit sensitive To the cold, you will, of course, try to get away from it. Right? And you will also have the co pain more, feel the co pain more if the if If you avoid it. So the more you avoid the cold, the the more pain painful it will feel, when you go into it. So yeah.[0:17:38] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned being outside in a T shirt versus, cold immersion up to the neck versus shower. I think, this is something a lot of people wonder about. What are the differences in terms of impact, short term and perhaps even long term, between cold showers, Cold plunge to the neck, so that could be an ice water or just very cold water. Immersion with Dunking one's head and then coming up, because, obviously, people have to come up for air at some point, and then simply being outside on a cold day In shorts and a T shirt or something of that sort.[0:18:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So there are different outcomes, because they're they are very different exposures of the cold to your cold receptors in your skin. So the more you can say you cover your body in the cold, which you would do in cold water Because they're, of course, covered totally and and and the molecules are closer to your skin, you will have a more potent, activation of all your code, receptors in the skin. So that one will definitely activate your enormous nervous system more and rapid, compared to going out in a T shirt, in the cold wind, just go for a walk. But That is also something that's gonna activate your, sympathetic nervous system, meaning them that you have an increase in norepinephrine, and you will activate something called, the the brown fat. So this is a healthy kind of, fat tissue that we have in our body.[0:19:07] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And when you activate that, That's gonna, increase your metabolism.[0:19:11] Andrew Huberman: Before we talk about brown fat, and I'm so glad you brought it up, because it's so much to talk about there. What about cold shower? I mean, obviously, cold shower is somewhere in between Yeah. Being out outside in the air, cold air versus, being immersed up to the neck.[0:19:27] Dr. Susanna Søberg: If we had more studies on on cold showers, we would learn more about how does that activate metabolism, how does that increase our neurotransmitters in the brain, which could also have an impact our on our mental balance? So I think that will be interesting for the future. But what we do know is from from, from brown fat and, both from rodent study studies, but also in in humans, is that as soon as we get cold on our skin, We will activate our brown fat. So it is kinda like our 1st responder in in the body to keep, our, temperature up. So our muscles is like a second tissue in our body.[0:20:08] Dr. Susanna Søberg: We have 2 tissues which can increase our, Thermogenesis. So the brown fat, which is, like, always, like, temperature regulating our body, and then we have, The the muscles, which will secondarily start to shiver, and that's gonna increase our, temperature in the body. Well, as soon as you go into a cold shower, you will activate your brown fat, also immediately. So it could be good also for increased metabolism in theory because haven't really any studies showing how much does actually activate the brown fat. So if someone out there wants To do a study.[0:20:42] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I think right?[0:20:43] Andrew Huberman: I thought about why there are fewer studies of cold showers than cold immersion, and I think the answer to my mind is that From a methodological standpoint, it's just harder to do because if people are getting into cold water up to the neck, They're getting into cold water up to the neck. Whereas if people are getting into a cold shower, some people are larger or smaller, some people are gonna stand under the shower With it hitting their head, some people at the back of their neck, you could direct people to do it. Yeah. But it's a little bit, more difficult. Also, I think, for you and I are both research scientists.[0:21:14] Andrew Huberman: There's a little bit of a, methodological challenge that might seem silly to people, but it's a real one, which is if people are in a cold shower, also, the water is going to be kinda pushing their clothing against their skin. There's a certain vulnerability in, for most people, coming to a laboratory in the 1st place, let alone being observed while they shower. Yeah. Whereas when you get into cold emerge in cold immersion, you know, you're getting under the water. And, you know, some people might roll their eyes and say, okay.[0:21:39] Andrew Huberman: Really? Is that the barrier? But, know, science exists in these real world contexts, and this will vary by culture and things of that sort. But we run human subjects in my lab, and I'll tell you just, the process of getting people to the laboratory and having them park and find the lab and, you know, it's a whole new environment with people in lab coats and people moving around and where's the restroom? I mean, a there's a certain amount of stress just associated with taking part in a study for most human subjects.[0:22:02] Andrew Huberman: So, I, totally agree. However, we need more studies of of cold showers. It's just a harder environment to control in in my in my mind. So it sounds like any form of cold to the skin that people register as what you called a cold shock or uncomfortable, like, like, this is kind of, jarring, activates the brown fat. Do we know what the pathway is from cold receptors on the skin to the brown fat?[0:22:29] Andrew Huberman: I mean, how does the brown fat know that we're cold?[0:22:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Really good question. And it seems that I I think that, of course, in the future, we will know much more about these pathways. But what we do know is that, the co receptors will send to our temperature regulating center in in the brain, so hypothalamus, and that's gonna be, taking in this message. We have so many co receptors in the skin, so it's gonna be very fast as you can say if you immerse the body into cold water, this is gonna be so rapid.[0:23:00] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So it will have a rapid increase in neurotransmitters in the brain to noradrenaline, adrenaline and cortisol and, which is not that much, but it's But it's still there. So you have this increase in, noradrenaline, which will then immediately activate the brown fat, because the you can say the activator is the most potent one, cold and noradrenaline, that's gonna activate the brown fat. But there's also a direct pathway from the co receptors in the skin to the to the brown fat, which really shows that if because of these different pathways, it shows that that It could be that this tissue to keep us warm was was developed in in our evolvement, as humans To keep us warm and to save us whenever the temperature on our skin varies just a little bit to keep us in that right homeostatic balance So we don't get hypothermic, but also so we don't get hyperthermic. But because it seems that the brown fat is also activated when we get Warmer in our skin. So it is also, maybe a temperature regulator in our in our body, but the pathway is is different.[0:24:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I think it's also 3rd pathway from directly from the mussels. So the brown fat is also activated, even though the the mussels are starting to shiver. So there's a an extra pathway that way to keep our, our temperature up so muscles and brown fat are working together to to keep us warm so we don't, suffer too much in the in the cold water.[0:24:33] Andrew Huberman: That's super interesting. And what I hear you pointing to is the existence of 3 parallel pathways. And this notion of parallel pathways comes up over and over again in biology as you and I know, and, and I think it's important for people to know about because, as you said so so eloquently, the when something is very important to our survival or and or evolution, The brain and body, install multiple mechanisms for it, not just 1, and, and so it sounds like it's cold skin. Cold on the skin triggers an a response in the hypothalamus, which then activates brown fat, cold receptors in the skin directly to the brown fat, And then shivering in the muscle to the brown fat. I wanna talk about brown fat in-depth and learn from You more about brown fat.[0:25:22] Andrew Huberman: Before that, however, I wanna ask about shiver. I've heard that shiver Causes the release of succinate, which then activates the brown fat. Is it known whether or not Inducing shiver is important. And when should pea people shiver? I mean, I've gotten into cold plunges and shivered while I was in there, and then I've also had the experience of getting into a cold plunge or a cold shower then getting out, or even standing outside on a warm day after swimming in a pool and then starting to shiver.[0:25:55] Andrew Huberman: The shiver comes later. So how important is shiver, and does it matter when shiver happens?[0:26:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Well, shivering is is good Because that increases your metabolism, and that's gonna burn some calories in your body. You shouldn't be so afraid of shivering, I think, because the shivering, as long as you don't get too hypothermic, thermos so if you don't if you don't sit in the cold water for too long, and what you just said by shivering after you get up, that is because of the after drop. Something called the after drop is when your cold temperature, decreases even after you get out of the cold water. And it always does that, your body, because it as soon as you get into the cold water, all the, your blood vessels is gonna constrict Because you need to keep your blood in your core and and keep your, vital organs warm.[0:26:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So as soon as you get up, that Those blood vessel will open again, and the warm blood would flow out and get colder and then flow back again into the core. And that's gonna decrease the temperature in your core, of course.[0:26:56] Andrew Huberman: So that's the drop.[0:26:57] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So that's the drop.[0:26:58] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Oh, I'm so glad you explained that. I've heard, years ago, Wim Hof, I heard him talk about the drop, and I've heard colleagues of mine talk about the drop. That's the 1st time I've ever heard it explained clearly. They may let me make sure I understand this.[0:27:10] Andrew Huberman: So, I get into cold water. Obviously, I'm cold. Vessels constrict to keep blood near the center of my body, keep me alive. I get out. The warming up of my body allows those vessels and capillaries to dilate again.[0:27:26] Andrew Huberman: The blood goes out to the surface, but the surface is still cold. And so that blood is cooled, and then my core body temperature drops. And that's what you're referring to as the drop, and that's what induces shiver.[0:27:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Exactly.[0:27:38] Andrew Huberman: Great. And then Am I right in thinking that then the shiver activates brown fat, which then warms me up again?[0:27:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yes.[0:27:44] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[0:27:45] Dr. Susanna Søberg: That's why you should end on the cold. We could get back to that. Yeah.[0:27:48] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about yes. Ending on cold is, you know, it's what I refer to as and what has now become known as the Soborg principle, which is, a really important principle about the importance of ending on cold, and not doing what I do, which is to get into a hot shower or or back in the sun, but we'll we'll get back to that in a in a few minutes. So, that's wonderful that you can explain that so clearly because I think that shiver is something that a lot of people do avoid. People then go, I don't want the, you know, the chattering of the teeth. And Yeah.[0:28:19] Andrew Huberman: And it it feels like a loss of bodily control, which really it is. It's it's an autonomic response.[0:28:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. But I don't think that people should should avoid it that much. It's just like seeing shivering as a way of your body in a in a like, it's Training. It's training for your for all your cells. It's training for your muscles.[0:28:36] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It's training up your metabolism, and that's gonna increase your what's called the insulin sensitivity. So if you can, like, in your mind, get used to the thought of shivering is just like when you go exercising in the training center and get that feeling of like, oh, this is tough. Now it hurts a little bit. Yeah. It's gonna hurt because that's what shivering also does, but it's just a different way of Training your cells in your body, it's gonna create what is healthy stress.[0:29:02] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It's called homeesis in the cells. And the more you expose your your muscle cells or your brown fat cells So these kind of, like, healthy stresses, exercise, cold, heat exposure, it's gonna make them, better at, like, activating and also, at keeping you healthy. So as long as the the cells get exposed to this, it it's gonna keep them on its toes, you can say, because it becomes more robust, increasing yeast, heat shock proteins, and cold shock proteins in the cells to, make you more robust for the next time. And that is also what happens when you go to the training center. And I keep, like, do drawing that parallel because people today know more about we know more about exercise And what that's, is is gonna do to your muscle cells, and but the same kind of, like, training is also what you do when you go out and and into the cold water and submerge into cold water because that is just, your cold training center, you can say that, and and also your heat training center going into the sauna because cells are getting stronger with hermetic stress, so it's the same process, just different praxis.[0:30:11] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. I'm so glad that you brought up the fact that the Discomfort or the embarrassment or both of shiver is still crucial to, actually to reach for and try and experience the same way that with exercise. I think a lot of people don't realize this, but when we did our series with doctor Andy Galpin, it became clear to me what should have already been clear to me, and I think that most people don't realize, which is that If we were to measure, heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones, and inflammation in a human being during exercise, It would look as if they were ready to die. Blood pressure would be high. Inflammation is through the roof, but all of that is setting in motion an adaptation or set of adaptations that allow blood pressure to be lower at rest, that allow, inflammation markers to be lower at rest, all the things that everybody is seeking with In in addition to, of course, the aesthetic changes that people are seeking with exercise.[0:31:05] Andrew Huberman: Sounds like the exact same things are happening with the cold. So, the redundant message here seems to be that The more discomfort provided it's done safely, just like with exercise, the more shivering, The, the more cold shock provided it's not to the extreme and stop somebody's heart. Right? We can talk about thresholds for that a little bit later. It sounds like all of that is going to set in motion some long term changes that will make people feel better and will improve health.[0:31:34] Andrew Huberman: Could you just touch on a few of the Longer term changes that are known to occur. I mean, I'm well aware of the study showing that, I think it was European Journal of Physiology. It was, the European Journal of Physiology showing long lasting increases in catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and, epinephrine for many hours after deliberate cold exposure. What are some of the other things that happen at the level of metabolism and brown fat In, let's say, the hours and, day after a deliberate cold exposure.[0:32:05] Dr. Susanna Søberg: As soon as you go in, of course, there's an activation. But it seems like no. You're asking for the the later outcomes like blood pressure and stuff like that. Is that what you mean?[0:32:13] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Blood pressure, but also in terms of metabolism. I know that, in your study, you should and we'll talk about brown fat in-depth here in a moment, but Yeah. That there were changes to the brown fat that equate to changes in, for instance, people's ability to be comfortable in colder environments when they're not doing deliberate cold exposure[0:32:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[0:32:32] Andrew Huberman: Or in the same way that I can, exercise on an exercise bike or go out for a hard run, but then if I go hiking, with the family on Sunday and where it's a steep climb, I could do that steep climb more easily because I'm, quote, unquote, fit a consequence of the of the exercise, what are so or, what are some of the fitness adaptations of deliberate cold exposure?[0:32:51] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. So what happens is that you you get adapted a little bit every time you go. So you will, like exercise, get a little bit Stronger. So every time you go into the cold water, for every time you will be more exposed to it, you will you feel more comfortable in the cold. So you were gonna you're gonna build your which happens on a metabolic level, which is gonna be the brown fat.[0:33:13] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So we'll have more activation of your brown fat. The mitochondria in the the brown fat cells are gonna be, you have more of those, and they will be more efficient at heating you up because it expects the body expects you to to do this again, so you are prepared in a way. The capillaries in your skin is also be will also become better at, like, constricting, so you will have a better shield of your body to, prepare you for the next time. So you will be become better at, going into the cold water in that way. So the the body Makes this mechanism changes your body in a way so you can expose yourself to the next time.[0:33:51] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Right? And, and, also, you will have, also, Your, stress response will also be, subside a bit, so you will have a less increase of your, catecholamines, with time. With time also, you have because of this activation of your, brown fat or your muscles, you have an increase in, in in your metabolism, which will then make your insulin sensitivity better. And this is shown in in studies. For example, there was this interesting study I found just before I I started my PhD, which was from, Giberst Stomer, et al from 2016, Where they measured, metabolism, not in or not on brown fat, but they measured insulin sensitivity in Middle aged men and women, during 1 winter swimming season.[0:34:43] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So they were not very young like they were in my study, but they were they were Middle aged, and I think this is very interesting. So they during these 4, 5 months, they were winter swimming. They saw that they had a lower blood pressure after the season, And they had a lower heart rate, and they also saw that they have a better insulin sensitivity. And I think that is very interesting because if you can Have a better insulin sensitivity. You can prevent lifestyle diseases.[0:35:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So, and with lower blood pressure, which is a very strong outcome also for selling how much inflammation you have in the body. And because it didn't measure, brown fat, I figured that It could be that was the missing link. That was the one of the explanations to why we see this, less inflammation in the body. So, the longer outcomes so the long term outcomes could be that you lower your blood pressure and have a lower heart rate. You also, have a better insulin sensitivity and a better glucose balance, but that was shown it that is shown in my study.[0:35:48] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:36:16] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, And they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you year's supply of vitamin d 3 k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:37:03] Andrew Huberman: We'll get back to the, insulin sensitivity and glucose balance. That's a an an impressive list of benefits. You know, blood pressure, Of course, most people are aware of blood pressure and what it is. It's what they measure when we go to the doctor, and, it's not very sexy nowadays. You know, blood pressure, people, you know, blood pressure.[0:37:21] Andrew Huberman: It's not you know, people wanna hear about the inflammatome and the microbiome, and all of that stuff is really interesting. But, I think that blood pressure doesn't get enough Attention. And we have spoken to, on this podcast, to doctor Peter Attia who, is an expert in longevity and health span and things of that sort. And and I was surprised to learn, again, I shouldn't have been surprised, that the number one reason people die Worldwide is cerebrovascular disease and cardiovascular disease, and there are basically 3 things on the list of things to address. One is not smoking Mhmm.[0:37:57] Andrew Huberman: Or vaping, by the way. Not so many good there are a few other things related to blood markers, APOB and things of that sort, But then the big one is blood pressure. And so it's it's interesting because we don't think about blood pressure that much anymore, as a as the kind of People interested in health optimization and health, but blood pressure is so vital to control. So it's wonderful to hear that deliberate cold exposure is one way to control blood pressure. I'm guessing in concert with other forms of exercise.[0:38:25] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Let's talk about brown fat. And, if you'd if you're willing, I'd love to drill into brown fat at a at a deep level. Again, my understanding of this is is far more elementary than yours, obviously. You're the expert.[0:38:42] Andrew Huberman: My understanding about brown fat is that it's located in specific areas of our body, maybe more widespread than when I learned in school. I thought it was, I was taught it was just at the clavicles in the back of the neck and upper back, but who knows? I learned that there's more of it when we're children, maybe more distributed throughout our body, and that it's rich in mitochondria. But what is so special about the brown fat? Like, what if we could just go into the biology of brown fat a little bit, what does it look like?[0:39:11] Andrew Huberman: You've measured it in human subjects. Where is it distributed really? Can it expand its distribution? Can we Activate and expand the amount of brown fat as adults. And, for those of you that are cringing already thinking we're talking about Getting fatter, it's quite the opposite.[0:39:28] Andrew Huberman: We're talking about not subcutaneous fat, but fat located around the the organs. But please educate me, tell me where I'm wrong, and, Expand my knowledge on brown fat.[0:39:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Okay. Yeah. You are not wrong, but, it's definite it's true that there are more locations, of the brown fat than we previously thought. There's this very nice study from 2017 by Leitner et al, Well, they had made these capacities, overlays of, their subjects, but you could see where in the body do we have brown fat And where can we grow more brown fat, so to say? So the brown fat is can is very so it means that it can it can grow and it can decrease.[0:40:12] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And this is proven in in studies where we have seen, People with a failed cryocytoma is like a very specific cancer type where peep where from the seventies, where we can see that If they have this specific kind of cancer type, they have a they have this tumor on their adrenal gland, so they have, like, an Huge increase in noradrenaline. And because of that, they have this continuous activation of the brown fat. And they have grown a lot of brown fat in The whole body, abdominal, where it's located in these 6 different places, but it is less like very much compared to, like, normal people. And what they then see, what we learned from this study is that brown fat can apparently grow if you have, an increase in noradrenaline in the body. It's not like you want that because when that happens, you have a high blood pressure.[0:41:08] Dr. Susanna Søberg: You don't want it chronically. Right? You you just want it on, Like, a short amount of time, and then it can grow for a bit, but you don't want it chronically. Of course not. But because it it activates also your sympathetic nervous system.[0:41:19] Dr. Susanna Søberg: They have also showed they had high blood pressure. They had, they lost a lot of weight, of course, because this is activating your metabolism. So they they found luckily that when they removed this benign tumor, that, The brown fat, decreases again to normal size, and they gain weight again, and they had normal blood pressure. So The story ends well, but this is kinda like proof of concept of the brown fat can actually grow. So it's plastic in its in its way of, like it can it grow and it could decrease again.[0:41:53] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So that's very good. Good studies to to see what what the body is capable of. But we don't, of course, want all that brown fat. We just want it to be, we just want to keep it, actually, and and keep it activated. Because what we see in studies is also that after the age of 40, people, studies have shown that there is an association with having less brown fat but increase obesity.[0:42:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So, of course, we we don't know yet whether, brown fat decreases with a's, and therefore, we get obese or we get obese, and therefore, we have less brown fat. But as brown fat is an insulin sensitive organ in our body, And we get obese, just like the muscles get less sensitive, insulin sensitive. The brown fat does as well, And, therefore, it maybe decreases. It could be a theory, that I think could be one of the reasons why we we don't See that much brown fat in in elderly, people. Some have a lot, especially people working outside.[0:42:56] Dr. Susanna Søberg: There there are studies showing this.[0:42:57] Andrew Huberman: Who people who[0:42:59] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Who work outside.[0:43:00] Andrew Huberman: Do physical work outside? Farmers and Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.[0:43:04] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Yeah. They expose themselves to it. So they'll they'll just Keep it in that way. Mhmm.[0:43:09] Andrew Huberman: It's, and I suppose we should clarify for people in case they don't know that insulin sensitivity is a very good thing. You want that. You want yourselves to be sensitive to insulin. Insulin insensitivity is type 2 diabetes, and is associated with obesity. So just a point of clarification there.[0:43:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's interesting to me. I I I usually work out at home, but I I go to a gym once or twice a week if I Again, because it's good if I see, the outside world. And there are a few individuals at the The gym who are they're not particularly large or muscular, but they are incredibly, lean, And their posture is great, presumably from the musculoskeletal work, and they They're in their seventies and eighties. I mean, it's remarkable.[0:44:00] Andrew Huberman: Right? And, and I know all the telltale signs of hormone augmentation. I'm very good at spotting that. There are a few tell signs. I've talked about this on other podcasts, and they're not that's not why they're they're they're, they're fit.[0:44:12] Andrew Huberman: They're they're they're clearly of that look, and you see this Outside the gym too, of course, for people that look like they've done a lot of physical labor their whole life. Yeah. They're just moving a lot. They they have strong Hands and features and that they're, and they're not necessarily excessively lean, but you can tell that they've been using their musculoskeletal system. And I like to talk to these people and ask them, like, not what are you doing now for your workout, but what what did you grow up doing?[0:44:40] Andrew Huberman: You know? And I would say and, obviously, I haven't run statistics on this, but more than 75% of them respond that they grew up on a farm or that they did some sort of manual labor or were a postman or a postwoman or doing something where they moved a lot for their early years and throughout middle age. And most of them are now in retirement, but some of them are still working, and they all still moving a lot. So the relationship between shiver and brown fat makes sense to me. But is it the case that as we're just moving around, I've heard of NEAT, non, exercise induced thermogenesis.[0:45:18] Andrew Huberman: So if we're just moving around, that we are activating brown fat, or does there need to be this Stressor. Does there need to be shiver and a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus to activate the brown fat? In other words, is just staying active enough, or do we need to do some sort of temperature, shock type thing like deliberate cold ex exposure?[0:45:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. I think that is really good question because how how also, why do we have this tissue? Then if it's if it has to be stream, then you can question what what do we need this tissue for. But it seems that you can activate the brown fat with just a little bit of Exposure to to cold. So cold is the the most potent stressor activator of, our brown fat because it's our temperature regulating Organ in our body is a first responder to that, so the muscles will be a little bit too late.[0:46:06] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And, therefore, we have maybe these 2 kind of tissues. So, actually, just, exposing yourself or or hand, actually, just to cold water. So studies have shown, that If you just put your hand in cold water, not that you're going to gonna do that all day or or every day or anything, it's not, it's it's not something you have to do, but It just shows that you can activate your ground fit just by getting a temperature change on your skin. So you can go outside in T shirts. That's why, Also, we were just talking about, well, people who works outside or move a lot or get out in and out of it, like changing the temperature of their body all the time.[0:46:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: They will have more brown fat, and, activating that is gonna keep your metabolism higher and your insulin sensitivity. A study have also shown this. So The brown fat can be activated as soon as you just change your temperature in the skin. So going outside in a T shirt, wearing cooling vests, also studies have shown this, for 10 days, It's gonna also, grow your, your brown fat. So you can get more brown fat if you expose yourself to the cold.[0:47:10] Dr. Susanna Søberg: You don't have to start in a cold shower. You don't have to start in a cold, plunge if you're not really ready for that yet. But just exposing yourself to the wind has also shown to activate your brown fat. Or if you don't wanna be, like, In this awake state, then you can also just sleep in the cold, and you won't notice it that much maybe. But studies have shown that If you sleep in 19 degrees Celsius, then you will activate your brown fat, and you will grow your brown fat you have more of it.[0:47:42] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So this very nice studies from from two thousand and 17 showed that a a group of subjects who slept in a room at 24 degrees, and then they made this PETCT scanning see how much brown fat do they have from the beginning, so what we call baseline. Then they measured again after, a month of Sleeping in 19 degrees, and they saw, I think it's remarkable, just 1 month at 19 degrees sleeping there. They had a duvet on, and They were still had to close on when they're sleeping.[0:48:15] Andrew Huberman: So they're under a cover, under a duvet?[0:48:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Under under a duvet. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The subjects were sleeping at 19 degrees from 1 month, had Increased is insulin sensitivity.[0:48:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: The next month, they stepped at 24 degrees. They measured this again, and then they had decreased actually a little bit. And then they step at 27 degrees, so quite warm room, actually, for for the, 4th month, and they saw even less Activation of the brown fat and also insulin sensitivity. So it seems that you can expose yourself, and pretty rapidly, the brown fat will respond to this Because it's so sensitive to noradrenaline. Right?[0:48:52] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So if you keep exposing yourself to a little bit of cold, You will also get a little bit adapted to it, but that's because the brown fat, has grown these more mitochondria in the cells. So these small energy fabrics, that's gonna activate the cells, and that's gonna take up glucose and fat from the fatty acids from the bloodstream to keep, the thermogenesis up. And that's gonna clear up some sugar, and it's gonna clear, so in the in the bloodstream and some some fat as well. So the brown fat can in that way decrease, our unhealthy fat, which is the white fat. And the white fat is what we don't want too much of, but we still need some, of course.[0:49:33] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And it's our energy storage, so it's very important that it's there. We just don't need a lot of it. So on our thighs and also around our inner organs, that's where it's it's located. So if we can Have activation of the brown fat just by going out in the cold and just by sleeping in a cold room. Or if you are have courage for it, you can go out and expose yourself in a cold plunge.[0:49:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Cold showers is also gonna do the trick. So you can do different variations of this. Just exposing yourself to various temperatures It's gonna activate the brown fat because it was involved to keep us in a perfect homeostatic balance regarding temperature, So to keep us alive.[0:50:12] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. I to just get a clarification around this 19 degrees Celsius, room that they're sleeping in. So they're under a comforter, a duvet, and, and you mentioned they had clothes on. The room is 19 degrees Celsius, But the temperature underneath their blanket might not be 19 degrees Celsius. So, presumably, it's the cold on their face that's activating, the the increase in, brown fat that was observed.[0:50:38] Andrew Huberman: Is that is that a reasonable, expectation?[0:50:40] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I I think so. Yeah. Because it's You have so many, coreceptors in your faces, so it's actually, it's enough. And it I think it corresponds very well with the studies showing that you can the brown fat just by putting a hand into a a bucket of cold water. And I did this experiment myself in in my studies just to see how well did they, respond to cold water.[0:51:02] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So it was 4 degrees Celsius cold water for 4 minutes, and then I just measured Blood pressure and heart rate to see, do they have, like, an activation of this? I actually also measured the brown fat during this, cold exposure for 4 minutes with an infrared thermography camera to see, can I see that the brown fat is activated? And just to just to go back to the location of the brown fat. Usually, you cannot really see activation of your brown fat because it's located centrally in your around your central nervous system. And and the biggest depot, as you mentioned before, is up here, under the the clavicular bones.[0:51:43] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So, and very close to the skin's surface. And because it's so close to the skin's surface, I could measure it with this expensive camera. Yeah. And it's not very feasible for people to go home and do this. Don't because it takes a lot of practice.[0:51:57] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I can tell. But We measured the brown fat with this, and and I could see that after a few minutes that the activation was there, an increase in temperature, arose from that, Just 4 minutes. So it's very rapid. And I'm also measured in my study how deep was the brown fat under your skin. So it's very close to the surface, which also shows that it it needs to be there to to heat you up and heat heat your inner organs.[0:52:25] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm delighted To hear all of this, and I'll I'll tell you why. One is by way of anecdote. I mentioned a little bit earlier that as an undergraduate, I worked in a lab that Study thermogenesis, and we were doing that in animals, but we had this room that was very cold.[0:52:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Uh-huh.[0:52:38] Andrew Huberman: The whole room was cold. The guy who I worked for at the time, My name Harry Carlisle is a very accomplished physiologist. He came from this lineage. I don't know if this literature is still, discussed much, but it's a beautiful literature, from Rothwell and Stock, they were the ones who discovered, nonexercise induced thermogenesis. The fact that people bounce who bounce their legs a lot and move around a lot and have a lot of kind of, stochastic movement, burn up to 18, 1,800 calories more per day than people who sit more still.[0:53:09] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Fascinating.[0:53:10] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. Yeah. Just incredible. I don't think that work desert gets as much attention as as it deserves, published in journals like Nature, so very, Find journals. But in any event, one of the things that I noticed when I started working in that laboratory was that I was cold because the room was cold, And, doctor Carlisle, Harry, said, well, the key is to wear a T shirt in here for about 2, 3 days Yeah.[0:53:35] Andrew Huberman: And then you will cold adapt. I thought, well, wouldn't I wanna put on a hoodie and get warm in there so I was comfortable? And he said, no. Actually, what you want to do is get yourself uncomfortably cold, activate your brown fat. And, indeed, When I did that, I think it was just 2 days of being in that cold environment, then I could come back on the 3rd day and be perfectly comfortable Yeah.[0:53:53] Andrew Huberman: Because The brown fat had expanded, or or added mitochondria or both, and I was perfectly comfortable in that environment. I also got very, very lean In those, in those days weeks now I've I've never been somebody who's very lean nor am I somebody who carries a lot of excess adipose tissue. I'm kind of somewhere in the middle. I'm sure I could adjust that with feeding if I want to, but it was it was striking, what a powerful effect it had on my entire system of thermal regulation. And one of the things that I, also delighted in when Cell Reports, Medicine published your study is they had an accompanying, press release that went out to to those of us that receive press releases, and it described a, a saying in Scandinavia, which is, essentially I'm not gonna attempt to, speak Danish even though I have much of my family is in Denmark, believe it or not, from Denmark.[0:54:46] Andrew Huberman: We have a lot of Danes in my family. I won't embarrass myself by trying to speak Danish as I did before the the microphones were rolling, but That there's a saying that, I think, essentially, translates to in the fall, when when you're approaching winter Mhmm. You want to actually wear fewer layers, not bundle up when you go outside so that you can prepare yourself for the cold of winter and be able to heat yourself up using your brown fat. And that in the spring, as the temperatures are warming, rather than removing layers, you want to wear more layers in order to be A little bit uncomfortably warm so that in this heat of the summer, you're better at cooling your body. Do I have that right?[0:55:28] Andrew Huberman: And maybe do you know the saying, and would you be willing to share it? Only the Swedes and, and Danes will be able to understand. Maybe the Norwegians too. If you don't know it, that's okay.[0:55:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. So I know that I know the the concept of it because we say it. You should you should wear less before winter And, and more before summer.[0:55:47] Andrew Huberman: So There it is in English. So I think it doesn't have to be esoteric. But, okay.[0:55:51] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. And and you're completely right. And I think this is the This is just something that we know in the Scandinavian countries. I think that we we we intuitively know this. But if we just go back a little bit in history, I think that, around 19 fifties, the, the Russian government went out and said, well, we should do something about the Tuberculosis, pandemic, epidemic, the worst at that this time.[0:56:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So they they wanted to have the the people, be more resilient to the cold and also increase our immune system. So in Scandinavia and, actually, also in Russia, We, put our babies outside to sleep, in the prom, and that is like to, also to to get more resistant to the cold, but also to increase our immune system. And we still do that in Denmark. So we[0:56:44] Andrew Huberman: we really?[0:56:45] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. We do.[0:56:45] Andrew Huberman: Babies are taken out in the cold?[0:56:47] Dr. Susanna Søberg: In the snow, in Frosty, rain, everything. My 2 boys have been sleeping out in winter of at least the fur their first many 3, 4, 5 years because it's, like, very good for them, and they get, a better, immune system and get resilient to the cold so they will have less colds. And, also, they run around in a T shirt when it's super cold because they have activated all the brown fat. I didn't understand at that time, I must I must say. But I kinda like intuitively also knew because we have inherited this, way of doing things with our culture.[0:57:22] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So and I have heard people coming from the US saying, Danes are crazy. They put the babies outside and proms and leave them there, and then they go inside and drink coffee on the cafe.[0:57:33] Andrew Huberman: Well, I don't think Danes are crazy. I I I I adore the Danes. Their their amazing, Culture and people, I'm so fortunate to have family members, from Denmark, but I did notice so when when we were in Copenhagen, and and I know, We we saw you there, not long ago. That was June. The water in the harbor was was cold Yeah.[0:57:54] Andrew Huberman: For for Even though the Pacific is close to here, which is very cold, felt pretty cold, but I it was summertime ish, So people were in summertime mode. Right? T shirts and shorts and things of that sort. But it did strike me that people in Copenhagen are dramatically fitter than they are in the United States. I mean, first of all, everyone's Bicycling everywhere.[0:58:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Not many people wearing sunglasses, so trying to extract as much photon energy from the sun as possible, which I support. As everyone knows, that's a I'm a big fan of getting sun. But, also, when we did see swimmers, They were swimming in this cold water and like it was nothing, and their the range and age of the swimmers was what was remarkable. You saw the kind of fit triathlete looking types, but also young kids, like, really young kids, and then people probably in their, again, their their Seventies, eighties, maybe even nineties.[0:58:55] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[0:58:55] Andrew Huberman: Really, remarkable. Vastly different than what you see if you go to the ocean here in, Los Angeles or or elsewhere. So, yeah, you Scandinavians are on to something with this. I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.[0:59:19] Andrew Huberman: I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that they'll give you information about certain lipid markers or Hormone markers, but no information about what to do with all of that data. InsideTracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, And then to assess what sorts of behavioral, nutritional, supplementation, or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for your health. InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes 3 new hormone markers that are critical to measure during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years. These are estradiol, progesterone, and thyroid stimulating hormone.[1:00:05] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. I'd like to talk about your study. If you could give us a little bit of the backdrop about what motivated that study, and then, and then walk us through What you did, you know, who the subjects were, what you had them do, what you measured, in as much detail as you would like to share because I think it's Such an important, you know, even fair to say landmark study because it also explored not just cold, but Sauna and the the co use of cold and sauna as a way to probe metabolism and brown fat and other markers as well. And as you do this, I'm hoping at some point that you might, tell us some of the observations that you might have made that interested you that perhaps were not in the paper, because that's one of the great benefits of sitting across from somebody who who did the work in detail.[1:01:06] Andrew Huberman: So, yeah, if you could tell us about your study, And, what you did and what you discovered?[1:01:12] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Thank you for that question, Andrew. I I love to, like, also explain a little bit what did we do, because When people read this kind of paper, they just see the numbers. They don't see what what happened before that. And human studies are very different from From my study my study, you can do a knockout of something, and then everything is, like, perfectly matched and controlled. Doing human studies is very far different from that because People are different even in the groups.[1:01:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So yeah. But what we, when I started this research in 2016, I did not really know what the brown fat was, so I started reading up on all this. And I was very interested in preventive medicine. Also, the studies that I did before, brown fat was also, like, very much in in the preventive side. Like, how can we that was about something else, but, the sweet tooth and how can we lower our sweet tooth and stuff like that.[1:02:06] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So but after that, I wanted to to do something new. So I looked into Brown Phat, Got hired in this fantastic research group where they it's a cell group. So they mostly did cell studies, and they didn't have anyone to do a human study yet. And, but they really wanted me to to do that. So I read upon a lot of research about how does the brown fat get activated, What had been done already and I mentioned the paper before with sleeping in the cold.[1:02:34] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I found that particular paper very fascinating. And that was also where, at that time, I was like, okay. So cold exposure as an intervention of sleeping in the cold Could be a good thing to go out and say, well, people do this. But on the other hand, is first of all, it was already done. That was one thing.[1:02:53] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But the other thing was like, well, I wanted to to see if we can do in, like, some kind of activity so we can have people Move also. Go and do something do something together or whatever. And and and the quote made us think about, well, what about winter swimming? And it was kinda like a bit of a joke in the beginning. It's like, winter swimming.[1:03:13] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. It's gonna activate the brown fat. Right? But but when we read the literature, we couldn't really find anything about Activation of the brown fat with cold water besides hand in a bucket of cold water. That really that was already there.[1:03:27] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So we were just thinking, okay. So it should be very potent, activation of the brown fat if it's cold water, but very different from cold air. So it was kind of also a new thing we were going into, and, we knew that we were gonna do, like, a more of a, a proof of concept study, at the beginning of it because it was like winter swimmers, Must, in theory, activate the brown fat. Right? But we kinda didn't really know with was this kind of stressor too much, too little, or what will happen, actually.[1:04:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But we had this idea about well, we always say that cold water and winter swimming will activate your metabolism. But do but do we know if it does that? No. We don't. So, and while this idea was a little bit fun fun at the beginning, we kind of accepted.[1:04:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It was like, okay. Let's just try this out. But because we didn't have the funding for it, we was like, okay. Let's do a proof of concept study. Let's go with a small number, but enough to see, a difference between the groups.[1:04:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So the power calculation of that study is done on, what we know, from PET CT scanings of the brown fat. So that's the main outcome of that, of course. So, and we wanted to go a little bit smaller on the numbers of of participants because we wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the different mechanisms and also redo some of the the the days. So I really wanted to do that to see if I can replicate also the findings. And that's gonna take a lot of a lot of funding, but it's also gonna take a lot of time to do it.[1:05:05] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So the proof of concept was just going small, but looking at Different mechanisms. We also took, fat biopsies, for example, and looked at the white fat to see if there was any differences between the groups before and after and stuff like So that's kinda like how it started, and and and the 1st year was like a field study for me. So I was not a winter swimmer When I started this, it was just Oh,[1:05:28] Andrew Huberman: really?[1:05:28] Dr. Susanna Søberg: No. I wasn't, at all. And I I would say I was a bit afraid of the cold myself. Bit of a cold sissy. Always cold having big socks on and sweaters and stuff like that.[1:05:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So I was like, I am so comfortable. Oh, I'm just like everybody else, very comfortable. I like being com completely temperature neutral. But I started, like, playing with the stars. Well, if this is so healthy, in theory, I should not pack myself up.[1:05:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I should start not doing that. Yeah. But the 1st year observation of winter swimmers on the jetty, they kind of joked about it. They say, come on, Zuzano. You need to try this.[1:06:05] Dr. Susanna Søberg: You cannot study this Unless you have tried it and I was like, Very funny. Of course, I can do that, but I couldn't. I I read the literature. I understood, in theory, what happens when you go into cold water, but I completely understood it when I first tried it. The first few times, Not so funny.[1:06:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It felt painful. It was just like running too long after a long break, and you and your muscles hurt the day have to ride. You you completely regret that you took that extra mile.[1:06:36] Andrew Huberman: What about when you say uncomfortable, you mean uncomfortable when you got in and when you were in or uncomfortable afterwards? Because I find that, on rare occasions well, I should just full disclosure, I I do deliberate cold exposure every morning, for about a minute to 2 minutes in a cold plunge, there are days that I miss. But when I'm at home, I do that. And when I travel, I do a cold shower. I do finish with a warm shower, so, and we'll talk about why that's probably not the best idea.[1:07:06] Andrew Huberman: But, and I've been doing it for some years now, on and off. But, so just full disclosure. I'm a devotee, and I have family members that, hate the the cold but have gotten into it and and are starting to like it. But they don't and I don't necessarily like the experience in the cold water, but I love the way I feel when I get out. Sure.[1:07:29] Andrew Huberman: And I I'm a 100% on that statement about loving it when I get out. Occasionally, it feels good to be in there. It feels invigorating. And I think I've learned to control the gasp reflex and the hyperventilation, and I just have Told myself what we know, which is that the forebrain struggles to engage for the 1st 20 or 30 seconds, but if you can get past that wall, It's it's far easier to to push through. But when you say that it was really uncomfortable, do you mean the experience of getting in, or You also felt lousy afterward.[1:08:00] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. And very important to clear that out. I only felt very uncomfortable doing it at the moment. But afterwards, the 1st time I went, with with a group and, actually, my husband was as as well, because I I really wanted someone I knew coming along because it's very normal. If you haven't done this before, you feel a little bit anxious about it.[1:08:21] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Didn't this is shown in studies as well because blood pressure and heart rate goes up in in those who are new to this kind of activity. So, I was a little bit anxious about it. So it was really uncomfortable just doing it. But afterwards, As soon as I got up, I felt fantastic. And we went into the sauna, and I did 3 rounds because I just loved it.[1:08:41] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I love the feeling afterwards because you have all these neurotransmitters going in your brain, and you feel more positive. You feel I feel invigorated. I have so much energy. And that like, I I could totally see why people would do this to get energy throughout the day because I definitely had that. I didn't have to do 3 dips To to get that, I think 1 would be enough.[1:09:03] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And I often do that also now today. I do 1 dip. Sometimes I do 2 or 3, dips, in in 1 round, you can say in one day. But, often, it's like just 1 or 2 times a week. For me, that is enough To to get that energy and to get that positive feeling, and and I think that that is also why I I put up my study in that way.[1:09:26] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I wanted to study the lowest dose, you can say, the lowest amount that we can get away with but still see, health benefits. So what I observed there on the jetty was that some did it a long time. They were in the water for a very long time, and to me, it seemed maybe a little bit Stream. Could[1:09:44] Andrew Huberman: you give me an example of long time?[1:09:46] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Well, so maybe they were, like, really swimming, and they could be 20 minutes or half an hour.[1:09:50] Andrew Huberman: That's a long time.[1:09:51] Dr. Susanna Søberg: That's a long time, and there was, like, ice and people who came up. I mean, I just didn't really feel that this is something that I wanted to Go out and recommend to people aftermarketing.[1:10:03] Andrew Huberman: Research subjects dying either. Because if you're not adapted, I mean, the people, You know, people can do that. Also, a 20 minute cold shower or 20 minute cold plunge. I know people do it, but it's probably not a good[1:10:14] Dr. Susanna Søberg: idea. No. Probably not. It's gonna exhaust your cells and ate them make them age too fast. So exactly.[1:10:21] Dr. Susanna Søberg: That's, When you pass that hermetic stress, this the healthy stress level, that's what is happening. The quite opposite is is, almost chronic stress actually in the cells. Well, What happened then was that, I found out if if I want to have this protocol get through ethical committee, I I really needed to go, like, very, like, sleek with the not too long and and make sure that they were also very healthy and and to get approval, of course, of this study. But what I did was to to recruit winter swimmers who already have been swimming for 2 or 3 seasons, and I just observed them. I said, I'm not gonna do an intervention study yet.[1:11:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I did that after, But I I wanted to do, like, a proof of concept where they were already adapted to the cold and then compare them to a match control group who were matched on, on, you could say, diet. So were they vegetarian or not, and one of them was in each group. Also They[1:11:20] Andrew Huberman: weren't all vegetarians.[1:11:22] Dr. Susanna Søberg: No. No. No. Just 1 in each group. Yeah.[1:11:23] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I was[1:11:23] Andrew Huberman: gonna say with all the amazing fish and meat in, in Denmark, I'd have a hard time being a vegetarian. The breads are amazing. The fruits and vegetables too. But okay. So there were a couple vegetarians in each group.[1:11:33] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. 1 1 in each. Yeah.[1:11:35] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:11:35] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And then when mashed up[1:11:36] Andrew Huberman: vegetarian. I have family members of vegetarian, so I'm just poking fun. The,[1:11:41] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. But they were they were matched on different things. So what we usually match is also BMI. We chose 1 gender in this study, and we would always choose both men and women normally. But We do see that there are different, brown fat levels, depending on gender.[1:12:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So women have more brown fat than men. Really?[1:12:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Interesting.[1:12:05] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. I think it's interesting.[1:12:08] Andrew Huberman: A deserved study.[1:12:09] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Yeah. Why, actually? I think it's interesting because women are also smaller, so in size, mass. Right?[1:12:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But they also have, a lower perifold temperature, especially on hands and ears and Is[1:12:22] Andrew Huberman: that right? That's documented that women do run colder than men? Yeah. And there's Physiologically, I didn't say psychologically.[1:12:30] Dr. Susanna Søberg: No. No. No.[1:12:30] Andrew Huberman: We won't we won't go to the psychological cold cold heat.[1:12:34] Dr. Susanna Søberg: That's different. Yeah. Something else.[1:12:35] Andrew Huberman: That's a different podcast. Yeah.[1:12:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Another time. So women are just colder physically. So on hands and ears, it's measured on that, and and and feet as well, so compared to men. And men have bigger hearts than women, and they can pump out more blood, perifol, than in a woman's body. So they that could be an explanation for the colder hands, for thermo comfortable state is also different between gen genders.[1:13:05] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So men are more comfortable at 22 degrees Celsius, And women are thermo comfortable at 24 degrees Celsius. And this is[1:13:14] Andrew Huberman: the thermostat wars of home have been now validated.[1:13:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Okay. There's the study. 2[1:13:19] Andrew Huberman: degrees Celsius. By the way, prior to, starting recording, I made the executive decision that we were gonna go with Celsius throughout the podcast, because the majority of the world uses Celsius. So for those of you that think in Fahrenheit, the Internet is your friend in making those conversions, but so we're sticking with Celsius. So men tend to be thermo comfortable at 22 degrees Celsius, Women at 24. Okay.[1:13:46] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[1:13:47] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Explains a lot about, like, also some in the homes where men are turning down the heater and women are turning off the heater, and they cannot really so it's it's really it's I'm on both sides here understand the men. We understand the women, but it there is a difference there, which was also one of the reasons why we had We, in this proof of concept study, chose 1 gender. So it is not like only because we wanted to study men. It was just to see to eliminate, all the confounding factors which could have an impact on on our results. So, that was one of the reasons, but also because we yeah.[1:14:25] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So women have have more brown fat than men. And, otherwise, we would have to, like, do 4 groups or something like that. And not having funding yet, we were like, okay. We need to do, like, just 1 group, just a control group, and then a and a group who were already winter swimmers. So I recruited winter swimmers who have been swimming for 2 to 3 seasons, because I wanted them to be already adapted, but not going Too long in the water.[1:14:52] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So they told me. I did a lot of screening here, of course, beforehand and interviews To see to ask them how much do you do and, how much do you how long do you stay in the water, and I, monitored how long did they then stay in the water and recruited Based on, that they only did, like, 2 to 3 times per week, it seems reasonable, for for for Denmark, at least, to do that. And they stayed only in the water for 1 to 2 minutes. So the coast subsides very quickly, and you will get this activation of your rest and digest system, which is your parasympathetic nervous system, so the The other branch of your autonomus nervous system. And you get that activation because you submerge into cold water.[1:15:37] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And when you do that, you have An activation of your diving response, and, that's gonna slow down the, you can say, the the consumption of oxygen also your body, and that's gonna slow down your heart rate.[1:15:50] Andrew Huberman: Could I pause you on this? Because I've heard this before that when we get into cold water, shower or immersion Mhmm. We get this Sympathetic autonomic response, so increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, release of Norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus in the brain, release of, adrenaline, dopamine, Adrenaline from the from the adrenals, dopamine presumably within the brain, but that The parasympathetic response is activated when we put our face into cold water or go underwater, and that's a calming relaxation response. So this brings us back to I don't wanna take us off track from you describing the study, but this brings us back to the first question, which is If I go completely underwater for a moment when I start my cold plunge, does that change the physiological outcome as compared to if I just submerge myself up to the neck? And and, actually, nowadays, there seems to be a little bit of a movement online of people putting a bowl of ice water on their countertop and Submerging your face into it.[1:16:50] Andrew Huberman: Did you see this? This is a start. Obviously, more and more posts about this. So, can you just touch on the what the dive reflex is and why it Act perhaps activates the parasympathetic response, this calming response.[1:17:02] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But, also, the diving reflex is activated when you submerge into cold water.[1:17:07] Andrew Huberman: Even just to the neck? Yeah. Or I thought you had to get your face under. I'm not I'm not arguing different. You're the expert.[1:17:13] Andrew Huberman: I just wanna, Yeah.[1:17:14] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I haven't really I haven't read that. I've just seen, that you can activate your, diving response As soon as you go underwater with your body, so you don't have to do it with your face. As far as I understand, I could I could be wrong, though. Yeah. So when when you activate your, diving response, you will slow down your, your oxygen consumption in your body.[1:17:40] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And that is because the body tries to res preserve, oxygen so you will not get hypothermic too fast. So it's kinda like a survival system in your body. So this survival system is very, Important for us, of course. So that would be activated. And, because of that, you will have to maybe 1 minute or so.[1:18:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: That can't be precise on that because Maybe it also varies a bit in in humans. So 1 to 2 minutes, you will have full activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but also the parasympathetic nervous system. And that's gonna activate, for example, something like serotonin in your brain, which is, like, also good for mental balance and people feeling in mental balance afterwards. They after they go up you know, so that is, like, measured on questionnaires and also measured, like, on anecdotes. Of course, people tell all the time that they feel good afterwards.[1:18:34] Dr. Susanna Søberg: We need studies on this. So if anyone's sitting out there thinking that's interesting, Then please do some studies on that Yeah. I agree. To to get more, out of that. Yeah.[1:18:44] Andrew Huberman: So you had so you observe these winter swimmers who are Done this for a few seasons. Yeah. They're coming around for a new season of winter swimming, and you decide to recruit them as subjects. They are getting into cold water, climbing down a ladder or jumping into the water up to their neck.[1:19:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Climbing. Yeah.[1:19:02] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Climbing down a ladder into the because this is done outdoors. What a fun Study to do. My my graduate thesis was done under fluorescent lights with no windows in a in a building that, I mean, I had a ton of fun as a PhD student. I actually lived in the laboratory as PhD student.[1:19:15] Andrew Huberman: I loved it so much, but, not something required to do a PhD, by the way. But They're climbing down the ladder[1:19:23] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[1:19:24] Andrew Huberman: Getting in up to their next, staying in for 1 to 2 minutes, and then getting out. And how many times a week are they doing this?[1:19:30] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So they do this 2 to 3 times per week. And for each time they go, each day they go, they take 3 rounds, of So feed dips and 2 sauna sessions. So they start in the cold, and they end in the cold water.[1:19:44] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So it's get in for 1 to 2 minutes, Then get out and get into the sauna. Yeah. What is the temperature of the sauna?[1:19:52] Dr. Susanna Søberg: About 80 degrees Celsius.[1:19:54] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Then how long are they in the sauna?[1:19:57] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So they stayed there, for 10 to 15 minutes. So depending on if they went 2 times per week or 3 times per week.[1:20:04] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And then they get back into the cold for a few minutes? Yeah. 2 minutes.[1:20:08] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Up to 2 minutes. Yeah.[1:20:09] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Then back into the sauna, 15 minutes or so Yeah. Then back into the cold for a 3rd round[1:20:15] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[1:20:15] Andrew Huberman: Back into the sauna, and then Then they're[1:20:20] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Ending on cold.[1:20:21] Andrew Huberman: Back into the cold again and then ending on cold. Yeah. And, and we will talk about why it's important to end on cold, the so called sober principle. How cold was the water in this particular given average? Because I realize it's outdoor winter swimming, so it's gonna vary depending on wind chill and things well.[1:20:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Of course. So it's a very uncontrolled environment to do this kind of study then, but I wanted to do something that was Also very close to something people can do for free, going out in nature and use that and also have the nature light. It's a very healthy impact on us. It lowers our stress, stress level as well. So by doing so, I also measured the temperature every time they went.[1:21:02] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So I have this graph, and it's actually in the winter swimming book. It shows the temperature in Denmark going, like, from October to April, and it's like starts at 12 degrees. I think it's around 12 de 12 degrees Celsius, the water, and then it goes down to 2 degrees in on average in January and then up again. So it's within the spectrum of very cold water, I would say, from Around 15:15 degrees Celsius and and down, but it was actually a lot colder than, like, 2 to 4 degrees in in on average, when it it was the coldest. So it doesn't have to be that cold to be good enough and and enough to activate our metabolism.[1:21:44] Andrew Huberman: And what time of day are, the participants doing this cold sauna alternation?[1:21:50] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So I think they did this, throughout the day. So I didn't control whether they wanted to go in the morning, in the afternoon, or or in the evening. At the time where I set up the study, I I was not controlling it in that way. I wanted them to go whenever they had Time, and I also think that is the most important message to give to give to people is when do it when you have time. It's not if if if Doing it, when you get home from work and it's 6 o'clock in the evening, and this is the time where you are, where you can do it, then then and try out if it's gonna impact your sleep or not.[1:22:26] Dr. Susanna Søberg: If it doesn't impact your sleep, then fine. But you have to try for yourself and find out what works for you. It's the same for coffee, for example. Right? Some people can drink coffee in the evening and go to bed, and they can sleep.[1:22:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I can't.[1:22:39] Andrew Huberman: Or exercise.[1:22:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Or exercise. Exactly. So I can't I can't do that, and that's because the coffee exercise, cold water, immersion, it's gonna activate your sympathetic nervous system. Have an increase in stress response in your body, and and that's gonna make it really hard to fall asleep for some people at least. Maybe you are Super exhausted anyways, and then you will just crash.[1:23:00] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Anyways but yeah. But, that's that's the only thing. So I just told them to do this If they can during the daytime, and that's primarily what they also did.[1:23:10] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And then, all along you're measuring brown fat by way of this infrared camera. Right? So what did you observe in terms of changes in brown fat? How quickly did that occur?[1:23:23] Andrew Huberman: And And then I'd like to ask also about sauna a bit more, because earlier you mentioned that you can activate brown fat with sauna as well, with heat[1:23:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Oh, go to surface[1:23:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Surface of the skin. How long did it take before you observed significant increases in brown fat? And was it increased density of brown fat or distribution? Was it, you know, showing expansion to different regions throughout the body?[1:23:49] Andrew Huberman: And, maybe you could also touch on some of the changes in insulin sensitivity and metabolism.[1:23:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. A very good good question. And and and I didn't mention this be before, but Besides measuring temperature as an outcome for brown fat activity, we also, did PET MRI scanning, of the brown fat. So this is like the the golden standard, for measuring brown fat, and it's not very feasible for normal people to get And and a PET CT or PET MRI scanning of the brown fat is super expensive. So we had both, to see if we could have, like, a continuous measure of brown fat in humans because that was already not not out there.[1:24:34] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I wanted to see during both the experimental days, but also during day and night, what kind of, like, Circadian, rhythm do we have in our brown fat activity? So that's why I wanted to have that as well. So the PET CT scanning or the PET MRI scanning was to see upon cold activation, stimulation for some hours. Do we have activation? Can we see the brown fat in this subject?[1:25:00] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And also during thermal neutrality or thermo comfortable state, how is that activated in each of the group, of course?[1:25:08] Andrew Huberman: So you want to see how comfortable people were away from the cold water and sauna just at different, temperature environments. Is that right?[1:25:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yes. I also measured that. How comfortable are you? I had I made the scale, like, visual analog scale, and asked them, How comfortable do you feel with this temperature, and throughout the study days during cold exposure and thermal comfortable day? I had a whole day where I just kept them, thermal comfortable to see, do they activate the brown fat if they're just completely thermal comfortable?[1:25:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: As good as we could get with that because We were asking people, on a scale from 1 to 10 and 5 being still more comfortable, where are you on the scale? So 1 would be very cold and 10 would be super burning hot. Yeah. And so that was a way to, like, try to figure out how do they actually feel, also during the studies. I also measured, electromyography, so of of muscles to see do they shiver during the cooling day.[1:26:10] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Sometimes people shiver before they know they're really shivering. So I had Oh, interesting.[1:26:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So so our conscious perception of shivering might not be the best Readout of shiver.[1:26:20] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Well, you if you also get adapted to the cold water, you will have less shivering. They will be less vigorous. They will be very small, so you wouldn't probably know that you are shivering because this the shivering is so small, and the mitochondria in the muscle cells will be so Densed that it doesn't need to shiver maybe that much to get, that, thermogenesis going, compared to when you're completely new, to coat water exposure, you're not adapted, then the body needs to create this mitochondrial, this energy fabrics To keep you you warm, and that's also what the exercise is in the beginning. But, When we measured this, we we did see that the winter swimmers were shivering less, or, having less vigorous shivering when they said, I'm cold.[1:27:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So even though they they perception their perception of the cope was pretty similar in in in the in the groups, we could see that the the activation of the the muscles that we measured on, were different and more vigorous in the control[1:27:29] Andrew Huberman: Were the subjects incentivized to be in the study? Were they paid or anything of that sort? Or they just happen to like doing, cold and sauna, and so that's why they did the study?[1:27:38] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Well, they got paid a little bit, for it, but not much. And, that's how we do this strategy.[1:27:44] Andrew Huberman: I was just curious.[1:27:45] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[1:27:46] Andrew Huberman: I was just curious. There might be some folks that wonder. So Yeah. So what did you discover in terms of changes in brown fat, insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity rather and, metabolism.[1:27:57] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So what we we saw, was we had this kind of different measures, to see what's To try and unravel what what's actually going on when they are already adapted to the cold water compared to a control group who was matched, on on various parameters. We we did see that the winter swimmers had an increased insulin sensitivity. They produced less insulin, on all the experimental days. So besides from just cooling them and measuring the brown fat on each of these Cooling days or 2 cooling days and 1 thermo comfortable day. Right?[1:28:34] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So I wanted to measure insulin when they're just They were fasting, meaning that they hadn't eaten in, 8 hours before the study day, and they were Completely lying still, not moving just in a bed. And we measured insulin, during the experimental day just to see How what level are they on? And we could see that the the the the winter swim had had lower production of insulin, And they also when they had an glucose strength, so we give them that to see if they to test before we enroll them in studies to see if they have diabetes, for example, and Not knowing, for example, that that wouldn't that would, like, ruin maybe the the study. So we test for that and see if they have, like, a normal curve. So what we did see in that was that the winter swimmers had a faster glucose clearance in the bloodstream.[1:29:25] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So after 2 hours, we could see that they had a lower level, and it went the curve went down faster than in the control group.[1:29:33] Andrew Huberman: So despite having lower insulin release, They have better blood glucose clearance, which is really what you want what we all seek. Yeah. Right? You don't Yeah. Excessive insulin is bad.[1:29:42] Andrew Huberman: Insulin being a, More or less a chaperone for blood glucose. We can do all sorts of other things as well, of course, but, and having high blood glucose, obviously, terrible. Yeah. For cells, especially brain cells. I don't think people realize how toxic high blood, glucose is.[1:30:00] Andrew Huberman: Having high glucose is sort of if you wanna kill neurons, You make the you make their, put them in an environment where there's too much sugar. Ah, okay. Oh, yeah. Very, yeah, very neurotoxic. I mean, that's.[1:30:13] Andrew Huberman: And there are mechanisms like insulin that buffer that. We keep, you know, keeping blood glucose in a reasonable range so that, that doesn't happen. I mean, I think that's why people will go into insulinemic shock. Hypoglycemic shock is also possible. So that range in which neurons are happy is not a is not a tremendously large range.[1:30:30] Andrew Huberman: Incidentally, the range in which Neurons are are, happy and surviving, is much greater as one gets colder than when you heat up. I mean, you you can Basically, destroy brain cells by getting too hot for too long.[1:30:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Oh, yeah. Yeah.[1:30:45] Andrew Huberman: You can definitely destroy brain cells permanently by getting too cold for too long, but have to get really, really cold for a really long time.[1:30:51] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting.[1:30:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We're we're thinking about doing an episode on, So survival of the brain after death kind of things, which actually happens. You know, you hear about these people who are declared dead and then come back, And there is actually now a lot of cryopreservation type approaches for that. This is, anyway, we we risk going into the the, The esoteric now, so I'll steer us back to our discussion about your study. But, so if I do the math, These subjects are in the cold.[1:31:22] Andrew Huberman: Let's say they're doing 3 rounds of cold for 1 to 2 minutes, 3 2 or 3 times a week. What were the thresholds that you discovered were important for getting these positive changes in, such as reduced blood sugar or clearance of blood sugar, being more efficient, reduced insulin, improved brown fat distribution and density. How much cold exposure do people need? How much heat exposure do people need in order to extract these benefits?[1:31:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. So when we then calculated the numbers together, we can see that this was ended up being 11 minutes, in total per week. So not in 1 session, of course, but they had 2 to 3 visits to the water and the sauna per week. So When we divide that out, it corresponds to being in cold water 1 to 2 minutes at a time, but also in the sun at 10 to 15 minutes at a time. I think this is very, like, also similar to what we see in other studies when we look, for example, to the observational studies from the Finnish, A cohort study from, Lauken et al, for example, they published this very amazing paper in 2015.[1:32:36] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Some results from this long cohort study where they show that, that up to 30 minutes, in the sauna was healthy, and they you you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, and that's like the threshold. And if you go further than that, then There is not more, healthy benefits to to gain from that. So, and before that, it's like 19 minutes, Then you will have this dose response relationship up to 90 minutes. That's really in decreasing your risk of cardiovascular diseases. And I think we've been[1:33:10] Andrew Huberman: per week. 90 minutes per week.[1:33:12] Dr. Susanna Søberg: 90 minutes per session now.[1:33:14] Andrew Huberman: Per session?[1:33:14] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Per session. If we, then compare that with my study, which was 10 to 15 minutes per session, then I think it fits very well with what we call the Stress, healthy stress that you expose the cells to this kind of, like, potent, very, stressful situation, where they increase heat shock proteins in the cells, then that will repair the cells. But if you then overdo it and you go beyond the maybe 30 minutes in the sauna, This observational study from, Finland with more than up to 2,000 sauna bathers, where they followed these for 20 years, They see that, 30 minutes' position is, like, enough. And then if you go above that, you don't get more health benefits out of it.[1:34:01] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So I think there's a window where we can say the healthy stress corresponds to, like, 10 minutes, and and think it's like[1:34:07] Andrew Huberman: Per session.[1:34:08] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Per session. And it's not It's not much, actually, so you don't need to it shows that you don't have to expose yourself very much to the heat or very much, actually, to the cold To get this healthy, benefits, from going into cold, going to heat, and have healthy benefits on your cardiovascular system. So I think this is very important, also, message to to to get out that you don't have to go extreme. You don't have to, Swim for a half an hour in the cold water. You can go in the water for 1 to 2 minutes, per session, But go up to 11 minutes per week in total.[1:34:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And for the sauna, my study showed, 57 minutes in total per week. And if we also then divide it out on these 2 to 3 days and 2 sessions each day, correspond to 10 to 15 minutes. So It's a low threshold, but I think it's it's good to have that to maybe we can aim for that if if people need to have something to to aim for. And I think and I think it's really good to have that because then you you don't have then you don't overdo it. And if you overdo it, you exhaust the cells, and that will Increase your risk of cardiovascular disease also.[1:35:19] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So[1:35:19] Andrew Huberman: Well, I get a lot of questions about this, and I did solicit for questions for this podcast on on Twitter. And one of the questions that I That was as one becomes more cold adapted, do the benefits start to wear off, or can people do too much cold exposure? Of course, the answer to that is yes. You can become hypothermic. But I'm Sensing a different answer now, which is, if I understand correctly, the threshold is 11 minutes total per week of deliberate cold Bosher divided into 2 or 3 sessions of maybe 1 to 3 minutes depending on how long somebody stays in.[1:35:50] Andrew Huberman: And then 57 minutes. I want to be careful not to round up to an hour, but divide it into maybe 3:20 minute sessions or so. You know? So one doesn't have to be perfect as long as you get above beyond that threshold.[1:36:05] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Exactly.[1:36:05] Andrew Huberman: But I I wonder something, which is, Is it the case that if somebody said, oh, you know, I'm just going to do 1 11 minute session per week? That might actually not be as beneficial as dividing it up because what you told us earlier is that the hormetic response depends on having that cold shock. Actually don't want to become too cold adapted. I mean, once the blood pressure response drops down, so in minute 4, 5, and 6 Yeah. You're getting very cold and you're shivering, but your one is not getting the autonomic stimulus that they want.[1:36:40] Andrew Huberman: I guess I could liken this To, if exercise worked in a way where it was only the 1st few minutes of exercise that really triggered the adaptation of course, this is not how it works, But, in fact, probably quite the opposite. But if that were the case, then it's not simply the total amount of exercise, but dividing up the The the sessions into little bouts where every single time it acts as a as a stimulus Yes. That seems to be the key here. This is very important, because having watched the landscape of this on social media but also in books and generally, I think you're the 1st person to really touch on this, that the goal is not to get so cold adapted that you can sit in for the full 11 minutes in 1 session, where the goal isn't to be able to do an hour of very hot sauna. If you want to, I suppose people could do it for other reasons.[1:37:29] Andrew Huberman: But if the goal is to improve these health metrics[1:37:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[1:37:32] Andrew Huberman: Then the idea is to keep the stimulus a stimulus.[1:37:36] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Short. Exactly. Mhmm. Yeah.[1:37:38] Andrew Huberman: Great. Well, this also I think there's practical feasibility as you pointed out because getting into a cold shower or cold immersion or natural body water for a couple of minutes is far less, you know, challenging to most people than finding a full morning to go, you know, spend there, but I've never really heard it articulated that The longer sessions might not be beneficial and might actually be detrimental. That's very important. Were there any other observations that you made, that did not make it into the paper or that were Kind of in the the margin notes. I mean, in terms of psychological benefits, or anything of that sort, there was this recent study on soldiers that talked about Weight loss is sort of a controversial study, for a lot of reasons.[1:38:29] Andrew Huberman: But one of the things they remarked, in the paper was that there were a lot of psychological Changes improved buffering against anxiety. They even rep the men and women in that study, reported one of the significant effects was, significantly improved sexual satisfaction. Of Action. Of course, they didn't tell us what that meant for these subjects, but and so we won't go there. But but a number of subjective improvements.[1:38:51] Andrew Huberman: There anything that you observed or took note of in in your study that perhaps didn't make the main abstract, but that we should be aware of?[1:38:58] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. There was some. And I'm I'm today, I regret that I didn't measure on sleep, for example. I, I frankly didn't really think about that when I I, when I designed the study. So we were very, much occupied with the metabolism and kinda had the thought maybe this could impact sleep quality.[1:39:27] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And I wish it just if I had the thought that why don't you just ask them in a questionnaire? But I asked them every morning or everyone who's not many mornings, so just 2 mornings, actually. We measured on. But the winter swimmers told us before I wrote them that they had a really good, Sleep quality. The control group also had that, but they told me on the day where we measured the brown fat on a on a day and a night.[1:39:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So, for, actually, 2 days and 2 nights, they told me that they didn't they had a good night's sleep, but they also woke up. So it's just telling me that they also had, like, a quick wake up, and then they fell asleep again. And the winter swimmers So they have a really good sleep. So it's like in in general, they also say, we we sleep very well. I sleep very well.[1:40:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So it's anecdotally General, it corresponds to what I heard in my study, but nothing that I measured on, which What could be fun to do in the future, but we didn't measure, on sleep quality. That would been a have been a really good idea to do. They also told me that they were very comfortable, when they were cold. They they don't mind, winter swimmers. They don't mind, going out, For example, in in the coat with a T shirt, they were also less scared of showing their skin.[1:40:49] Dr. Susanna Søberg: That was also one observation. Interesting. Yeah.[1:40:52] Andrew Huberman: So kind of a reduced social anxiety.[1:40:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. They were just so comfortable in the lab. You as you just mentioned before, coats on and everybody's joining around. I was very busy, and, all the other, Scientists out in the hallway, and, also my supervisor had her office down down the hallway. And and one of the winter swimmers one day just Got out of bed after, had been in the study for 8 hours.[1:41:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: We it was a long day. Right? He jumped out of the bed and had his clothes In the bathroom, and he went out completely naked. He didn't care. He just went out.[1:41:28] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It was like Wait.[1:41:29] Andrew Huberman: So that's a side effect, perhaps, of getting too comfortable with the cold. And we're not recommending that. No. Although in your book, You, did a, you dedicated some let me start that again. Although in your book, you dedicated some, pages to, naked winter swimming or, oh, I should say, naked cold water exposure Yeah.[1:41:51] Andrew Huberman: As opposed to, with bathing suit. Yeah. Are there any data on this? I'm sorry. Chuckling.[1:41:58] Andrew Huberman: But, I think in most places in the United States, it's, Skinny dipping is not, is not legal, most public beaches. There are few. In fact, where I I my laboratory before moving to Stanford was in San Diego, and I At the Salk Institute For Biological Studies, beautiful building, incredible sciences done there. The beach right below that is called Black's Beach. Okay.[1:42:20] Andrew Huberman: And, and it's a known nude beach. And so whenever tourists were heading down the the stairway there, I would, you know, sort of let them know, especially if they had kids. I'd let them know. You know? It's a and it's a nude beach of a particular, of a particular genre.[1:42:36] Andrew Huberman: So I I'd give them a little warning about what what they could Inspect down below. It's a, in any event, those those beaches are quite rare, in the United States, maybe compared to Europe. I don't know. But Yeah. Maybe.[1:42:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So is there anything special about, clothes less versus closed, exposure?[1:42:53] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. I think in in that sense, we are a bit more free with this kind of life. But but remember, we also had this winter swimming culture for so for 100 of years in Denmark. And the winter the oldest winter swimming clubs that we have, especially the one we have in Copenhagen where I did my next study, which we haven't talked about, but, And it's also not published yet. But, in that winter swimming club, it's the oldest one we have, and it's huge.[1:43:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And they they swim naked At this facility.[1:43:22] Andrew Huberman: Men and women.[1:43:22] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Men and women. And they have sauna where they can go in together, and they also have the separate saunas. But it's very much, a Danish thing, and and I think it's I think it's it's I think it's good if people want that. And I had it in my book because People want to know if they have to swim with their bathing suit on or if they can take it off or what's the what's the difference. Is there any difference in this?[1:43:46] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And if you ask me, There is no difference. Oh, if you have your little skinny bikini on, it's not gonna do any difference to your, cold exposure or your Adaptation is not gonna do any difference for your benefits, of course, but I think that it has something else. It has something to do with How you also observe yourself, how you observe your your surroundings, and it's some some sense of freedom in skinny dipping. I think people in Denmark who does this is they do the winter swimming because they feel free when they do it. As they come home from work, they Go to this club, and they skinny dip, and they feel, like, in touch with nature.[1:44:25] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And they have maybe done this their whole life. So this is an old tradition in Denmark In some of the clubs, but the newer clubs that are coming, they don't they don't skinny dip. So everyone has bathing suit. I never skinny dip because There are people around, people with phones and taking pictures all the time. So this[1:44:44] Andrew Huberman: Different different nowadays. Everything's recorded.[1:44:46] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Yep. And, Also, this this old tradition is also fading away because of that.[1:44:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I, I Use sauna and cold at home, but when I travel, there there's a a banya. So Russian banya has hot sauna and cold plunge. There's one in San Francisco called Archimedes Bania, and that one is clothing optional. And so some people are clothed such as myself, and then other people are not, and it's coed Most of the time, I think they have male female separated, evenings or something like that.[1:45:17] Andrew Huberman: And then, the other Bania is Spa 88, which is in on Wall Street in New York is an amazing banya as well. And these are starting to crop up in different cities or maybe they've been there for a long time and as Deliberate cold exposure in sauna gets more popular. More people are using them. The the one in New York that I that Spy 88 is always clothed. And it's interesting because, you know, people hear naked or skinny dipping, and they they might get certain ideas in mind.[1:45:43] Andrew Huberman: It Yeah. All these places are very well lit, and they all have a tone of kind of, of health that is about the kind of health and and and wellness. I guess the point being that, there's no requirement to do one thing or the other, although in the studies that, you did, obviously. People were closed, but I I did, I did pay attention to those pages in your book. I thought it was interesting that you put some, some dedicated, passages in your book related to this.[1:46:10] Andrew Huberman: And I think it[1:46:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: My publisher wanted that.[1:46:12] Andrew Huberman: Oh, your publisher wanted that. Yeah. It was[1:46:14] Dr. Susanna Søberg: it was not me. It was like my publisher really wanted to Have a little discussion about that. So it's like, okay.[1:46:19] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think it, you know, it points to a larger theme, which is, I think, for a lot of people who already do these practices, there's no shock there.[1:46:27] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[1:46:27] Andrew Huberman: For people that do not do deliberate cold exposure or sauna, I think that, you know, there is this idea perhaps that, oh, you know, these are, traditions that are are kind of fringe or that they're cut yeah. And I just I wanna, cue that point because there's so many things that are happening right now in biomedical research and medicine. You know, serious Quality peer reviewed studies published in excellent journals like your paper on things like deliberate cold exposure, sauna, the use of particular supplements, natural natural herbs and supplements. I mean, there's an entire branch of the National Institutes of Health in the United States dedicated just to the study of supplements and behavioral interventions for health, like meditation and breath work. Really incredible.[1:47:14] Andrew Huberman: Really incredible. And psychedelics, of course, being something that for a long time was part of a certain community and feel and now is being, frankly, adopted by mainstream medicine, even pharma. So it the the times are changing. And so, yes, So I think it's important to know that, it's perfectly acceptable and encouraged to wear clothing.[1:47:34] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[1:47:37] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And and one other thing that, I wanted to to mention going back to your questions around if there were any Observations in the studies which we really maybe haven't discussed yet and maybe it's in in the back of the the paper and not mentioned that much was 1 of the winter swimmers didn't have any brown fat when we measured him.[1:47:57] Andrew Huberman: 0.[1:47:58] Dr. Susanna Søberg: 0. And, in we do see this In in in previous studies as well that some humans don't have any brown fat.[1:48:07] Andrew Huberman: Was he did he carry a lot of white fat adipose tissue? Was he was he obese?[1:48:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: No. He wasn't. No. He was not obese because that he would not have been in the study then.[1:48:16] Andrew Huberman: Oh, right. Yes. You mentioned this earlier. Forgive me.[1:48:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: No. No. But he was, but what I did observe before I knew that he didn't have any Bronfen was that during the cooling experiment where I cooled them for, 2 hours before they go into the PET CT scanner, he was not able To control his, shivering like the winter swimmers, could. So he got he got very, cold very easily, compared to the others. So and without I didn't know what was different about him, but we could all all of Me and the 3 others were working on the experiment.[1:48:57] Dr. Susanna Søberg: We were like, okay. What's going on? Because we turned down the the temperature, but he started, like, shivering, and then we had turn it up again, and it was just all over the place. The temperature is not it wasn't that controlled like the others. It was pretty similar protocol.[1:49:12] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I could just do pretty much the same because they were same size and, also same gender. So it it it was easier, to, like, foresee what was gonna happen and when will they start shiver. I quickly learned that. But with this subject, it was just with this, volunteer was just very much different. And then when we scanned him and didn't find any brown fur I I I didn't even think about it.[1:49:36] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So when we scanned him, we didn't see anything. I told the PETCT people to, like, oh, you put up the wrong, Scanning.[1:49:43] Andrew Huberman: Right. It was the technology.[1:49:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. It the technology. It was like this scanning looked like the thermo neutral day, the thermo comfortable day, where we also scanned them to see if they have any brown fat. So you have made a mistake, I was pretty sure. And they reanalyzed anal analyzed this, scanning, and they just concluded, well, It the scanning was fine.[1:50:03] Dr. Susanna Søberg: The experiment went well. It was just that he didn't have any brown fat. So he was like, well, we just in the paper called a a brown fat negative, so he didn't have any. And in in mice studies, it it would be called a knockout, so it didn't have any brown fat. So what the observation with him, and I think that would be that's interesting, is that he both Shivered very early on and didn't regulate his temperature as well.[1:50:29] Dr. Susanna Søberg: He also told me that then he was, like, A 5 on the scale of how comfortable he felt with the code. And[1:50:38] Andrew Huberman: Out of[1:50:39] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So it was from 1 to 10 Mhmm. And 5 being thermo comfortable, and 10 being, very, cold, and and one very hot. So on this slight scale up and up and down and he he was, like, more up and down on this scale than any of the others. It was an observation that I did. But we did see in his blood samples also that his blood samples looked a bit more like the control group.[1:51:06] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Also, his Insulin levels were, like, the control groups were a little bit higher than the other winter swimmers, and he also had, You his blood glucose clearance was not as fast as, as the the the other winter swimmers. So he was like an outlier, what we call and in the analysis, we also had to take him out, of the analysis because he was an outlier. So the results showing that the brown fat, is, more efficiently activated in the winter swimmers is without him having him in that group. Well, it didn't ruin the the study. If we I tried to put him in in as well and didn't it didn't ruin the the results or anything.[1:51:50] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But just to to keep it more clear, we put we took him out up the analysis. Mhmm.[1:51:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So he was a mutant, a knockout. Yeah. And I'm sure they're out there. Very interesting.[1:51:59] Andrew Huberman: So if you shiver early, then perhaps you have less brown fat to begin with. Although it's hard to conclude from 1 person, that's sort of the the the implication there.[1:52:08] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Or you haven't adapted to the code, you should build that up. Yeah.[1:52:12] Andrew Huberman: Right. So in addition to looking at regulation of blood sugar, round fat, metabolism and so on. Were there any markers that you examined in the deliberate cold exposure group as compared to controls, that reveal to you that deliberate cold exposure could have additional benefits, say for, immune system function, or for any function for that matter.[1:52:37] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. So for we looked at in inflammation. Of course, we measure the outcome of blood pressure and so on. But we also measured the IL 6 in the study just to see also an inflammatory, anti inflammatory marker. So IL 6 went up, and it also follows with the IL ten.[1:52:55] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So that is, like, also very known in the literature. So we measured that, and I think it's very important to To think about the cold exposure and the heat exposure as something that then lowers the inflammation in the body. And would if we can do that, We will have an open door for, preventing lifestyle diseases. Right? So for, type 2 diabetes, but, actually, also for some mental diseases as well, so as known as depression and anxiety and also Alzheimer's disease, which are all associated, in research also newer research showing that,[1:53:31] Andrew Huberman: that[1:53:31] Dr. Susanna Søberg: inflammation increases the risk of depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease with neurological diseases. So if we can decrease inflammation in the body, we will decrease, modern lifestyle diseases, but also these increasing mental diseases that we see in these modern lifestyle times. So I think that It's I think it's very interesting that we can go out in nature, and we can use these natural stressors. And it it I don't want to Have it sound very romantic or anything? It's just it's just exposure to temperature, actually, just a cold or to heat That is gonna trick our body into a natural state again and and reset it where the the the homeostasis, the balance has is lost a bit.[1:54:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So the body is gonna repair itself in that way, and I think it's beautiful that we can do that just by changing the temperature of our body. And although people are very scared of doing this because in our times, we have been away from cold, away from heat, Temperature, for some for decades now, since, we isolated our houses better And, we are more sedentary. We also sit more indoor. We don't move as much. So this very, modern Sedentary lifestyle has made us more temperature comfortable, just neutral.[1:54:53] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So no no wonder, I mean, that obesity is increasing. We don't expose ourselves to the natural stresses that we did early on, in in our evolvement, but us up until maybe the Seventies to sixties where we started having more, like, comfortable lifestyles. Right? And obesity increases in the in the eighties. We can see that from statistics.[1:55:17] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Think so. I think that if we can take in cold and heat, and, you mentioned other things also before, but, of course, exercise is very important here, and also a bit of fasting, actually, because it all increases the hormetic stress in the body. So it's doesn't have to be, other than natural stresses to the body, which then could keep us in that natural balance again.[1:55:40] Andrew Huberman: Could we talk about what I refer to as the sober principle, which is to end on cold. And the reason I called it the sober principle is because, in reviewing oh, by the way, I wasn't a Official reviewer of your paper. But, I mean, in reading and, reviewing your paper for its after published contents, I noticed that you had people end on cold, and this has been a long standing debate in the the, deliberate cold exposure community. Should you warm up in a with a warm shower afterwards as you get back in the sauna, what should you end on? End on cold or end on heat?[1:56:12] Andrew Huberman: And the sober principle says end on cold. As I understand it, In order to force your body to heat itself back up and thereby increase metabolism further still. Is that right?[1:56:25] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yes. So when you when you end on the cold, you you force your body to heat up by itself, and that will require that you activate. You keep your brown fat activated and also your muscles, which is a good thing. It's a good collaboration to keep your thermogenesis up. And that's like an an exercise even when you go home.[1:56:45] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So in that way, you don't have to think about your cold exposure dipping in in your plunge, Open Sea or what it is as just, an exercise that you do for 1 to 2 minutes, and then it's over. If you end on the cold, you have an exercise for your body going on for hours afterwards, and that's not only on your metabolism, but it's also Gonna keep your neurotransmitters, activated as well and increase that because your body is still cold. So you need that, Those neurotransmitters to activate the brown fat as well. So that's gonna make your brown fat cells more efficient and also your muscle cells more efficient, so increasing mitochondria in the cells, which will then generate heat very fast. So if you have done this for a few times, so maybe 3, 4, 5 times, being new to this, but have tried it a few times, you will notice a switch where you, like, feel that you get Easierly warmer, and you can keep yourself warmer.[1:57:42] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And that is also what we've shown in in my study is that the the winter swimmers were physically, warmer on the skin compared to the control group. So they they[1:57:52] Andrew Huberman: When they are out of the cold.[1:57:53] Dr. Susanna Søberg: When they're out of the cold. Just relaxing, And we tested this in in on the days where they were sleeping in the lab. So we could see that they had, a more activation of the brown fat, Higher temperature, so probably because they also lose heat. They have a high heat loss to the body, compared to the control group, because they have a more vascular skin, because of the contrast of cold and heat. So they lose heat Faster from the body during the day.[1:58:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But is that a bad thing? No. Probably not because that's gonna keep Your brown fat and your moss is a little bit activated, so we you will have to it it has to work to keep you warm.[1:58:36] Andrew Huberman: I and I would hypothesize that it also might lead to some of the, subjectively reported improvements in sleep. Because in order to fall asleep, you need your Core body temperature to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. Yes. So it's not just sufficient to be sleeping in a cold room and under the blanket. You also need your body temperature to drop.[1:58:54] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yes.[1:58:55] Andrew Huberman: And so what you're, saying if I understand correctly is that by forcing by ending on cold and forcing oneself to heat up naturally, that increases the brown fat stores, which I sort of see as, kinda like the oil in the candle Yeah. Of the furnace that is thermogenesis, and that in turn leads to increased Heat loss, which people might think, oh, I don't wanna lose heat from the body, but yet there are times when you want to lose heat from the body. Basically, it sounds like what we want is to be a very Efficient heating and cooling system. Yes. That it's not about being cold or being hot.[1:59:31] Andrew Huberman: It's really about keeping the system tuned Well, keeping the oil in the candle is brown fat, functioning. Yeah. What could I ask 1 question about, fed or fasted? Is there any rather, are there any known benefits of doing deliberate cold exposure and or sauna fasted, versus, after a a meal, say, within the last hour or something of that sort. I do my deliberate cold exposure first thing in the morning.[1:59:58] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. So in general, I'm fasting because I don't eat until a little bit later in the day. Yeah. But what's known about that, was that looked at in your study? I know you measured glucose, but that was as a separate, test away from the cold.[2:00:13] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Away from the cold. Yeah. But I also tested glucose on the days on the cold. So we measured that as well on on the cooling days. Specifically on fasting and fat, I don't know.[2:00:25] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I don't think that I have seen studies specifically on this.[2:00:29] Andrew Huberman: Okay. More science needed. A number of people ask about the use of deliberate cold exposure to offset some of the symptoms of various diseases. Now here, we're not talking about curing disease. We're talking about offsetting symptoms.[2:00:45] Andrew Huberman: 1 question I've seen quite often is whether or not people with Raynaud syndrome. This is a syndrome and my high school girlfriend had this syndrome, and I'll never forget. We went we're at a a school dance together, and, this was when we first started dating. And, had Raynaud's, which leads to very poor blood flow to the the, the extremities. And, And she was very cold, so she left to go to the bathroom and warm up her hands in the warm water.[2:01:10] Andrew Huberman: And I was left standing there at the dance, and people came up to me and asked, you know, Why I was there and who I was there with, and I kept telling them who I was with, and they didn't believe me because they couldn't believe that she would be with me. Made total sense if you knew me at the time. I was I I was way out of my league with her, at the time. I like to think eventually I caught up, but in any case, she was in the bathroom for about an hour. So at one point, I did consider the possibility that she had just left, but, indeed, she hadn't.[2:01:37] Andrew Huberman: She warmed her hands back up. But people with Raynaud suffer from this, from this thing of very, very cold extremities, the, their fingertips will even turn blue, you know, as if they were starting to get frostbitten. It's quite dramatic. And that question gets asked whether or not there's any use of cold to try and increase the, elasticity, the plasticity of the of the, small capillaries in vessels. By everything you've described, up until now, it seems like that would be a logical thing to do.[2:02:09] Andrew Huberman: And in addition to that, whether or not people with Autoimmune conditions, people with, any other types of conditions are known to benefit from deliberate cold exposure. I'm not aware of any studies, I get asked about this a lot, and there were a lot of questions about this for you in the in the Twitter feed.[2:02:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Thank you for those questions. And I get them as well on social media. And I have to say that I I haven't seen any studies directed, on this outcome on measuring Rehnoid's syndrome. I do know that it's it's, It's not that rare, actually, a problem, and I know that many women or more men women than men, suffer from this.[2:02:48] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But logically, it would help them if they expose their hands to cold and also heat to make the vest It's more vascular, but and I have heard from people saying that it had helped them, but also heard for some others saying it didn't help them.[2:03:04] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:03:04] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So Studies are needed on this specific topic, I think.[2:03:08] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:03:09] Dr. Susanna Søberg: I hurt my hands when I go into the COVID. I don't have this syndrome at all, but I keep my hands above the water.[2:03:16] Andrew Huberman: You do?[2:03:16] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. And I I do that. Often, I take a little bit of Swim, and then, of course, I have to have my hands in the water. But it helps me when I then get back to The daddy, and then take my hands up because then I can stand there for a little bit and get my 1 to 2 minutes exposure, and then I can go up Because then, otherwise, that would stop me from, being in the water enough time that I as long as I I would like to. So if people suffer from having this pain in the fingers, and it it can be very intense.[2:03:49] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:03:50] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So just take the hands up a bit from the water and the and that's gonna help you. Also, boots, Neoprene boots, it's gonna help on the feet. Some people have the hurt, feel the pain in the feet and or in the ankles, And that's gonna help them also a little bit.[2:04:04] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So there is no problem with keeping hands out or feet in, Neoprene booties, if people feel the need to do that. If that's what the if pain of the hands or feet is a barrier for people doing, deliberate cold exposure, then it seems it would be okay to do to keep hands out or to keep your feet in[2:04:24] Dr. Susanna Søberg: a good space. Because then you you do get the exposure, but, of course, Hands and feet are very potent, places in your body to get a fast activation, of your nervous system, of course. But if you can just you can also just dip them and then take them off. It's gone still gonna activate that, but you have your full body is covered in in the coke receptors. You'll have a full activation anyways.[2:04:49] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So[2:04:50] Andrew Huberman: You you are providing very information to people, because I know a number of people that do not like to put their hands in. I find that the more of my body I get in, the more comfortable I am. Cycle I don't know if it's psychologically and or physiologically. I find that if where there's an interface between the water and the cold, it's Most uncomfortable, so I prefer to just get everything under. I keep my head out.[2:05:12] Andrew Huberman: Although I'd these days, I've been dunking all the way in and then coming out and then dunking once more with my head under before I get out after the the plunge. That raises a different question. Now we're getting into kind of the practicalities of deliberate cold exposure, which I think are are important. Sometimes, I'll experience and I hear from a lot of people that they'll get a kind of back of the head headache At the interface of the of the water, you know, when they're in doing cold immersion to the neck. Okay.[2:05:40] Andrew Huberman: I assume this has to do with blood flow, that there's vasoconstriction right up until the neck and in the region surrounding it, but that maybe there's still blood flow to the head. But do we know what the origin of these, headaches is and, again, this doesn't happen for everybody, but some people do experience them.[2:05:55] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Okay. Yeah. I haven't really heard about that one specifically. So But I would say that there are different reasons for maybe keeping your head out of the water, but it seems like maybe for some, that could be a reason for, like, Just getting, like, a quick head dunk.[2:06:11] Andrew Huberman: It's too all the way in.[2:06:12] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Yeah.[2:06:13] Andrew Huberman: That's what I've started doing to eliminate I I wasn't getting headaches, but I couldn't I noticed that interface.[2:06:18] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Okay.[2:06:19] Andrew Huberman: And I wasn't in the rest of the experience it's so the experience of it so much, so I started dunking all the way in. I noticed in some of the photos that you've put out, and in your book that you'll sometimes wear a cap Yeah. While you go in.[2:06:30] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Okay. And, well, it comes from different reasons. So let's talk about some of the physiological reasons. So when you submerge in in cold water up to the neck, study have shown and this is from Denmark studies from hospital, that, when you submerge into cold water up to the neck at 0 degrees, so 0 degrees Celsius, very cold.[2:06:55] Dr. Susanna Søberg: You will have a decreased blood flow to the brain by around 30 to 40%, And makes sense because you activate the sympathetic nervous system, and and, therefore, you will have a less blood flow to the brain. It makes you maybe a little bit dizzier. And[2:07:09] Andrew Huberman: Proof again that you're you need a heart more than a brain because when the sympathetic nervous system gets activated, blood flow is maintained to the heart keep you alive, but, obviously, taken away from the brain to keep you from thinking. That's why it's hard to think when you're stressed.[2:07:22] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Well, the muscles and then then your vital organs need to you have to be able to run away from that tiger. Right?[2:07:28] Andrew Huberman: The the rationale makes total sense. And Yeah. Who am I to disagree with mother nature? Yeah. Right.[2:07:33] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Well, But yeah. So one of the reasons being that you should keep your head out of the water is that you could increase that, decrease in block flow to the brain further if you dump the head. So there's just a very nice paper from, from a research group in Canada where they have collectively, looked at different papers where they, compared heat loss in a crew in the papers where they dunked the head and compared to heat loss, submerging up to the neck to see how much extra heat do we lose from our core when we dunk the head. So, and I think it's very interesting that if you submerge up to the neck, you have a heat loss of 11% from the body core. And when you then, also dunk the head, you will increase that heat loss rate by 36%.[2:08:28] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So that means I'm not saying that I'm not I'm not here to say what is right and what is wrong. I just think that people should know the information So they can, for themselves, evaluate what is best for them. But if you increase your heat loss rate by 36% from your core, That's gonna increase your after drop, which we touched upon a little bit earlier, even further. So that's meaning that you are closer to hypothermia than you are if you just submerge up to the neck. So you should really think about whether this is, like, something that you want to do or if it's just better for you not And because we swim in the open sea in Denmark, we have a lot of wind.[2:09:15] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Our wind our conditions are just very rainy, very windy. And when the temperature is also freezing, you could get this, what is that called? So very cold and light headed just from wind. So if you also submerge into cold war and you then get up, you could you will get a brain freeze immediately.[2:09:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[2:09:36] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So it is enough to just go up to the neck, Wear a beanie to just not get dizzy also because the the, the heat loss is increased, of course, but it also the blood flow to the brain has decreased. So the beanie will keep you a little bit warmer so you can stay for 1 to 2 minutes. So it's just a way of, like, getting around some of the conditions also. So people can choose that if they they feel that, but it's quite normal, to do in in Scandinavia where a beanie.[2:10:04] Andrew Huberman: I love it. And, so for those of you afraid of doing a 2 minute cold shower, what, doctor Silbergh just described, let's, you see how, she and others are capable of doing things far harder than that. When the way you describe it with the cold wind in Scandinavia and, is is quite striking. Along the lines of covering the head, there's this, seemingly paradoxical, thing of people going into hot saunas and wearing wool caps. You know, if you go to a banya or you go to a sauna and there are People who are, well, from Eastern Europe or typically or Finland or, Russia or, Ukraine or elsewhere, what you'll see is that many of them are wearing wool caps in the sauna, which many people think is to make it hotter.[2:10:53] Andrew Huberman: That's actually not the case. It actually insulates To you from the heat environment, the urge the sense of urgency to get out of the hot sauna is a brain driven mechanism. And so, the reason that people wear wool hats in the sauna is it actually lets you stay in the sauna longer, because It takes a lot of heat to the skin before you feel that you you'd have, quote unquote, have to get out, whereas so when you Insulate the brain, you don't get that signal. It's pretty interesting. I've tried this before just by putting a towel over my head in the sauna, and you can stay in there, you know, much more easily and for for much longer.[2:11:28] Andrew Huberman: You know, as we talk about these different stimuli for, the hormetic response, the adaptation to stress, You know, it occurs to me that the the big ones in our evolutionary history have been light. Right? I mean, you were talking about seasonal changes. We know there especially as you go up to Nordic countries, there are seasonal changes in the amount of light by time of year, dramatic ones, in fact. Dramatic ones.[2:11:52] Andrew Huberman: Less so at the equator, Of course. Yeah. Light, temperature, food, movement, and it it's sort of interesting. And and at the same time, Perhaps it should have been obvious to us that there are stimuli that our bodies have evolved to adapt to in very powerful ways. And so the idea that temperature, heat, and cold could evoke these tremendous physiological changes that are beneficial for us Probably shouldn't surprise us at all.[2:12:23] Andrew Huberman: I mean I mean, this is why we I mean, these are not, so esoteric mechanisms. They're actually the the foundational mechanisms by which our our body and the bodies of other animals adapt. So I do have a question about the, different ways that people could approach deliberate cold exposure. So for instance, children. I've been to where there are kids, you know, 6 or 7 years old with their parents at the, and so they're in hot sauna.[2:12:53] Andrew Huberman: I'm not suggesting people do this if they're if they're not, you know, adapted to it, and, you know, talk to your parents' kids and talk to your kids' parents. Talk to your doctors. But it's remarkable. I mean, children doing sauna from a young age or deliberate cold exposure. Are there any data on this, and is it safe assuming that, you know, obviously, that They can swim and or they're doing this in a in a tub or shower.[2:13:15] Andrew Huberman: And then I'd also like to ask you about, are there any additional male female Differences. I know your study focused, on men, but, other studies have focused on both, and you, of course, are a woman and can attest to your own experience with this. So children, men, women, differences there, in terms of protocols, is there anything that people should build into the structure of of their deliberate cold exposure that's unique to that?[2:13:42] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So, Yeah. So this was done on cold exposures. So, yeah, I think that, starting with the the question about children, I think that it's important to to think about as children are smaller than adults, so we cannot really Completely transfer all the information and the benefits and also protocols for how long and and and stuff like that. 2 children. We cannot do that because they are just smaller in mass.[2:14:09] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And one study that actually, approves this It's a study where they have, compared heat loss, in children, boys, who were 12 years old, compared to, adults, men, and looked at heat loss of the core temperature and expose them to a a 1 or 1 or 2 minutes, cold exposure, so immersion up to the neck. And what they saw was that the the the boys in this study could actually defend the core temperature in Same way as the adults could, but they had to use their muscles way faster. So it means that They couldn't stay for as long, and they use more energy to defend their core temperature compared to the to the adults. But For 1 minute, it seems that they could actually come, but they will be colder when the then come out because they are Smaller in the mass to their ratio. Right?[2:15:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So it means that if the surface is so large on children and Their mass and muscles being smaller to that ratio, it means that they can be in the water, less time before they get hypothermic. So just think about that. They are just smaller. They can't defend their temperature for a very long time. But in this study, they saw that For up to I think it it was a minute or so.[2:15:36] Dr. Susanna Søberg: They could 1 minute. 1 minute. Yeah.[2:15:38] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you mentioned hypothermia and smaller bodied, people children. I used to do some, Pacific, ocean swims in the morning, without wet suits, and I adapted to it pretty quickly. And these are fairly long swims, and we brought an excellent swimmer with us, So that was interning with me for a while, is 16 years old at the time and, very lean. And, he wasn't small for his age, but he was smaller than us Yeah. Than the there was all guys on the swim that day.[2:16:08] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes women join us. And he Got hypothermic, and he's an excellent swimmer, and he didn't report feeling overly cold. But, fortunately, we got him to shore and heated him up again. So he lived. I don't think his mother is gonna ever let him go swimming with us again.[2:16:25] Andrew Huberman: He's thriving in the world. He's a university student now, and he recalls that swim I mean, this is why you always wanna ocean swim with a buddy, with people. Yeah. He he became hypothermic. His teeth turned yellow.[2:16:39] Andrew Huberman: He was slurring his words. He wasn't making sense. You know, we got him on the shore, and he was kind of, you know, drooling and a little Semi euphoric and then kind of you know, it was, hypothermia is no joke. So I think, yeah. So I I I'm really glad that this is coming up because The cold is a powerful stimulus, and, and I and kids are at a and smaller bodied people are at a greater risk of hypothermia, so A good reason to approach it with caution.[2:17:03] Andrew Huberman: Maybe start with cold showers, get, then cold immersion in still water. Natural water and open bodies of water, of course, are always gonna be, more dangerous for other reasons, currents and things of that sort.[2:17:14] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Exactly.[2:17:15] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[2:17:15] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And drowning. Yeah.[2:17:16] Andrew Huberman: So important note there. What about any additional male female differences or similarities that, we should be aware of? And this comes up all the time on social media. Anytime I Post anything about a study. It's it's what about women?[2:17:29] Andrew Huberman: Because oftentimes, there are differences.[2:17:31] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. Yeah. And and and there are we we also just talked about the difference in in in in temperature in men and women. So it means that if we did if we replicated my study in women, it could be that They would, have enough, you can say, cold exposure with just 9 minutes per week. It could be because they, apparently, are also just Colder and, and they have, increased metabolism.[2:17:59] Dr. Susanna Søberg: The brown fat is just they have more brown fat. It could be, but this is just something that I I I I frankly don't know, but women also do a cold exposure winter swimming with the 11 minutes protocol. I do it myself and feel good about it. So I would say that, women, also regarding activation of the brown fat, it should be the same, In theory, but I don't know if women actually do need to have another protocol when it comes to this rapid Cold exposure. I think that is another question if we are talking about ice swimming when it comes to how far can you be in the cold water without getting hypothermic, Then there will be differences, in men and and and female.[2:18:44] Dr. Susanna Søberg: But but if you do this cold exposure for a very brief amount of time, which is what I try to to talk to talk about the what what we call also microstressing the body to to increase the hormetic stress, the healthy stress, Then this is such a short amount of, ex exposure that it it's fairly the same. I think I think women can look at this as a fairly good protocol for for for them as well.[2:19:11] Andrew Huberman: I always say that if you really dread the cold and, and don't like the cold, then you are a perfect candidate for using deliberate cold exposure because the sympathetic, aka the stress response, would be greater, And, thereby, the adaptation to that shorter 1 or 2 minutes is, is going to be much greater. Right? For people that are perfectly comfortable in the cold, it's harder to get a an adaptation response. The same way that if somebody's very strong and they can lift A very heavy weight that that had very heavy weight is unlikely to evoke the same kind of or same degree of Yeah. Of, adaptive responses if somebody is not quite as strong.[2:19:48] Andrew Huberman: So Another reason to keep these exposures relatively short[2:19:51] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah.[2:19:52] Andrew Huberman: And more frequent than to do longer duration exposures frequently. However, let's say somebody only had 2 days a week, to do deliberate cold exposure. Maybe they don't have access to a sauna. Maybe they do. Would you suggest that they get in for 1 or 2 minutes, then get out, then get back in for another couple of minutes, then get out and call that for, You know, 4 or 5 minutes, to try and get to that 11 minutes total per week, as opposed to getting in for a full 5 minutes, and then getting out and coming back a 2nd time that week.[2:20:26] Andrew Huberman: I know this is getting down into the weeds, but these are the sorts of things that I think people really want to know because A lot of people either don't live close to a body of water or don't have a cold plunge, that they can do this with although cold shower apparently works too. So, most people live close to a shower.[2:20:43] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. So definitely, I think the the changes in temperature is what is Strengthening your your cells in the body. So if you can do the short amount of, exposure and then get out and get back in, That is gonna you can say, strengthen yourselves because you are challenging them to to adapt to, changing temp temperatures. So during 1 session, you can change this. Right?[2:21:11] Dr. Susanna Søberg: You you can do it if you are able to go to Cold water, but also a sauna, then you just do that automatically, and you will have a change in temperature. But you could also do it by varying the temperature in your cold plunge if you have If you have a plunge or if you have the open sea or you have seasoning seasons even, you have we have that in Denmark, so we have 4 seasons, And the temperature is gonna vary with that. So we have nature who can just change this for us, and we don't have to think about it. But if you have a cold plunge, Well, then I would say that changing the temperature is what is gonna create this hormetic stress and also keep your Cells on its toes, you can say, because you are try the body will still be, stressed to try to adapt to the new temperature As it's seen as something actually toxic to the body. Right?[2:21:59] Dr. Susanna Søberg: It's a small small piece of toxicity that you are exposing yourself to. You don't have to swallow it, but it's enough that you touch it, actually.[2:22:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Great, great way to frame it. That brings me back to this idea of circadian time. In your study, you didn't, control for specific time of day, and now I'm realizing that may be a great asset to the whole thing. So we know, for instance, that our bodies go through pretty dramatic shifts in temperature from the time we wake up.[2:22:28] Andrew Huberman: Our body starts heating up as we wake up and, continues to heat until the afternoon, and then starts to drop in the later afternoon. And then assuming all things are working correctly, that body temperature drops and we sleep. So I could imagine that doing deliberate cold exposure at different times, just by way of convenience or by way of intention, could be very beneficial because my body temperature is going to be quite a bit warmer at one time of day versus another, and in that way, keeping the system tuned. That's really what I keep hearing coming through in as you explain these data and all these, beautiful studies, yours and others, is that it's not really about getting cold. It's about going from warm to cold and from cold to warm.[2:23:09] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. It's not it and I love this Idea because I I probably said this a 100 times on my podcast and a 1000000 times in my life, and I'll continue to, which is that biology is not an event. It's a process. Like, these These, metabolic and thermoregulatory processes are indeed like the turning of a knob. It's a verb.[2:23:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's as opposed to a noun. And I and so I I think if people can internalize that idea that they're going to, have a lot more flexibility, a lot more fun, and and get a lot more benefit As opposed to thinking, okay. I need to get into x degrees of water for x amount of time on x number of days Yeah. You know, in a very rigid way.[2:23:49] Dr. Susanna Søberg: All the time. Yeah. How much and how cold? And and, I mean, it's the it's just like well, because we also don't have studies showing exactly if you just keep 5 degrees in your water and you do that for a month, then what happens? We maybe in the future, we will know much more about this, and I'm I'm sure it's gonna come.[2:24:06] Dr. Susanna Søberg: And I really hope so. But I just think by logically changing that temperature up and down, up and down, and you also do that in your water, it doesn't really It's not that important what temperature you you will have your water then, then just keep changing it, going up and down. It could be all up to 12 degrees Celsius. You're gonna activate your brown fat anyways. I mean, 12, 19 degrees, cold air is enough to activate your brown fat.[2:24:32] Dr. Susanna Søberg: So maybe we don't have to go as Cold as I think many people think, and putting ice even all the time, it you don't have to. It's not I don't think it's necessary to To expose yourself to that cold, temperature all the time, but vary it a bit.[2:24:49] Andrew Huberman: So keep the system off balance, and it's the way to keep it tuned. Yeah. You mentioned a study that is more recent or an ongoing that's not published. Or, if you're willing, could you share maybe some of the, data from that, Our findings from that study, with, of course, the the cue to everybody that these are not yet published data so that the conclusions could change the data could change for that matter.[2:25:13] Dr. Susanna Søberg: Yeah. So we we haven't analyzed all the data yet, and I I know from the study that we did publish that We we would need to look more at the data. So I don't really have any results yet that I can share because we are still in very preliminary analysis of this. So I wouldn't know yet what to exactly say about it, but what we looked at was both men and women, my friend. So that's that's coming.[2:25:38] Andrew Huberman: Oh, that's fantastic. I that answer is going to please a great number of people Yeah. And and intrigue everybody. So, Well, listen, I I want to really thank you for coming here today to talk about your work, and the incredible direction that it points to because I think that, you know, No one study is definitive, but your study really, again, stands as a landmark in the landscape of Exploring deliberate cold exposure and heat, how it can impact and potentially impact our health because, Frankly, there just haven't been that many, high resolution, detailed modern studies of this. There have been studies of sauna.[2:26:24] Andrew Huberman: There have been some studies of cold. There are a lot of groups physiology that work on, hypothermia and very cold exposure, but, most of the temperatures used in those days just aren't practical. So first of all, I just wanna thank you doing the work that you've done and for the work that you continue to do. I'm, waiting with bated breath, as they say, to, to hear the results of this study that's ongoing on both men and women. So, we'll have to have you back to to inform us about that soon.[2:26:51] Andrew Huberman: And I wanna thank you for, the incredible public education efforts that you've been doing on social media, and with respect to your book, and we, of course, will put links to all of those things in the show note captions so people can learn from you and can continue to learn from you. We We certainly need more scientists who are both experienced with doing hardcore research, as it's called, and who also do the practices. Think that's a wonderful additional asset. You know, you're not just behind a lab coat or bundled up in a in a down, in a down feather jacket as everyone else is getting into the cold, you do these things, and that you, are so open and generous in the way that you share, knowledge, which includes coming here today to to share knowledge with me and, our audience. So thank you ever so much.[2:27:40] Dr. Susanna Søberg: You're very welcome. I am so pleased to be here, and thank you so much for inviting me. And I could explain my study, and I can share some of my insights from from doing that. I'm very grateful for being here.[2:27:52] Andrew Huberman: Delighted, and we'll have to have you back again. Thank you for joining me for today's discussion all about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure Science and protocols with doctor Susanna Soberg.

That's the best way to support this podcast. Not so much on today's episode, but on various previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing sleep, focus, and hormone support. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered with Momentous Supplements.[2:29:04] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to hear more about the supplements you're not already following the Huberman Lab Podcast on social media, we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. And on all those places, I focus on material that somewhat overlaps with content from the Huberman Lab Podcast, but often is distinct from the content covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels. For those of you that haven't already subscribed to our so called Neural Network newsletter, this is a completely zero cost monthly newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes and so called toolkits. Toolkits are lists of about a page to 2 pages long that give the critical tools, For instance, for optimizing sleep or for neuroplasticity or deliberate cold exposure or deliberate heat exposure, optimizing dopamine.[2:29:56] Andrew Huberman: Again, all available to you at zero cost. Simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab in the corner, scroll down to newsletter. You provide us your email. We do not share your email with anybody. And in addition to that, There are samples of toolkits on the hubermanlab.com website, again, under newsletter, and you don't even have to sign up to access those.[2:30:16] Andrew Huberman: But I think most people do end up signing up for the newsletter because it's rich with useful information and, again, completely zero cost. Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with doctor Susanna Soberg. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
