I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Casey Halpern. Doctor Halpern is the chief of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. His laboratory focuses on bulimia, Binge eating disorder and other forms of obsessive compulsive behaviors.[0:00:29] Andrew Huberman: Normally, when we hear about eating disorders or obsessive compulsive disorders of other kinds, the conversation quickly migrates to pharmacologic interventions and serotonin or dopamine or talk therapy interventions, many of which can be effective. The Halpern Laboratory, however, takes an entirely different approach. While they embrace pharmacologic and behavioral and talk therapy interventions, their main focus is the development and application of engineered devices to go directly into the brain and stimulate the neurons, the nerve cells that generate compulsions, that Cause people to want to eat more even when their stomach is full. In other words, they do brain surgery of various kinds, sometimes removing small bits of brain, sometimes Stimulating small bits of brain with electrical current and even stimulating the brain through the intact skull, that is without having to drill down beneath the skull in order to alleviate and indeed sometimes cure these conditions. Today's discussion with doctor Halpern was an absolutely fascinating one for me Because it represents the leading edge of what's happening in modification of brain circuits and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease.[0:01:33] Andrew Huberman: For instance, they just recently published a paper in Nature Medicine, one of the premier journals out there entitled pilot Study of responsive nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation for loss of control eating. The nucleus accumbens is an area of our brains that we all have. In fact, we have 2 of them, 1 on each side of the brain, that is intimately involved in the release of dopamine for particular motivated behaviors. And while most often we think about dopamine for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in, in this context, they are using stimulation and control of neuronal activity in nucleus To control loss of control eating, something that when people suffer from it, despite knowing that they shouldn't eat, despite not even wanting to eat, they find themselves was eating. So, again, this represents really the leading edge of where neuroscience is going, and it certainly is going to be an area of neuroscience that's going to expand in the years to come.[0:02:24] Andrew Huberman: And doctor Halpern and the members of his laboratory are among a very small group of scientists in the world that are using the types of approaches that I described a minute ago and that you're gonna hear more about in today's episode in order to resolve some of the most difficult and debilitating human conditions. During today's discussion, you will also learn about the use of deep brain stimulation and other approaches for the treatment of movement disorders such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, and various types of dystonias, which are challenges in generating particular types of movement. So whether or not you or somebody that you know Suffers from an eating disorder, from obsessive compulsive disorder, or from a movement disorder, today's episode is sure to teach you not only about what's happening those arenas, but also in the arenas of neuroscience generally. In fact, I would say today's episode is especially important for anyone that wants to understand how the brain works and what the future of brain modification really looks like for all of us. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:03:24] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were created with performance in mind.[0:03:50] Andrew Huberman: I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with a number of very important challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. For instance, when you go from a sunny area to a more shaded area and then back out again. It's a very complex process. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were built that is engineered with that sort of biology in mind. And as a consequence, no matter where you are wearing them and where you happen to be, you always see through them with crystal clarity.[0:04:16] Andrew Huberman: The aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses is also worth mentioning. Unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there, which only come in the kind of Cyborg variety. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses come in those varieties, but they also come in varieties that you would feel very comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work or to School, really anywhere that you go. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's Roka, roka.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout.[0:04:45] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking ability. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the close relationship between temperature and your ability to stay asleep and emerge from sleep. The way 8 Sleep mattress covers work is that they allow you to program the temperature of your mattress so that you can fall asleep quickly, get into deep sleep, stay in deep sleep, and emerge from that sleep feeling especially rested by Dropping the temperature of that surface by 1 to 3 degrees at the beginning of the night, dropping a little bit further into the night, and then raising the temperature towards morning because waking up requires that One to 3 degree re increase in body temperature. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for the last 6 months or so now, and I can Assert that it is the absolute biggest game changer in the quality and duration of my sleep.[0:05:34] Andrew Huberman: In fact, I don't really like traveling as much as I used to because the The 8 Sleep doesn't go with me, and they don't seem to have them yet in Airbnbs and hotels. So this is also a call to action. Airbnbs and hotels, please put 8 Sleep mattresses on your beds, and I'll be more apt to stay in those hotels and Airbnbs. With that said, if you'd like to try an 8 Sleep mattress cover, Can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman. Check out the pod 3 cover to save $150 at checkout.[0:05:59] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman. And please note that 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, 8 sleep.com/huberman save $150 at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition Form that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.[0:06:23] Andrew Huberman: Now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason That many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. One of the major issues with the various blood tests out there is that you get information back about lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they make knowing what to do with the information you get about your biological health extremely easy. They have this very easy to use dashboard, and that dashboard tells you, for Since what to change in your nutrition, what supplements you may want or may not want to take, as well as other behavioral and other types of interventions that can allow you to move those numbers related to metabolic hormone and other factors into the precise range that's optimal for your immediate and long term health. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com Slash Huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.[0:07:15] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them. Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep, or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability, or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels to optimal range for you. The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.[0:07:41] Andrew Huberman: We partner with Momentous for a number of important reasons. First of all, the quality of their ingredients is exceptional. It's really second to none. Second of all, they ship internationally, and that was important to us because a number of you reside outside of the United States. 3rd, we've worked with Momentous very closely to develop single ingredient formulations.[0:07:58] Andrew Huberman: Now this turns out to be very important because if you're going to take supplements, You want to know what's working for you and what isn't. And, of course, you wanna optimize the cost efficiency and the biological efficiency of those supplements. To find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to live momentous, spelled ous, live momentous.com/huberman. I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.[0:08:26] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Casey Halpern. Casey, I should say, doctor Halpern, for those listening. Welcome. Thank you.[0:08:34] Dr. Casey Halpern: Great to be here.[0:08:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's been a Long time coming. We were colleagues at Stanford, and then recently, you moved, of course, to University of Pennsylvania, also an Incredible institution. We're we're sorry to lose you. So[0:08:46] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's bittersweet for me too.[0:08:47] Andrew Huberman: Stanford's loss is UPenn's gain, but, let's talk about your work, Past and present. As I've told the listeners already, you're a neurosurgeon, which I consider the astronauts of neuroscience, Because you're in somewhat uncharted territory or very uncharted territory, and yet precision is everything. Right? The The margins of error are very, very small. So for those that aren't familiar with the differences between neurosurgery, neurology, psychiatry, You just educate us a bit.[0:09:19] Andrew Huberman: What does a neurosurgeon do, and what does the fact that you're a neurosurgeon Do for your view of the brain. How do you think about and conceptualize the brain?[0:09:30] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. Yeah. The scope of neurosurgery is quite broad. When I was in medical school, I I was drawn to neurosurgery because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation. When I was at Penn as a college student, I actually watched my first Deep brain stimulation surgery performed by Gordon Balchuk who to to date is one of my career mentors.[0:09:50] Dr. Casey Halpern: Deep brain stimulation is One surgery that neurosurgeons offer, but it's actually sort of a very small minority of what neurosurgery does. You know, we take out brain tumors. We clip aneurysms in the brain. We take care of patients that have had traumatic brain injury, concussion, spine surgery is 90% of what neurosurgeons do around the country, you know, taking care of herniated discs and lumbar fusions. So, You know, the the scope is the entire central nervous system, include including the peripheral nervous system.[0:10:27] Dr. Casey Halpern: We take care of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and nerve disorders. Now over the course of the past 2 decades or so, there's been a a mission in the field to to subspecialize. And so, Historically, neurosurgeons did everything in that domain, but now we subspecialize, and and I'm lucky to be at Penn Medicine where We can focus on one of these areas. So I'm, chief of stereotactic functional neurosurgery. All I do is deep brain stimulation surgery, and a compliment to that is focused ultrasound or transcranial focus ultrasound, which is a noninvasive way to do an ablation In the brain, recently FDA approved, and it's FDA approved for tremor at the moment.[0:11:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: These 2 procedures are, For me, my everyday, but, still the minority of what neurosurgeons have to offer. The majority of neurosurgery in my mind is is a bit more structural than it is physiology or Deeply rooted in in how the brain functions. When we take out a brain tumor, we have to find a a safe Trajectory to get to the brain tumor, and then we remove it, and we help the patient recover in the ICU similar to a brain aneurysm. Often, we don't have to go into the brain to clip a brain aneurysm, but we go around the brain or under the brain to get there. And in my mind, those surgeries are a bit more structural.[0:11:56] Dr. Casey Halpern: Deep brain stimulation, the surgery that I do routinely, is a procedure where, yes, there there is Structure involved, of course. We have to place a, a very thin wire that's insulated deep into, a part of the brain that's involved in Parkinson's disease, for example, but that's actually not the therapy. The therapy is delivering electrical stimulation Through the tip of that wire or one of the tips as there actually are multiple contacts at the bottom of the wire. They're very small. But that's all done out of the operating room.[0:12:32] Dr. Casey Halpern: You know, this stimulation wire is connected to a a battery pack or a pulse generator that's Kind of like a pacemaker. And so we deliver this therapy, and I always tell patients, it's a bit more like I have to implant a, a tool to to deliver you a medication, but that medication is gonna be in the form of electricity, and it's gonna be delivered into a very small region of the brain. And it's that procedure that's inspired me to not just become a neurosurgeon, but, has really defined the focus of my research laboratory as well.[0:13:06] Andrew Huberman: Maybe by way of anecdote, you could tell us one of the more outrageous or surprising Or who knows, delightful and thrilling things about the brain that you've observed as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas. You know, in textbooks, we always hear about, the kind of dark stuff. You know, stimulate 1 brain area, somebody goes into a rage, stimulate another brain area, Person starts laughing uncontrollably. 1st of all, given that some of the information let's hope not much, but some of the information in textbooks is incorrect. Is Are those sorts of statements true?[0:13:41] Andrew Huberman: Can one observe those in the clinic? And what are some of the more interesting, and I don't necessarily mean entertaining, but, surprising things that you've seen when you've poked around in the brain, deliberately, of course. And, what have you seen? What have you heard? I have[0:13:59] Dr. Casey Halpern: to say I I I am amazed by these effects, every day. Yeah. I'm very privileged to be able to interact with the human brain in this way. It's always in them With the goal of trying to provide somebody with a meaningful therapy. But when we deliver electrical stimulation, You know, the these electrodes, while they might be sitting in a very small region of the brain, there are regions within a few millimeters of where these electrodes are that if stimulated could cause a temporary, very brief side effect, a a moment of laughter like you said, or a moment of panic.[0:14:31] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, of course, we can just shut that electrode off. But often these side effects could be therapeutic. And, actually, that's how we have discovered ways to use deep brain stimulation, not just for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, but for example, patients with Parkinson's disease that have a psychiatric, comorbidity like depression or obsessive compulsive disorder. A lot of these patients are highly compulsive, and impulsive. Sometimes these problems actually melt away.[0:15:03] Dr. Casey Halpern: And we're trying to help their tremor, but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue has gotten better Or their mood has improved. And why is that? Well, you know, there's probably more than one reason. You know? You can help somebody's mood by making their tremor go away, of course, But we see laughter in the clinic sometimes.[0:15:19] Dr. Casey Halpern: And and why is that? And that's because we're stimulating parts of the brain that are not just involved in these Motor circuits, but they're also involved in what we call a limbic circuit or or part of the brain involved in emotion. And if we learn how to Modulate those areas therapeutically, step by step. We can actually develop these therapies for other indications like depression. I would say The most impressive and consistent effect we have when we have a patient with tremor who has been tremoring for the past 20 years, if we can deliver stimulation through that electrode in the clinic, We have immediate relief of tremor, and that is the effect that inspired me to be a neurosurgeon when I was in college.[0:15:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: I've never really wanted to do anything else except Help develop that type of therapeutic for an other another kind of symptom. I'm very interested in obesity and related eating disorders, Compulsive behavior, the urge to, to to have something that might be delicious, but dangerous or unhealthy or, a drug, or a compulsion like we see in OCD or test of compulsive disorder. Interestingly, Like, we see tremor melt away when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain. We can see these psychiatric, More psychiatric problems. They're not all psychiatric disorders, but let's say, disorders of the brain.[0:16:42] Dr. Casey Halpern: We can see symptoms of those disorders also improve and often immediately just like we do with tremor. So, I see it all the time to to to pick out 1, would be would be a challenge because, for me, this is my my everyday. The[0:16:57] Andrew Huberman: speed of the relief that you described for tremor is really, incredible. Just thinking about drug therapies, and There are 2 there are side effects, but there are, still a lot of mysteries as to, for instance, why SSRIs even work when they work.[0:17:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes. And The timing is always a challenge.[0:17:16] Andrew Huberman: Timing, dosage. Yes. Absolutely. I'd love to Learn more from you about OCD. I I have several reasons for asking this.[0:17:26] Andrew Huberman: First of all, I'm a somewhat obsessive person. I tend to be very very narrowly focused. Although I confess it's not a step function. It takes me some time to turn off the chatter, but once I'm into a thought train or a mode of Being, and thinking and work, it's very hard for me to exit that that mode. It's like a deep trench.[0:17:45] Andrew Huberman: Adaptive in some circumstances, less adaptive in others as you know. The other is that when I was a kid, I had a little bit of a grunting tick. I used to I had a a this intense, intense desire to clear my throat, to the point where my my dad Said, look. You need to stop that. He used to squeeze my hand every time I do it, and I used to hide in the back seat of the car or in the closet to do it because it provided so much relief.[0:18:09] Andrew Huberman: Real and then it eventually passed. Yes. I wasn't medicated. They never did anything about it. Every once in a while now, if I'm, very fatigued, I've been working a lot.[0:18:18] Andrew Huberman: I noticed it starts to come back. I'll do this, like, kind of grunting. And so it's been sort of like a a pet neurological symptom for me That reminds me that these these circuits exist in all of us, and that sometimes they go haywire, and sometimes they just have subtle, You know, over excitation or something of that sort. And then the third reason is that I get thousands of questions about OCD. You perhaps just tell us what is OCD?[0:18:44] Andrew Huberman: Sure. What are some brain areas involved? What are the current range of treatments? And What's the difference between someone who is obsessive and somebody who has true OCD?[0:18:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: So a a brief disclosure. As a as a neurosurgeon, I do take care of patients with severe obsessive compulsive disorder. But my perspective on OCD may be a little bit different than a psychiatrist who who Lives and breathes OCD and sees patients every single day with OCD. I probably take care of a 3 to 5 patients a year with deep brain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder. So I don't see these patients as routinely, but my laboratory is geared As a researcher, I'm very focused on trying to improve outcomes of deep brain stimulation for for OCD.[0:19:33] Dr. Casey Halpern: So I I do feel I have, expertise and and a perspective to share, but just a a brief disclosure. I I do feel that as a neurosurgeon, I am obligated to better understand where the obsessions in the brain come from and how we can interrupt them to stop the compulsion that's associated with the obsession, sort of the intrinsic most feature of OCD, better than we're actually doing it. For example, if we were to offer a patient with tremor, Deep brain stimulation surgery. Of course, there's some risk to the procedure, but the outcome is so consistent and positive that many patients are willing to take on that risk. For obsessive compulsive disorder, The surgery risk is about the same.[0:20:26] Dr. Casey Halpern: However, the benefit is not quite as robust. And so a lot of patients, and their referring psychiatrists, are reluctant to refer these patients to us, and it's completely understandable. I've been, leading an endeavor with a number of collaborators around the country to try to better understand these circuits in the brain, study them in humans, both invasively and noninvasively. That would be with an electrode based surgery, sort of like we do in epilepsy to understand where seizures come from. We wanna understand better where obsessions come from, but we're also working with imaging experts and geneticists to understand OCD, at a broader level as well.[0:21:06] Dr. Casey Halpern: I'd I'll I consider OCD to be a a spectrum disorder in a way, and I I I apologize to those who Who might feel that I'm using that term incorrectly. I I'm using it in a way to describe patients that have obsessions and even some related compulsions Might not meet criteria for OCD. It may be something, Andrew, that that you have. And as a neurosurgeon, I'm really Obsessive about safety and compulsive about my surgical procedures. So, you know, I I think that some aspect of OCD, which we often joke about but we should, know, consider seriously because people do suffer from this.[0:21:45] Dr. Casey Halpern: Some aspect of it helps us. There are, you know, Famous, CEOs that probably have some level of OCD, surgeons and scientists alike. So, Perhaps if it can be controlled, it's an asset. And, but if it goes awry and is uncontrollable, then it becomes Obsessive compulsive disorder. And, I tend to see the patients that are the most severe.[0:22:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: So they have failed medication, and there are Multiple medications that are worth trying for OCD, some can actually be very helpful.[0:22:18] Andrew Huberman: Which which neurotransmitter systems do they tend to poke at?[0:22:21] Dr. Casey Halpern: Well, SSRIs are sort of the the first, line for OCD, but also tricyclics can be helpful. So this is still the serotonin system. But as we know, the serotonin system interacts with the, You know, noradrenergic system and the dopamine system, so it's hard to, be specific to one of these things. And I think that's also why it's hard for us to predict how these medications are going to to work for these kinds of patients. But tricyclics and SSRIs can be very helpful and are definitely first line, and there's others.[0:22:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exposure response prevention is, probably the most effective option, which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy, but these are different and offered by psychologists. And this is a whole field, and there's a, a field, or I should say a whole clinic at my institution, focused and started by Edna Foa, at Penn who this is what they do for these patients, is offer these types of cognitive therapies, exposure To the stressor and to try to get patients to habituate to whatever it is that stresses them and causes these, compulsions To help these patients live in every day and and function, the these are all fabulously helpful pay, therapies for a variety of patients, but There's still about 30% of patients that still suffer from OCD, and some of them have severe OCD. Sometimes it's moderate to severe. And those are the patients that I'm really Motivated to try to help. Our therapies for those patients right now, I would say are are worth pursuing, but not optimal.[0:23:59] Dr. Casey Halpern: And so it's it's one of those things that we have to balance as a researcher because when you see patients like this, you wanna do everything you can to help them. And I think it's important to educate Patients on the risk and benefits of them. This is deep brain stimulation surgery, but also capsulotomy, which is more of an ablation approach. A little bit like deep brain stimulation, but rather than delivering stimulation through an electrode, you can actually heat the tissue and even destroy it. Some would say this part of the brain is very safe to destroy.[0:24:25] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's kind of like an appendix. Others would say it's safer to modulate. I have seen, patients do very well with these ablations. And so, you know, you asked me earlier what what I find so amazing about the brain, these effects that we can have. Sometimes the lack of effect is what's so amazing.[0:24:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: You can actually, traverse parts of the brain without having any adverse effects on patients, function at least that you can test. But you can also destroy small parts of the brain. We're talking 3 or 4 millimeters in size. These little ablations can be really helpful for patients, but have no obvious side effects that we can tell, perhaps after a short recovery from surgery. But, nonetheless, despite how safe they might be, these surgical procedures still are surgical procedures, And patients are hesitant to proceed, especially when they know that their chance of a transformative effect is quite low.[0:25:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: We we can generally, Achieve a responder rate of about 50%, and responders still have symptomatic OCD. So I'm really, sort of inspired to, really find a way to deliver these therapies in a more disease specific or symptom specific way, but, we're years away probably from from that therapy since it's all part of a research study at the moment.[0:25:40] Andrew Huberman: What brain areas Should I think about when I think about OCD, years ago, I remember opening a textbook. I think I was an undergraduate still, and work from Judith Rappaport at the National Institutes of Mental Health, this would be late eighties, early nineties, was, had done some neuroimaging or maybe it was PET of, or some other imaging technique and had identified portions of the basal ganglia[0:26:04] Dr. Casey Halpern: Sure.[0:26:04] Andrew Huberman: Caudate putamen type structures in OCD And, maybe some differences in boys versus girls. So what brain areas are there sex differences in terms of OCD? And we're one to Coming to your clinic, this you know, for this sort of work of ablations or stimulation, where would you first start to probe in the brain? Yeah.[0:26:28] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. This is a, a disorder of both cortex and the sub subcortex. The critical control areas, areas that are involved in inhibitory control, we have found to Not function properly in patients with OCD, so areas like the orbital frontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. If you image these areas, or study them even in a, eroded model of OCD, which quite honestly these models they model aspects of OCD, but OCD is a human condition. You can't really model this Whole condition in a in a mouse or a rat, but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat.[0:27:09] Dr. Casey Halpern: Sure.[0:27:10] Andrew Huberman: And that out their hair.[0:27:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. Exactly. You know, that's That's not necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder, but that is compulsive behavior. And perhaps if you can ameliorate that in a rat, that might be helpful for a patient with OCD, but we have to approach Animal modeling of OCD thoughtfully. And I and I and most scientists do, I think.[0:27:28] Dr. Casey Halpern: And when we study OCD in in models or in in humans with imaging, and we're trying to do it invasively with with electrodes like we do in epilepsy patients. We we find that areas in the cortex like the prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex are are not functioning they the way they would in a non OCD patient. They're often hyperfunctioning, such that Well, you might say, well, they're hyperfunctioning, so aren't these patients, you know, functioning better? The the Hyperfocused. Yeah.[0:27:56] Dr. Casey Halpern: Hyperfocused. Exactly. No. I I would say it's it's not so much an upper or down. It's more that they're just dysfunctional, and we need to find a way to try to restore normal function to these areas.[0:28:06] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's not so much directional, really. We we tend to oversimplify brain function by thinking about it with directionality too much. Unfortunately, imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation or hypo activation, and that's where I think these kinds of things can be misconstrued. But what I would call the cortical areas of OCD is that they're dysregulated, and we need to find a way to try to normalize their function. So, the frontal lobe is is huge, but areas of the frontal lobe that are a bit more basal like the OFC or orbital frontal cortex and prefrontal cortex, Definitely, it consistently seem to be, implicated in patients with, OCD.[0:28:42] Dr. Casey Halpern: And then there are projections to the subcortex. This is the basal ganglia, like you were saying, caudate Putamen or the dorsal striatum, and these are interconnected with the ventral striatum. This is an area of the brain that I, focus a lot of my energy in. This is the ventral striatum, which is not limited to, but includes the nucleus accumbens. This is an area of the brain that, we know to be involved in gating reward seeking behavior.[0:29:05] Dr. Casey Halpern: When it's perturbed, it seems to Gate compulsive behavior, meaning a rat will pursue a reward despite punishment, despite, foot shock, for example, and that can be, Similar to an OCD patient, they will, check their home for safety, until 3 AM in the morning and not sleep that night. In a way, that is similar to a rat seeking out a food reward, despite a foot shock. Doing something because of the urge, but despite the risk. And perhaps there is some normal judgment there. We all have to take risks To function in everyday society, to be successful, we have to take a risk.[0:29:45] Dr. Casey Halpern: To take care of patients with surgery, there's Some risk there. We make a judgment call, and, that's not a condition. That that's just normal. But when our judgment is consistently, sort of puts us at risk, that's where we have something like OCD. But OCD is also you know, it's one of many conditions that suffer from these kinds of problems.[0:30:08] Dr. Casey Halpern: We tend to label them, because they tend to present in a consistent way. So we have patients with OCD that have hyper checking behavior or, contamination behavior where they if they feel contaminated, they will wash their hands for hours repeatedly, or if they drop their toothbrush on the floor, it this will lead to a compulsive behavior of Cleaning a toothbrush or brushing your teeth consistently, very, very common symptoms that we see, or signs that the patients report to us or or that we observe. But, you know, patients with eating disorders, you know, they tend to if if they have binge eating disorder, they'll overeat. If they have bulimia, they might Purge despite the risk of these things. And so, addiction is is similar.[0:30:50] Dr. Casey Halpern: We we tend to drug seek if we're addicted. We'll we'll pay off a a dealer, in order to get our fix despite the risk. And and that type of Urge, despite the risk, is something that I I've always been really interested in, and and it's a common denominator to all of these problems. And if you think about these problems, I mean, these are some of the most common Conditions in our society today.[0:31:12] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:31:39] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are Optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, and they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:32:26] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I really appreciate that you're building this bridge from OCD to nucleus accumbens, which is, of course, associated with reward in various forms, and we'll get to that. I'll share a personal anecdote as a as a form of question. When I was in college, and studying a lot, I relied on caffeine as a stimulant. I've never really been into drugs or alcohol.[0:32:49] Andrew Huberman: I've been lucky in that sense. I don't drink and I care less if alcohol disappeared. Never really liked recreational drugs, so I was never drawn to them. However, when I was in college, at the time, there were these little epinephrine pills that were common in a lot of sports supplements. These are, like, pre workout type things.[0:33:09] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes.[0:33:10] Andrew Huberman: Not unlike energy drinks now, which I completely avoid. And I had this experience of taking one of these and drinking some coffee. And, of course, it gave me a lift in energy. These are very similar to amphetamine. They were legal over the counter at the time.[0:33:22] Andrew Huberman: They're now Either banned or illegal, I do not recommend them. And I had a lot of energy, but what I noticed is that my grunting tick came back, and I had I made one mistake. I still think of this as one mistake, which was, I engage in a superstitious behavior. I knocked on wood, And then somehow it felt very rewarding. Like, it gave me some totally irrational, but internally rational sense of of security around.[0:33:47] Andrew Huberman: I forget what I was knocking on wood about. And I found that I couldn't break that knock on wood compulsion. I felt I needed to knock on wood. And so then I started sneaking, knock on woods, like, in mid exam and studying, and pretty soon, I was knocking on wood often. I developed a superstition.[0:34:03] Andrew Huberman: And so I'm curious about the role of superstition and compulsion in the crossover there. It makes sense logically to me, but I was equally shocked to learn that when I stopped taking this Dimulant, which I was quite happy to to stop because it did make me feel too alert, couldn't sleep well, etcetera, that The superstition went away as well. And I'm guessing this has something to do with some of the reward circuitry, as it's called, related to stimulants. Again, I am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants, although healthy use of caffeine or safe use of caffeine might be the one universally accepted stimulant. It was really surprising to me how quickly this came on, how quickly it engaged my my thinking and my behavior, the obsessions and the compulsions, And how quickly it turned off when I stopped taking this sports stimulant or whatever it was.[0:34:55] Andrew Huberman: I don't even remember. I think it was some form of epinephrine, ephedrine. Sure. Some it's not epinephrine. Excuse me.[0:35:00] Andrew Huberman: I misspoke ephedrine. Sure. Does what I described sound totally outside the bounds of of, Logic or is or am I imagining it all? No. It did happen.[0:35:12] Andrew Huberman: I'm certain it happened.[0:35:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. No. I don't think you're imagining it at all. I You know, this the grunting that you you mentioned to me you know, first of all, I didn't, comment, but, you know, that that sort of not to put a label on it, but it sounds like a tick. Mhmm.[0:35:25] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, you know, ticks in in young males, extremely common. And they do tend to go away as[0:35:31] Andrew Huberman: Linking ticks. I have a good friend who he's actually a famous neuroscientist, and I won't mention who it is, who's worked very hard to suppress his his blinking tics. And when he gets fatigued, it comes back, and and, he's very high functioning[0:35:43] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes.[0:35:43] Andrew Huberman: In his personal life and his professional life. But but when you're talking to him and he starts Doing this, so you kinda you start wondering, like, what's going on? Yeah.[0:35:50] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. And and it's unfortunate. You know, people with these problems, especially as they get more severe than you get Tourette syndrome, you know, It's hard to function in our society. I have some friends that have Tourette, and I'll tell you. I I'm just so inspired because they're so, They're so confident and, you know, people obviously notice these problems, but they they just live their life and they're very successful, and That's not typical.[0:36:16] Dr. Casey Halpern: I have I have friends that I went to Penn with undergrad that had these kinds of problems, and I was always just so happy and inspired by them. But what's more typical is, you know, these problems cause people to lose their confidence and and not, you know, Pursue, you know, their profession as they may have done or, the things of that nature. So I I think it's all related to the fact that we our brains are very vulnerable. And to get back to your question about the stimulant, you know, I think I think your brain was very vulnerable to it. You know?[0:36:49] Dr. Casey Halpern: You you sort of may have had a predisposition to it. You mentioned that you have you're a little obsessive. And with the tick there, maybe you have this kind of, you know, on the on the mild side of the spectrum OCD. And I I probably do as well, by the way. So I also also have avoided, drugs for that reason, in my life, I'll drink a little bit of wine here and there, but that's about it.[0:37:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, But I I think most people don't avoid these things, and we see these problems in relation to not just taking a stimulant, but any kind of environmental exposure. Our own Society causes so much stress, and that's why I think we have these human conditions. These are human conditions. We try to model them in in animals, but animals don't have these kinds of problems. You know, I've heard that you can, an animal like a a a monkey in the wild can have depression, Monkey's version of depression, but, I don't think it's really typical or human depression, you know, and certainly it's not as prevalent as depression is in our human society.[0:37:48] Dr. Casey Halpern: I think, You know, we haven't evolved to manage the stresses that are in this society that we currently have, and stimulants is probably one of them. You know? And I I I suspect you are probably a little bit vulnerable. It's possible the stimulant, led to an overdrive of your prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex and even brought out a little OCD behavior related to this super, this, superstition that you had. So, no.[0:38:10] Dr. Casey Halpern: I believe that, entirely, and I also think, know, that's why things like OCD and other kinds of psychiatric disorders tend to present themselves in college. When people leave their home And they're in school, and they're stressed, and they're getting exposed to things that they haven't been exposed to before outside of the home, And, you know, their brains aren't evolved and, sophisticated enough yet to help them cope with these kinds of stresses and how it manifests is in these kinds of conditions. And it's I don't wanna put a label on those conditions, but certainly could be a psychiatric disorder, but could also just be lots of anxiety. It could also be, the kind of problems that that that you had as well. So, and I think the nucleus accumbens and the cortical areas that we've been discussing that that Sort of send projections to these areas are are probably at least one of the main circuits involved in these kinds of things.[0:39:03] Andrew Huberman: I'm relieved it's no longer present, but I confess it oh, I always feel it close by. A long run helps. So moo you know, being a slightly fatigued not overly fatigued, but slightly fatigued seems to move out the the kind of physical compulsion, but tried to channel it. Never taken any medication for it, and here I am. So I'm still still going.[0:39:22] Andrew Huberman: I may call you for a a referral at some point, but at this point, I'm, I'm feeling okay. Let's talk about nucleus accumbens and reward circuitry and the relationship between OCD, reward, addiction. And to just give you a sense of where we're headed with this is into the realm of, food related and eating related, behaviors and disorders. Yes. I know you you're doing, some very important work there.[0:39:49] Andrew Huberman: What is nucleus accumbens? I know we all have 1. We have more 2. Yeah. 1 on each side of the brain.[0:39:55] Andrew Huberman: What is it, what roles does it play, in healthy brain behavior and in pathology?[0:40:01] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. The nucleus accumbens is A part of the brain, part of our reward circuits, a hub of the reward circuits that I've always been most fascinated in. There are scientists around the world, some of the leading, arguably, some of the leading scientists in the world, the father of addiction neuroscience. I call him, although he tells me I'm nuts, Rob Malenka, who has studied the nucleus accumbens since the beginning of his career and who I worked with when I was at Stanford, Fabulous scientist and mentor. Taught me so much.[0:40:33] Dr. Casey Halpern: Taught the world so much.[0:40:34] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. Yeah. Person, scientist, and and physician as[0:40:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: well. M m MD, PhD, brilliant in both ways and, very fatherly in a lot of way in terms of teaching people how to how to do science and and be good Citizens as well. But, yeah, the nucleus accumbens is an area that is also very complicated because It has a lot of functions. It it interconnects with many parts of the brain. But there are some things about the nucleus accumbens that are very consistent.[0:41:12] Dr. Casey Halpern: So when I started getting interested in Reward and what a what I could do as a surgeon to try to improve how we manage rewards. And what I mean by that specifically is what if you have an urge for a reward, that that's a normal phenomenon. That that's not something we're trying to stop. The the issue is if you have an urge for a reward that either puts you or somebody else at risk, it's probably a reward we shouldn't have. I suppose you could say, well, it depends on the size of the reward and the size of the risk and how that fits into your societal norms.[0:41:46] Dr. Casey Halpern: But for example, If you're, obese and, you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight and try to control your eating habits, you know, perhaps, better food choices is an important way for you to be healthier. And and not pursuing those better food choices, that's an urge that We probably need to treat. If you're a drug addict and you, use heroin or opiate, Considering the opioid crisis right now, or cocaine, which is an untreatable at the moment, you know, that That cocaine might make you feel like you have some more energy that day to to deal with your work, or that opiate might make you feel better because life is stressful. But The risk of doing those things is really high. In fact, potentially lethal.[0:42:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: So that's an urge that's treatable. If you have OCD and you can't sleep at night because you're so nervous that you didn't lock the door and you checked 30 times, That's a reality for some people with severe OCD. That's an urge we gotta treat. Eating disorder is the same. Eating Eating disorders and obesity are obviously linked because of the relationship of a patient with food, but they're also quite distinct.[0:43:06] Dr. Casey Halpern: Not everybody with obesity has an eating disorder, and obviously, not everybody with an eating disorder has obesity. I'm particularly interested in patients that have binge eating disorder as well as obesity, because they're so heavily linked. Not everybody with binge eating disorder has obesity, but, on average, most are overweight. We are doing a deep brain stimulation Trial at Penn where we're trying to modulate the nucleus accumbens and understand it better in patients that have failed gastric bypass surgery, the most aggressive form of treatment for obesity. And we and we believe they failed gastric bypass surgery because of Bidge eating disorder, meaning they just can't control how much they eat.[0:43:45] Dr. Casey Halpern: So their obesity is either related or even due to overeating, not some predisposition to, that body habitus. You know, obesity is a phenotype, something that we can see. Not everybody is obese because of the same thing. So it's very important. I was taught this by a close mentor and friend, Tom Wadden, when he was the director of the, obesity center at Penn, or the center for weight and eating disorders.[0:44:09] Dr. Casey Halpern: And and he said to me, you know, Casey, you know, be careful with obesity. You're you're interested in addiction, and I understand you're interested in the addictive tendencies of certain patients obesity, and and and their relationship with food, but not everybody with obesity has that problem. And and in fact, it's It's probably present in about 20% of patients with obesity. But now taking a step back, 20% of patients with obesity is still a massive problem, of epidemic proportions, and Perhaps some of these patients have either some form of bingeing disorder or or I should say some degree of bingeing disorder, or at least loss of control eating, which is common to both. So that's a feature that I think eating disorder experts, obesity experts, neurosurgeons, Obesity, obesity medicine experts would agree is common to eating disorders and obesity, And I also believe would is common to addicts, and perhaps patients with OCD is sort of a loss of control disorder.[0:45:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's actually not a disorder known by, like, the DSM 5, some diagnostic manual, but, a feature, I should say, of these conditions that's common. And That common denominator, I believe, can be restored, or at least this problem can be ameliorated or improved upon By a better understanding and a tailored treatment to the nucleus accumbens specifically. We have learned in mice, That if you expose a mouse now this is just a model. If you expose a mouse to high fat food, not food that they would normally eat, food that, is like 60% fat. High fat.[0:45:47] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's like butter. We've learned that if you expose them to food like that, within 2 weeks, their nucleus accumbens is not functioning Like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food. There's aspects of it that, are hyperactive, I could say, and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive or decreased activity. But either way, it's it's not functioning properly. And most likely that function is pre predisposing continued behavior, and then probably eventually leads to things like a habit that gets developed, and that's a whole another area of these kinds of problems that is very complicated and poorly understood.[0:46:22] Dr. Casey Halpern: But in any case, if we just focus on the behavior, at hand, it seems that repeated exposure to something like high fat food, A drug of abuse or any type of reward that is a really strong reward. In a way, it it can hijack Normal functioning of the nucleus accumbens. So the goal of our, invasive trial is to try to restore normal functioning to that nucleus accumbens. In mice, there seems to be a signal that predicts when they're going to lose control. And we can use that signal To deliver a sort of a a real time therapy in the form of deep brain stimulation, just a brief amount of stimulation, and that actually blocks the behavior.[0:47:04] Dr. Casey Halpern: And what's interesting is over time, that signal actually decreases in frequency, which suggests some level of restoring normal function to that circuit in the mouse, and we're trying to do that now in a human trial.[0:47:16] Andrew Huberman: Fascinating. Where is the stimulation provided? Because I would imagine that if one were to stimulate nucleus accumbens, you would see a reinforcement of whatever behavior coincided or preceded the stimulation.[0:47:30] Dr. Casey Halpern: So the stimulation, it's a, a brief Delivery of stimulation anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds that is intended to just disrupt The perturbed signaling that's happening in the nucleus accumbens. There are disorders like depression, let's say, That I I would describe as a bit more of a state disorder. And this is obviously oversimplified because we know that there's fluctuations in mood and depression as well. So Don't let me oversimplify it too much. But, but but for now, let's forgive the oversimplification.[0:48:05] Dr. Casey Halpern: If we if we accept Depression is a state disorder, or maybe Parkinson's disease is a state disorder ex recognizing that they do fluctuate. These types of problems most likely, Not but not definitely. Most likely need a continuous therapy of some form. A therapy that's consistent. Perhaps therapy that fluctuates with the condition, but nevertheless still consistent.[0:48:29] Dr. Casey Halpern: Binge eating disorder or OCD or, Addiction, and and bingeing disorder in the context of obesity. A lot of these patients are functioning quite normally every single day. It's just that Intermittently throughout the day, there's brief interruptions in their normal functions such that they have thoughts about food or the drug of abuse that they're really longing to have. And so we wanna deliver a episodic therapy delivered at the right time and only at the right time To try to interrupt the circuit aberration or the the problem at hand That is gonna lead to that dangerous behavior and to kinda get the patient back on track to what they're doing. I don't necessarily think that it leads To a reinforcement, it's possible.[0:49:19] Dr. Casey Halpern: We have to study that more, but rather the goal is to just disrupt Perhaps what is kind of habitual, or or at least this kind of recurring Problem that is happening. You know, people that have binge eating disorder, at least at a severe level, they tend to bitch about once a day, but they don't binge all day long, of course. They have A moment perhaps when they get home from work and they're stressed, where they might have a bout of binge.[0:49:48] Andrew Huberman: What constitutes a binge? And, I also want to know, does binge eating disorder come on suddenly, meaning as an entire disorder? One day, people wake up, suddenly they have binging disorder, or is this, you know, a few too many buffets? And I'm being entirely serious here, you know, kind of Unlimited food Yeah. And a circuit gets flipped or kinda starts moving into the high RPMs, so to speak.[0:50:14] Andrew Huberman: So how does it come on? And, and I'm actually surprised to hear that it's once a day. I would think Just hearing binging disorder, I assume it's like OCD, which it probably fluctuates across the day as well. But, I would have thought anytime people around food, they just simply can't control their intake of food. Yes.[0:50:31] Andrew Huberman: So so what does this look like, in terms of the onset of the disorder? And then what do you think underlies this once a day type of phenomena? That's pretty interesting.[0:50:40] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. So severe bingeing disorder, these patients will binge about once a day. It could be a couple times a day, but in general, it's not more than that. Moderate is about 3 to 4 times a week, for example. The reason I think that that seems surprising to you and If you think about it, it is surprising.[0:50:59] Dr. Casey Halpern: But but but, and I and I agree with you. But the reason for that is is actually just in the definitions of the word. And as a neurosurgeon, in full disclosure, as I as I mentioned, you know, I don't see these patients clinically. I see them for research trial purposes, and I try to understand The literature around eating disorders and I obviously collaborate with fabulous eating disorders, in in these problems that are that are highly innovative people. But the word binge is a definition.[0:51:29] Dr. Casey Halpern: There there's a definition to that word, and you can't necessarily binge all day Because our stomachs are not big enough. And so, there's a limit to how much one can eat. And to meet criteria for a binge, you have to Have a sense of loss of control. You have to eat an enormous amount of food in a brief period of time. And, yes, generally, that doesn't happen more than about Once a day in in a patient with severe binge eating disorder.[0:51:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: However, they can lose control quite often. And in fact, Perhaps even at every meal, they might meet criteria for a bout of loss of control where they yes. They may have lost control, but they might not have eaten enough To constitute what we would define as a binge. And that would be in a That by the way, it's it's really just compared to their normal meal. You know?[0:52:20] Dr. Casey Halpern: Perhaps it's, 50% of their daily calories in that one brief moment. So, that's that's why I think it seems surprising that binges aren't happening more often than that. What I would say is if we re re replace the term binge with loss of control eating, loss of control eating could happen dozens of times a week. And in fact, you know, the patients that we're studying, You know, we've we've seen patients that, lose control 20, 30 times a week, and that's probably the the term you have in mind when you're saying you're surprised that it's just one time a day. It's specifically related to the fact that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food in such a brief period of time.[0:52:58] Dr. Casey Halpern: So it's hard to do that more than once a day.[0:53:00] Andrew Huberman: I see. You mentioned that some preexisting anxiety might bias somebody to have a binge. I'm also fascinated by something I've observed before, which is when I was in college, my my girlfriend had a roommate who we were aware was bulimic, and would binge and then purge. And often, when she ingested alcohol, that would lead to a binge Sure. Which is kind of the opposite of anxiety when I think about alcohol as something that Slightly reduces prefrontal activity somewhat of a sedative or certainly a sedative at higher dosages.[0:53:36] Andrew Huberman: So This brings you to something that you said. I'm just gonna, I won't say it as eloquently as you did that. It seems like it's neither the case that Anxiety leads to binging nor that hypo reduced activation of the forebrain and lower anxiety leads to binging. It's this It's this dysregulation of circuitry[0:53:56] Dr. Casey Halpern: Mhmm.[0:53:56] Andrew Huberman: That the the seesaw could go either way, and it and it can throw things off, but it's off balance in both cases.[0:54:02] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes. Uh-huh.[0:54:03] Andrew Huberman: It's, and that seems to be a a that seems to pose a problem. It seems like it's a particularly tricky problem And kind of explains to me in my nonclinical awareness why medication might be really hard to use as a way to treat this, but that Being able to poke around in the brain and assay in real time, you know, how do you feel? Do you feel like binging now, or do you feel, further from the binge impulse? Is that what you do with these patients? Are they awake while you're stimulating the brain?[0:54:32] Andrew Huberman: Because it's one thing to say, I stimulate a brain area and that binging goes away or or partial relief or complete relief. But how do you know? Are they in there with a donut, and you're tempting them? So how do you actually know if it's A blading of brain area is going to lead to, relief or exacerbation or no impact on a on this disorder.[0:54:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. So, there's a lot to unpack there. I'll I'll try to go 1 step at a time. And if I if I miss something, please remember.[0:55:00] Andrew Huberman: And I tend to ask these 3 part questions specifically of neurosurgeons because I like to challenge you guys. Because, again, you are the astronauts of neuroscience. Also, I I'm just gonna take a moment poke at neurosurgeon because I have couple close friends, who are neurosurgeons, and I consider Casey a friend. I don't know if he considers me a friend, but I Of course. Give him a friend.[0:55:17] Andrew Huberman: I'm teasing there too, which is, first of all, they all have incredible hands. Right? They have I'm not so they all guard their hands with the kind of, protection that you would guard the the tools of the most important tools of your trade. So they're very careful with their hands. You're not gonna see them doing heavy deadlifts.[0:55:35] Andrew Huberman: You're not because of the way that impacts the[0:55:37] Dr. Casey Halpern: the motor on.[0:55:38] Andrew Huberman: So they're it's all about fine control.[0:55:40] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes.[0:55:40] Andrew Huberman: So if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts, you might wanna consider getting a different neurosurgeon. Hope I didn't put anyone out of work there. And then the other the other thing is that, You all are tend to be very calm people, at least on the exterior. We'll return to this later. Okay.[0:55:57] Andrew Huberman: But I do throw 3 or 4 questions out at once. So So elevated autonomic arousal and alertness as well as decreased autonomic arousal and alertness both seem to be able to lead to bingeing. And then there's this question of how do you know whether or not to stimulate or to ablate or whether or not to leave a structure alone? In other words, what is one of these experiments look like in the laboratory?[0:56:17] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. Sort of a[0:56:18] Andrew Huberman: Clinic. Excuse me.[0:56:19] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. Of course. Yeah. I these are these are questions I think about all the time. And, I do wanna come back to the dead lifting comment, but Regarding and you and you referred to this earlier as well, and I I don't know if I've addressed it sufficiently either is is sort of like what what comes first here or how does this develop?[0:56:42] Dr. Casey Halpern: I I think first of all, I I I I like to understand these kinds of problems in In sort of the the construct of what I I consider to be a a bit of a a two hit hypothesis. So you sort of need, like, in the concussion literature, you need the 2nd hit is can be devastating. So if you have a concussion, you know, you wanna only return to play when your symptoms are gone, and cleared by a a physician. So, in the context of eating disorders or let's say binge eating disorder. Now first of all, I I didn't mention earlier, but this is the most common eating disorder.[0:57:15] Dr. Casey Halpern: It affects anywhere between 3 5% of the population. Wow. And it's probably underdiagnosed in obesity, by the way. And if obesity affects 35% of our population, Most likely, bingeing disorder affects more than 3 to 5%, but that's that's the current, literature, estimate on on the prevalence. So, how do we develop a gene disorder?[0:57:37] Dr. Casey Halpern: And is it related to this anxiety question? You know, I think that there is a predisposition. That's the first hit. I actually think all humans have this predisposition. Just some have it more than others.[0:57:49] Dr. Casey Halpern: I don't think that we've evolved to live in a society where foods are so readily available and enormously delicious and have so much sugar and fat in them. Not that there's any particular problem with either of these mac macronutrients. It's just the excess of it, and how they're refined, that I think is the problem. You know, there's high fructose corn syrup in almost everything we eat. We there it's in bread.[0:58:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: I I don't even know why it's in bread sometimes. It's just Kinda crazy. So so I don't I don't think we're evolved to live in a society, That that has food that's so readily available like that, and cheap, by the way. In fact, the cheaper the foods are sort of the the more refined and palatable, and would argue dangerous to eat. I think they change our reward circuits for the worse, and put us at risk for wanting more.[0:58:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: Tend to get a headache when I eat food like that, and and perhaps that's, evolutionary advantage because I don't wanna eat those foods because it they actually do make me sick. So, in in a lot of ways, I I kinda wish that headache on everybody because perhaps we wouldn't have all these problems, or at least some of them would go away. So I think that's the first issue is, a predisposition to, or a vulnerability to these types of foods, Which we undoubtedly all have to a certain extent, but some more than others. And then and then the and that's so that's the first hit Is this predisposition in the context of this sort of food focused society? And then the second hit is Probably a stressful event or a stressful life, and it probably a recurring stressful event.[0:59:31] Dr. Casey Halpern: I'm not sure this is published. I've never sat down with, like, a eating disorder expert and and had this question about how this develops. And I'm not sure it's actually well well known. But in a lot of ways, I think that that answer anybody would agree with. That we need sort of a predisposition in the exposure, the environmental exposure, and the genetic predisposition, but also a stressor, and that stressor is probably one that's recurring.[0:59:58] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, You know, it's obvious in our society, these stressors are everywhere, and how we can manage them is is often poor. And, you know, I think we can all relate with that. Then there's something else in the background that I think is really important to mention is that patients with these kinds of problems are embarrassed because our society doesn't Think fondly of these kinds of patients. You know, bingeing disorder patients, they they do tend to be overweight. That's obviously a stigma.[1:00:24] Dr. Casey Halpern: Obese obesity is another stigma, then there's the opposite. In a way, it's an opposite by the way for for a phenotype standpoint. It's that's anorexia. I mean, That's another stigma. And, you know, gosh, you know, not to make this about 1 sex over another, but when when girls are Told they're pretty because they're thin.[1:00:46] Dr. Casey Halpern: It just reinforces this problem. And, of course, you wanna compliment people and make them feel good about themselves, but The problem is that in this vulnerable society, that that can lead to problems because people start thinking, oh, I should be thin or thinner. So I I think that it's a little bit of a societal understanding that our brains are very vulnerable, and I think that will really help changing society. It's hard. And most of society is not, you know, ill meaning.[1:01:16] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's all done by accident, but that that is the society that we live in. So if we can try to Improve that stigma, and and be kinder to people in that way. I think a lot of these problems would get better. People that are Obese that feel embarrassed by their obesity, it doesn't help. It only makes it worse because they give up.[1:01:37] Dr. Casey Halpern: Same thing might be true for anorexics. So, I really think it's important to consider all of these things, and and that's why it's so complicated. And it it it would be so hard to do a well controlled study to understand it better because there's So many of these variables to control for that you really can't control for. You might be able to control for them in a in a mouse's home cage, but not not in the society that we live in. So So that that's kind of my brief, sort of summary of how I would answer your your first question.[1:02:05] Dr. Casey Halpern: Then I I think, you know, your second question, I I sort of take that as, well, how do you study such a complicated problem In the operating room and and in the clinic because, I mentioned the operating room because that's sort of the first step here. First, we want to We have, just to clarify, we have a, NIH funded, trial approved by the FDA for for research to do this first in human study. We've treated 2 patients. We have 4 more to come at Penn, and, and in this study, something I've been working towards my entire career. What we don't know is where in the nucleus accumbens Will we identify cells or regions that seem to be Involved in this sort of reward seeking behavior, I would call it appetitive.[1:03:04] Dr. Casey Halpern: It it's kind of like appetite, but the word appetitive is, I think a a a good word to use. What what part of the nucleus come in is repetitive? Is the whole thing appetitive? Probably not. It's huge.[1:03:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: In my world, it's huge. As a neurosurgeon, you know, I I target parts of the brain that are 3 or 4 millimeters in size. The nucleus accumbens is almost a centimeter in size.[1:03:22] Andrew Huberman: Wow. I didn't realize it was that large.[1:03:24] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. This[1:03:24] Andrew Huberman: sort of, like, reminds me of discussions around the amygdala. Everyone thinks amygdala fear. Yeah. But amygdala's got a lot of different subregions. Yes.[1:03:31] Andrew Huberman: And Stimulation of certain areas of the amygdala makes people feel great.[1:03:34] Dr. Casey Halpern: That's right.[1:03:35] Andrew Huberman: And other stimulation of other areas makes them feel terribly afraid.[1:03:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exactly. And and that shouldn't surprise us because, you know, when we treat patients with Parkinson's disease for tremor, you know, if we're in one part of the subthalamic nucleus, we'll help their tremor. We're in another part of the subthalamic nucleus, the neurologist is looking at me like, why isn't this working? And that shouldn't surprise us. We already know that, you know, 2 or 3 millimeters Deviation or 2 or 3 millimeters away from where we wanna be, and you might not have the result you want.[1:04:01] Dr. Casey Halpern: And that's probably also true for these more limbic structures like the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens. So, you know, regarding the nucleus accumbens, we traverse some of the nucleus accumbens, not all of it, in order to place the electrode That we want to use to detect when cravings are happening, for example, and to try to block the cravings from leading To the behavior related to the the reward seeking, which is the overeating in this case. So What we decided to do in the operating room was to actually try to leverage a tool that we use all the time when we take care of patients with Parkinson's. So with Parkinson's, these a lot of these patients, not all, have tremor. And so when we place an electrode into this motor structure so we can actually hear it.[1:05:01] Dr. Casey Halpern: And and it sounds kind of like the tremor looks. Like, the frequency of the signal is the same as The handshaking. So Exactly.[1:05:09] Andrew Huberman: And so the the patient with Parkinson's is is trem trembling.[1:05:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yep.[1:05:13] Andrew Huberman: They're awake, and you're poking around Yep. In a in a dedicated, careful way, of course.[1:05:19] Dr. Casey Halpern: One poke at a time.[1:05:20] Andrew Huberman: One poke at a time Yeah. With a very fine wire or set of wires, Listening to the electrical activity until you you encounter some cells that are sending out electrical activity That's right. At a similar frequency.[1:05:33] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exactly.[1:05:33] Andrew Huberman: And then you can stimulate them or quiet them and see if the tremor goes away.[1:05:37] Dr. Casey Halpern: So we we are very confident that when we stimulate that area of, In this case, the subthalamic nucleus, we will we will make that tremor. We will disrupt that tremor circuit, and that tremor will dissolve, and it does. That's why Parkinson's is so beautiful and inspiring in, from a certain tractable. Yeah. Exactly.[1:05:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: But what is the It makes us feel we understand the brain Right. At least in that limited way.[1:06:01] Andrew Huberman: So what is the, analog to tremor in terms of appetite and desire to binge? Craving.[1:06:08] Dr. Casey Halpern: So craving is a term That you know, there's probably other terms we could use, by the way, but that that's the term we've chosen to use for a number of reasons. 1, because people relate with that term. People that have binge eating disorder or obesity, they if you ask them if they crave, the answer will often be yes. If you ask them if they lose control or binge, They might not know what you mean, or they might not actually feel out of control even when they are. So, but the word craving is relatable.[1:06:37] Dr. Casey Halpern: And so we set out to see if we could identify craving cells. In a patient with OCD, which is related. In fact, we target a very similar part of the brain. We try to identify Cells related to obsessions, and we believe we did do that. It was a single case study, where we tried to optimize where our electrode was placed.[1:07:01] Dr. Casey Halpern: So we had some Proof of concept that we would be able to elicit a sort of disease specific symptom in the operating room, assuming the patient could tolerate Being awake. Not everybody needs to be awake for this procedure, but at least for these 1st in human trials where, we're just trying we're trying to where in the brain we need to be. I think this type of approach is really critical. And, you know, by the way, none of this has been published, but I think it's So important for people to know this. So I I am willing to share some aspects of what we're trying to do.[1:07:35] Dr. Casey Halpern: But, But that's that's really the first goal of this trial is to identify where the nucleus accumbens we can detect these craving cells. So we have to provoke Food craving in the operating room. That's the first thing.[1:07:47] Andrew Huberman: How do you do that?[1:07:49] Dr. Casey Halpern: Well, there are some, somewhat validated ways to do that. So for example, we ask patients to provide pictures of food that they rate very highly as something that they would typically crave. And, you know, depending on the patient, it might be something that's very salty. It could be very sweet like a doughnut.[1:08:10] Andrew Huberman: Donuts are good. I love doughnuts. Right? Drones are great. You should[1:08:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: you should try the cronut when you're here in New York City.[1:08:15] Andrew Huberman: I just might. I try not to eat that sort of thing. For all the reasons, they change your brain worth 1 bite. Okay.[1:08:21] Dr. Casey Halpern: Just try to stop yourself after that was done.[1:08:23] Andrew Huberman: So if I were one of these patients, given the fact that, the binges come on pretty seldom Once a day. Do you you I imagine you have them come to the the operating room fasted or semi fasted.[1:08:35] Dr. Casey Halpern: They're fasted. Yep.[1:08:35] Andrew Huberman: Okay. They're fasted, which probably there are probably[1:08:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: surgical Yes.[1:08:38] Andrew Huberman: Reasons for wanting that too.[1:08:39] Dr. Casey Halpern: They kinda have to be. Right.[1:08:41] Andrew Huberman: And then you they've you've done the craniotomy. You removed a patch Skull Yes. Lowered the wire into the nucleus accumbens, and then they are viewing pictures of food that they crave and thinking about it. Do they have, Olfactory cues, smells of cronut, and Yeah.[1:08:56] Dr. Casey Halpern: I would love to do the olfactory because we haven't implemented that, but that is a a great, thank you for and I'll give you full credit when we do. Sure.[1:09:02] Andrew Huberman: I didn't review the grant, but I it I'm I'm so glad this work is funded because, I mean, this is when I I'll make this time, it's not a joke when I refer to you all, you neurosurgeons, as the astronauts of the brain, you know, this is out on the Extreme edge of what we don't know[1:09:21] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:09:21] Andrew Huberman: About how the brain functions, and this is so far and away different than giving a mouse access to a high High fat food. Not that that I'm not being disparaging of the mouse work, but so the person says well, I'm the patient in this case, so I might say, know, I'm hungry. A doughnut sounds really good right now.[1:09:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:09:38] Andrew Huberman: But craving to me is, like, I you know, I'll cross the street, cross town, Be late for my meeting, eat 3 of these[1:09:47] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes.[1:09:48] Andrew Huberman: Maybe even hide that from somebody that cares about me, that doesn't want me doing this, this kind of thing. Hide it from myself. Yes. These these kinds of behaviors, I'm projecting. I'm fortunate that, I I have cravings for things in life, but, donuts are not among the more extreme of them.[1:10:04] Andrew Huberman: So, so this is all happening in real time Mhmm. And you're listening to the cells the same way you would listen to it and search for tremor cells.[1:10:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exactly. Same exact tools.[1:10:13] Andrew Huberman: And you're doing that by, recording from a a small population of cells in the area?[1:10:18] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. In fact, we do get multiunit activity, which is multiple cells. But we really try to find 1, a single unit to listen to.[1:10:26] Andrew Huberman: 1 neuron.[1:10:27] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. Because it's just, much easier to understand what that one Neuron is doing versus trying to listen to multiple. And, we also, measure local field potential recordings, but those are analyzed, which is more of a population response, Thousands of cells. Kind of a chorus of cells. Exactly.[1:10:44] Dr. Casey Halpern: That we measure offline. The device that we use to Sort of treat these patients or intervene, that we're studying, it it can't do single unit recordings. It's only doing these more population responses. So We correlate what we see in the operating room at the single unit level to the population response, but we do that all offline. And I can explain that, in a moment.[1:11:10] Dr. Casey Halpern: But yes. So we we try to identify these craving cells. And, because this is a a feasibility study, And we can't, you know, be in the operating room searching for hours and hours and hours. We do have some sort of We have guidelines that we've set for ourselves, that we've, developed with the NIH or the FDA to make sure that what we're doing is Feasible and safe as well. So we we will spend a limited time trying to identify these, craving cells.[1:11:40] Dr. Casey Halpern: But another, sort of, Strategy that we think is really important is, the effect of the stimulation. So a lot of patients and this gets to sort of your question earlier about what kind of What comes first? You know, a lot of people when they when they binge or they lose control over food, or seek drugs. That moment of vulnerability is preceded by What we call a a a moment of sort of pre meal negative affect, which basically means right before they binge, they're feeling down or they feel stressed We're anxious, and they compensate for that momentary symptom by binging or losing control over food. Not everybody meets criteria for a binge, so I I try to, specify that we are we are looking at loss of control eating specifically just because the criterion of a binge is not as critical for us.[1:12:39] Dr. Casey Halpern: So, so what we wanna be able to do is Trigger stimulation when this craving is detected by the device, but we trigger it only when the craving is there. And we believe that if we can sort of temporarily elevate their mood ever so briefly, again, this is about 5 to 10 seconds of stimulation only, That perhaps that elevation in mood could actually sort of disrupt the craving to binge cycle. Maybe that's a habit, maybe it's not. But if you crave and then you binge, if we can interrupt that with this moment of feeling good, That might be a really good therapy for a patient. And in fact, when we do deep brain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder, We can fairly, reliably induce a positive affect.[1:13:32] Dr. Casey Halpern: The problem is that it's not sustained. And the reason it's likely not sustained is because with obsessive compulsive disorder, we treat that condition with continuous stimulation. And it's not surprising that over time, the effect kinda goes away. So when they're in the clinic and we turn the device on, our patients feel great, And we feel like we've solved the problem. But they call us the next day, and they're like, you know, my my depression came back or my OCD hasn't gotten better, and my mood's back to where it was.[1:14:02] Dr. Casey Halpern: Can you can you get it back to where it was yesterday? Because that felt great.[1:14:05] Andrew Huberman: The brain loves homeostatic regulation. It does. And It does not like to shift patterns.[1:14:10] Dr. Casey Halpern: Regression to the norm. Right. And I think there's sort of a tolerance effect there That, is is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation. And, actually, in a mouse, if you do continuous stimulation, the the sort of blockade of binge eating goes away. So, actually, in a mouse, we've actually demonstrated, we published this not too long ago, in PNAS that if you deliver stimulation intermittently and only when sort of a craving signal is detected, So to speak.[1:14:42] Dr. Casey Halpern: That that act that effect will be the most robust and durable. But if you deliver it continuously, actually, the benefit goes away over time. So I've always encouraged my colleagues to consider more of an episodic stimulation approach rather than continuous deep brain stimulation. But, of course, that that's for these more episodic conditions. Whereas these more quote, unquote state disorders, as I oversimplified earlier, they might need more of a continuous therapy.[1:15:06] Dr. Casey Halpern: So that's definitely subject for a lot of research in the future. So in any case, the goal in the operating room was to identify a craving cell, Deliver stimulation safely, but also to capture a moment of elevated mood. We were able, to do that as we are in our OCD patients as well, and also to get an intraoperative CAT scan. We have, devices now in the operating room that allow us get imaging in real time. They're they're fabulous tools that we didn't have 10 years ago, so we can confirm accuracy.[1:15:41] Andrew Huberman: You know where the you can see where the electrode is Exactly. Precisely.[1:15:45] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exactly. You know, with 0.5 millimeters of air. So Super precise, or as precise as we think we need to be. And we use connectomics. So there's a tool in, Brain imaging called, tractography, where we can actually measure circuit connections.[1:16:04] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's it's an indirect assay, but We believe it's powerful. It has its, assumptions, but, like anything in in science. But, we could actually, map out where the nucleus accumbens connects to, the prefrontal cortex, sort of the control inhibitory control pathway, And where that pathway intersects with the nucleus accumbens, and we can target that area, structurally. So Those 3 goals of the surgery, we we aim to set up to accomplish, and we believed if we achieve 2 of those 3, that we would have a a successful result in our in our early trial. Amazing.[1:16:45] Dr. Casey Halpern: Given That at[1:16:47] Andrew Huberman: least to me, the non clinician, that anorexia is the mirror image of binge eating disorder. And at least from what I learned, one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions[1:17:00] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:17:01] Andrew Huberman: But also quite common. Yes. Is it possible that nucleus accumbens, this so called reward circuit, is also involved in anorexia, But somehow it is the resistance to eating, the craving of the fasted state, or something like that that's being reinforced.[1:17:20] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:17:20] Andrew Huberman: And and I asked this for two reasons. 1, because I'm genuinely curious about anorexia. I've observed anorexia in a number of people I know, and it's Striking thing to see somebody just resist food despite all better knowledge of the fact that they're getting quite ill, Maybe even at risk of death. But the other reason is that if in fact, nucleus accumbens It is the site which can harbor cells to promote craving and craving of, fasted states, so to speak. Then that, I think, might tell us something fundamental about how the brain works, which is that structures don't control functions per se.[1:18:02] Andrew Huberman: Structures Control dynamics[1:18:04] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes.[1:18:04] Andrew Huberman: Of interactions. Sort of like a a orchestra conductor, has a certain number of operations that they Form, but, really, their main function is to coordinate the actions of a lot of things, not to make sure that the violins always play in Yes. A certain way, alongside the oboes. You can tell I'm not a musician here. I see[1:18:24] Dr. Casey Halpern: you have an appreciation for the oboes. Usually get left out.[1:18:27] Andrew Huberman: What's that? The oboes? Yeah.[1:18:27] Dr. Casey Halpern: They usually get ignored in my opinion.[1:18:29] Andrew Huberman: My partner plays the oboes. Oh, wow. Yeah. So yeah. So I think it's[1:18:33] Dr. Casey Halpern: a great analogy, by the way. You know, I I I make this statement. It's a little controversial, but I I actually think people would understand where it's where where I'm coming from, across all of these sort of subspecialties, of medicine. But I I actually think especially with obesity, remember, it's a phenotype that's reflective, Often, but not always of a behavior. But if you consider patients that have obesity and they they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards food.[1:19:00] Dr. Casey Halpern: So they they overeat despite the risk of it. I think those kinds of patients are more similar to anorexics than they are different. Anorexia and obesity are both phenotypes that are, at least in this specific case of obesity and in anorexia, a result of a compulsion to either over or undereat despite the risk. These types of compulsions are driven by societal pressures, brain vulnerabilities that are probably more similar, than than they are different. They they just happen to manifest differently.[1:19:32] Dr. Casey Halpern: Why they manifest differently is probably related to each patient's predisposition or perhaps preference. That's hard to know. Like you, I I have a a personal connection to these eating disorders, anorexia included, and, yeah, I I think it's, It's very scary, and it's a condition that, often instills fear In psychiatrists, because I think, you know, not not everybody, by the way. I mean, we have some phenomenal, psychiatrists that I work with both at Danford and at Penn. They're also involved in my obesity study that take care of these patients.[1:20:10] Dr. Casey Halpern: I mean, these are heroes, but there's a lot of psychiatrists that are not in this domain that that Find anorexia scary for the reason you said. It has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions. That includes depression, Because not only can these patients die of suicide, but they die of metabolic complications of being underweight. So it's a, It is a it is a scary condition. I I relate with that.[1:20:33] Dr. Casey Halpern: I am trying over time to bridge what I'm doing in obesity and binging disorder to anorexia For for two reasons. 1, because I think these problems are more similar than they are different, and 2, because of the need. And I I think we're well positioned, to to sort of tackle anorexia, using similar approaches, not identical, but but similar approaches. The nucleus accumbens has been studied in patients with anorexia, in China. Actually, my postdoc my 1st postdoc who, I had the honor to Trane, when I was at Stanford as a neurosurgeon in China, when, before he came to me, actually was involved in a in a trial of anorexia that had some benefits.[1:21:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, there are studies in Europe, and elsewhere that, have examined preliminarily, the effects of deep brain stimulation targeting the nucleus accumbens, for anorexia colleagues of mine in Canada. Andres Lazado is a wonderful Neurosurgeon scientist has been studying the effects of going after area 25, which is directly connected to the nucleus accumbens by, you know, it's it's a monosynaptic connection. So in a lot of ways, you know, perhaps delivering stimulation there could could be very similar to delivering simulation with nucleus that's all part of 1 critical inhibitory control circuit. He's seen benefits as well. So I I definitely think there's some evidence that this is an area that we need to be studying.[1:22:02] Dr. Casey Halpern: I think our more episodic approach response to stimulation going after sort of a a signal in the nucleus accumbens that seems to be related to the compulsion to Withhold from eating, I think it's what we will be trying to accomplish, in our study. It's, right now, just being conceived though. Yeah. The these studies, they move so slowly because you have to get a grant. That grant gets reviewed by the NIH 6 months after you submit it, Often gets rejected because it's too innovative and too high risk, so then you have to edit it and decrease the risk.[1:22:36] Dr. Casey Halpern: So it takes my obesity study took 2 years to get funded. And I worry about that time frame because that's a lot of time for patients with anorexia to suffer that I might be able to help at least in a small sample of patients. So, but that that is the nature of how these things go. You also have to get FDA approval do these kinds of things. We try to do all of this in parallel.[1:22:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's an enormous undertaking. And in a lot of ways, we're starting from scratch, but in some ways, we have some preliminary data to to go after this. So My hope is in about a year, we'll have a similar trial for anorexia at Penn, so so more to come on that. And and I'm and we're not the only, lab that's trying to go after because of the the clear need. So[1:23:14] Andrew Huberman: What is the status of noninvasive brain stimulation, Ablation and blocking activity in the brain. I get a lot of questions about transcranial magnetic stimulation.[1:23:23] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:23:23] Andrew Huberman: I've actually had that done Oh. As a research Subject. Sure.[1:23:26] Dr. Casey Halpern: When[1:23:26] Andrew Huberman: I was at Berkeley, Rich Ivory's lab put a coil on my head. I was tapping my finger in concert to a, a drumbeat, and then all of a sudden, because of the stimulation, it was impossible for me to keep time[1:23:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes.[1:23:38] Andrew Huberman: With the drumbeat.[1:23:39] Dr. Casey Halpern: That's cool.[1:23:40] Andrew Huberman: It's a pretty wild Experience to not have motor control and, then to have motor control returned[1:23:47] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:23:47] Andrew Huberman: At the flip of a switch when someone else is controlling the switches,[1:23:51] Dr. Casey Halpern: it makes[1:23:51] Andrew Huberman: it especially eerie. So my understanding is that transcranial magnetic stimulation is being used to treat depression and a number of other, brain syndromes, noninvasively, so no no drilling through the skull. The surgeons don't like that. Surgeons love to cut and drill, with purpose, but they do. With purpose.[1:24:08] Andrew Huberman: Yes. But, my understanding is that the spatial precision isn't that great. Yes. Ultrasound is something I hear a lot about these days, and my understanding is that ultrasound can allow researchers and clinicians to stimulate specific brain areas, perhaps with more precision. Mhmm.[1:24:27] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you could just give us a Sure. Coverage of what those are being used for. What are your thoughts on on, these forms of noninvasive, Meaning, no no flipping open of a piece of the skull type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity.[1:24:44] Dr. Casey Halpern: Sure. I wanted to clarify also. These these surgeries generally don't, by the way, require a a full craniotomy. It's usually just a Small opening about the size of a dime in the bone. So just just to clarify, but that[1:24:56] Andrew Huberman: is painless too. Right?[1:24:58] Dr. Casey Halpern: Well, usually without pain. Yeah.[1:24:59] Andrew Huberman: There's a little bit of scalp numbing.[1:25:01] Dr. Casey Halpern: We give a scalp block, And the patients are getting IV sedation, so they, in general, don't feel anything. And if they do, they tell me, and we give them more local anesthetic, but that's they're usually asleep during that part. So it's minimally invasive. But, you know, in a lot of ways, there's no such thing as a minimally invasive procedure in the brain. You know?[1:25:17] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's a it's kind of[1:25:18] Andrew Huberman: a misnomeric hear you say that.[1:25:19] Dr. Casey Halpern: Oh, no. I you know, I'm I am not one of those neurosurgeons that you've probably encountered, and we have mutual friends that, and, you know, these mutual friends are some of my Favorite people in neurosurgery, and they probably actually think more like me than than not. But, there are neurosurgeons that you're absolutely right. And and this is true for all surgeries. They they really In a lot of ways, they think what they do is sort of the ground truth or is it closer to the ground truth, and I I get that.[1:25:45] Dr. Casey Halpern: You know, probing with purpose. I I I actually really like that. I'm gonna use that if you don't mind.[1:25:51] Andrew Huberman: Just it's just describing what you do. So the yeah.[1:25:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: But I I actually We have I've always said this. I've said it publicly. I've said it to my boss. I've said this to my team. We need to embrace noninvasive approaches.[1:26:04] Dr. Casey Halpern: Some of them are a little fluffy. Fluffy in that we don't understand how they work. Don't necessarily understand how deep brain stimulation works, by the way. So, but because we don't know exactly how they work, they're not as precise as we would like them to be, so we have work do there. And I actually think that work is doable, and actually underway.[1:26:26] Dr. Casey Halpern: You know, at Stanford, we have great collaborators that that, I think are doing this. People like Nolan Williams and Connor Liston at Cornell and others. So we, I think that TMS, Transprenal magnetic stimulation, it it is FDA approved for depression. By the way, it's also FDA approved for OCD and for nicotine addiction.[1:26:46] Andrew Huberman: Where did they put the coil for those 3?[1:26:48] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's[1:26:49] Andrew Huberman: or more or less?[1:26:49] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. So they they put it over was always on the scalp and, over the frontal lobe. There's different parts of the frontal lobe that have been demonstrated to be a little better or a little bit worse. But what the FDA has approved, for depression, I believe is, similar, to what's been approved for, OCD. But for addiction, I I believe it is a different target, but, we'd have to ask our Our TMS experts on that.[1:27:14] Andrew Huberman: Can they direct the transcranial magnetic stimulation deep below the cortex?[1:27:17] Dr. Casey Halpern: They try. And we're, we're actually studying this in OCD patients Now, I as a part of our invasive trial, we're we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial that's in parallel to what we're doing, all funded by the Foundation For OCD Research, where, we believe we can use TMS to to define a circuit That if modulated improves OCD, albeit temporarily. And in those patients, if it's temporary, they would be appropriate for an invasive study. So, something we're actively working on. I've always believed that neurosurgeons need to be part of the discussion with these noninvasive approaches.[1:27:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: We don't need to do them, But, I think we can help make them more precise and to probe non invasively with purpose, Rather than, this more kind of I don't know. A noninvasive blast effect kind of, You know, I I just can't imagine how that is gonna be as effective as probing with purpose, but you could do that noninvasively as well. And I I think we need to do better, in that way. I do believe that's possible, and I think people are actively trying to do it. Getting deep in the brain with TMS, I think, will always be hard, but You can get there indirectly by using connectivity assays and targeting superficial structures that have High connectivity to deep structures.[1:28:43] Dr. Casey Halpern: So for example, perhaps one day, there will be a TMS target For anorexia and obesity, if we are scratching the surface with invasive approaches to these problems, We we're even doing less with the brain stimulation. So we have so much work to do there. Eating disorders and TMS have been so, sort of, scarcely studied or or there have been so such little research done in that in that space, and so it it it is an area that we need to to work on. For the obvious reason, for example, in a patient with anorexia, just thinking practically, you know, placing a device in a patient who is Significantly underweight might not be the best approach. You know, wound erosion and issues like that could come up.[1:29:28] Dr. Casey Halpern: So developing a noninvasive approach, I think, is critical. The problem is, where do we target? And so the only way to answer that, I think, reliably is To accept that we have to get into the brain before we're out of the brain. And with these kinds of conditions, we're only just starting to get into the brain. You know?[1:29:46] Dr. Casey Halpern: So I I worry that we're A long way away from a noninvasive approach that really works consistently.[1:29:54] Andrew Huberman: Just sorry to interrupt. Yep. I I wanna make sure we touch on ultrasound because Yes. Sure. Go ahead.[1:29:59] Andrew Huberman: But, his historically, it seemed that there was a bit more permission For people to probe around in the human brain, I I've, sometimes refer the podcast to some of these papers that were, done, Allowing patients to self stimulate in the brain. These are, work done in the in the sixties, and now his name escapes me, Robert. Anyway, there's a couple papers published in Science allowing patients to stimulate a couple different brain areas asking which ones they preferred, and I was always shocked and slightly, I'm intrigued by the fact that the the brain area that all 3 of these patients who I don't think had any syndromes, I think they volunteered for these experiments. They I don't think you could do this anymore.[1:30:39] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes. Regulatory Yeah.[1:30:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think[1:30:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: was not the same as it[1:30:42] Andrew Huberman: is now. Things have changed, fortunately, but they, All 3 of them, seem to like some midline thalamic structure, which for those listening is just the area kind of in the in the dead center of the brain, more or less, that, evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger, which surprised me because I would have thought, oh, it's Robert Heath. Yeah. His experiments. Rather than patients preferring to stimulate areas that evoke laughter or joy or a feeling of drunkenness or delight, it it also explains a lot of what I observe in social media.[1:31:13] Andrew Huberman: This serve, kind of people repeatedly engaging in battles, that are kind of trivial. It seems like frustration and anger might have its own reward circuitry. Anyway, I don't wanna go too far down that rabbit hole, but it it,[1:31:26] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's a deep one.[1:31:27] Andrew Huberman: It's a deep one, and and kinda gets to our nature, you know, as humans and what we find interesting or rewarding. But, You know, the the inability to probe around the brain in a safe way without the need for somebody to be A very sick[1:31:46] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:31:46] Andrew Huberman: Would be, I think, would be enormously powerful. And in at least to my mind, if I were in charge, which I'm not, would Offer the opportunity to really come to an understanding about how the human brain works without all these issues of how to translate for mouse studies. And, again, there's huge value to animal studies as we both agree, but, so many of the things that we wanna know about the human brain involve asking the person, Hey. Do you what do you feel when that set of neurons is stimulated, and what don't you feel? Yeah.[1:32:14] Andrew Huberman: And a mouse, we can ask and ask, but they're not gonna tell us something they do tell us. They're not gonna tell us in English. So, how do we overcome this challenge? But first, ultrasound, or if you prefer, after ultrasound. What.[1:32:27] Andrew Huberman: Is ultrasound gonna be really useful towards solving these clinical issues and these basic issues?[1:32:31] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. So I think, Let's start with ultrasound, then we'll come back to it. So ultrasound right now, transcranial magnetic guide magnetic resonance Guided focus ultrasound. So, this this is an FDA approved method to Deliver an ablation to the brain noninvasively. There are, researchers, myself included, that are trying to use Transcranial magnetic guided magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound or MRI guided focus ultrasound, to use it in a modulatory way, not just as an ablation, but to drive neuronal activity or inhibit it perhaps.[1:33:12] Dr. Casey Halpern: We're still learning how to do that. There are trials, that are trying to understand if you can use ultrasound to open the blood brain barrier so you can deliver a medication to that specific, area, perhaps for a brain tumor or something like that. So, it's a very exciting field, and it is FDA approved for tremor right now. And so I actually Do it routinely for patients with, tremor with Parkinson's or essential tremor. And so, I I love doing it.[1:33:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's, often Just kind of a miracle because there's no incision. I don't have to place an electrode into the brain to achieve a a similar result.[1:33:49] Andrew Huberman: How early into the, pathology of Parkinson's, can someone think about approaching this? So for instance, if somebody has a a parent or or a sibling and they're developing some resting tremor[1:33:59] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:33:59] Andrew Huberman: Obviously, they should talk to a neurologist, but a neurosurgeon. But this noninvasive approach could be incredible for them as opposed to just take Only taking drugs to increase dopamine levels.[1:34:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. So, depending on the reason you have tremor would dictate the kind of medication you would use. It could be Parkinson's, but if it's not, it might be essential tremor. By the way, central tremor is 10 times as common as Parkinson's. Really?[1:34:22] Dr. Casey Halpern: Essential tremor is the most common neurologic condition in patients over the age of 70. We often aren't aware of that. People with essential tremor feel they have their forgotten disease because there's no Michael j Fox For essential tremor. I I sent a letter[1:34:35] Andrew Huberman: to Bill Sorry. Is it essential tremor or or Essential tremor. Tremor.[1:34:39] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yep. E s s e n t I a l. Yeah. I actually sent a letter to to Bill Clinton. I I've observed, tremor in him, and I think he's actually disclosed that he has it.[1:34:50] Dr. Casey Halpern: And I Hoped he'd become a champion for for patients with essential tremor. Sandra Day O'Connor does as well. She's also public about it, but I I was not able to get them eager to become the champion for this condition. But like Michael j Fox, these patients need a a champion like that. But, unfortunately, it's a bit of a forgotten disease.[1:35:10] Dr. Casey Halpern: Nevertheless, because of the FDA approval of focused ultrasound for tremor, they're just trying to get some attention for sure, and, it's fabulously effective for these patients. It treats patients on one side, usually their dominant hand or their worse hand. And it, it really speaks to the fact that, wow, you can deliver non invasively an ablation to the brain In a hypothesized zone that we think is related to the problem at hand, and at least with tremor, it works really well, Could this be effective for psychiatric disease, obesity, eating disorders? Well, perhaps. Actually, that would be the ideal.[1:35:48] Dr. Casey Halpern: The problem is we don't know where to do the ablation. There is a trial that we would like to do for OCD where we would deliver an ablation to Same area of the brain that we've been delivering ablations to for years for patients with OCD, and it helps a bit. That's called a capsulotomy. Really, the outcome is probably gonna be about the same. It's a nice method because it's it's noninvasive, but, we need to find a new target for these for these conditions.[1:36:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: And because of the common denominator of the urge despite the risk, sort of that compulsion, Yeah. Perhaps it could be the same target. I don't know. But I would argue we need to do these modulatory experiments either with a device or With, invasive recordings, to better understand where these problems are coming from, to define where we should do an ultrasound treatment. So, you're right.[1:36:39] Dr. Casey Halpern: Historically, without much regulation, we've we've probed the brain. The problem we can't learn a lot from those experiments now. Well, in this way, at least. We don't know exactly where those electrodes were. We didn't have MRI scanning or high quality CAT scanning to to know where those electrodes were with certainty.[1:37:00] Dr. Casey Halpern: We're and we and we know 2 or 3 millimeters matters. We also didn't have the tools to place electrodes in a precise way back then. So, unfortunately, we can't learn a lot from those experiments right now, So we're sort of redesigning them, and there is a way to do it now. Patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time. There has been a revolution in America.[1:37:22] Dr. Casey Halpern: It was In Europe, before it was in America where we would do stereoencephalography, which is basically like doing an EEG of patients with epilepsy, But with invasive electrodes, and we would place tiny little wires less than a millimeter diameter all throughout the brain into parts of the brain that we believe are involved in seizures. And we would admit the patients to the hospital and figure out where the seizures were starting and propagating, and then, you know, we could stimulate these electrodes see if there was a symptom that was important, and I try to identify a a region that we thought we could either remove Surgically, ablate with a laser or put a a stimulator in it perhaps. That's commonplace now for epilepsy, And it works extremely well, and it's very safe. Of course, it's still a brain procedure, but the, the complication rate is Surprisingly low, quite honestly, for the amount of electrodes that we place, and it's extremely well tolerated. Most of these patients leave the hospital, and they don't even feel like they've had surgery.[1:38:21] Dr. Casey Halpern: So, there's actually a lot of interest in using that procedure to study mental health disorders. We are trying to do it for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. We're awaiting an FDA decision on that. But actually, I credit, our colleagues at Baylor and at UCSF for for studying this, already. We have fabulous colleagues at UCSF, that have studied depression using this type of approach, a a mutual friend of ours.[1:38:51] Dr. Casey Halpern: You know, Eddie, Chang, who who's a a wonderful friend and colleague, somebody I've emulated for many years as well, and and the the psychiatry team at UCSF have worked together on this, sort of bringing together the epilepsy technique and the psychiatry expertise to study how we could better target Electrodes in depression. And I'll tell you, if they have a consistent target, perhaps there becomes an ultrasound target. But right now, the approach is a bit more reversible because you can always shut that electrode off or even remove the electrode If perhaps it's not in the optimal location to treat the depression. But actually after a large volume of, cases, perhaps, They could pool that data to develop a a new ultrasound target for depression. I think that would be fabulous and probably is their long term goal.[1:39:43] Dr. Casey Halpern: To speak for them, but that would be something that I I'm sure is on their radar. And a bailer is trying to do the same thing, for depression. Their approaches are a little bit different, but a similar tool to try to understand, depression. And, you know, we're working with all of these types of, colleagues, some of these are our friends to try to to bring this to, OCD as well, and, you know, it makes sense to try to do this for addiction and obesity and anorexia. You might ask, well, why aren't you doing this for obesity right now in, in our in our study?[1:40:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: And the reason is that, we've developed a target For obesity, and binge eating disorder, developed out of mice that we believe, is relevant for the human state because you can model this problem a mouse, a bit better than than you can model depression or OCD. So we feel like we can rely on the preclinical studies more. Whereas with these, perhaps, more I don't wanna say more complicated, but more human mental health conditions that are hard to model in a mouse, You really have to study it in the human, and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient, a patient that has electrodes and try to provoke a depressed state or study epileptics, Like doctor Chang has done that have comorbid depression, for example, and that can really validate this approach as well. But in the end, it's it's getting into the human brain that we need to do in the disease specifically, that will eventually lead to a Noninvasive approach, either a lesion or a modulatory approach. Modulatory would be like TMS or lesion approach would be with, ultrasound.[1:41:17] Andrew Huberman: I couldn't agree more. Meanwhile, because there are many, many millions of people suffering from depression, eating disorders, Parkinson's and essential tremor, etcetera. Well, first of all, I should say, based on everything you've told me Thus far, it's amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work because of how systemic they are in impacting serotonin Serotonergic neurons over here and dopaminergic neurons over there are not targeting any specific batch of cells. It makes perfect sense as to why all the side effects exist. But earlier, you said something that really grabbed my attention I wanna come back to, which is that if people can be made to feel or make themselves feel Just a little bit better, a little less anxious just prior to a craving episode or a binge episode.[1:42:07] Andrew Huberman: Maybe even if people can become better at detecting their own internal states. And when they're kind of veering toward a binge or veering toward using a drug or Maybe you're veering towards suicidal thinking. I based on what you said earlier, that those kind of, Pre behavioral states, the kinda drift on the on the steering. Those sound like powerful Levels of awareness. At least for now, until we have specific sites in the brain that we can target noninvasive methods that could be deployed to millions and millions of people, seems like That awareness seems like maybe among the best tools that people could develop.[1:42:50] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes. A 100% agree with you.[1:42:52] Andrew Huberman: You know, so for the person with OCD or, who Suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder, and to their clinicians, you know, I I I just wanna highlight that you said that. I mean, I I'm not again, I'm not a clinician. I always say this. I don't prescribe anything. I Profess things.[1:43:07] Andrew Huberman: And, but awareness of one's thinking seems immensely powerful in this context. Yeah. And after all, it is the clinical probe that you use because the if let's say the patient were to lie to you about their experience of what happens in their mind when you stimulate. You could basically, the whole thing the whole surgery, the whole procedure could Could be go badly wrong. So it's it's up to the patient to be, of course, honest with you, and they're they're, incentivized to do that.[1:43:40] Andrew Huberman: But to be honest with themselves About, you know, I've gone all day without a binge, but, you know, the the smell of a donut or the thought of a donut is starting to have a particular allure. That awareness seems like an incredibly powerful thing to own and to and to build and cultivate.[1:43:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes. I've always thought that if we can improve awareness, we can improve outcomes. I think that's probably true for many of these patients. The problem I think comes down to the fact that some of these patients are so resistant to treatment. And the patients that we see as a surgeon, for example, are the patients that they've tried cognitive behavioral therapy.[1:44:18] Dr. Casey Halpern: They've tried medications. They've tried behavioral management. They are aware of their problem, and they've shown that to us. They can tell us when they're craving. But despite the craving and despite being involved in this invasive brain surgical trial, highly, you know, first in human novel study, I think will have a positive effect, but it's still experimental.[1:44:40] Dr. Casey Halpern: They still can't stop themselves. So they're Sort of as made aware as could possibly be. Did I use grammar there correctly? I think so. They're as aware as they could possibly be, And they still lose control.[1:44:55] Dr. Casey Halpern: We've had this studied in the lab. So we will bring patients to the laboratory with this implanted device To to try to provoke this electric graphic electrical signal, that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they're at home. But before we actually initiate stimulation, we want us to see, can this device detect this craving cell signal, which is gonna be different than what we saw in the operating room because that's a single cell. But these devices, these electrodes are about a millimeter in diameter instead of, like, a tenth of a millimeter, which is what we use in the operating room. So they're they're only hearing or or detecting, I should say, thousands of cells responses.[1:45:36] Dr. Casey Halpern: And We actually have a way to provoke binges. It's called a mood provocation. It's very well well very well validated. It's a little bit like provoking seizures in the epilepsy monitoring unit, but here in these sort of, psychiatric monitoring unit or the the food monitoring unit, we we actually have a psychiatrist and eating disorder specialist come and induce a mood that is related to Each patient's sort of self described binge episode.[1:46:09] Andrew Huberman: So the psychiatrist comes in and provokes Yes. A feeling that can evoke the negative behavior.[1:46:17] Dr. Casey Halpern: That's exactly right. So that we can video and synchronize the video to the brain signal recordings. The patients all wear an eye tracker so we can see what they're eating at all times what they're looking at specifically. And that allows us to have the best temporal resolution possible To understand what is happening right before the bite, and even under video surveillance through a one day one way mirror in a laboratory Setting. When patients are very well aware that they're there to be studied if they're going to binge, they still do.[1:46:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: And we believe they do because they just can't control it as aware as they are of it, and it's probably because they're the most severe. So I think if we can improve awareness, not just the societal awareness that I was talking about earlier, but the patient awareness, around their problem, I think that could be a powerful way to help so many of these patients, and that's sort of the role of cognitive behavioral therapy. The problem with cognitive behavioral therapy or I should say the limitation of it, actually don't have a any problem with it. I think it's a wonderful treatment. Is that if you stop it, many of these patients go back to their old behaviors.[1:47:30] Dr. Casey Halpern: I don't wanna say old habits, but it might be a habit, but the old behaviors. And so, that's the problem is that it's not necessarily lasting in the absence of continued cognitive behavioral therapy. Some people can benefit from it long term, but some can't. But I think in in in in the less severe patients, Improving awareness, key. But in these really refractory patients, this is this is kind of like this is the disease.[1:47:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: Despite the awareness, they can't control themselves. And that's what we're trying to restore is that improved ability to control their behavior.[1:48:01] Andrew Huberman: Do you think there's a role for machines and, artificial intelligence here? There are a couple laboratories up at the University of Washington that are using particular signature patterns of Within voice to try and help suicidal, people who are suicidally depressed Know when they're headed towards an episode before they even can consciously know. So this gets right down to issues of free will and whether or not machines can be smarter than we are. You know, one could argue that some of the search algorithms on Google and other search engines are actually more aware of our preferences than we are. Mhmm.[1:48:39] Andrew Huberman: Basically, what these are, these are devices that are listening to people talk all day. They're also paying attention to patterns of breathing and how well people slept, etcetera, integrating a a huge number of cues And then signaling somebody with a, you know, a yellow light. Like, you know, you're headed into a depressive episode, and the person might say, I feel fine, where I feel pretty good. This is kind of baseline state for me, and they say, uh-uh. This is where you were preceding the last episode that took you down a deep, Dark trench, and it took months to get out of.[1:49:08] Andrew Huberman: Yep. I wonder whether or not some of these devices could help with the sorts of things that we're talking about today.[1:49:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. I think so. I've always said we have to get in the brain before we get out of it. And if we get in the brain and understand what these signals look like, We'll know what those noninvasive signals are. I think it's possible that we are, scientifically sophisticated enough to Use machine learning, and sort of this kind of bot tech technique to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive.[1:49:42] Dr. Casey Halpern: Know, suicide is the most dangerous impulse. It's something that is immensely a focus of the lab is impulsivity. We've talked mostly about compulsion. Compulsion being, you know, going after a reward or or the urge despite the risk. Impulsivity is is similar, but different.[1:50:01] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's kind of going after something, a little bit if you if you model impulsivity in a in a mouse, it's, you know, related to, You know, going after a a food reward without the sort of paired tone that your the mouse is supposed to wait for. The mouse doesn't wanna wait anymore. They they just go after the food.[1:50:21] Andrew Huberman: I've been that mouse.[1:50:22] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. We all have. We could all relate with this, to a certain extent. Again, it's a spectrum. Mhmm.[1:50:29] Dr. Casey Halpern: So, so in any case, I, non sequitur, but I I I certainly think that There is a way to use our own body's physiology to anticipate When these impulses are coming online, how best to do that? I think we're just scratching the surface, but, These are the kinds of solutions we need. These are some of these problems are of epidemic proportions. Largest public health problems in this country, in this world, obesity, opiate crisis, depression Yeah. Suicidality.[1:51:03] Dr. Casey Halpern: I mean, that's like a third of our country, maybe more. Probably more if you think about it.[1:51:08] Andrew Huberman: And a colleague of ours at Stanford Psychiatry told me something that still just blows my mind, which is that Something like 75% of the antidepressant and antianxiety medication that exists in the world is consumed in the United States. It's amazing. Which is I mean, that's an outrageous number.[1:51:26] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. We do have an obsession in this country for pharmacy, you know, and, the pharmaceutical industry is very powerful here and probably related such some aspect of capitalism. I'm capitalistic and, just like everybody else, but, I do worry about a little bit. But, you know, we tend to overprescribe, and I think we, as patients, tend to, Over want medication. We like quick solutions, and sometimes medications provide it, sometimes not, or they're often just a Band Aid.[1:51:54] Dr. Casey Halpern: Depends on the problem, of course. So, but I but I I agree that we need scalable solutions. But, you know, I'm I'm a neurosurgeon. Only gonna be able to treat the most severe of patients with these problems. You know, you know, we've only done about 200,000 Deep brain stimulation surgeries ever.[1:52:15] Dr. Casey Halpern: So, I mean, the problem we're talking about here is 50,000,000 Americans. There's no Possibility that surgeons can address that problem, but we could help inspire an initiative to go after that kind of problem or help make it more rigorous. Because the last thing we need is a, you know, some sort of wearable fancy tool that, you know, Waste people's money and time. You know, we need real therapies for these things. Not that these devices that we're discussing are not.[1:52:44] Dr. Casey Halpern: I think actually there's lots of promise, We use machine learning in the lab all the time. I'm not a an electrical engineer or the computational neuroscientist doing this type of work. I I just helped develop the hypothesis around it, But, and help fundraise around it. But I I definitely think there's a a future for it. I just I I suspect we're we're scratching the surface on how best to do it.[1:53:05] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about your hands. Yeah. Sure. All the neurosurgeons I know are, you know, very faithfully Protect their hands and stuff about because hand[1:53:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: insurance is too expensive.[1:53:16] Andrew Huberman: That's right. But I'm guessing that you all are not the ones to reach into the garbage disposal, even if your eye is on the switch to make sure that it isn't gonna get Even if your eye is on the switch to make sure that it isn't gonna get turned on. They're just too precious. They are your livelihood.[1:53:28] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah.[1:53:29] Andrew Huberman: And earlier, we talked about deadlifts. There are other forms of exercise. There are things like tennis. There there's Drawing and painting a full range of things that one can do with their hands. Use your imagination, folks.[1:53:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: Sure.[1:53:42] Andrew Huberman: Is it true that neurosurgeons Don't do any, really, like, heavy grip activity because it can refine the motor motor circuits In the brain and elsewhere, that can throw off their neurosurgery game.[1:53:59] Dr. Casey Halpern: I would say that many neurosurgeons, Avoid activities that put their hands at risk. Another one, by the way, you know, there's a, an annual, softball tournament, that neurosurgeons come to in New York City in Central Park[1:54:17] Andrew Huberman: With a very softball. No. I'm just giving you Well, actually,[1:54:20] Dr. Casey Halpern: it's it's actually a a very, you know, typical hearts, Huffball. I don't know why they call it softball. And, actually, 2 close colleagues of mine have gotten injured at that Maybe this is it's also[1:54:32] Andrew Huberman: I must say in here, I'm poking fun. But for those of you who are going in the medical profession, it's also one of the more, how should I say this? Well, I'm just gonna say it. There's a steep hierarchy of training in neurosurgery. Yes.[1:54:44] Andrew Huberman: There's a certain harshness that's been conveyed to me about the training, much like astronaut training, to be totally fair. And so maybe this is a tactic to, to weed out either the younger or the the older generation.[1:54:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: This is evolution. Right? We, have to evolve and We're we're in medical treatment. The weak, I guess. Well, I I could say that one of the individuals that got injured is one of the more Senior surgeons that I work with now and is one of the best athletes that I know, and he's definitely not weak, but you can get injured playing these sports.[1:55:13] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, That being said, I can tell you briefly is, I think that you know, it's funny. My my mother came to me recently. She's she has osteopenia, And she told me her doctor told her she's not allowed to do deadlifts, and I was like, okay. That's fine. I'm not telling you you should do deadlifts.[1:55:31] Dr. Casey Halpern: I just don't exactly understand the relationship. But, I can say that I do think I'll I'll give you a little story here. The reason why I'm being a little Hesitant to to confirm that I agree with you on the dead list is I, when I was operating this is when I was at Stanford, University operating, and, We as I mentioned earlier, like, we get an intraoperative CAT scan, to confirm accuracy for our lectures. I do this for all of my surgeries. When I was reviewing that CAT scan, the X-ray technician Looked at me and said whispered into my ear.[1:56:03] Dr. Casey Halpern: He's like,[1:56:04] Andrew Huberman: your posture is really bad. It's embarrassing. Your physical posture while doing your surgeries. Yeah. Uh-huh.[1:56:10] Dr. Casey Halpern: And I looked at him, and I and I kind of wanted to say I won't curse, but saying about that.[1:56:14] Andrew Huberman: I yeah.[1:56:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exact I mean, I I've been doing it intermittently during our conversation because He made me realize that I I really did have bad posture, and, we kind of had a little brief aside and he he I learned he was a personal trainer, and, his name was Zach. And he, you know, he said to me, you know, your your posture is weak because or your posture is poor because you're weak. You need to strengthen your body and strengthen your core. I was like, how? He's like, power lifting.[1:56:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: And I'm like, I'm a little hesitant to do this. And I'll tell you, I started very slowly, And I can't prescribe power lifting to everybody for the exact reason you said, and I've gotten hurt doing it, by the way. But I do think I I wish I started a little younger, and I would argue that with close supervision and very Well, if you are if you have a very experienced trainer, which I would argue if you're a neurosurgeon or an astronaut, or or have a highly specialized Profession where you need your your limbs to to to function. Dentists, things like that. If you're gonna take something on like this, it really needs to be Extremely carefully supervised.[1:57:20] Dr. Casey Halpern: And I can tell you that, you know, my my trainer had a profound impact on my life and my posture and my my physical health. And so, we did dead lift. I'll I'll admit. So when you brought it up, I I kind of chuckled to myself. But, yes, I I have gotten Mildly hurt dead lifting, but it was when I was doing it by myself and I was kind of cocky and I wasn't paying attention.[1:57:40] Dr. Casey Halpern: But when I was with him and he was all over my technique, It actually was the most efficient way for me to feel stronger, and it improved my posture, significantly. And I I miss him since I've left California, I I I have a new trainer in Philadelphia who's great, but, and and I still deadlift occasionally with him, but I, I I can say I I am opposed to deadlifting Callously. But if you're extremely well monitored by an experienced, personal trainer or weightlifter, I think it could be a great exercise.[1:58:13] Andrew Huberman: Great. I'm I love to be wrong in this case, because I'm a huge proponent. And now on the podcast, I go on and on. I mean, there's so There's so much data now pointing the fact that 100 and 180 to 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio kinda jogging, cycling, swimming type behavior is very healthy for everybody, and we should all be doing that, at least that.[1:58:33] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yes. I need to as well.[1:58:35] Andrew Huberman: And that resistance training on the order of, you know, Six hard sets per muscle group per week are is really important just to offset deterioration of muscles[1:58:43] Dr. Casey Halpern: and I'm learning as we go here.[1:58:44] Andrew Huberman: Skeletal function and tendon strength, and that's just to maintain. We're not talking about all out sets to absolute failure, but, Ed, as you point out with, with proper form. So even the neurosurgeons are doing this, which I think is is wonderful. Yes. As a final question, but one that I think really or maybe second to final question.[1:59:06] Andrew Huberman: Earlier, I commented on the, remarkable calm, at least perceived calm of neurosurgeons. It could be cause or could be effect of the training, but it's obvious to me why one would want that trait In their neurosurgeon, you I wouldn't want a hyperactive certainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon given that the margins of error are so So tiny spatial scale and probably on the temporal scale too. Yes. And you don't want people doing things in time that are, you know, or being spontaneous at all. Do you think that this branch of medicine that you're in selects for people that at least can know how to control any kind of fluctuations and autonomic arousal.[1:59:50] Andrew Huberman: They can calm themselves in real time. And here's a specific question. When I've never operated on the human brain. Although I've Had the privilege of being in the operating room and seeing in this with some of our experiments with people in VR. It's a remarkable thing.[2:00:02] Andrew Huberman: I wish for everybody that would get this experience at some point, not Hopefully, as a patient, unless they have a need, but to observe it. But what was just striking to me is, the various Stereotype behaviors of the surgeon. And when I did surgeries as a graduate student, as a postdoc in the brains of other types of animals, I would find, for instance, that if I started to tremble a little bit, if I tapped my Left foot that my hand would stabilize a bit, that there's this kind of need to move the body or one feels the impulse. Maybe that's my my Tourette's like compulsions again. But but that one can kind of, siphon off some of that energy into another limb so that you could remain precise.[2:00:42] Andrew Huberman: So are these sorts of things that I'm talking about are maybe it's entirely my imagination, but are are these the sorts of things that one learns as a neurosurgeon? How to Still the body and still the mind. Do you have a meditative practice? When you go into the operating room, if you had a particularly challenging morning or or a poor night's sleep, Do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself and get yourself into the zone? I think this would be very interesting for people to get insight into even if they don't wanna be neurosurgeon.[2:01:11] Dr. Casey Halpern: Yeah. I I completely agree, and I I appreciate the earlier, reference to neurosurgeons as, astronauts, because I've also heard, you know, as compared to cowboys before, and it's a little bit less flattering. I, you know, Some of what we do surgically really does require a substantial amount of confidence, and that confidence hopefully comes from Years of training and experience. You you always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced, And that that that is problematic. Luckily, I you know, so rarely see that because our training is so rigorous.[2:01:49] Dr. Casey Halpern: You know, we have a a board of, American Board of Neurological Surgeons that, sort of allows and and assesses surgeons to continue practice, and holds us to a really high bar. I do think it tends to attract a certain personality. In my subspecialty, I as a, like, a deep brain stimulation surgeon, we call it stereotactic and functional neurosurgery. You know, some people have likened us to the neurologists With a scalpel. We we tend to be a bit more intellectual.[2:02:23] Dr. Casey Halpern: Maybe maybe bedside manner is a little bit friendlier. Then there's the the vascular neurosurgeon who doesn't sleep, and so they're not as friendly. There's the spine surgeons who operate the most, and so they're, you know, busy, busy, busy. We there are some of these kind of reputations going around, but I I agree with you. There is a sort of a common feature of of a calmness, across neurosurgeons, and, know, there's some of my, obviously, my favorite people, my closest friends, and I I can relate with them probably because of that.[2:02:55] Dr. Casey Halpern: Sort of a big picture. They don't get sort of, flustered. They they tend to Are they tend to be really good at figuring out how to have quality time because we work really hard. Our hours are, significant. And so the time with our families, our friends is less than we would like it to be.[2:03:17] Dr. Casey Halpern: Obviously, that's true for people who work hard across any profession, but definitely true for neurosurgeons. And I think that we're very good at figuring out how to make that time high quality. You know, even just texting with some of my friends, in that are that are neurosurgeons. A great friend of mine just became chairman at Duke, and just Connecting with him by text, which takes seconds. You know?[2:03:38] Dr. Casey Halpern: You feel we feel connected. You know? And I I think that's a that that's a trait Amongst neurosurgeons, we sort of know how to cut to the chase in a way, and prioritize our time. It's a skill that we probably Have innately, but is also part of the training. You know, when we are interns now, there's a lot of work hour regulations that is Probably quite appropriate, by the way.[2:04:00] Dr. Casey Halpern: I I think our hours before were bordering, on on, on not necessarily let's let's just say they were not ideal for mental health and sleep, which we know are very important components. Certainly, we had no time for meditation. I definitely did not. I I wish I did. Now knowing what I know about meditation, my wife's a health coach, I I Get it.[2:04:23] Dr. Casey Halpern: I see it. I I I practice it myself with her. I see the value. I wish I had that tool when I was in training because it's stressful. You know, you even with the workout restrictions, we still don't sleep very much.[2:04:36] Dr. Casey Halpern: We're still at work a lot, about 80 hours, you know, a a week.[2:04:39] Andrew Huberman: Throughout the entire career.[2:04:41] Dr. Casey Halpern: There are times when it's more because after training, there's no work hour restrictions. So sometimes I feel like as faculty, we get abused, And the trainees are a little bit more protected now. It would definitely was the reverse at one point, and that's also a huge problem. Probably more of a problem. And I'm joking a little bit.[2:04:59] Dr. Casey Halpern: I I don't necessarily think we're abused, but certainly, our hours are significant. But, you know, they come a bit more here and there. You know? On my OR days when I'm operating, those are long days. But on the days that I'm lucky enough to be a researcher, know, like you, those days tend to be a bit gentler unless I'm grant writing.[2:05:18] Dr. Casey Halpern: Those days can be long as you know. So I so to answer your question, I do think we're we're sort of self selected for it, but I also think it's part of the training. You know, we because of the long hours that we're in the hospital, we're taking care of sick patients, And we have sort of a type a mentor approach where our mentors are hard on us. You know, we learn to cope with our stress and be efficient And prioritize things despite the the stress of it all. And I think, you know, we take from that this sort of calm demeanor.[2:05:51] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, you know, perhaps, perhaps it's just amplifies what we're probably drawn to. Because before we come to neurosurgery, we might rotate in neurosurgery. We might been a month, you know, pretending to be a neurosurgeon, learning from residents and and and faculty that are practicing the the specialty. But, You know, prior to actually starting your training, you you never experienced anything like being a a resident in neurosurgery. The stress and The the volume of patients that you have to take care of and the the long nights, it can be quite lonely, by the way.[2:06:25] Dr. Casey Halpern: You develop friends in the hospital, but Sometimes you're on your own when you're on call, and you have backup. You can call your chief resident or your attending, but you really have to learn how to Take care of patients yourself. You obviously form teams with nurses and staff and things like that and other residents, but it can be lonely. It can be really Challenging. And I think because of those experiences that all neurosurgeons go through, you know, we tend to have this sort of Unflappable personality that perhaps we started with a bit compared to the average person, but the training definitely amplifies it.[2:07:01] Andrew Huberman: And do you have tools that you implement if you ever feel that you're getting slightly off center?[2:07:07] Dr. Casey Halpern: I do now. You know, I when I was in training, I I actually remember in my 2nd year. So most neurosurgery programs when you're a junior resident, in some ways, that's your toughest year. Not in every way. It it it is your toughest year because it's you're you're young and you're inexperienced, and you don't know what you don't know.[2:07:32] Dr. Casey Halpern: And and that that's why it's such a tough year because you have to learn a lot very quickly For patient safety reasons, for self survival, you know, you just have to learn a lot, and you're on call by yourself in the hospital. And It's, it's a real challenge, and I think that, you know, I you know, personally, I I gained a lot of weight during that year. The only exercise I did Consciously was taking the stairs. I refused to take the elevator. And I was at, Penn at at HOP where I currently practice now.[2:08:00] Dr. Casey Halpern: And, I remember I would see patients anywhere from sort of the ground floor where the trauma bay was or the ER, all the way up to Founder's 12th, the 12th floor, I would never take an elevator. That was my rule for the year because I knew I would not have time to exercise, but I would just take the stairs. And in the beginning of the year, I would I would be a little winded when I got to the 12th floor. But by the end of the year, actually, it didn't really faze me. It became a a great habit to have.[2:08:23] Dr. Casey Halpern: The problem with that though was I paired that, unfortunately, with, You know, a lot of sleepless nights or not enough sleep, let's say. And I had this terrible habit of Drinking coffee late at night, and I would put a lot of sugar in it. And it was sort of the only way for me to get a quick, you know, A a quick bout of energy that for some reason I prioritized at that time, obviously, knowing that I would crash, which I always did, and I always kind of regretted it, but I still did it anyway. And I I I attribute that to poor decision making, inexperience, and perhaps being a little vulnerable, like I think we all are. That's why I I relate with a lot of the research that I do.[2:09:02] Dr. Casey Halpern: And I remember I got married in my 3rd year, the year after my 2nd year. And my wife and I or my fiance at the time, started going to the gym together in the morning, and my hours were a little better, so I would actually be able to exercise before I operated that day. And I operated almost every day as a 3rd year resident. So I remember I'd get to the gym really early, and I in 3 months, I lost, like, 20 pounds. And I wasn't trying to lose weight.[2:09:24] Dr. Casey Halpern: I just was sleeping better and taking care of myself. And I remember when we got married, I I, you know, I fit into a tuxedo that I had in college or it would have fit me in college. It actually was a new tuxedo, admittedly, but it was the same size as my tuxedo from college. So I I think that, I I've always related with the problems that our our our patients have to a certain extent, and, you know, I When I've been most vulnerable, which is when I was working the hardest with the least amount of sleep, I I related with it the most. And, Yes.[2:09:53] Dr. Casey Halpern: Exercise for me has always been my tool. More recently, exercise, some some, you know, strength training, I think, is important compared with Cardio, I don't do enough of either, but I definitely do some, and that helps. Meditation helps me a bit. We I do that every night before I go to sleep. You know, I I use an app for it.[2:10:14] Dr. Casey Halpern: It's probably not the best way to do meditation,[2:10:16] Andrew Huberman: but If it keeps you doing it regularly Exactly. That's the best way to do it.[2:10:19] Dr. Casey Halpern: Andrew, I couldn't be with you more. You know? It's one of those things where I look forward to it every night. And, you know, sometimes my wife falls asleep, And I come to bed a little later, and I whisper. I'm like, are you okay if I turn the app on?[2:10:30] Dr. Casey Halpern: So Mhmm. You know, and she does the same to me because I think we both value it today. I think that's that that's been very helpful. And I I didn't have that pool, probably when I needed it most, but I have it now, and it and it's very helpful.[2:10:41] Andrew Huberman: I really appreciate you sharing, those tools. A a number of people, I'm guessing out there might wanna become neurosurgeons. I really believe that in hearing today's conversation that you will spark an interest in medicine and or neurosurgery. I hope so. Well, certainly, you need to be a a a physician before you can become a neurosurgeon.[2:10:58] Andrew Huberman: So and neurosurgery in some cases, And that would be beautiful, and I predict that will be happen that will happen, excuse me, as a consequence of, what you've shared today. I really appreciate your mentioning of the, emphasis and appreciation on, quality time. I very much see this as quality time. I I know that our listeners were will as well. Really wanna thank you for taking time out out of your not just immensely busy, but very important schedule because, Again, the work that you're doing is really out there on that cutting I don't wanna say bleeding edge because in this context, it's not gonna sound right.[2:11:33] Andrew Huberman: But on that Extreme cutting edge of what we understand about how the human brain works and how it can be repaired. They're doing marvelous work. We'll point people to, various places they can find you online, and, should they need your the help of your clinic to to your clinic and your laboratory as well. So on behalf of everybody and and myself as well, thank you so so very much.[2:11:57] Dr. Casey Halpern: I'm honored. Thank you so much for having me.[2:11:59] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor Casey Halpern about the use of deep brain stimulation and novel technologies for the treatment of eating disorders and movement disorders of various kinds.
