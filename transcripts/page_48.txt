I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing doctor Duncan French as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Doctor French is the vice president of performance at the UFC Performance Institute, And he has over 20 years of experience working with elite professional and Olympic athletes. Prior to joining the UFC, French was the director of performance science at the University of Notre Dame, and he has many, many quality peer reviewed studies to his name exploring, for instance, how the particular order of exercise, whether or not One performs endurance exercise prior to resistance training or vice versa, how that impacts performance of various movements and endurance training protocols as well as the impact on hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and some of the stress hormones such as cortisol.[0:01:01] Andrew Huberman: He's also done fascinating work exploring how Neurotransmitters, things like dopamine and epinephrine, also called adrenaline, can impact hormones and how hormones can impact neurotransmitter release. What's particularly unique about doctor French's work is that he's figured out specific training protocols that can maximize, for instance, testosterone output or reduce stress hormone output in order to maximize the effects of training in the short term and in the long So today, you're going to learn a lot of protocols whether or not you're into resistance training or endurance training. You will learn, for instance, how to regulate the duration of your training and the type of training that you do in order to get the maximum benefit from that training over time. So whether or not you are somebody who just Sizes recreationally for your health, whether or not you're an amateur or professional athlete, or whether or not you're just trying to maximize your health through the use of endurance and or resistance Training. Today's discussion will have a wealth of takeaways for you.[0:02:02] Andrew Huberman: There are only a handful of people working at the intersection of elite performance, mechanistic science, and that can do so in a way that leads to direct immediately applicable protocols that anybody can benefit From doctor French also provides some incredibly important insights about the direction that sport and exercise are taking in the world today and their applications towards performance and health. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA.[0:02:46] Andrew Huberman: ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are The absolute highest quality. I've spent my career working on the visual system, and I can tell you that everything about the way that ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed was with Performance in mind. First of all, they're extremely lightweight, so you actually forget that you're wearing them most of the time. Second of all, even if you get Sweaty, if you're running or biking or it's a hot day or running around just happen to be perspiring quite a lot, they don't slip off your face, which is terrific. They also have a great aesthetic, and they have a lot of different styles to choose from.[0:03:16] Andrew Huberman: The clarity of the lenses is superb. I don't think there's a match for the clarity of Roca glasses out there, and if there is, I'm not aware of it. They are absolutely crystal clear, and that's true in any environment. Whether or not you're working in a dim environment or a bright environment, the clarity is Unmatched. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to roka.com.[0:03:37] Andrew Huberman: That's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your 1st order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are uniquely tailored to Your sleep needs. All of us have unique sleep needs, and we should be sleeping on a mattress that's ideal for us. If you go to the Helix site, have a quick 2 minute quiz, asks you a number of questions about whether or not you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach, do you tend to run hot or cold, etcetera.[0:04:05] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you don't have the answers to those questions, which is fine. They'll match you to the mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. I took that quiz, and about 10 months ago, I started sleeping on the Dusk Helix mattress, that's d u s k. That's the mattress that's ideal for me, and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helix sleep dot com/huberman, take their 2 minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress, and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders and 2 free pillows.[0:04:33] Andrew Huberman: That's helix sleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 published studies. By now, I think most people have heard about or experienced the benefits of meditation, improved focus, better sleep, reduced stress, More creativity and insight. There's just so many studies out there that support those claims.[0:04:55] Andrew Huberman: The challenge, however, is sticking to a meditation practice. And over the years, I confess there have been times when I've meditated regularly and then I stopped meditating even though it always provides benefits for me the 1st time I do it and every time I do it. With the Headspace app, it makes it very easy to meditate consistently because they have different types of meditations to select from, and they come In different durations. So sometimes I only have 3 or 4 minutes to meditate. They have those sorts of meditations.[0:05:21] Andrew Huberman: They also have longer meditations of 20 minutes or more. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a free 1 month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations that you can use in any situation. This is the best deal offered by Headspace right now. So, again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer.[0:05:42] Andrew Huberman: And now my conversation with doctor Duncan French. Duncan French, great to see[0:05:47] Dr. Duncan French: you again. Likewise. Likewise. Thank you. I don't don't have many, Stanford professors in the Performance Institute, so I'm I'm I'm really excited.[0:05:54] Andrew Huberman: Oh, well, this place is amazing, and, you have a huge, role in making it what it is. The reason I'm so excited to talk with you is that, yeah, you're one of these rare beasts That you have been involved in human performance and athletic performance at the collegiate level. You are obviously very involved in MMA now and the UFC Performance Institute, and you also, had the fortunate I like to think of doing a PhD in, what exactly was the PhD in? It's exercise physiology. Physiology.[0:06:28] Andrew Huberman: So you're familiar also with designing studies, Control groups, all the sorts of things that, in my opinion, anyway, are kind of lacking from the Internet, Social media version of, exercise science, which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas about how people should be training, what they should be doing, and eating and not eating and doing. And certainly, science doesn't have all the answers, but I just think it's so rare to find somebody that's at the convergence of all those different fields. And, so I have a lot of questions for you today that I'm I'm sure the audience are gonna be really interested in it.[0:07:01] Dr. Duncan French: Well, listen. I mean, I I appreciate that. It's very humbling. And, yeah, I've worked hard to get to where I am, but I've always tried to be authentic. And I think authenticity comes Alongside, you know, academic rigor and and objectivity and insight and and and knowledge base.[0:07:17] Dr. Duncan French: Right? At the end of the day, it's about, having confidence, having expertise, and being able to deliver that expertise to to in my world to athletes. And I think, what I've always tried to do. I've tried to have many strings to my bow, so that I can talk with many different hats on. You know?[0:07:34] Dr. Duncan French: But one day I'm talking to a coach, next I'm talking to an athlete, day, I'm talking to a CEO. The next day, I'm talking to a, you know, an academic professor. And then, you know so I think, you know, being able to wear those different hats is certainly a skill set that tried to, to build throughout my career and, you know, like I said, I've been blessed to work with, I think it was 36 different professional or Olympic Last time I've co I I I counted. So, yeah, it's been it's been a wild ride. It's been great.[0:07:59] Andrew Huberman: Which of those sports was the most unusual?[0:08:02] Dr. Duncan French: I've worked with Crown Green Bowling, which I don't know. As an American guy, I don't know. You know? I don't know that.[0:08:08] Andrew Huberman: Heard of it.[0:08:09] Dr. Duncan French: Basically, imagine a, you know, a a 20 foot by 20 foot square of turf, with a a small raise in the middle, I e, the crown. So it's it it slopes to the edges. And then, you know, you use you you you throw out a white jack, a smaller ball, and then you you sort of roll out larger balls To to try and get closest to the jack. It's, it's a very, European thing, let's say. Interesting.[0:08:33] Dr. Duncan French: But, yeah, sports performance at Crown Green Bowling. There you go.[0:08:36] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Wow. And then to, a mixed martial arts,[0:08:40] Dr. Duncan French: fighters Absolutely.[0:08:41] Andrew Huberman: And everything in between. So, along those lines, could you give us a little bit of your background? You know, where'd you start out? Are you from originally?[0:08:49] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. I'm from the northeast of England. So I'm from a town called Harrogate, which is in in Yorkshire, which is a northern kind of Area of the[0:08:56] Andrew Huberman: Nice sunny weather all year long.[0:08:58] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. If you can imagine, yeah, with the the 2 weeks of summer that we get. You know? But yeah. I mean, I did my, my undergraduate studies there in sports science.[0:09:07] Dr. Duncan French: I, you know, I did teacher training to be a physical education teacher after that. Like most people, I then, you know, worked as a high school physical education teacher. You know, great experience working with kids, you know, developing, you know, Athletic qualities, but something in the back of my mind always, you know, I wanted more. I wanted to be, you know, to be at the higher end of elite Or, you know, I was a failed athlete like my many people. I I'm representing my country in in different sports and things, but I never made it professionally.[0:09:36] Dr. Duncan French: So, you know, that that little seed was sown in as much as I then start to reach out to, you know, to different areas to do a PhD, whether it was in the UK or also, you know, chance my arm, took a punt, see if we could get over to the States. All my buddies were going on, you know, gap years after the Finnish university or whatever and and going to Bali and hanging out or whatever, traveling through Thailand. And I figured, well, know, I I've always loved the states, and can I go and kill 2 birds with 1 stone and do something academic, continue my studies, but also do in a different environment and get some life Life experience and many, many rejections as as I'm sure you're kind of aware from different professors, whether it's Roger and Renuka or, you know, William Kramer[0:10:17] Andrew Huberman: or not? Wrote to these folks.[0:10:18] Dr. Duncan French: I just called, called, called and and and sent out information and saying, So have you got any opportunities? Push back from more, but, you know, dogged and kept kept asking. And, Yeah. Doctor William Kramer, who was at Ball State University in Indiana at the time, you know, a a muscle neuroendocrinologist and and Searching muscle physiology using resistance training. You know, he basically said, listen, I can guarantee your funding for the 1st year of your studies, but not the next 3.[0:10:45] Andrew Huberman: Sounds like a Typical academic response. I can take care of you, but not that well necessarily. Right?[0:10:50] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. So spoke to my parents and said, hey. Can we can we Take a punt. And they, you know, they were great in supporting me. And, yeah, long story short, came out to, to begin my PhD at Ball State.[0:11:00] Dr. Duncan French: After a year, doctor Kramer transferred to Yukon, you know, Connecticut in Storrs in the northeast there, and, I transferred to him and with him. And, Yeah. 4 great years with my with my PhD and and getting my PhD with a with a really prolific, research group that looked at, you know, neuroendocrinology, g, hormone will work, but using a resistance training primarily as an exercise stressor, as a major mechanism, and then looking at all the different Physiology is off the back of resistance training.[0:11:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You guys were enormously productive. I found dozens of papers on how weight training impacts hormones. And your name's on all of them, and it's remarkable. I I have a question about this.[0:11:43] Andrew Huberman: I'll just inject a question about weight training and hormones. You hear this all the time that doing these big heavy compound movements or resistance training increases Androgens, things like testosterone, DHT, DHEA, and so forth. Does anyone know how that actually happens? Like, what about move what about in What is it about engaging motor neurons under heavy loads sends a signal to the endocrine system, hey. Release Neustostone.[0:12:09] Andrew Huberman: I've never actually been able to find that in a textbook.[0:12:12] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Well, I mean And how can I do more of that? Yeah. As much as I know, you know, and again, I'm digging out into the annals of Duncan French's kind of brain now. But, yeah.[0:12:22] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, I think it's a stress response. Right? It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic dress. And these, you know, downstream regulation of of testosterone release at the gonads, comes from many different areas. You know, the there My work primarily looked at, you know, catecholamines and and and sympathetic arousal.[0:12:41] Andrew Huberman: So things like epinephrine, adrenaline.[0:12:42] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Epinephrine, adrenaline, When, you know, and noradrenaline, how how they were signaling that signaling cascade using, you know, the HPA axis releasing, Cortisol and then, you know, looking at how that also influenced the adrenal medulla to release, you know, androgens and then Signaling that at the gonads.[0:13:02] Andrew Huberman: That raises an interesting question. So in, presumably, weight training in women, people Who don't have testes, well, also it increases testosterone. Yeah. And is that purely through the adrenals when women lift weights, their adrenal glands release Test Absolutely.[0:13:17] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, that is the only area of of testosterone release for females. And, yes, it's the same downstream cascade. Obviously, the extent to which it happens is is significantly less in females, but that's how you there's good good data out there that shows, you know, females can increase their anabolic environment, their internal anabolic milieu, using resistance training as a stressor. And then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth, you know, whether it's tendon, ligament adaptations, you know, the the beneficial consequences of resistance training, which is driven by anabolic stimuli.[0:13:48] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I have 2 questions about that. The first one is something that you mentioned, which is That the, the androgens, the testosterone comes from the adrenals under resistance loads in women. Is the same true in men? I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone when we weight train that for for men that have testes, but, the Do we know whether or not it's the adrenals or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone Yeah.[0:14:13] Andrew Huberman: Or both? A little bit from each?[0:14:15] Dr. Duncan French: The there's a there's a the the field is divided presently. And as much as understanding the acute adren the the acute, adrenergic response in terms of, you know, anabolic response to exercise in an acute phase and the exposure to, you know, a stimulus that is stress driven, which might be partly from the adrenal glands, partly from the gonads, versus a longitudinal exposure, to anabolic environments, which is primarily driven by, obviously, The gonads in the release, the endocrine environment from from testosterone release at the gonads. So this the the field is split in terms of how exercise Size is promoting hypertrophy, you know, muscle tissue growth, and whether that is very much, an adrenals, stimuli Or if that's significant enough in these acute responses versus the longitudinal exposure, just elevated basal levels of of anabolic test testosterone to a level. So it[0:15:10] Andrew Huberman: sounds like in most kit like with most things, it's probably both. It's probably the adrenals and the gonads. Yeah. And then you mentioned that, testosterone can have, enhancing effects growth effects on tendon and ligament also that you don't often hear about that. People always think, you know, testosterone muscle.[0:15:26] Andrew Huberman: But testosterone has a lot of effects on other Tissues that are important for performance, it sounds like. Can you Yeah. Yeah. What's[0:15:33] Dr. Duncan French: the story there? Absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, the the the testosterone hormone is I mean, listen. There's androgen receptors on, neural tissue, on neural axons.[0:15:42] Andrew Huberman: Pretty much everywhere.[0:15:43] Dr. Duncan French: Exactly. So, you know, it the the binding capacity of testosterone and influence in different tissues within the body. I had touched on, you know, muscle tissue, but, you know, the the the ligaments, the tendons, even bone to to some extent. You know, testosterone is is potential To influence that, in in terms of removing osteopenic kind of characteristics, etcetera. So, yeah, it's a it's a it's a magic A magic hormone, let's say, with many, many end end impacts in terms of adaptation.[0:16:12] Andrew Huberman: I definitely wanna get to your trajectory. But as long as we're on, the interactions between androgens, testosterone, and its derivatives, and different tissues, You know, from the work that you did as a PhD student and, and throughout your career, could you say that there's a there are some General principles of training that favor testosterone production in terms of that the that somebody who's not an elite athlete could use. Barbell, and they know how they know the various movements. They're not gonna damage themselves. But Once they're doing that I mean, I've heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions, but in rep loads with now there's a lot of parameter space.[0:16:53] Andrew Huberman: But if you were gonna throw out some of the, the parameters that you think are most important to pay attention to for the typical person who's trying to use weight training to Build or maintain muscle Yeah. Lose body fat, so body recomposition, and or stay strong and healthy for sport of a different kind.[0:17:12] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. So the work that we obviously you know, I was exposed to back in my PhD. It it was a double edged sword. And as much as testosterone is really stimulated by an intensity factor, and also a volume factor. Now growth hormone is a little bit different.[0:17:26] Dr. Duncan French: That's largely driven by an intensity factor alone.[0:17:28] Andrew Huberman: Oh, really? Always thought the growth hormone was driven by volume, which just goes to show you Maybe[0:17:32] Dr. Duncan French: I've got No. No. No. No.[0:17:33] Andrew Huberman: I think you're probably right. It just goes to show you that most of what's out there on the Internet[0:17:37] Dr. Duncan French: Right.[0:17:37] Andrew Huberman: It's completely right. Not only not only is it wrong, it's usually backwards. So no. Trust I I I no. Trust your instinct because Because I think people just make this stuff up.[0:17:47] Dr. Duncan French: Right.[0:17:47] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because it's very hard to measure growth hormone and testosterone, and, and I can't imagine most of the The stuff that I see out there, they're taking drips and and, you know, measuring free versus bound and all this kind of stuff. But that's what you do in in laboratories. Right.[0:18:01] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. You you look at total composition, then you look How much of that is free circulating in the system? How much is bound? And therefore, biologically active bound to receptor creating adaptation. But, yeah, coming back to testosterone in terms of the training strategies, it's largely driven by both an intensity and a volume factor.[0:18:19] Dr. Duncan French: So if you look at many of the exercise interventions that we use to try and investigate and interrogate testosterone, it was It was usually, you know, a a a 6 by 10 protocol. So you're touching a[0:18:31] Andrew Huberman: a 6 by 10 meaning?[0:18:33] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. 6 sets of 10 repetitions, which is, you know, it's quite a large, you know, 60 repetitions is quite a large volume for a single exercise, And that was usually pitched at about 80% intense over 1 repetition max intensity.[0:18:45] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So 80% of the 1 rep max, six Six sets of 10 reps separated by rest of, like 2 minutes. 2 minutes, which is actually pretty fast Yeah. Least to me. It is Anytime you see these 2 to 3 minutes, when you're actually watching the clock, Those 2 minute rest periods go by pretty fast.[0:19:00] Dr. Duncan French: By the 3rd, 4th set, you're you're dying for more.[0:19:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah.[0:19:03] Dr. Duncan French: And I think, you know, we, you know, we we formulated that kind of exercise protocol to really Target, you know, the the release of testosterone and try and drive up these anabolic environments to study the, you know, the endocrine, you know, consequences. But I think that's that's that's the type of protocol that is most advantageous for driving Anabolic environment.[0:19:24] Andrew Huberman: And that was it for the workout?[0:19:26] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. We we would do that in a back spot. So, you know, multi joint, you know, Challenging exercise, multi muscle, multi joint, 80% loads of of your 1 repetition max and then 6 by 10. We did play around with, you know, your classic German volume type 10 by 10, kind of protocols, but they were just unsustainable at that 80%. The The key to what we also did was we always adjusted, the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions that were sustained.[0:19:55] Dr. Duncan French: So if the load was too too high and an athlete or or or participant had to drop the weights on on the 6th repetition. We would unload the bar and make sure they completed the 10 repetitions. Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity and a volume Derivative that that is gonna be most advantageous for testosterone relief.[0:20:13] Andrew Huberman: That's really interesting. And one thing that you mentioned there is especially interesting to me, which is you said, when you go from 6 Sets of 10 repetitions to 10 sets of 10 repetitions. You it's not as beneficial and might even be counterproductive. But to me, The difference between 6 10 sets is only 4 sets. It doesn't even sound that much.[0:20:32] Andrew Huberman: So that sort of hints at the possibility that the thresholds for going from A workout that increases testosterone to a workout that diminishes testosterone is actually a pretty narrow margin.[0:20:43] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. And I think it comes back to that intensity factor then. You know? What what we saw with the that 10 by 10 protocol really sees pretty significant drop offs in the load. And again, we're trying to stimulate with intensity, with mechanical strain through intensity, as well as metabolic strain through volume.[0:21:00] Dr. Duncan French: I think that's that's the paradigm that you've got to look at is that the mechanical load has to come from, you know, the the vol the actual weight on the bar And the volume, is is the metabolic stimulus. How much are we driving lactate? How much are we driving, you know, glycogenolysis in in in terms of that type of energy system for, you know, executing a a 10 by 10 protocol. And what we often saw was just a significant reduction in the intensity capabilities of a of an athlete sustain that. So we shortened the volume, to try and maintain the intensity.[0:21:32] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. And you could imagine just taking very long rest, Keeping the session being a big lazy bear in Right. In training. I sometimes do this. I tell myself I'm gonna work out for 45 minutes, and then 2 hours later, I'm done.[0:21:43] Andrew Huberman: But not because I was Huffing and puffing the whole time, but because I was training really slowly. Right. Is there any evidence that training slowly can offset some of the negative effects of doing a lot of volume?[0:21:54] Dr. Duncan French: Well, it's an old adage of, you know, 2 responses to your question. I mean, the first one I would say, you know, there's a difference between 10 sets of 6 6 sets of 10. And I think that comes back to the volume conversation. You know, 6 sets of 10 is driving up metabolic stimulus. If if you're doing 10 sets of 6, you can probably take it to a higher intensity, but you're not gonna get the same metabolic load.[0:22:16] Dr. Duncan French: You're not gonna get the same Internal metabolic environment that drives the lactate release that they will then signal, you know, further anabolic testosterone release because of the lactate in your body. That that that's a key consideration. The rest is often the consideration that's overlooked, Out there in general population and in many sporting environments. You know, the the rest is is as important a programming variable as the load and the intense the intensity, the load, the the volume, etcetera. And yes, if you remove if if you extend the volume, if you extend the the duration of your rest periods, What you're ultimately doing is influencing that metabolic stimulus again.[0:22:56] Dr. Duncan French: You're allowing the flushing of the body, the removal of waste products, you know, lactate to be, You know, removed via from from the body, and then the the metabolic environment is reduced.[0:23:06] Andrew Huberman: So you want so if I if I understand correctly, You want to create a metabolic stress. Absolutely. So so the way that I've been training, slow and lazy, is not necessarily the best way to go. I could I could in theory do a 45 or 60 minute session where I pack in more more work per unit time. I'm not gonna be able to Quote, unquote perform as well, I won't be able to lift as much.[0:23:29] Andrew Huberman: I have to, you know, unweight the bar between sets or maybe even during sets if I have someone who could do that. But it sounds like that's the way to go. So it's gotta be so this the old adage of high intensity short duration is probably the way to go.[0:23:42] Dr. Duncan French: Correct. And and and, You know, in in in layman's terms, if the same objective, the same training goal is just muscle tissue growth, and we're not talking about maximal strength or any of those type of parameters, we're talking about growing muscle. If there's an athlete a and they do 6 6 sets of 10 with 2 minutes rest and there's athlete b that does 6 sets of 10 with 3 minutes let rest, Athlete a will likely see the highest muscle gain, muscle hypertrophy gains because of the metabolic stimulus that they're driving with the Interesting.[0:24:11] Andrew Huberman: And for all the years that I've spent exploring exercise science and trying to get This information from the Internet in various places that this is the first time it's ever been, told to me clearly. So, basically, I need to put my ego aside, And I need to not focus so much on getting as many reps with a given weight and keep the rest restricted 2 minute about 2 minutes.[0:24:34] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah.[0:24:34] Andrew Huberman: Get the work in, and then I'll derive the benefits.[0:24:37] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, you've absolutely nailed it, to be honest. And, again, if you think about human nature and how we approached, we're inherently lazy. Right? As as as as humans, we want to, you know, we want to take that rest. We want to take the the time out to recover and feel refreshed, but We're trying to create a training stimulus.[0:24:53] Dr. Duncan French: We're trying to create a very specific stimulus internal to the body, and that is often driven by the metabolic environment at that Moment in time. Now if we allow the metabolic environment to change by extending the rest periods, we're not going to see as as beneficial gains at the end of it.[0:25:08] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting.[0:25:09] Dr. Duncan French: It it is, it is very much a motivational and ego thing rather than saying, okay. I'm gonna Push my loads as high as I can and really challenge maximal strength, do fewer repetitions, take longer periods of time. It's a completely Different approach to training. It's a different end goal.[0:25:25] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. And you mentioned lactate. So it seems still a bit controversial as to what actually triggers hypertrophy. You hear about Lactate buildup or people the the common language is the muscle gets torn and then repairs, but I don't know. Does the muscle actually tear?[0:25:40] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, micro trauma.[0:25:41] Andrew Huberman: Again, micro trauma.[0:25:42] Dr. Duncan French: Disruption of, you know, the mic within the[0:25:45] Andrew Huberman: muscle tissue for sure. Interesting. And and we're talking now about nondrug assisted, people whose whose, Let's just say, let's define our terms here that whose testosterone levels are within the the the range of somewhere between 301,500 or whatever, 1200. Because it does seem that athletes who take high levels of exogenous androgens can do more work and just get protein synthesis from just doing work.[0:26:10] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah.[0:26:10] Andrew Huberman: You know? I've seen these guys in the gym. Right? That's that the whole tale signs are not that hard to spot where they're just doing a A ton of volume, not necessarily moving that much weight. They're just bringing blood into the into the tissue, and then they're loading up on they're eating a ton of protein, presumably, because they're basically in puberty part 15.[0:26:28] Dr. Duncan French: Right.[0:26:28] Andrew Huberman: Right? They got on their 15th round of puberty where during puberty, You are approaching synthesis machine. I mean, that's to me, that that's, you know, pretty clear about puberty. Interesting. So and then, you'd In terms of, because I know the audience likes to try protocol.[0:26:45] Andrew Huberman: So that that you described a protocol very nicely. What about day to day recovery? I mean, can the workout that you described is intense but short. How many days a week can the typical person do that and sustain progress.[0:26:59] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. I mean, I think that comes back to your training age and your training history. Obviously, there's a resilience and a robustness with with an incremental training age. So, you know, that's not a protocol that I would advise anyone to go out and start, you know, tomorrow.[0:27:12] Andrew Huberman: They'll be mopping them off the gym floor.[0:27:14] Dr. Duncan French: But at the same time, it's also relative. Right? So 80%, you know, via via maximum at at a young training age is still 80% versus, you know, been training 10 years, it's still 80 Send. But, yes, the mechanical load is gonna be significant. It's just more tonnage.[0:27:28] Dr. Duncan French: Right? But, yeah, I think a a protocol like that, we would look 22 times, you know, a week, something that's that's pretty intensive like that. Because, again, it comes back to the point you make is that you really need to be, For one of better terms, suffering a little bit through that type of protocol both in terms of of the challenge of the load, but also being able to tolerate the the metabolic Stress that you're exposed to. It's it's a it's a, you know, a bit of a sicko feeling, right, because of the lactate that you're driving up. So, you know, I wouldn't promote as An athlete doing that type of modality, you know, multiple multiple times unless you're up from the realms of bodybuilding, and then you really that that's the sole purpose of of you're trying to achieve.[0:28:08] Dr. Duncan French: Most athletes, in most sports have, diverse requirements in terms of outcomes that they're trying to achieve. They're not just targeting muscle growth. Muscle growth is a, a conduit to increase strength, increase power, increase speed, obviously. So, yes, trying to get bigger cross Sectional area of a muscle means that we can produce more force into the ground or or wherever it may be if we're a locomotive athlete. But usually, sports men and women are not just Surely seeking muscle growth.[0:28:38] Dr. Duncan French: They they they look for different facets of muscle endurance or maximal muscle power, muscle strength. You know? So then you've gotta be very creative in how you build the workout. If it's a bodybuilder, absolutely. They're chasing muscle growth, and they're gonna do so with these types of protocols, which Sees high intensities and high volumes of workload, on a pretty regular basis.[0:28:59] Dr. Duncan French: If it's just somebody, you know, a weekend warrior that wants Keep in shape and look and look good, I would say, you know, 2 times a week for a really challenging workout like that, and then flex the other types of workouts within the week To have more of a a volume emphasis where you reduce the intensity and you might just look at, you know, larger rep ranges from 12 to 15 to 20. Another workout where you're looking at, you know, reducing the volume, but increasing the intensity and really trying to drive, you know, different stimulus to To give you more endpoints of of of success. Mhmm.[0:29:31] Andrew Huberman: Great. No. That's that's really informative. Along the lines of androgens and Intensity. When I think intensity, I think epinephrine, adrenaline.[0:29:41] Andrew Huberman: And, since you have a background in Right. Catecholamines and testosterone, Last time I was, here at the UFC Performance Institute, we had a brief conversation, and I I wanna make sure I got the details right. That in the short term, And a big increase in stress hormone can lead to an increase in testosterone, like a like a parachute jump. Correct. But, So stress can promote the release of testosterone.[0:30:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That was news to me. Right. We always hear about Stress suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing the immune system, all these terrible things. But in the short term, you're saying it can actually increase the release of testosterone.[0:30:19] Andrew Huberman: So I have that right?[0:30:21] Dr. Duncan French: Correct. Okay.[0:30:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And so then the second question is, does my cognitive Interpretation of the stressor make a difference. In other words, if I voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute, Does it have a different effect on my testosterone than if you shove me out of the plane against my will? Well, presumably with a parachute Right.[0:30:42] Dr. Duncan French: Too. I mean, so so this was what all my PhD work was was looking at was the, you know, the the, pre, the the exposure to a stressor and the pre arousal of how your body essentially prepares for that stressor and then how it manages it Throughout the exposure to the stress, and it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers. There there was an older study, looking at parachute jumpers into into into combat. Then, you know, they they were studying, you know, the cortisol, the stress response, and the epinephrine response of these parachute jumpers. So we we got us thinking about hold on.[0:31:17] Dr. Duncan French: You know, there's certain workouts You do that are just the daunting. You know? It's like, okay. It's squat squat Saturday or whatever it may be. Oh my gosh.[0:31:24] Dr. Duncan French: This is gonna be is gonna destroy me.[0:31:27] Andrew Huberman: Right. Or I have to talk to this person I don't wanna talk to or, you know, or what right? I mean, something or PhD dissertation exam or something. Yeah.[0:31:35] Dr. Duncan French: Even public Speaking of whatever it may be. Now, you know, we we we used an exercise. We used a resistance training protocol that would that these athletes knew would was going to be very, very Challenging. It's gonna be there's gonna have some anxiety to doing it. They knew there were gonna be some physical distress from doing it.[0:31:52] Dr. Duncan French: For, you know, their their mindset of how they were gonna approach that was already set. So what we saw prior 15 minutes prior to the the start of an ex Exposure to to the workout. The the epinephrine, the neuro adrenaline, the adrenaline was already starting to prepare the body sympathetically, to go into what it knew was going to be a very, very challenging workout. So that brings you back to, you know, exercise preparation, competition for certain Preparation preparation for certain competition. Excuse me.[0:32:21] Dr. Duncan French: You know, pre workout routines, the use of music, you know, all these different Things that we know can now, you know, anecdotally in the gym, we put into place, but, you know, the data that I presented to Showed that it was a first of its kind to show that this link between, you know, epinephrine and and norepinephrine release, an arousal and then consequent performance. So force output throughout the, throughout the workout was intimately linked.[0:32:47] Andrew Huberman: So what's the what was the takeaway there? Should is it, beneficial for people to get a little stressed about the upcoming impending event, whether or not it's a lift in the gym or whether or not it's Talking to somebody that you might be intimidated to talk to or a a an exam, is is the stress good For performance or is it harmful?[0:33:07] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. And I think that's a great question. And I think I can only talk to, you know, physical exertion, which is what we were We were we're exploring, and and I don't want to tread on the toes of the psychologists with flow state and these types of things because clearly[0:33:21] Andrew Huberman: I think you're in the position of scientific strength on this one, I think you have the leverage. I mean Alright. I mean, most you know, I have a lot of friends in that community as I'll just say as a as a buffer to to your the answer you're about to give That there's there's very little science around, flow, and there's very little neuroscience related to most psychological states anyway. So I think we've a lot of degrees of freedom here.[0:33:42] Dr. Duncan French: Alright. I can breathe easy, and thank you for that.[0:33:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'll take it. I'll I'll be anything you like, credit Duncan. Anything you dislike, Send the send the mean comments to me. I[0:33:52] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. I think for from from my data, certainly, the the greater the arousal, the higher the performance was from a from a physical exertion perspective. And I think that was the intriguing part of some of my findings where there's definitely a bio an individual biokinetics to some of these, hormonal kind of releases. And as much as those guys that had the highest, you know, adrenergic response in terms of epinephrine release, norepinephrine release, Also, sustained force output, through for a longer period of the workout than those that didn't. So the the the the individuals adds a A lower, stimulus of of the sympathetic arousal, let's say, certainly didn't perform as well throughout the workout.[0:34:32] Dr. Duncan French: Now the intriguing thing then becomes is okay. And I think this this, you know, really segues into what what we're doing here with with combat athletes, with mixed martial artists. You know, there there's a philosophy. There's a paradigm now from myself in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure. You know, the the more you do that challenging workout, do you get the same Psychological stimulus.[0:34:53] Dr. Duncan French: Do you still get the same stress response? And and the assumption is unlikely. You know, you Accommodate, you become accustomed to the stressor. Your body will therefore adapt, and that's the classic overload principle. Right?[0:35:05] Dr. Duncan French: You then need to take the stress down a different route. But, I think when you look at, you know, the the the athletes that we work with here, It's it's a fist fight at the end of the day. That's there's nothing more stressful than that. But I think just the exposure to the rigors of training, to understand The bad positions, the bad situations to know that they can get out of certain situations, out of certain, you know, submission holds or whatever it may be. I think that really ties in with some of my PhD work in terms of what these guys do to approach what is, you know, a really challenging sport and arena in mixed martial arts.[0:35:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's definitely the extreme of what's possible in terms of asking, does stress favor or hinder performance? Because, yeah, like you said, at the end of the day, it's someone trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can within the bounds of the rules, and you're trying to do the same. So That's you know, I find that your thesis work fascinating. Were were you never to be at the, UFC Performance Institute?[0:36:04] Andrew Huberman: Luckily, they made the right choice and brought you here. But were you have never to come here, I I was still fascinated by this because over and over, we hear that stress is bad. Stress is bad. Stress is bad. But everything I read from the scientific literature is that stress and epinephrine in particular It's coupled to the testosterone response to performance and to adaptation provided it doesn't go on too long.[0:36:30] Andrew Huberman: So, unless I'm saying something that violates that, I mean, that and that's your work. So it's a really, important and beautiful work, and I I refer to it often, so I'm just glad that I've,[0:36:40] Dr. Duncan French: Thank you.[0:36:41] Andrew Huberman: We could, you know, bolt that down because I think the people need to know this, that That discomfort is beneficial. Now there's a there's another side to this, that I want to ask about, which is, the use of cold, in particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, or, any other type of cold temperature exposure. You know, In theory, that's stress also. It's epinephrine. And so, how should one think about the use of cold for recovery?[0:37:14] Andrew Huberman: So if it's stress, how is if stress if colds causes stress, then how is cold used for recovery? That's what I don't understand. And maybe you just Wanna share your thoughts on that.[0:37:25] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. No. And I think, you know, it's it's a great question. And I think the the jury is still out there, certainly, knowing some of the conversations that we we've been having. But I think, you know, when we talk about stress, it's your classic fight, flight, or freeze approach.[0:37:40] Dr. Duncan French: And, you know, throwing your body into, you know, a a cold tub, an ice bath, or whatever it may be, Certainly is gonna have a physiological stress response. Now people are using that for different end end goals. And again, I think that's where the narrative has to be explained. If you are using the stress specifically to manage the mindset, to use it as a specific Stress stimulus. That's the same as me doing 6 by 10 80%.[0:38:07] Dr. Duncan French: You know? You you're just trying to find something to disrupt the system to do something that's very, if want a better term, painful, discomfort, whatever. You're just finding a stressor and then being able to manage the mindset. But if you're using Hold, specifically from a physiological perspective to promote, you know, redistribution of vascular you know, of blood flow, you know, to to different vascular areas of of muscle that that you feel have gone through a workout, that are damaged, or whatever it may be. I think there's we we've got to understand what that stress mechanism is.[0:38:43] Dr. Duncan French: And, you know, the the data, the literature is certainly still out there with respect to cryotherapy and cold baths And some of these, you know, high these these cold exposures in terms of what they do at the at the level of the muscle tissue. If that's if that's the target, if you're trying to promote a flushing mechanism or you're trying to promote redistribution of of the blood flow, What you've got to understand is that cold is gonna clamp down every part of the vascular system, and we've really got to understand how the muscle would be redistributed, 2 areas of interest. So, you know, I think the stress response is is is is a real thing with respect to, you know, cold exposure. But I think the narrative around what are you using the cold for has to precede the conversation because, yes, it's, you know, it it's like Putting your hand over a a hot cold. You know, that that's a stress the same way as jumping in a cold bath is.[0:39:41] Andrew Huberman: That. You're gonna get the epinephrine release from holding your hand up too close to flame, and you're gonna get it from getting in the ice bath.[0:39:46] Dr. Duncan French: And your body doesn't know the difference. Right? Your body does not know the difference. It is A, you know, a a a a primordial kind of physiological response that it's created over 1,000,000 and 1,000,000 of years. And I think that that's, That physiology is is not changing, and it's it's fixed in a particular way right now, that that it doesn't understand the difference between whether 6 by 10 doing a challenging workout over here, whether it's putting my hands on the hot coal, whether there's a lion stood in front of me or whatever, that epinephrine response from the the level of the brain down So the the whole signaling cascade is is the same.[0:40:21] Dr. Duncan French: Mhmm.[0:40:21] Andrew Huberman: And cold, I've heard, can actually prevent some of the beneficial effects of training That it can actually get in get in the way of muscle growth, etcetera.[0:40:33] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. There's there's there's some pretty robust data out there now showing that it It definitely has an influence on performance variables like strength and power in particular, but absolutely in terms of muscle hypertrophy. And there's a big kind of theme in in the world of athletic performance right now in terms of periodization of cold Exposure as as a recovery modality.[0:40:54] Andrew Huberman: So what[0:40:54] Dr. Duncan French: when do you use cold? You know? Should you be using cold for recovery in periods of high training load when you're actually pursuing, you know, maybe general proprietary work. We're actually trying to pursue muscle growth. Well, that's usually where you get the most So it's usually where, you know, you you feel the most fatigued, but it's probably not the most beneficial approach to use an ice bath think that in that scenario because you're dampening, you're dulling the, you know, the mTOR pathway and and the hyper hypertrophic, signaling pathway.[0:41:25] Dr. Duncan French: Whereas in a competition phase, where actually quality of exercise and quality of execution of skill and technical work has to be maintained. You want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery, capabilities and recovery interventions in that scenario because You now you know, the the muscle building activity should be in the bank. That should have been done in the in the general prepare preparatory work, and, now you're focusing on technical execution. So you're absolutely right.[0:41:52] Andrew Huberman: No. It's interesting. So if I if I understand correctly, if if I want to maximize muscle growth or power It or, you know, improvements and adaptations than the inflammation response, the delayed onset muscle soreness, all this stuff That's uncomfortable and that we hear is so terrible is actually the stimulus for adaptation. And so using cold in that situation might Short circuit my progress. But if I'm, you know, I don't know that I'll ever do this, but if I were to do an Ironman or something or run a marathon, under those conditions, I'm basically coming to the to the race, so to speak, with all the power and strength I'm going to have.[0:42:30] Andrew Huberman: And so they are reducing inflammation as good because it's gonna allow me to For more work, essentially.[0:42:35] Dr. Duncan French: Absolutely. Yeah. You have to be strategic about when you use some of these interventions. And, you know, the The time when you're preparing for a competition is not the appropriate time excuse me, is the appropriate time when you want to drive recovery and make sure that your body is optimized. You know, when you're far away from a a a competition, you know, date or, you know, out of season or whatever it may be, and you're really trying to just Tear up the body a little bit to allow it to to its natural, you know, healing and adaptation processes to take place.[0:43:07] Dr. Duncan French: Well, you don't want to negate that. You you know, you want the body to optimize its internal recovery, and that's how muscle growth is gonna happen. So So interesting. There there's a time kind of Consideration that you need to make with these interventions for sure.[0:43:19] Andrew Huberman: At the UFC Performance Center, are the are the fighters periodizing their cold exposure, or are they just[0:43:24] Dr. Duncan French: you doing cold at At at will. Well, it's not just the UFC. And again, I I I talk about my personal experiences with different sports. I think Just education around where science is at and our understanding of of concepts like the use of cold Exposure for recovery, ice bath. You know?[0:43:43] Dr. Duncan French: Everyone wants to jump in an ice bath. But I think as we've as we've stepped back and scientists have start to say I've I've started to figure out and look at some of the data. You know, we're we're now more intuitive about well, actually, that might not be the best or the most optimal approach, and I think that's That's any given sport. So, yes, certainly here at the at the UFC, we're trying to educate our athletes around, you know, appropriate timing. And it's same with nutrition.[0:44:07] Dr. Duncan French: It's the same with an ice bath intervention. It's the same with lifting weights. It's the same with going for a run or working out on the bike. You know, the the the there's there's tactics To when when you do things and when you don't do things. And I think, you know, stress and and cold exposure, we have to have a consideration around that well.[0:44:24] Dr. Duncan French: But it's not just, you know, MMA fighters. That's any any athlete. And I think it's the the best the best professionals, the most successful professionals Do that really well. They under they listen, number 1. They they educate themselves, and then they build structure.[0:44:40] Dr. Duncan French: And I think, You know, at the most elite level, we we always talk about it here at the UFC, but the most elite level, you're not necessarily training harder than anybody else. Everybody in the UFC trains hard. Like, everyone is training super hard. But the best athletes, the the true elite their skills can improve or physical development, their physical attributes can improve. So that ability to reproduce on a day to day basis Falls into a recovery conversation.[0:45:14] Dr. Duncan French: Now when is the right time to use something like an ice bath and when isn't, it's part of the The high performance come conversation for sure.[0:45:21] Andrew Huberman: So, really, they're scientists. They're building structure. They're figuring out variables. Yeah. But it sounds like the ability to do More quality work over time is is one of the key variables.[0:45:31] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, it's fundamental. I mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out. But in our sport, you know, I talk about, you know, mixed martial arts. It's truly a decathlon of So there's so many different attributes, whether it's a grappling, whether it's a wrestling, whether it's a transition work, whether it's a stand up striking.[0:45:49] Dr. Duncan French: So the the different facets the training program in this sport are significantly large compared to something like, you know, A wide receiver in football. And that's no disrespect for wide receivers, but they run routes. They'd they they're gonna run a route of of of passing tree, And that's all they need to do. These guys have to be on the ground. They gotta be great on the ground.[0:46:09] Dr. Duncan French: They gotta be great standing up. They gotta be great with the feet, you know, the back against the fence. So There's so many different kind of facets to our sport. So managing the distribution of all the training components is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts, and and the best Guys get that right. They they allow their body to to optimize the training.[0:46:28] Dr. Duncan French: And remember, why why are we doing training? We're doing training for Technical and tactical improvement. Now if you if your body is fatigued or you just can't expose yourself to more tactical to call development or technical development, then you you you essentially doing yourself a disservice. You you're gonna be behind the curve with with respect to those guys that can reproduce Day in, day out.[0:46:50] Andrew Huberman: On the topic of skill development, regardless of sport, we hear all the time and it certainly is Intuitive to me that the person who can focus the best will progress the fastest. What's kind of interesting, sometimes I talk to athletes and, They seem, a little bit laid back about their training sometime Obviously, know how to flip the switch, and they can really, you know, dial in the intensity. Do you think that there are optimal protocols for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning? Like, could it ever be parameterized like the 6 sets of 10 reps? Which is still you know, it's not a black box, but it's kind of a a black box with, portions of it illuminated, I like to I like to say.[0:47:39] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, what are your thoughts on skill development? Is there for somebody that wants to get better at sport, do you recommend a particularly, long or short training session? It does intensity matter, or is it just reps?[0:47:53] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. I think, no. It's not a volume driven exercise. It's a quality driven exercise. And listen, my my expertise is not in motor learning and motor skill acquisition.[0:48:04] Dr. Duncan French: I I tend to default to Gab doctor Gabrielle Wolf here at UNLV for for, for that. She's one of the leading proponents in this area. But, You know, if if you look at, you know, true skill development, it is about rehearsal of accurate movement, Accurate movement mechanics. And the soon as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue or inaccurate movement, you're now losing the The the motor learning. You you're losing the accuracy of the skill that, you know, people can call it muscle memory or whatever they want.[0:48:36] Dr. Duncan French: Right? But essentially, you're grooving neural songs to to create movement patterns, and they're situational throughout sport. Right? You know, whether it's a cruyf turn in soccer or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line, You you can carve out that particular posture and position and skill, and you can isolate it, and you can drill it again and again and again. Now as soon as fatigue is is influencing that repetition.[0:49:02] Dr. Duncan French: It's time it's time to stop, and the best coaches understand that. They understand that it's Quality over quantity when it comes to skill acquisition. So to answer your question in a roundabout way, I would say, yes. It it's it's it's Shorter sessions that are very high quality, and I think the best athletes in my experience are the ones that consciously and cognitively are aware of it at every moment of the training session. They should they should leave the training session not necessarily just physically fatigue, but mentally fatigued because They're completely engaged in the learning process.[0:49:36] Dr. Duncan French: The the the problem then becomes, okay, if we just do lots of, You know, 30 minute sessions. We've gotta do a lot of 30 minute sessions to get the volume exposure of the repetition and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again. So it's a bit of a paradox. It's a bit of of a double edged sword. But, you know, a a 3 hour session versus a 90 minute session, you know, we'll we'll take the 90 minute Session any day when it comes to skill acquisition because that's gonna be driven by quality over quantity.[0:50:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Training and skill learning is Incredibly mentally fatiguing. I've often wondered why when one works out hard, whether or not it's with, you know, run or with the weights, why it's hard to think later in the day. Right. Yeah.[0:50:18] Andrew Huberman: It really there really does seem to be something to it. And I've wondered, is it depletion of Adrenaline, dopamine. I sometimes think it might be dopamine, and here I'm totally speculating. I don't have any data to support this. But if You hit a really hard workout or run early in the day.[0:50:35] Andrew Huberman: Oftentimes, the brain just doesn't want to do hard mental work, which gives me great admiration for these athletes that are drilling their mind and body all all day every day, with breaks. But So what are your thoughts? What what it what leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance?[0:50:53] Dr. Duncan French: Well, again, I don't wanna talk out, you know, I'm talking the to the here, you know, this this Well,[0:50:57] Andrew Huberman: we're we're just 2 scientists speculating on on this point. Up until now, we've been, you've been giving us concrete, peer reviewed study He based feedback on my questions, but but if we were to speculate I mean, I think this is a common occurrence. People think if I get that really good workout in in the morning, I feel better all day.[0:51:12] Dr. Duncan French: Right.[0:51:12] Andrew Huberman: That's true unless that work is is really intense or really long. Yeah. And then you just the mind just somehow won't Latch on to mental work quite quite as well.[0:51:25] Dr. Duncan French: I I mean, just philosophically, you know, I think there's that There's a there's a coming back to this kind of stress consideration, you know, like a a public speaking or taking an exam. I mean, if you're if If if you have an amazing coach who is setting up training in a particular way, it's challenging. There's a strain related to it. And I'm not talking physical strain. I'm talking Figuring things out, you know, figuring out the skill, and I think that can be stressful.[0:51:49] Dr. Duncan French: Like, the learning process can be stressful. So, you know, we've touched on stress. I also think if they if they, you know, if the if they hit the right technique, you know, that reward center in the brain, that dopamine shot is is is gonna fly up there, and there's only so many times that we can get that before that becomes dampened. And I think there's an energetic piece to it. You know?[0:52:09] Dr. Duncan French: There's the fueling of of the brain. There's the there's the the the carbohydrate fueling exercise that actually the strategy around how you fuel for learning and fuel For physical training is is actually pretty similar. Glucose. Yeah. It's it's glucose.[0:52:25] Dr. Duncan French: It's sugar at the end of the day. Right? So, you know, are you are you are you fueling accordingly around your training sessions, be that very physical because everyone thinks, okay. You know, I'm gonna jump on a treadmill and I'm gonna bang out, you know, 15 sprints at max effort, and I'm gonna, you know, be dropping off a line on the floor at the end of it. I need to refuel.[0:52:44] Dr. Duncan French: Well, what about the refueling of the brain in a very demanding, exercise or drilling session where you're looking at technique that you're trying to figure out this very challenging for your mind to figure out the complexity of it, but still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards. And I think that's obviously, Yeah. It might be an area where athletes do themselves a disservice by not appropriately fueling from what might be considered to be a lower intensity session, but the the the the cognitive challenge has been significantly high.[0:53:15] Andrew Huberman: So they're doing skill work or drill work, and It's taxing the brain. And they're thinking, oh, you know, I wasn't, you know, pushing hard lifts or or doing sprints, and so I can just go off the rest of my day, but then their their Their mind is drifting.[0:53:29] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I I speculate.[0:53:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. No. That that seems very reasonable. I mean, I know that I'm here and presumably with the other athletes You've worked with nutrition as a huge, aspect of that. And I think the general public can learn a lot from athletic nutrition because in at the end of the day, The general public is trying to attend to their kids, attend to their work, whether or not they're lawyers or whatever.[0:53:51] Andrew Huberman: They need to focus. Nutrition is a barbed wire topic.[0:53:55] Dr. Duncan French: Oh, yeah.[0:53:56] Andrew Huberman: But, if since we're free to, do what we would do if we were just sitting in each other's offices, which is to Just, speculate a bit. It for the typical person, right, do you think these, low carbohydrate diets, typical person who exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights, maybe not all those things, but some collection of those is pushes themselves to do those things and to do them well, isn't necessarily a highly competitive athlete. Do you think that, nutrition that doesn't include a lot of glucose, doesn't include a lot of carbohydrates, is a problem, or is it okay? What do you what do you recommend for athletes? What do you recommend for typical people?[0:54:37] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Again, disclaimer, I'm not A dietitian, but I[0:54:41] Andrew Huberman: That's okay. The dietitians don't know what to recommend to athletes either. And I say that from having to spend a lot of time with the literature now. It's a complete[0:54:49] Dr. Duncan French: Right.[0:54:49] Andrew Huberman: Mess. Yeah. It's like, I thought we didn't understand anything about the brain. The nutrition science stuff is all over the place. Right.[0:54:55] Andrew Huberman: So I think we have, again, I've got a few great reasons for freedom.[0:54:58] Dr. Duncan French: Right. Right. Right. I mean, I think, you know, I I I think for it's it comes down to metabolic efficiency. So we would never we would never advocate a high no.[0:55:07] Dr. Duncan French: I never say never. Okay? But, you know, we rarely advocate a high performance athlete in a in a High intensity intermittent sport like MMA, being totally ketogenic or or[0:55:20] Andrew Huberman: You do not recommend that?[0:55:21] Dr. Duncan French: No. Because at the end of Some of those high intensity efforts, usually require, you know, carbohydrate fueling, for for the high end and The energy, the energy is produced at those high intensities. So we try to navigate around that. Now they listen, there are fighters in the UFC and and elsewhere. Matt Brown is a great Example, who who, you know, promotes the ketogenic approach, and it works for him.[0:55:45] Dr. Duncan French: But we we we look at the science and the nature, the characteristics and we don't necessarily promote that.[0:55:51] Andrew Huberman: Can I interrupt you real quick? What about ketones for people that are ingesting carbohydrates? This is an interesting area because people always hear ketones, and they think, oh, I have to be ketogenic to benefit from taking ketones.[0:56:02] Dr. Duncan French: Right.[0:56:02] Andrew Huberman: But there are a number of athletes and, recreational athletes now as well taking liquid or powder based ketones on even though they do eat Rice and oatmeal and bread and other things as so are there any, known benefits of ketones even if one is not in a state of ketosis?[0:56:22] Dr. Duncan French: So the the the, the the only the the the use of ketones that I'm primarily aware of is is, in our sport is after the event, you know, in terms of the brain health with with athletes that take, you know, potentially taking trauma to the brain, etcetera, and looking to maintain the the the Fueling and the energy supply to the brain. But, yes, it's probably a little bit on my remit. So I I don't wanna talk on that because I'm not I'm not fully familiar with that.[0:56:46] Andrew Huberman: Well, I've heard that ketones, after head injury can provide a buffering component.[0:56:51] Dr. Duncan French: Correct.[0:56:51] Andrew Huberman: It's not gonna reverse brain damage, but it might be able to offset some of the micro damage. Right.[0:56:56] Dr. Duncan French: So that that's what that's how we use it just to sustain, you know, the energy supply to the brain that might be compromised through brain trauma. So that's why we use Ketones. To come back to your original question, if it's, you know, general population, then yes. I think there's there's a place to argue that Actually, being on a ketogenic diet at times and maybe that's it's a cycling exercise, maybe not you know, I don't mean cycling a bike. I mean, cycling, ketosis, is beneficial because I think it's gonna lead to better metabolic management and and and metabolic efficiency.[0:57:29] Dr. Duncan French: Those lower intensities where we should be fueling our Our metabolism with lipids and fats, clearly, the the Western diet and and, you know, the modern day diet is Heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates that, you know, people become predisposed to utilization of that fuel source, above Lipids use, fat use, intensities that are very low. So, you know, some of our data with the fighters shows that as well. But I think the challenge For us is that we're working with a clientele that require high intensity bouts of effort. So, you know, fueling appropriately, it is very important for that. Now we use we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes on what you would say kind of a is it A largely a ketogenic diet, but then we will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions.[0:58:20] Dr. Duncan French: So we'll do very timed Exposure to carbohydrates. So it's not Post training? Post training. Immediately pre, during, and then immediately post. And then the rest of their diets, you know, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, what would look like ketogenic type approaches.[0:58:35] Dr. Duncan French: So we're trying to be very tactical in the exposure to maximize the intensity for the training, and then return to a metabolically efficient diet, which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate because we've fueled the The the sessions that need it.[0:58:50] Andrew Huberman: I'm smiling because, once again, the this place, the UFC Performance Center, is doing things scientifically, which, you know, to me, The idea that and and I'm pleased to hear that because to me, that's idea that the ketogenic diet is the best and only diet or Carbohydrates and, low protein diets are the best diet. It's just it's ludicrous. Right. Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency. I think, some people might be familiar with that term, some perhaps, not.[0:59:18] Andrew Huberman: But the way I understand metabolic, efficiency is that you're you teach the body to use Fats by maybe doing long, long bouts of cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit. So teaching the body to tap into its fat stores for certain periods of training. And then you also teach the body to utilize carbohydrates by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training and before training. You Teach the body to use ketones, and then you use them at the appropriate time as opposed to just deciding that one of these fuel sources is good and all the others are bad or dispensable. Do I have that correct?[0:59:51] Dr. Duncan French: You nailed it. I mean, from, Bob Sebehar is formerly of USA Triathlon, is is the guy that kinda came up with the The the the concept of metabolic efficiency. But, yes, you're absolutely right. I mean, at low intensities of exercise or just Day to day living, we shouldn't be tapping into our, carbohydrate fuel sources extensively. That that's that's for higher intensity work or, know, the fight or flight needs of of stress.[1:00:19] Dr. Duncan French: You know? If, you know, athletes or any individual has a, you A high carbohydrate diet, they're gonna start to become predisposed to utilizing that fuel source preferentially. Now a low intensity, that can be problematic. Certainly for an athlete because if they preferentially use carbohydrate Right? At lower intensities, when the when the exercise demand goes to a higher intensity, they've already exhausted their fuel stores.[1:00:46] Dr. Duncan French: You know, they can't draw upon fat because the Oxidization of that that fat is just too slow. So they're essentially now become fatigued, because they've they've already utilized the carbohydrate stores. So what we try to do, yes, through diet manipulation and a little bit of exercise manipulation is, as you say, teach the body or train the body to preferentially use a specific fuel source. Fat, obviously, at lower intensities and carbohydrate at high intensities. And we would look at specifically the crossover point between the two tells a lot in terms of how an is is ultimately, you know, how their metabolism is working.[1:01:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, again, I I'm smiling because I love this because It's grounded in something real and scientific, which is that we have these different fuel sources. The body can adapt to use any number of them or one of them. I think most people are looking for that one pattern of eating, that one pattern of exercising that's gonna be best for them or sustain them, and they often Look back to the time when they felt so much better switching from one thing to the next, but the adaptation process itself is also key. Right? Teaching the body.[1:01:48] Andrew Huberman: And I, so if we were to, just riff on this just a little bit further, if if somebody, I'll use myself as an example since I I can only, speculate what other people's, current nutrition protocols are. But if somebody is eating In a particular way, and they wanna try this kind of periodization of nutrition. Could one say, okay. For a few weeks, I'm gonna do more high intensity interval training and weight training, and I'm gonna eat a little bit more carbohydrate because I'm depleting more glycogen. Then if I switch to a a phase of my training where I'm doing some longer runs, Maybe I'm not maybe I'm training less.[1:02:24] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I'm just working at my desk a little bit more. Then I might switch to a lower lower carbohydrate diet. Do I have that right? And then if I'm gonna enter a competition of some sort, certainly not UFC Right. Or MMA of any kind to be clear.[1:02:37] Andrew Huberman: Not because it isn't a wonderful sport, but because it's, that wouldn't be good for my Other profession. But, if I were gonna do that, then I would think about stacking carbohydrates, ketones, and and facts. Is that do I have that more[1:02:51] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, I think yeah. I think yeah. You just said it eloquently. At the end of the day, you're consciously understanding what the, Bose you to to physical exertion is, and you're flexing your diet accordingly. And I[1:03:03] Andrew Huberman: think that's need based eating.[1:03:05] Dr. Duncan French: Exactly. You know, for for a better terms, you know, you can call it whatever fancy The terminology there is out there, but, yes, it's it's needs based eating, but you're very conscious and cognizant of what is my current exercise status. You know, if I'm, You know, if I'm taking some time off, then, you know, don't gorge on the carbohydrates. We probably need to be cut. It's gonna be lower intensity work or even just habitual day to day Walking around, doing your groceries, you know, that that doesn't require massive amounts of glycogen storage and and and and carbohydrate refueling.[1:03:36] Dr. Duncan French: So you can potentially go more ketogenic in nature, you know, oxidizing lipids for that fuel. If you are in a high period of of high intensity training, then you have to consciously flex your diet to support that. That's not normal. You've you've made a A change of elevated the demand. So the fueling requirements for the regenerative not only fueling the exercise, but the regenerative requirements of your body after that type of work is gonna Really important as well.[1:04:03] Dr. Duncan French: So, yes, take on more carbohydrates. So I think it's consciously interpreting the nature of your diet against what where you are at any moment in time.[1:04:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Like that. You know, I think, the listeners of my podcast generally are experimenters, and they are scientists of themselves, which, which makes me happy, obviously. And and and I like to think that they're paying attention to the changes they're making and how they're affecting themselves, And they seem more open to, trying things, provide they can do it safely, you know, and, and and seeing what works for them. And I'm certainly gonna try some of the Change up.[1:04:38] Andrew Huberman: I also am really a creature of habit, and I think the, talking to you today, I realized I'm probably doing a number of things truly wrong in my training, But also that I don't tend to vary my nutrition with my training quite as much as I should. I'm just locked into a protocol. We, we We cover a number of things related to your PhD thesis work and then, but I cut you off early on related to your, trajectory. After you finish your thesis Yeah. You I know you were at Notre Dame for a while.[1:05:06] Andrew Huberman: Was that your first spot after after your PhD thesis?[1:05:10] Dr. Duncan French: No. No. I, I basically finished my PhD, and I dropped into the British Olympic system for about 14 years.[1:05:17] Andrew Huberman: Oh, my.[1:05:17] Dr. Duncan French: I was, you know, I was with, you know, I've done 3 full Olympic cycles, with different sports and largely a strength and conditioning coach, as a practitioner. I was always working in in universities and academia alongside, you know, in terms of Continuing to publish and write, and and do research and teach as well, because that explains[1:05:38] Andrew Huberman: the YouTube volume of publication. I don't think people realize all of the work That goes into getting a quality peer reviewed publication. It's not, what what do they call it now on Instagram? Anic data, where people would do something what you know? Right.[1:05:51] Andrew Huberman: And then they put in the world that Yeah. It's a the anecdata are I don't even know that we could should call it data. But, so 14 years in the Working with the British Olympic team?[1:06:01] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. So with, you know, whether it was GB boxing, primarily with the with the the Rios excuse me, the The Beijing cycle, but also lightweight rowers and gymnastics. For the London Olympic Games, that cycle, I was with I was, the lead strength and conditioning and physical performance coach British basketball, so GB basketball. I had about 3 years, in the English Premier League and with with Newcastle United and and and the soccer team. And then for the Rio Olympic Cycle, I was with Great Britain Taekwondo.[1:06:29] Dr. Duncan French: So again, another combat sport. After I'd finished there, I kind of moved to University of Notre Dame, where I went into more of a more of a managerial position working across all the different technical Services, medical, nutrition, strength and conditioning, you know, psychology, whatever, sport science, whatever it may be. As the, you know, The, director of performance sciences at for Notre Dame Athletics. And then after about 16 months there, the UFC came, Knock in and and they they recruited me out of Notre Dame. So, it's been, it's been a great ride and lots of you know, I've got you know, lots lots of athletes have taught me a lot Along the way, lots of coaches, you know, every day is a school day.[1:07:10] Dr. Duncan French: I I I still try and keep that that mentality. And, you know, in this world, we call it white bent white belt mentality. You know, it's, No. I'm a I'm a PhD. I've got 25 years of experience in in high performance sport, but, I still I still learn every single day from these people out on the mats in the ring, and it's it's impressive to see what they do.[1:07:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It certainly is. I I'd got introduced to MMA just a few years ago. I think the first time I came out here was One of the first times I'd heard of MMA because I was kind of in my laboratory, you know, nose down. And it's a really interesting sport because it incorporates so many different Types of movement, as you said, you know, it's not just stand up boxing.[1:07:46] Andrew Huberman: It's, just kicking. It's every you know, ground game, everything, and I'm still Learning about it. But as you mentioned, going in with that beginner's mind, the white bed white belt mentality, what what has been the most surprising thing for you in terms of being exposed to m MMA in particular as opposed to other It's like, what's what's unique about MMA fighters besides that they have this huge variety of of, tactical skills that they have to learn and perfect?[1:08:17] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. That's a great question. I would say 2 things. I'm gonna answer 2 questions. 1 actually reiterates what you've already said.[1:08:23] Dr. Duncan French: Like, the degrees of freedom in mixed martial arts exponential. Like, no other sport. You know? You we've got 11 different weight classes. We have men's classes.[1:08:33] Dr. Duncan French: We have women's classes. We have, you know, kickboxers, wrestlers, jujitsu fighters, judokas, you know, like karate fighters. You know, the stylistic backgrounds are infinite. We have we're a weight classification sport. There's a whole issue relating to making weight and then rebounding to To fight about 24 to 30 hours.[1:08:51] Dr. Duncan French: Like, just the variability in this sport, the the the considerations that you have to make are Unprecedented compared to any other sport that I've worked with. And a lot of them go against and they are the antithesis of What you would expect for a high performance, you know, in in terms of we we don't always have a very clearly defined competition schedule. You know, once these guys fight, they they don't necessarily know when their next fight's gonna be.[1:09:18] Andrew Huberman: What's the closest spacing of a of a fight?[1:09:20] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, listen. I think the the the record is around, It's it's just over a month, I believe. Goodness. So, you know, that that's a quick turnaround, but most of these guys are fighting, You know, 3 or 4 times a year, 3 times a year is is pretty normal. The the the bigger fights maybe 2 times a year.[1:09:39] Dr. Duncan French: But, invariably, the guys don't know when that next date is going to be. So we're in this gray area of, okay. What what what do we do? Like, are we are we taking some time off? Are we just gonna do some general prep work.[1:09:49] Dr. Duncan French: Are we gonna try and keep this the, you know, the knife sharpened in case I get[1:09:53] Andrew Huberman: I didn't realize this. In that way, it's a lot like special operations.[1:09:57] Dr. Duncan French: Absolutely. You don't know when the call is gonna happen.[1:09:59] Andrew Huberman: They have to be ready at all times. There isn't this, like, let's get ready for the season.[1:10:02] Dr. Duncan French: Right. Yeah. And, like, when when I was with the British Olympic Association, you know, I knew it was the the British Open, the Spanish Open, the French Open, the European championships, the Israeli Open, the American Open, the Canadian Open, the Olympic Games. You know, I could[1:10:15] Andrew Huberman: a circuit in your brain.[1:10:16] Dr. Duncan French: Right. Yeah. You just you just plan, like, you know, where all the targets are gonna be. Here, it's a moving target because you might be Just hanging out, doing some general prep work, and then you might get a short notice fight. They give you a quick call and it's in 6 weeks or 5 weeks and okay.[1:10:29] Dr. Duncan French: I've gotta ramp everything up really quickly. So That's a real challenge in terms of just managing all these these these different components of mixed martial arts, alone. The the other to come back to your question, the other thing which is truly fascinating about these individuals is their just their mental resilience. And again, we we've touched on it in the talk, but, you know, the ability to do what they do on a daily basis to, Look at all the different skill sets that they have to try and engage in and and and bring into their training. To do that and and and embrace the grind, embrace the process of just Learning, the physical side of our sport is unprecedented, but the mental side, you know, we have a funny saying here.[1:11:13] Dr. Duncan French: We always say it's 90% medical, 90% mental apart from the 60% is physical. So, you know, it's just it's just more and more and more. And these these guys' ability to, to just Do that on a daily basis is is is is very impressive. Like, the resilience, their their internal drive, and their resilience is is is really impressive to Yeah.[1:11:34] Andrew Huberman: All the fires I've met here have been really terrific. It's interesting. Every time I meet a fighter, how often I, I shouldn't be surprising where they're often very soft Spoken. Right. Always extremely polite.[1:11:44] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. You know?[1:11:45] Andrew Huberman: And fighting is such a, you know, it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain. Right. Is, but a large portion of the brain, nonetheless.[1:11:52] Dr. Duncan French: That's another skill is that switch, you know. And and again, that's the recoverability piece. Right? Like, You cannot be type a or you cannot be, like, supercharged 24 hours a day because you're gonna just fry your system. Right?[1:12:05] Dr. Duncan French: And I think that's something now is where we're really trying to manage this whole process, be it through nutritional interventions, be it through education around sleep, be it through, training prog program management, Be it through psychological interventions. You know, you could look at fights and say, like, these guys are go. Like, they're red alert, and they they'll run through a brick wall. But actually, Again, their ability to turn it on and off means that they can do what they do. You know, they can bring it down and and be very normal, very, very polite, very, you know, Accommodating[1:12:37] Andrew Huberman: maybe even better than most people because, you know, one of the reasons I'm obsessed with with human performance and high performance and But people like fighters and, you know, elite military or, or even bodybuilders for that matter is that they they experiment. Yeah. They find the outer limits of what's possible, but one of the things that they have discovered as you're describing is this ability to toggle between high alert States and calm states. Most typical people can't do this. They see something that upsets them on the Internet or something on the news or Some external event pressures down on them, and they're stressed for many, many days weeks, and sometimes it goes pathological.[1:13:13] Andrew Huberman: Right? And and this I don't say this as a criticism. It's just that Most most human beings within our species, most members of our species never learn to to either flip the switch or to just voluntarily toggle between states. I think athletes learn how to do that extremely well. And, it sounds like MMA fighters do that even better than perhaps many other athletes.[1:13:35] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, yeah, the there's the odd 1 or 2 that we'd struggle with. But I think in terms of that chronic exposure, we we see, that coming from challenges Around, you know, cyclical weight cutting and metabolic disruption and metabolic injury, not necessarily from the psychological drive. You know, they they do they do understand that this is a job for them, and the time on the mats. You know, most of them can can Turn it off a little bit and and downgrade things when they're off the mats. It's it's, it's impressive to see.[1:14:03] Dr. Duncan French: Because, again, like, as as a layman, just Looking in at at the fight game, you think, you know, it's gonna be crazy chaotic, a 100 miles an hour every hour of every day, But, that's not that's clearly not the case. They they they, they manage their energy and their efforts pretty well.[1:14:20] Andrew Huberman: So just a little bit like science. Although maybe scientists could take a lesson from[1:14:23] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Is that evidence based practice or practice based evidence? Right? That.[1:14:27] Andrew Huberman: That's good. A couple more questions. I I Can't help myself. I know we talked about temperature earlier, when we discussed cold, but I I can't help myself. I have to ask you about heat.[1:14:37] Andrew Huberman: Because earlier, we were having a a conversation about heat adaptation, about how long does it take for, the human body or athlete or typical person that's maybe exploring sauna or things of that sort to learn to be a better sweater.[1:14:52] Dr. Duncan French: It[1:14:53] Andrew Huberman: sounds like something none none of us would want to do. We all wanna say Cool, calm, and collected, but one of the reasons to deliberately expose oneself to heat is for things like growth hormone release, etcetera. We talk about this, but, a couple questions. 1, is heat exposure stress in the same way that the ice bath or cold exposure stress? The second 1 is, is there any difference there that's important?[1:15:16] Andrew Huberman: And the other 1 is, how does one get better at heat adaptation? Or at least what are you doing with the fighters to get them Better at dealing with heat. How long does that take? So the first question just, because I threw 3 questions at you Uh-huh. Is, was You know, is heat stress like coldest stress?[1:15:33] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. I think it is. And I think, you know, heat shock proteins, for example, are driven by that Stressful exposure to a changing environment. So I think, you know, it's we do graded response in terms of heat acclimation Strategies. But, yes, as we we've touched on it earlier in the conversation, for me, heat is still a stressor.[1:15:54] Dr. Duncan French: And if it's managed incorrectly, You can have detrimental responses rather than beneficial responses.[1:16:01] Andrew Huberman: So barring, like, hyperthermia and death, like, I mean, obviously, you heat up the brain too much. People will have seizures and die, but, you lose neurons. But, what's the right way to acclimate heat? Taking into account that people are, you know, To check with their doctor, etcetera, we do all these disclaimers. But, you know, but let's say I let's just say I wanna get better at dealing with heat or I wanna Track more benefit from heat is I mean, how many minutes a day are people typically exposing themselves to heat?[1:16:27] Andrew Huberman: How often and over how what periods of time?[1:16:30] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. So we We we normally start with about 15 minutes of exposure. Now if someone's really lacking acclimation to heat, you know, you can do that in 3 5 minute efforts. Do you know what I mean? And that should be[1:16:41] Andrew Huberman: taken hot hot sauna.[1:16:42] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Hot sauna. Take time to step out.[1:16:44] Andrew Huberman: 200 degrees or something like Fahrenheit.[1:16:46] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Yeah. 200 Fahrenheit. Yes. And we we we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous.[1:16:53] Dr. Duncan French: Now we we have to understand, you know, What what's the advantage of heat acclimation for our athletes? Ultimately, their ability to sweat and to lose, you know, body fluids is gonna be advantageous to their weight cut process, their their ability to make weight. It is a technique that these guys some of guys adopt. So if you don't have, you know, high sweat rates, it means you're gonna have to sit in the sauna for longer and longer and longer to get the same Delta in sweat release. So the more acclimated you are, the more your body is thermogenically adapted.[1:17:28] Dr. Duncan French: The more sweat glands you have, the small pause, you you can sweat more, and therefore, you'll lose that fluid quicker and you spend less time in the sauna. So That's why we do it, to try and promote the the lim to limit the exposure. And it comes back to your first question, is it a stressor? It's It absolutely, it's a stressor if you gotta spend, you know, 2 hours over, you know, over a 4 hour period, 2 hours of it sat in a sauna because you just[1:17:53] Andrew Huberman: doesn't work. So you can't no. Just, you know, people just wash them from their phone, and that's a stressor in itself.[1:17:59] Dr. Duncan French: Right. I mean, yes. I think, you know, there's There's a you know, what we do is we we like anything, we build up in temperature, but we build up in in volume of exposure. So, you know, we start with 15 minutes, and then we just try to Add on and add on across the time. And now now for us, we kinda found about 14, sauna exposures starts to really then drive the adaptations that we're looking for.[1:18:20] Dr. Duncan French: So it's not a quick fix. You know, a heat acclimation strategy has to happen long before fight week or long before the fights. You know, this is a this is a process that has to begin, you know, 8 to 10 weeks before the fight so that we can actually get that adaptation and that Tolerance to the stressor to the exposure of heat.[1:18:38] Andrew Huberman: This is interesting. I until today, when we talked about this earlier and again now, I didn't realize that, but it makes perfect sense now that I hear it that heat adaptation is possible that your basic can train the body to become better at cooling self, which is what what sweating is. I mean, I should have known that before, but, you know, you don't see that in the textbooks. And so yeah.[1:18:59] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, listen. It's it's It's the same as the ketogenic conversation. You know, you you're training your body to be more metabolic efficient. You're training your body to tolerate heat more. You're training your Like, the body is, you know, as an organism, as an organic system, it's it's hugely adaptable.[1:19:17] Dr. Duncan French: It's hugely plastic. But I think the skill is understanding The when's, the whys, and the whereofs in terms of changing the overload, changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation. And, philosophically, that's That's how we go about our work here. We talk about adaptation led programming. Now adaptation led programming fits into every single category, not just lifting weights or running track.[1:19:41] Dr. Duncan French: It fits into nutrition. It fits into sitting in the sauna. It fits into being in a cold bath or not. It fits into many different things because we're driven by scientific insights, and and that's how we really wanna go about our business.[1:19:54] Andrew Huberman: I love it. I love this concept of Adaptation led programming and doing that not just in the context of, you know, throwing another plate on the bar or something like that, but in every aspect of of one's training and and performance. And I think there's a lot here that's applicable to the recreational athlete too. Yeah. That would you say that, you know, what comes to mind is 12 weeks.[1:20:14] Andrew Huberman: It feels like 12 weeks is a nice block of time for someone to try something in terms of to try something new, see how they adapt adapt, and then maybe switch to something new. I realized that it's very hard to throw a kind of pan, time frame around something. But in terms of if someone wanted to experiment with heat adaptation or Experiment with cold adaptation or change up their training regimen or or diet and, look at metabolic efficiency. Do you think, 12 weeks is a good period of time to really give something a thorough go and get and un gain an understanding of how well or how poorly something works for oneself, or would you say 8 is enough for 3.[1:20:52] Dr. Duncan French: I mean, that's that's the how long is a piece of string kind of response. Right? I mean, yes. If if we're just talking Recreational experimenter. Yeah.[1:21:01] Dr. Duncan French: 3 months exposure, 12 week training, you know, strategy, 12 week intervention is is more than adequate to say. For 99% of things that change within the body that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus or an overload stimulus, you're gonna start to see Either regression or progression, you know, beneficial or detrimental effects within 3 months. Absolutely, I would say. So now listen. I I say that in as much as we do training blocks here that are 3 weeks long.[1:21:28] Dr. Duncan French: Right. You know?[1:21:29] Andrew Huberman: So it was That's because of this constraint that sometimes people suddenly have to they get the call to[1:21:34] Dr. Duncan French: Right. Correct. Yeah. So it's like super condensed. And, you know, in in that in that scenario, we're always conscious of Is a body a is a body or, this individual, do they have the ability to tolerate that super overload?[1:21:48] Dr. Duncan French: That, like, Super condensed exposure. Now we might be doing that purposefully. We might be trying to do an overreaching strategy where we're really trying to damage or flex something, and I don't mean, like, negatively damaged, but, like, we're trying to damage tissue to really get an adaptive response versus, you know, a more drawn out 12 week to g, which is more coherent, more planned out, more structured in nature. But, yeah, for all your listeners, I would say if if 12 weeks To engage in a in a process of of, you know, trying to change and adapt your body or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient to see if it's gonna be, the right approach for you. And I think, you know, the the the the the individual interpretation is always has to be considered, and I think that's where It comes back to to be a thinking man's athlete or be a thinking man's trainer, like someone that's going through exercise.[1:22:40] Dr. Duncan French: You have to cognate consciously understand where your body's at any moment in time. You know, you've gotta be real with yourself. You you create a journal, create a log of your training, a log of your feelings, your subjective feedback of, you know, how you felt, your mood, your sleep[1:22:55] Andrew Huberman: athletes do that.[1:22:56] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. Yeah. We we we try to promote that again, that's that's part of this this process. You know? Maybe 12 weeks for you, but I might get the same responses in 8 8 weeks.[1:23:05] Dr. Duncan French: You know? And I think that's That's, that's another critical theme here is that, you know, we could put 15 guys on the mat And give them the same workout, and there's gonna be 15 different responses to that same workout because the human organism is so complex And in nature, the it's gonna adapt differently. You know? Some people will tolerate it. Some people are gonna be challenged by it.[1:23:31] Dr. Duncan French: Some people have got a metabolic makeup That's gonna promote it. Some people are meta metabolically challenged by it. You know, there's there's just so many different things that we have to consider, and That's what we try to do here. It's the cross we bear is that we try to understand on an individual level how to optimize athletic performance.[1:23:48] Andrew Huberman: I think it's terrific, and, you know, the athletes here are so fortunate to have this. And most people out there, I've, you know, I've Certainly been trying to encourage people to learn some science and some mechanism and become scientists of their own pursuits, whether or not skill learning or athletic pursuit, etcetera. As a sort of a final question, what are some things about the UFC or something about the UFC that perhaps people don't know in terms of its overall mission or what you guys are trying to do here, I mean, I think I've I've become a fan of MMA, and I am more and more as time moves on. Some people might be in MMA, some people not into watching MMA, but what are some things that the UFC is interested in in and doing, that most people might not know about and certainly I might not know about.[1:24:33] Dr. Duncan French: Yeah. I mean, I think, You know, we we, we try to be cutting edge. We try to be super progressive. You know, we we we think we've got an amazing platform from here, particularly the performance institute to do some really cool things that can inform many different people. And I doubt that doesn't just mean the the 600 or so athletes that are on our global roster.[1:24:53] Dr. Duncan French: What we're trying to do is is influence, you know, global community around optimizing human performance. So, you know, any moment in time, we're engaging in different technologies with different vendors, different partners, you know, exploring opportunities to, you know, Learn more, share data, understand what's the best mechanisms for, you know, interpreting your body, interpreting how your body's responding to training, interpreting, you know, your nutrition or whatever it may be, we we get we're we're in a really privileged position to do that. But we've also, you know, hence, you've been here today. You know? We're also Trying to venture into some really cool areas of science and research that's got applicability, that you can take from high performance athletes and apply, you know, to yourself, to, you know, Joe Blow walking down the street, you know, out there, that that is really interesting.[1:25:42] Dr. Duncan French: And that's everything from, you know, whether it's CBD and psychedelics through to different technologies for, you know, thermal monitoring and Bluetooth heart rate monitoring or whatever it may be through to data management, etcetera, and and and and anything in between. We've we've got some great partners There's on the nutrition side, on the psychology side, on the data side, and, I think, you know, we we always try to just push the envelope a little bit more. Think we we keep our core mission with our athletes, but I think a lot of what we do, hence your podcast and, you know, like, an an amazing platform. You do such a great job of it that, you know, we can all learn and take from, you know, the elites and interpret how it might help us and and and just in the general So I think that's, you know, that's our our North Star is to provide our athletes the best integrated service of care. But we also wanna influence, you know, just the global community and put, you know, the UFC at the forefront of that.[1:26:38] Andrew Huberman: That's great. Well, you guys are certainly doing it, and we, Can't, let the cat out of the bag just yet, but the things that we're gearing up to do with my laboratory and Yeah. And the work together, hopefully, we'll be able to talk about that and share that in in the year to come, but that's we're very excited about that. And, Duncan, look, you know, I have this, this, filter that I use when I talk to people, academics or otherwise, which is you know, some people they open their mouth and it and it doesn't make Much difference, but when you speak, I learn so much. I I'm gonna take the protocols that I've I've heard about today.[1:27:13] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna think about how I'm training and how I could train differently and better, how and better how I'm eating, how I could eat different differently and better for sake of performance and just in in general. Thank you so much for your time. Your scientific expertise, the stuff you're doing in the practical realm, it's it's immense. So, hopefully, we can do it again.[1:27:33] Dr. Duncan French: Yes. Thank you. This has been a blast. I appreciate it. And, Yeah.[1:27:36] Dr. Duncan French: Keep doing what you're doing because I know there's a lot of people out there that love the platform. So thanks for the invite. It's been awesome.[1:27:41] Andrew Huberman: Oh, thank you. Thanks so much. Thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor Duncan French.

Many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements, supplements for sleep, supplements for focus, and for other health benefits as well. While supplements may not be for everybody, if you're going to use supplements, you want to make sure that those supplements are The very highest quality.[1:28:40] Andrew Huberman: For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, t h o r n e, because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality, and The amounts of ingredients listed on the label of Thorne supplements precisely matches what is actually contained in those capsules, bottles, and pills, and powders, so forth. This is extremely important. A lot of analyses of supplements and supplement companies have shown that what's listed on the bottle is often not What's actually contained in the bottle. Thorne stringency is unmatched. They've partnered with all the major sports teams, with the Mayo Clinic, and so there's a lot of Trust in Thorne supplements for all the right reasons.[1:29:16] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Thorne supplements, you can see the supplements that I take. You can go to thorne, thorne.com slash the letter u slash Huberman. There, you can see the supplements that I take. You can get 20% off any of those supplements. And if you navigate into the Thorne site through that portal, you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.[1:29:37] Andrew Huberman: I'd also like to mention that if you're not already following us on Instagram at hubermanlab, you might wanna do so. There, I do brief science tutorials and offer science based protocols for all sorts of things that are often separate from the protocols and information covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. We're also on Twitter as Huberman Lab. And last And certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
