I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Rick Rubin. Rick Rubin is credited with being one of the most creative and prolific music producers of all time. The range of artists with whom he's worked with and discovered Is absolutely staggering ranging from artists such as LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Beastie Boys, Jesus and Mary Chain, Jay Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Green Day, Tom Petty, System of a Down, Joe Strummer, Kanye West, Johnny Cash, Adele, and many, many more.[0:00:42] Andrew Huberman: Not surprisingly, therefore, Rick is considered somewhat of an enigma. That is people want to know how it is that 1 individual is able to extract The best creative artistry from so many different people in so many different genres of music. Well, as today's discussion reveals, Rick's expertise in the creative process extends well beyond music. In fact, our conversation takes us into the realm of what the creative process is specifically and generally across domains, including music, of course, but also writing, film, science, and essentially all domains in which new original thought, Ideas and production of anything becomes important. Our conversation ventures from abstract themes such as what is creativity and where does it stem from to the more concrete, everyday tool based approaches to creativity, including those that Rick himself uses and that he's seen other people use to great success.[0:01:37] Andrew Huberman: That took us down some incredible avenues ranging from a discussion about the subconscious to how the subconscious interacts With our conscious mind and how the subconscious and conscious mind interact with nature around us and within us. Indeed, our conversation got rather scientific at times, but all with an eye and an ear toward understanding the practical tools that any and all of us can use in order to access the creative process. We also spent some time talking about Rick's new book, which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity. The title of the book is The Creative Act, A Way of Being by Rick Rubin. This is a book that I've now read 3 times from cover to cover, and I'm now reading it a 4th time Because it is so rich with wisdom and information that I'm applying in multiple domains of my life, not just my work, but my everyday life.[0:02:24] Andrew Huberman: I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rick has an incredible ability to translate his understanding of the creative process in a way that is meaningful for anybody. So if you're in music, if you're a musician, it will certainly be meaningful for you. But it is not about music. It is about the creative process.[0:02:41] Andrew Huberman: And so whether or not you consider yourself somebody creative or not or whether or not you seek to be more creative, Rick's book in today's conversation sheds light on what I believe to be the fundamental features of what makes us human beings, that is what allows us, unlike other animals, To look out on the landscape around us, to examine our inner landscape, and to come up with truly novel ideas that thrill us, entertain us, Entertain other people, scare us, make us laugh, make us cry. All the things that make life rich are essentially contained in the creative process. And to be able to sit down and learn from the Rick Rubin how the creative process emerges in him and his observations about how it can best emerge in others Is and was truly a gift, so I'm excited to share his knowledge with you today. One thing that you'll quickly come to notice about today's conversation is that Rick is incredibly generous with his knowledge about the creative process. In fact, he very graciously and spontaneously, I should add, Offered to answer your questions about creativity.[0:03:41] Andrew Huberman: So if you have questions about the creative process for Rick, please put those in the comment section on YouTube. And in order to make those questions A bit easier for me to find, please put question for Rick Rubin in capitals then colon or dash, whichever you choose, then put your question there. I do ask that you keep the questions relatively short so that I can ask Rick as many of those questions as possible. We will record that conversation, and we will post it as a clip the Huberman Lab Clips channel. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:04:13] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Maui Nui, which I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available. Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA certified Wild harvesting system to help balance invasive deer populations on the island of Maui. I've talked before on this podcast, and we've had guests on this podcast that have emphasized the critical role of getting quality protein, not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis, but also for repair of all tissues, including brain tissue on a day to day basis.[0:04:54] Andrew Huberman: And the general rule of thumb for that is 1 gram of quality protein per pound of body weight per day. With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily, and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories, is also critical for immediate and long term health. I should say that Maui Nui meats are not only extremely high quality, but They are also delicious. I particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky. I also have had Maui Nui Venison in various recipes including Ground venison, some venison steaks, and I love the taste of the venison.[0:05:26] Andrew Huberman: It's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all. It's incredibly delicious. So if you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison, go to Maui Nui Venison .com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Again, that's Maui Nui Venison .com /huberman to get 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.[0:05:45] Andrew Huberman: Thesis makes custom nootropics. And as many of you have probably heard me say before, I'm not a fan of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs. And frankly, the brain doesn't work that way. The brain has neural circuits for focus. It also has neural circuits for creativity and neural circuits for task switching And for imagination and for memory, there is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart.[0:06:08] Andrew Huberman: And therefore, the word nootropics doesn't really apply to anything Pacific neurobiologically speaking. Thesis understands this and therefore has designed custom nootropics that are tailored to your unique needs. I've been using Thesis for over a year now, and their nootropic formulas have been a game changer for me, in particular, in the realm of cognitive work. My go to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive work is their clarity formula. That's the one I've been using most often lately.[0:06:33] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Thesis Customiz Nootropics, You can go online to take thesis.com/huberman. You'll take a brief 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month.

Whoop is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep, but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking to provide real time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules in order to feel and perform better.[0:07:05] Andrew Huberman: 6 months ago, I started working with WHOOP a member of their scientific advisory council, as a way to help WHOOP advance their mission of unlocking human performance. And as a WHOOP user, I've experienced firsthand the health benefits of their technology. It's clear based on quality research that WHOOP can inform you how well you're sleeping, how to change your sleep habits, how to change your activity habits, even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and lifestyle in order to maximize your mental health, physical health, and performance. So whether or not you're an athlete or you're simply for health. WHOOP can really help you understand how your body functions under different conditions and how to really program your schedule, nutrition, and exercise, and many other factors of your life in order to really optimize your health and performance, including your cognition.[0:07:51] Andrew Huberman: If you're interested in trying WHOOP, you can go to join WHOOP, spelled whoop.com/huberman.

The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce that we are now with momentous supplements because momentous supplements are of the very highest quality, they ship internationally, and they have single ingredient formulations. If you'd like to access the supplements to have you here today, Rick.[0:08:25] Rick Rubin: Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure.[0:08:27] Andrew Huberman: So of all the topics in science and in particular in neuroscience, I confess that Creativity is the most difficult one to capture because, you can find papers scientific studies that is On convergent thinking versus divergent thinking, and there are definitions to these, and they take on different forms. But in a strict definition form, it seems that creativity has something to do with either rearranging existing elements or coming up with new elements. But as I went into your book, which I've done, you know, Twice. I've read it twice. And by the way, I feel so blessed and honored to have gotten an early copy from you or a final copy early, that is.[0:09:17] Andrew Huberman: But having gone through it twice, I'm now convinced that there may not actually be an internal source of creativity that exists on its own. Right? And and the example that you give that For me, really is serving as an anchor. And tell me if I'm wrong here, is this idea that ideas and creativity are a little bit like a cloud. If you look at it at one moment, you might think that it looks like one thing where it has a certain shape and texture.[0:09:47] Andrew Huberman: But then you look at it a moment later, it could be quite a bit different. And if you look at an hour later, it very well could be gone. And the The reason I think that serves as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general have never actually captured A way to even talk about creativity, stems from somebody that you knew in person, but that, as you know, I greatly admire. I don't have many heroes, but I would put Joe Strummer among the shortlist of heroes that I have. And I remember once an interview with him fairly disjointed.[0:10:22] Andrew Huberman: He was sort of, you know, often different tangents that I couldn't follow, but at one point, he just kinda blurted out that if you have an idea, You have to write it down, and you may end up throwing it away. But if you wait, it will be gone. And I remember that, and as a consequence, I have a whole system that I use to try and capture ideas. But what are your thoughts on what Joe said? This Cloud idea that comes up, in one form in one area of the book, but then I think is thread throughout the book in different ways.[0:10:55] Andrew Huberman: You know, how did that come to you, and and how does it serve you in trying to ex I don't wanna say extract, but trying to access creativity.[0:11:04] Rick Rubin: I think the best way to think about it is like a dream. It's like if you think about your dreams, they don't they don't necessarily make sense. When you wake up, you'll you might remember part, but not the whole thing. Then if you start writing them down, they'll They'll they'll come back, and they may not make sense to you. They're they're they'll be, a series of abstract images.[0:11:32] Rick Rubin: And may you know, maybe someday in the future, you'll be able to look back and understand what they mean and maybe not. And that's sort of how this the art making, process works. It's like we're making things, and we're looking for a feeling in ourselves. And it's it could be a feeling of excitement or enthusiasm, a feeling of interest, feeling of curiosity. I wanna know more.[0:11:59] Rick Rubin: Feeling of leaning forward. And We've we're following that energy in our body when we feel the this there's something here. There's Something here. I wanna know more. I wanna know more.[0:12:13] Rick Rubin: I wanna know more. And, but it's not it's I'll say it's not an intellectual process. It's a different thing. That's why it's it's hard, but even to talk about it because it's so, elusive. You know?[0:12:28] Andrew Huberman: Recently, I was listening to a podcast by our friend, Lex Friedman.[0:12:33] Rick Rubin: Yeah. I think[0:12:34] Andrew Huberman: it was an episode with Balaji Srinivasan where this With Balaji, who's investor type guy, thinker type guy, this is like an 8 hour episode. He says something at the beginning that I'd love your thoughts on he said, look. You know, we can train a rat to lever press every other time or to expect reward and every even number press or every odd number press or every even every 5th number press. But a human and a rat can't do that for, like, prime number presses. You can't actually train that.[0:13:11] Andrew Huberman: And then you think about the reward systems and the way that we follow life when we get up until we go to sleep. And what he said is the fact that we can't do that means that we may not actually be In touch with the best schedules of doing things. Like, every time I'm thirsty, I take a sip. I assume that's the right way to do it, but it might not be optimal. Right?[0:13:34] Andrew Huberman: Optum for whatever purpose. When I was reading your book, I was thinking about There's a there's a there's a set of things to follow, things to pay attention to. You talk about this, things to access That none of the creative process comes from just within us. It can, but it's always being fed by things outside of it. And so what I started to do is the 2nd time I read through the book was think about it through the lens of what Balaji was saying was that there may not even be a language for this thing that we call accessing creativity.[0:14:07] Andrew Huberman: I mean, there's a process, but that language in the form of words is a little bit like, trying to use even numbers to try and access prime numbers.[0:14:18] Rick Rubin: Yes.[0:14:19] Andrew Huberman: Like, the the math becomes so convoluted That we end up in a conversation like this where I'm confident we can get to the kernels of it because in the what's remarkable about the book is that you do. You You show and inform the process. But there may not be a English or any other language for saying do this, then this, then this, then this, and you'll have something of creative value. Yeah. Does that capture it?[0:14:48] Rick Rubin: Yes. I think language is insufficient to to drill down On creativity, it's more, it's closer to magic than it is, science.[0:15:01] Andrew Huberman: So when kids come into the world, do you think that they have better access to this creative process than we do as adults because we start to impart rule plays and books like will it get likes, will people like it, But, also, like, all the things that are available to us that we're not paying attention to, like the texture of this table. Right? They We're discarding things kind of systematically. We get, quote, unquote, set in our ways. Do you think kids are more are just by definition and by design more creative than adults?[0:15:36] Rick Rubin: Yes. Kids are they're open, and they have no baggage. They don't have any belief system. They don't know how things are supposed to work. They just see what is.[0:15:48] Rick Rubin: And if we pay attention to what is, we learn we learn much more than if we, Most of us select from an endless number of data points available to us To well, as a as a species, to make sure that we don't die and to procreate and to feed ourselves are probably the primary Functions first, and then and then we learn things about what's right and what's wrong, and we learn things about, How to do certain things, or we're inspired by someone who makes something we love, and we wanna do it the way they do it. And all of those things undermine the purity of the creative process. They can be, tools to Build your skill set to be able to do it yourself. Like, if you're a a a singer, you might imitate a singer you really like For a while to get good at it and then eventually come to find your own voice. It doesn't always it doesn't always start with your own voice.[0:16:57] Rick Rubin: But if you're 3 years old or 5 year years old and you try singing, you're not singing like anyone else. You're you're singing with your own your own voice. And when you make Something you're making it based on not not knowing. And I I think, I had the advantage early in my career of Starting making music without any experience, which was helpful because I didn't know what rules I was breaking. And So what it wasn't intentional breaking of rules.[0:17:28] Rick Rubin: I just did what seemed right to me, but I didn't realize that I was doing things that other people wouldn't do.[0:17:35] Andrew Huberman: I mean, there is this idea that there are no new ideas. You know? I sort of disagree because every once in a while, I'll see or hear something that at least seems different enough.[0:17:47] Rick Rubin: I think it's a a a comb a combination of a new combination of existing ideas presented in a new way. I think that's I think that's how it works. I don't know. But I will say it does seem like the things that are most interesting to me have A series of familiar elements joined together in a way that it's creating something that I've never seen before.[0:18:11] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned that it's, that when you are close to or you see hints of creativity, that is of real value that you can that it's a feeling. And I also believe that the body is a great source of information. I mean, which, you know, Once people will realize that the brain, of course, is in the skull, but the nervous system extends everywhere in the body, the whole mind body thing just falls away. You know? Philosophers have argued about this forever, but it's a silly argument.[0:18:41] Andrew Huberman: It's also true that, you know, god forbid I were to amputate All my limbs have them amputated. I'd fundamentally still be me. Right? The same is not true if we Took about big enough chunk of my brain and I still survived, I would be fundamentally different human being. Mhmm.[0:18:57] Andrew Huberman: I'd still have the same name and identity and Social Security number, but I would behave very differently. Mhmm. Who knows? Maybe better. The signals from the body, We know or at least we assume are pretty generic.[0:19:15] Andrew Huberman: Like, I can think of 50 different ways or a 100 ways that we Talk about creativity today, and we could define it and redefine it and carve it up and serve it up like sushi in a bunch of different ways. But The body sends signals that most of us are we have a kind of course understanding of. It's like, oh, my stomach hurts or my stomach feels good or I'm not Sensing my stomach or, oh, that feels good. It feels warm. It feels cold.[0:19:41] Andrew Huberman: Like, most of us aren't trained in understanding how to interpret those signals. So it's almost like you have a few vowels, a few syllables, and there isn't a lot more. Whereas when we talk about our thoughts and our experiences depending on how hyperverbal somebody is and how much emphasis they put on different sounds. It it's kind of near infinite. Right?[0:20:00] Andrew Huberman: Not infinite, but near infinite. So for you, personally, When you know that you're on the on the the end of a thread of creativity, maybe you're listening to an artist or you're Or you're hearing something, you and you're like there, and the the your antennae start to deflect in a certain way.[0:20:19] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[0:20:19] Andrew Huberman: Right? Do you feel that In your body as a recognizable sensation, or is it a thought and a sensation?[0:20:28] Rick Rubin: It's a it's a feeling in my body.[0:20:31] Andrew Huberman: Is it low is it localized?[0:20:33] Rick Rubin: No. It's a it's a it's a feeling of, I would say it's like a surge of energy.[0:20:42] Andrew Huberman: Do you remember the first time you experienced that?[0:20:45] Rick Rubin: Probably, you know, hearing the Beatles when I was 3 or 4 years old.[0:20:49] Andrew Huberman: 3 or 4 years old?[0:20:50] Rick Rubin: Yeah. Wow. Yeah.[0:20:52] Andrew Huberman: Is there something wrong with me that The Beatles have never done it for me?[0:20:56] Rick Rubin: Maybe you just weren't exposed at the right time in the right way. It's there's no no right or wrong way. And and everyone, I can love the Beatles, and you cannot, and we're both right. You know? There's not a[0:21:06] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad that we can still be friends. I was a little concerned. I was a little scared to ask you that question. I know my taste in music is a little bit obscure, but and and kind of fragmentary, but, okay. Good.[0:21:16] Andrew Huberman: I've always felt like, gosh. There must have been something wrong with me. I like their songs. Yeah. But they don't there's no juice for me there.[0:21:23] Rick Rubin: I think maybe we'll watch, there was An 8 part series called The Beatles Anthology, which is out of print, but I I can try to find it somewhere and we can watch that together. Okay. Maybe that'll Make the case for The Beatles.[0:21:37] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Yeah. Be I I mean, nothing against them. It's just and I'm always bothering you for story, but, like, Ramones. I saw that, and I was like, wow.[0:21:44] Andrew Huberman: Like, jeans, aviators. Everyone had to change their last name to Ramon. A lot of them hated each other. Yeah. There's all so much drama in there and And 3 chords and just but to me, it just was like, wow.[0:21:55] Andrew Huberman: Like, kids from New York, that energy. So I think different things for different people. Right?[0:22:00] Rick Rubin: Absolutely. So[0:22:01] Andrew Huberman: that brings me to a question of when when something feels creatively right and you're sensing it and, and you're there, let's say, in the studio or maybe even you're listening to something that somebody sent you.[0:22:15] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[0:22:16] Andrew Huberman: How do how do you translate that Given the absence of of language, how how do you translate that into a conversation with the artist? Again, this could be about writing or comedy or, you know, or science or podcasting for that matter. How do you say that keep going that way When they might not even recognize that they did it, and I'm guessing a lot of times, they don't.[0:22:40] Rick Rubin: Yeah. Sometimes they don't. It depends. When we're in the I'll I'll try to be in a in a setting where as we're talking about it, we can engage with it in that moment. So it's not much good.[0:22:57] Rick Rubin: Let's say I was producing your new record and you played me something and I had some thoughts about it. It wouldn't be so helpful for me to tell you what those were. It'd be better for us to wait till we're in a place where we could try things and see where it goes. So the first thing is I wouldn't rely on language to do it. It would be more of a Making a suggestion is something that's actionable.[0:23:23] Rick Rubin: We try it, and then we have more data. And either we're moving in a good direction or we're moving away from it. We're moving towards it or away from it, And we never know. And so it's always an experiment. And maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like, if I gave you 2 Dishes of food and ask you to taste them and tell me which one you like better.[0:23:43] Rick Rubin: It's pretty usually, it's pretty straightforward. You know? When you have 2 choices, which you like better. And I think most creativity can be boiled down to that. That's very different than I wonder how this gonna perform on certain social media platforms.[0:23:59] Rick Rubin: That's different than what is it when I'm tasting these 2 things, which is the one I wanna finish eating. And and if I were to say, I like this one better, but it needs a little salt and then put a little salt on it. It's like, maybe I put too much salt. And you'll and you know, when you taste it, it's like it's it's that simple. Being in tune enough with ourselves to really know how we feel in the face of knowing that other people might feel very differently, Which is part of the challenge.[0:24:34] Rick Rubin: It's like, if everyone tells you a a a a a a a, and you listen and you're like, That's b. As an artist, it's important to be able to say, To me, it's b. And that's a it's a disconnect because so much of you know, when we go to school, it's get us to follow the rules. And in art, it's different because the the rules are there As a scaffolding to be, chipped away as need be. Sometimes they're helpful, sometimes they're not.[0:25:17] Rick Rubin: And sometimes we'll even impose our own rules to give something its shape. So We can decide to make a, we're gonna make a painting, but we're only gonna use, green and red are the only clothes we're we're allowed to use. We decide that in advance. And then how do we solve the problem knowing all we have is green and red? It it can Because otherwise, if there's an infinite number of choices, anything can be anything.[0:25:47] Rick Rubin: You know? It's like it's it's, Sometimes more choices is not better. So limiting your palate to something manageable Forces you to solve problems in a different way. Now in our, in our digital age, music wise, you can Make anything, digitally. There's no like, in in there was a time when if you didn't have a guitar in the studio, you couldn't record guitar.[0:26:18] Rick Rubin: Or if you didn't if you couldn't hire an orchestra, there couldn't be orchestra on your recording. Now you can just call any of those things up. So there's infinite choices, and infinite choices don't necessarily lead to better, better compositions or better final, final works. Understanding how you feel In the face of other voices without second guessing yourself is probably the single most important, thing to practice as an artist or skill set to develop as an artist is to Know how you feel and own your feelings. And the and the key to that is not I know, so I know what's right for you.[0:27:10] Rick Rubin: It doesn't work that way. It's just I know from me, and the reason I chose to be an artist is to demonstrate This is how I see it. If I'm if I'm undermining my taste for some Commercial idea or, it it defeats the whole purpose of doing this. This is not that's not what this process is about. This process is I'm doing me, and I'm showing you who I am, and you can like it or not.[0:27:42] Rick Rubin: But either way, this is still how I see it.[0:27:46] Andrew Huberman: I love that because, in science, you know, having trained graduate students, having been a graduate student, I was very blessed to have mentors, One of who is a real iconoclast. He's dead now. Actually, all my advisers are dead. Suicide, cancer, cancer. The joke is you don't want me to work for you.[0:28:03] Andrew Huberman: So they were all had a morbid sense of humor, so they're laughing about this someplace right now.[0:28:09] Rick Rubin: I thought you were gonna say they all ate the poison mushrooms.[0:28:11] Andrew Huberman: No. But the last one, Said to me, you're the common denominator, Andrew. And I thought, oh my goodness. And he said, kind of just kidding, but not really. So That's a little bit eerie.[0:28:24] Andrew Huberman: But in any case, he he always said his name was Ben. He always said, there The one thing I can't teach is taste. And the one predictor I have of the people who will never develop it are the ones who are perfectionists because they're filtering their perfect perfectionists that filter their perfection through the feedback of others. He was always looking for the person that was cut putting up a little bit of a middle finger to feedback, not so much that they would get things Wrong[0:28:55] Rick Rubin: because you[0:28:56] Andrew Huberman: can be badly wrong in science. You can be wrong for the right reasons, but you can also be for the wrong reasons.[0:29:01] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[0:29:01] Andrew Huberman: But people that Just had almost a compulsion to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing. And I I'm hearing some of that, Or I'm hearing that in what you're describing. I I also think that there's something about the human empathic process or the emotional process where When we see somebody doing something and they seem to really not be paying attention to what anyone else is doing Mhmm. I mean, I guess that the crazy person on the street is one version of it where we go there just in their experience, and it's just crazy. But when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves or the the emotion seems to be real.[0:29:39] Andrew Huberman: I think there are a good fraction of people who feel a kind of gravitational pull, And they go, you know, that. And the best example I have of this is I remember growing up in the skateboard thing. We were the 1st we were the 1st to start doing the baggy, Like, sagging the clothes thing, and we got teased endlessly 1 year in school. Then there was a bunch of hip hop that came out, and guys were wearing sagging their Their jeans or their shorts. Next year, we come back, and the very same people who were making fun of us, we're all doing it.[0:30:08] Andrew Huberman: And that's when the it clicked for me. I was like, most people don't actually know what they like. No. They like what they like because of the certainty of the people that they like. Mhmm.[0:30:18] Andrew Huberman: And, so the question then is, in this, landscape of creative stuff, what's real, what's not real? You know, these are it's almost like whoever can create the most convincing story at least captures a good number of of a good fraction of audiences. But that's not what the creative artist needs to do. They need to actually depart from that. Do I have that right?[0:30:43] Rick Rubin: Well, they're just 2 different things. Like, Coming up with a story with the purpose of pleasing someone else is a skill set, but it's more of a It's more of a commercial endeavor than an artistic endeavor.[0:30:57] Andrew Huberman: It's, like, tactical.[0:30:59] Rick Rubin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[0:31:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I was thinking in your book, you describe again, when you're thinking about the creative process as the cloud. For me, again, it serves as such a powerful anchor. And then I think about the the biology, the neurobiology of, like, strategy formation or strategy implementation. And then almost by sheer luck or miraculously, I turn a few pages later into the book, And there's a description of how animals that are trying to accomplish something, eat, mate, find water, You know, accomplish their their the requirements of living.[0:31:39] Andrew Huberman: It requires a narrow visual focus. This is something my lab is kind of obsessed with and I've been obsessed with. And in that more narrow visual focus, we know that the the playbook becomes more narrow. The rule set is more narrow. Now at some point, in order to come up with a new creative idea, that means that broadening vision is essential In some way or broadening thinking.[0:32:03] Rick Rubin: Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing, but it's changing the aperture from The standard. The reason we do this is to present something new That maybe you already knew, but didn't know you knew it. And for that to be the case, You have to be looking at it. It's not unlike what a comedian does. You know, comedian makes you laugh.[0:32:30] Rick Rubin: Usually, what they're saying, it's outrageous, but you know that it's Right. You know, just no one says it that way, or no one has said it that way before. But it's always the truth in it that makes it funny. It's it's like that. It's the same it's the same idea as recognizing something that seems Really obvious once you see it, but seems like nobody else sees it or no one else points it out.[0:32:59] Rick Rubin: And I feel like science is like that too because how much of science when once the, you know, the the light Flashes over your head. It's like, I got it. Of it just seems like, well, I we knew that forever. No one knew it, but you know what I'm saying? It's like it's so obvious.[0:33:18] Rick Rubin: Absolutely. It's so obvious. And I think another superpower of artists is is this accepting we don't know anything. When we think we know things, that also limits our our world. We think we know.[0:33:31] Rick Rubin: It's only like this. This is all that's possible Where mice in this little box, but in reality, who's to say that's that's the case? Who's to say any of the we could take all of the, what we believe in science now and decide to throw all of that away and start from scratch, And we'd probably create a different a whole different one.[0:33:55] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic greens is an all in 1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens. I started taking athletic greens way back in 2012. So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens every single day, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.[0:34:22] Andrew Huberman: So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not, I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins, minerals, probiotics, Adaptogens to combat stress and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion. I just feel much better when I'm drinking If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman. And for the month of January, they have a special offer where they'll give you 10 free travel packs Plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Vitamin d three and k two are vital for immune function, metabolic function, hormone health, but also calcium regulation and heart health. Again, that's athletic greens.com/huberman to claim their special offer in the month of January of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:35:04] Andrew Huberman: In a offline conversation, one time, You asked a good friend of mine who's been a guest on this podcast, Eddie Chang, who's chair of neurosurgery, and one I I would place him in the top top 1% of neuroscientists, you know, is pulling speech out of people who are completely paralyzed with locked in syndrome, etcetera, and you asked him, what percentage of What's contained in medical textbooks and training Today. Today.[0:35:31] Rick Rubin: Yeah. If you went to medical school today[0:35:33] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:35:34] Rick Rubin: And you learned what was in the textbook, But what percentage of that information is accurate and what percentage is not? And he said, maybe half.[0:35:42] Andrew Huberman: Right. And you asked, And what is the consequence of that? And he said, incalculable. And I I completely agree. And, and I asked him a second time, and he still came up Same answer.[0:35:52] Andrew Huberman: So that's a good sign. Reliability from experiment to the next is good. Yeah. I think that the there is this idea that we really know things. In science, I mean, you've seen we've observed amazing discoveries from chance.[0:36:08] Andrew Huberman: We've observed Amazing discoveries, from incredible bouts of hard work. In both cases, people are spending a lot of time in the lab. Like, no one walked into the lab, saw something one day, and had a Nobel Prize winning discovery or fundamental discovery. They were all hanging out in lab a lot. Just some of them, came up with something that they didn't expect.[0:36:32] Andrew Huberman: Others were were drilling toward an answer.[0:36:34] Rick Rubin: And in all those cases, when the breakthroughs happen, I'm guessing I don't know this. That considering, We we assume this information, then this discovery It's true based on everything that came before it. But if everything that came before it is wrong, then the discoveries are probably built on Do you know what I'm saying? It's like the the the context everything that happens takes into account that the context that it's sitting in, It fits in that context. Maybe that context isn't right.[0:37:12] Rick Rubin: Who knows? We don't know. So I'm saying we're too we're too close to most things In thinking when we know when we think we know things where there are a lot of assumptions that go into it, And that any new discoveries are essentially built on top of these beliefs, you know, But their beliefs[0:37:36] Andrew Huberman: I remember, you know, learn of course, I listened to the BC boys growing up Who didn't? I was child of the nineties, and they were in this you know, sabotage was, you know, sort of an outgrowth of a skateboarding movie like Spike Jonze and, like, the Girl movies and those worlds that Beast Boys and skateboarding were were really closely interwoven for a while. Some people know this, some people don't. And Spike sort of formed the bridge, and then Spike went off and started Making more triggered bigger movies, that more people watch. But let's just use them as an example.[0:38:08] Andrew Huberman: I heard you say Once before that, you know, you guys were kind of joking around, like, BC boys, like, you know, these guys doing hip hop, but it was kinda like the hardcore scene in New York, Punk rock scene, and it was sort of a joke. There were a lot of inside jokes. When you were working together, was there the thought That people might love it, might hate it, or you just weren't paying attention at all?[0:38:31] Rick Rubin: Weren't paying attention at all. Never considered it. There there were no, at that point in time when we're making licensed ill, hip hop music was a tiny underground thing, And it was no one making hip hop at that time thought it would ever mean anything. It was it was not a realistic thought. So we were making it really for our crazy friends, and that's it.[0:38:59] Andrew Huberman: So do you think nowadays the fact that One can create something and, quote, unquote, release it quickly. I can put it something out onto Twitter or Instagram now. I could do it in 10 seconds from now, and I will get immediate feedback that that which is external feedback, of course, but then I can iterate on the basis of that feedback. Do you think That's problematic for the larger opportunity for creativity. In other words, if we were to go back 20 years or even 15 years When the opportunity create to create was certainly still there, but you really didn't know what the how it was gonna land until you, quote, unquote, released it.[0:39:38] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[0:39:38] Andrew Huberman: It was it seems to me there was more opportunity to stay in that magical, rainforest that is the the the creativity itself.[0:39:47] Rick Rubin: I don't think it's wrong or right. It's just it's More information that you can use or not use and use it in a useful way. And, you know, you can make something and Put it out and people could not like it. And they're like, oop, they still don't get it. Here, I'm gonna I gotta go harder.[0:40:01] Rick Rubin: You know, like, I gotta go harder in that direction, not do you know what I'm saying? It's like not, to react away from information. It can be helpful. It can be helpful when There could be different stories that happen at the same time where you're making something, and you have an idea of what it is. And then other people Engage with it and may have a different idea of what it is, and they like it for a different reason than you did or dislike it for a reason different than the reason you like it.[0:40:33] Rick Rubin: We can't control any of those things. You know? The only part of it that we can control is how we relate to the thing that we make. And any external information That undermines the clarity of that connection is probably bad for the art is my is my guess. Mhmm.[0:40:58] Rick Rubin: Oh, and and, again, I I'm only saying this from my experience. Like, I I try to make things all I've ever tried to make were was something I like or something that I felt like was missing as a fan that I wanted, and I Nobody was making it, so I'll I'll make it. You know? But it wasn't. It was always in the service of, I love this thing.[0:41:23] Rick Rubin: I want something like this. No one else is making 1. I have to make 1.[0:41:27] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's, it's beautiful because I the word that keeps coming to mind is this it's almost like a compulsion. Like, there there are other options of ways to be and to behave and to function and work in life. But there's if something's a compulsion, it it yanks us away from those other opportunities just enough that we have to get back to it. You've talked before about and you talk in the book, this notion of the source.[0:41:54] Andrew Huberman: And, to me, again, I can't help but put my neuroscientist lens on this. I think of, the source as not one brain area, but Some function within the brain where we we are in touch with our bot bodily signals, like what feels right, doesn't. Sort of like tasting the 2 foods. I love that example. And that it's a it's a playbook that is Far more vast than the the short term adaptive playbook, like this how I'm gonna get from point a to point b.[0:42:28] Andrew Huberman: And yet When I listen to an album or a song, I mean, I have to assume that they're at some point, it becomes Not strategy development or creativity, but strategy implementation. Like, there needs to be like, the songs are gonna come in this order and, like, I don't know much about music. My musician friends are always, you know[0:42:49] Rick Rubin: I don't either. It's not it's not so much about music.[0:42:55] Andrew Huberman: Right. Well well put. But the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, etcetera. So at what point does one decide, okay. Like, now is the time to get into that more narrow focus of of Effort.[0:43:11] Andrew Huberman: Like, we've got it. Let's run with this. Because there is a component that creative process involves packaging and finishing. And Is that part less satisfying to you, or is it just all part of the same larger arc?[0:43:23] Rick Rubin: It's all part of the same it's it's nice. There's a good feeling. There's usually a good feeling when something is done. On the one hand, it's it's a commitment because up until the time that you say it's done, you can keep experimenting and changing it. You know, if you if you think, well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better, then it's not finished.[0:43:43] Rick Rubin: And you keep thinking that for a long time, you can do that forever and never never put out anything. So getting to the point where you're ready to sign off is a good feeling, and it allows you one of the things I talk about in the book is, because it is a difficult thing to do because it's fun to play, and it's fun to Maybe it's not the best it could be yet, you know, to use whatever the next project is gonna be As motivation to finish the one you're working on now. Like, I'm working on this. I'm spending all of my time on this thing. It's really good.[0:44:25] Rick Rubin: I believe it can be better, but there's this other thing that I really wanna make. And if I keep Tinkering with this one, I'll never get to make the other one. So using other projects as a impetus To finish something and release it into the world is a good one. And you said the your description of of source is something within us. I I don't know if I would accurate if I would say that was accurate.[0:44:54] Rick Rubin: It's definitely In us too, but it's not only in us. And it's, I think of source as The organizing principle of everything. And it's how everything exists. How the trees grow and why there are mountains and anything that we can see in the outside world and and every discovery And every piece of art and every, new design and every machine are all outgrowths of this source energy. Our part of it is the antenna that, like, connects to it.[0:45:38] Rick Rubin: Mhmm. And and maybe we're the, we're the the vehicle for source To allow things to happen in the world.[0:45:50] Andrew Huberman: No. And thank you for that because I I did indeed miss Speak because I recall very distinctly in the book you described how, you know, the physical world is constrained by the laws of physics and certain things are. The imagination is unconstrained. And you, I think I have this right that you said you know, the work sits somewhere between those. It's neither of 1 nor the other.[0:46:10] Andrew Huberman: But then ultimately, What feeds into all of that, our imagination and the way indeed that our our brain is a physical entity, the Nature in the outside world provides at least what appears to be near infinite, if not infinite options. And I I love the example of the color palette That if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints or medium I have, then, it's restricted. But in nature, there's a an infinite number of Shades and tones and combinations.[0:46:41] Rick Rubin: And even on 1, you know, if you pick up a rock and look at the color of the rock and tried to find a paint to match that rock, it would never match. There's too much there there are too many variations In nature within a a a single color rock, for us to get close. There's There's too much information. We we scratch the surface. We're only scratching the surface.[0:47:08] Andrew Huberman: And we love when we Are able to peer in at different scales, spatial scales, time scales too, but spatial scales. The delight that comes from that, you know, that these nature pictures seem like there were of these in the eighties, like, where you'd see a drop of oil shot at high very high resolution. Mhmm. There's beauty in a drop of oil, and then you'd see the the Earth and the galaxy. There's beauty in that 2.[0:47:29] Andrew Huberman: Right? These extremes. And, of course, our daily perception is mostly through the filter of these kinds of interactions, walls, and sometimes outdoors. There's a, a brilliant neuroscientist, and, not surprisingly, he has a Nobel. His name is Richard Axel.[0:47:46] Andrew Huberman: He's at Columbia University. His outrageous personality, choose Nicorette nonstop. You guys would get along great, not because of the Nicorette, but because His perspective on things is is very abstract for a guy who's solved. He won the Nobel for solving, a great Problem within how we smell, perception of odors and taste. And he says, you know, the everything that the brain does is an abstraction.[0:48:16] Andrew Huberman: Like, I could take a photograph of your face and show it to you and say, yeah. That's me. Or let's say, for the moment, I call myself an abstract artist. Let's just play a game because I've never been accused of being an artist. But And I do 3 dots and a squiggly line, and I say, that's you.[0:48:29] Andrew Huberman: And you say, well, that doesn't look like me. And I say, but that's my abstraction of you. Yeah. Okay. Well, the brain essentially does that because or something in between that because there's no actual photograph of you in my brain.[0:48:41] Andrew Huberman: It's just a bunch of neurons Playing what we call an ensemble, like a different keys on a piano, and we go, Rick, I recognize you. Rick Rubin. And so everything is an abstraction. And it's only once we start tinkering with the parts, and this is the essence of science, to remove and add and manipulate. And the best example I can come up with would be, Rothko.[0:49:02] Andrew Huberman: And I only come up with this example because I started off in vision science and maybe so make the most sense to everyone except the folks who've been blind since birth, And they can swap something in here. The if I show you a Rothko and I don't tell you it's a Rothko, you may or may not actually think it's that impressive. It depends on your taste in art. But what Rothko did, which was amazing, even if you don't like Rothkos, and I happen to, is that he removed All the white and high contrasty stuff. And when you do that, you alter color space, and so the colors look very different.[0:49:36] Andrew Huberman: Some people saw that dress a few years ago. Is it orange or is it gold or whatever? That was a little bit of the same phenomenon. I doubt in fact, I'd be willing to bet my left arm that Rothko knew nothing about the neuroscience of color perception, But somehow got to this place where if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast and the paintings were large enough And on the appropriate wall, you saw them a certain way that tapped into something fundamental. And this is where I think art and science really converge is that every once in a while, we see something that feels Amazing to enough people and not just like the baggy pants phenomenon, not just because other people think it's cool, but there's something there.[0:50:21] Andrew Huberman: And, again, this defies language. And I have to imagine that in your, your years of of life and music and other creative endeavors that you've That every once in a while, do you have you ever encountered something where, like, something fundamental keeps showing up in different form, or there's something Like a like a almost like a rule or a principle. Does it ever come about? Because in science, we think of this as, like, this is reveals something about our limitation To abstract the world. I hope I made that clear.[0:50:55] Rick Rubin: Not exactly, but I have a thought. It looks, you talked Earlier about the, the drop of oil the photograph of the drop of oil and the photograph of orb, We could use, on the other side, like, Hubble telescope images of these these vast things and high high definition. What we see every day is as impressive as those things, but we're numb to them because we see them all the time. And if we were to look at drops of oil every day in in a microscope, a month from now, we would not we would not find wonder in that image. So it's sometimes, it's the novelty of Not seeing it from that perspective before.[0:51:43] Rick Rubin: That's really thrilling. You could and I could imagine, and this probably relates to the Rothko idea, Yeah. That you could see something from a particular angle and have this magical experience And then walk 3 feet to the side and see it from a different way, and it just evaporates. It only works It only triggers this thing in us, when we look at it just the right way. There was a paint an experiment I just heard about heard about the other day that that sounds fascinating, that A painting teacher recommended where instead of painting you know, having a model in the room and painting the model, That you have the model in the next room, and you go into the next room without your equipment.[0:52:35] Rick Rubin: You don't have your equipment. And you can study the model for as long as you want, and then you go into a different room where you can't see the model to paint the model instead of And it it's it changes your relationship where it's not we're not just painting the lines. We're painting what is interesting enough about what I saw. What are the data points that stuck in my mind? And when I string those together, what do I get?[0:53:09] Rick Rubin: And and what do I how do I form it to get as close to whatever that the experience of that person was, which the close the closest of of getting to the experience of that person in the painting Might not look like a photograph. You know, it might look more different Then more the same to really see what you see. If we think about, the Picasso paintings that were inspired by African art where the eyes are on different different levels, They may give us more information than a photograph would give us. I'm thinking about the, when you were describing the the the sensation of when something takes breath away, and we all have that when we see a dramatic sunset. Anyone you know when there's a really dramatic sunset or if there's a whale And if anyone's on the beach and there's a whale, everybody's really interested that there's a whale.[0:54:23] Rick Rubin: It's do you know what I'm saying? The these feelings of wonder, we get to experience them depending on where we are Or, you know, a dragonfly or a bird flies into your space. These things happen. And when they happen, it's like we're we're, Confronted with the the mystery of the world when we change the perspective. Normally, we don't think of whales in our backyard or birds in our house, You know, flying freely, but but they do happen.[0:54:53] Rick Rubin: These things do happen, and they they, like, break us out of our trance When these things happen, like, oh, yeah. There are birds like this everywhere. I'm just not paying attention. This guy is coming in to, like, tap me on the shoulder. Like, remember me?[0:55:09] Rick Rubin: Here I am. You know?[0:55:11] Andrew Huberman: So I would say that that the whale example and what you're describing is it's revealing to us how in a delightful way, how deficient our perceptual filters normally are.[0:55:23] Rick Rubin: Yes.[0:55:23] Andrew Huberman: It's a little bit like the Roth Go is revealing how I've never thought about it this way until this moment. It's revealing to us how color normally looks is actually, First of all, not the only way it looks. Those colors we think are one way, but all color this gets into the biology of color vision is all about contrast. What something is next to dictates what it looks like.[0:55:43] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[0:55:43] Andrew Huberman: Then that's the origin of that dress meme or whatever you call it. I still can't figure out exactly what a meme is. Someone will eventually tell me. The in the same way, when you see a whale and it's delightful, I think it's revealing to us the extent to which those whales are. The ocean is vast.[0:56:00] Andrew Huberman: There's a whole universe there, and we are blind to it all the time. And I think the misperception or the misconception, excuse me, is That we're delighted because we see the whale. We might be just as delighted because we're getting hit with the contrast of how little we recognize all the time. And in that way, it reminds me a little bit about comedy where and I've I've been watching more comedy lately, and, Sometimes, it's the shock. Sometimes, it's the the absolute truth that's revealed.[0:56:32] Andrew Huberman: And then other times, What I've noticed and I saw Rogan do comedy at the Vulcan Club in Austin, which he does every once in a while, and it was Small club and and he was leading out the story during his routine or bit, I think, ish. Right? This bit, his and Everyone knew where it was going. We all knew. And then when he finally told us, it was exactly where we thought it was going, and it was hilarious.[0:57:03] Rick Rubin: And it felt good.[0:57:04] Andrew Huberman: And it felt amazing. And I and I thought in in that moment, I was like, wait a second. How did he pull that off? That was masterful because, normally, it's this thing, like, you create 1 story. There's, like, a scripting out, almost like a courtroom lawyer, and then they kinda pull the curtain, and it's something different.[0:57:18] Andrew Huberman: It's the and and if you look at the The science, the neuroscience, and brain imaging of of laughter and humor, which I've looked into. To be honest, and no disrespect to the people in that field, it's pretty lame. It's lame because it's always the the jarring nature of a surprise. But what he led us to was something that, Oh, no. He's actually going there.[0:57:39] Andrew Huberman: Oh, wait. He's really going there, and it was this anticipation with a with a beautiful delivery at the end. Mhmm. And so I'm convinced that based on what we're talking about here that there's something about when we see something, we think it's about that, but the the delight that we feel could be about all the other experiences that now become in a subconscious way kind of like it's almost like laughing at this perceptual deficit that we have. It's almost like laughing at how little we actually know, which is what you've said.[0:58:13] Rick Rubin: Yeah. It could it could be that it also could be the sense of community of When you think it's gonna go a particular way and it goes that way, it's like reinforcement of you. You know, so you it's like, yeah. We he's saying it, but in a way, we're saying it together. I'm listening.[0:58:35] Rick Rubin: He's saying it, but We're in this together, and that's a good feeling.[0:58:41] Andrew Huberman: To think about that for a second. I was trying to think about why certain music, still can evoke such powerful emotions in me. And and there does seem to be something special about the music we listen to when we are teenagers. You know, from about, You know, 14 until about 25. It seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way.[0:59:02] Andrew Huberman: Maybe because that phase of our life is is really one of identity crisis. I mean, you don't find too many 40 year olds, some, who are wondering, like, who they are.[0:59:12] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[0:59:12] Andrew Huberman: Occasionally. But almost every young teenager or preteen and sorta like, who am I? You're defining personality. So I always likened it to that. But Leaving out the the sort of critical period biology stuff, what do you think it is about the music that we hear at that time?[0:59:28] Andrew Huberman: Are we that much more emotionally tuned? Have we not Shut down our sensors quite as much. Is there the songs and the artists don't matter because they're very individual to me. Other for other people, it'll be the Beatles or something. Now I just really wish The Beatles did it for me too.[0:59:42] Andrew Huberman: But, do you think that's important? Because I could see how it's really terrific. I could also see how it sets up one of these, what I'll just use nerdy language to call the, like a semi deprived filter. Because if I'm only looking for the way that, Like, a stiff little fingers track made me feel the 1st time I listened to when I was 15. The feeling is worthwhile.[1:00:02] Andrew Huberman: But if I'm looking for that, I'm missing all the other stuff. I'm missing The Beatles. I'm missing Fleetwood Mac, which never did it for me either. I'm like, I'm missing all this stuff that, you know, people I love and respect Really love.[1:00:14] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[1:00:14] Andrew Huberman: So, I've never worried about it because there's kind of a infinite treasure trove of other things that I do love, But I do sometimes wonder whether or not my life experiences diminish because I'm not allowing, kinda range. And you've obviously worked in a huge number of different genres of music. Punk is one thing. Hip hop isn't I mean, Neil Diamond too. Right?[1:00:41] Andrew Huberman: Eminem too. Right? Slayer too. Right? And in some senses, I list these off.[1:00:46] Andrew Huberman: I mean, just think about how much in high school, Maybe nowadays less so, but even in college and as an adult, we societally, we're sort of asked to constrain ourselves to one of these groups. Like, I didn't know it was okay to love Bob Dylan and love punk rock as much as I do until I heard Tim Armstrong said he loved Bob Dylan. Yeah. And I was like, And recently, he told me he loves the Grateful Dead, and I was like, woah. Yeah.[1:01:12] Andrew Huberman: But to a I remember when you had to pick[1:01:15] Rick Rubin: Both the Ramones and the Clash loved the Beatles, we can Okay.[1:01:18] Andrew Huberman: I got work to do. My no. We'll we'll[1:01:20] Rick Rubin: do it together. Okay. It'll be So so I have a feeling part of it is The reason it gets in at that age is is at a time when we're defining who we are, and the music is Part of the definition of how we see ourselves. So it's the like, the music that we hear before that might be The music that's on the radio or our parents' music or our older brother or sister's music. And then when you're 14 or 15 and you start choosing what you're you're listening to, it's like, Now it's finally mine, and my parents might not like it.[1:01:53] Rick Rubin: And my elder brothers and sisters may or may not like it, but this one is mine. And It always it always has that impression in us that this is this is ours. It's my it's my thought of what of why it it, like, why it continues to last. You know?[1:02:16] Andrew Huberman: How do you wipe the slate clean Then, like so for instance, if you're gonna go in and work with somebody new and, again, as people are hearing this, I hope that they're transplanting this to whatever it is that they do. Because in the realm of science and Podcasting communication, it's not music, but, there's a contour and a a way you know, hopefully, this podcast will look nothing Like it does in 5 years. That's my hope is it will still have the core features of the beauty and utility of biology coming through, but I hope it doesn't look anything like episode 2.[1:02:46] Rick Rubin: Yeah. Right? And I think it'll evolve as you evolve. It's just the the truer it is To what interests you. And if you're not interested in biology in the same way in 5 years, I would hope it's not the same.[1:02:59] Andrew Huberman: I'll be doing psychoanalysis in real time here. We'll give therapy. We'll all be lying down on couches.[1:03:03] Rick Rubin: Whatever it is. Whatever it is.[1:03:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We probably won't be on psychedelics, but we might be levitating. You know? I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized Nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.[1:03:23] Andrew Huberman: I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work Done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based Interventions you might wanna take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com slash huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.[1:04:14] Andrew Huberman: So How do you let's talk a little bit, if you would, because I know it I'm very interested in, you know, like, your process. Right. I'll spare you the daily routine, question. It's very cliche. But you and I are both lovers of sunlight, of horizons, and not as a trivial source, as an amazing, gift of energy.[1:04:38] Andrew Huberman: Right? And and there aren't words for it, really. Aside from your daily routines, When it comes to, you know, somebody you're going from project to project and and you know you're gonna be doing work with somebody, Could be your own work, and we'll talk about the writing of this book, and its structure, which is very unique. I've never encountered a book with this kind of structure before. And it's the it's the most facile read ever, and yet every single page, I underlined, took note, starred, and, like, as you'd notice, it's very worn.[1:05:13] Andrew Huberman: Have Very, very worn already and only more so over time. Do you have a process for, you know, Removing the functions of the day and that what you were doing last week and what's going on and, in order to get More access to the this, I wanna think of it now more as as a receiver inside of you. Right? Almost like tuning a radio[1:05:38] Rick Rubin: Right.[1:05:39] Andrew Huberman: And then it comes in. Like, the beginning of, like, a strummer clash. Right? You love the radio. Joe, I love the radio.[1:05:44] Andrew Huberman: Right? The and then it comes in clear, And there it is. How do you clear the static? What what are some of the operational steps that you think might be more Generalizable to regardless of where some somebody in, you know, Africa is listening[1:06:03] Rick Rubin: to this now. Say when I'm when I engage in a Particular project, whatever it is, I I dedicate all of myself For that period of time, whatever it is, whether it be 20 minutes or whether it be 5 hours, whatever it is. Total focus and no, outside distraction whatsoever. And when I leave that process, I do my best not to think about it when I'm away from it. I don't bring any materials with me.[1:06:39] Rick Rubin: I don't leave the studio with works in progress and spend time listening to them during the day or looking for ideas. I I Stay as far away from it when I'm not directly engaging in it as possible. And in the best of situations, I have something else to totally engage myself in in between. So instead of working on project a For 5 hours and then leaving and doing nothing, I'm hoping to engage in a project b or b, c, and d with all of myself before going back to project a again, which might be the next day, let's say.[1:07:17] Andrew Huberman: So this, relates to an amazing, chapter and series of writings in your book that I'm not going to describe because I want people to find it for themselves about disengaging about disengaging from the process. One question I had as I read that chapter and as you're saying this now is even though you're disengaged, do you believe that your subconscious is working it through that[1:07:38] Rick Rubin: I believe so. I believe so. And I think in general, to stew over a problem is not the way to solve a problem. Think to hold the problems lightly. And and if and when I say a problem, you know, when we're When we're starting a project, there's usually this feeling of, there's a question mark at the beginning of every project.[1:08:03] Rick Rubin: I I I'm always anxious when I start a new project because I have no idea what's gonna happen. I never know. I never I never, I may have, In some cases, a potential backup plan if, you know, if nothing works. But I really try not even have that. It's I prefer not to have that.[1:08:26] Rick Rubin: I prefer to go in Maybe to calm myself down enough to be able to show up, there'll be an idea of, like, nothing works. Maybe we could try something like this, But that would only be for my own anxiety. That would be it wouldn't be for actual practical use. But there's always a sense of anxiety because I know Whatever's gonna happen is completely out of my control. Something's gonna something either interesting or not will appear, And then we're gonna follow that wherever it goes.[1:09:01] Rick Rubin: And until Something appears for us to follow. I have a lot of anxiety. Even though I know even though it has never not come, you know, it has come every time, but There's something about it because I also feel like there might be expectation on me that I'm gonna make it happen, and I know that's not happening. That's not how it works. It's it's, I show up ready for it to happen And I'm open to whatever we have to do to find that first thread.[1:09:40] Rick Rubin: And once we find the thread, then it's like, okay. We have a and it that thread may lead us to anything. You know, it could lead us to in a 1000000 different directions. But something about having that glimmer that it's not a black we're not looking at a blank page. You know, we're looking at okay.[1:09:57] Rick Rubin: We have, we have, the beginnings of, I would say a map, But it's a map that we don't know where it takes us, and it's just the beginning. It's just like it's just a you know, you are here. Was it Mhmm. If you have a map and it says you are here, even if you can't see the directions, knowing where we are feels okay. And once we get and usually, again, usually, in the 1st day, 1st couple of days, it happens.[1:10:36] Rick Rubin: But up until then, it's it's really an anxiety producing, situation. And then I can't I can't remember the original question. It's like, that was the beginning of Mhmm. Of something completely different. But I do you remember what you asked?[1:10:49] Rick Rubin: I don't remember.[1:10:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, we were talking about disengaging and is your subconscious into it and you're and then we were talking about, you know, so I love this. So, like, what are what is your process of of wading into this thing, and and you're revealing that now? I mean, I I think of anxiety as readiness. Know, I mean, think about the characteristic, features of anxiety.[1:11:11] Andrew Huberman: It tends to be a bit of a constriction of the the visual field into more of a narrow vision. That's appropriate because you ever want to shed the what's going on elsewhere. And then, you know, even when people talk about the shakes or this, Like, not feeling okay sitting still, anxiety was designed to mobilize us and not always to run away. This is one of the I could you know, Rarely do I talk about the work in my own laboratory, but one of the things that, frankly, I didn't discover, but it was done in my laboratory, but this brilliant Graduate student, Lindsay Saleh, who's now at Caltech, was that we can often observe animals or humans in very high states of anxiety as they move forward toward a goal. And we always think of moving forward as, like, this calm thing.[1:11:53] Andrew Huberman: You know? We these heroes, you know, Rosa Parks telling people, like, f u. Like, I'm not getting off the back. I'm not leaving the the giving up my seat on the bus or Mohammed Ali. I bet you they were experiencing tremendous anxiety, but it was in the forward tilt.[1:12:09] Andrew Huberman: And so I think anxiety is is least, comfortable when we are forcing ourselves to stand still. So it's a it's a activating energy. And, know, that brings up a word that, you know, I have written in my notebook as an extraction of a lot of themes from within the boat that you and I have talked about before, which is And here, I'm gonna sound very West Coast, woo, but I mean it as seriously as it can be Stated that I feel like everything is energetic. Right? We can do things from a place of anger.[1:12:44] Andrew Huberman: We can do things from a place of joy. We can do things from a place of delight. I'm, I like to think maturing into the idea that joy and delight and love is Kind of the ultimate reservoir of energy, but, you know, a lot of the music I liked from when I was younger was because of the anger that was thread into it Or, or the sadness.[1:13:05] Rick Rubin: But if you think of your relationship to that music, it's a relationship of love. You didn't listen to that to get angry. No. Listened to it because you loved it.[1:13:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I felt loved by it because it matched where I was at at the time.[1:13:19] Rick Rubin: It was true to who you were and where you were.[1:13:22] Andrew Huberman: I know that collaboration there's a wonderful chapter on collaboration, but but it's collaboration, as you mentioned before, with the universe, not with others. But in terms of the especially the kind of work that you've done and do, when it comes to working with artists, I do wonder. And here, I'm not looking for any, gossip or stories. It's I've never been interested in gossip. I love stories, but I'm not interested in gossip.[1:13:48] Andrew Huberman: But once you see that thread kinda dangling there and you're gonna yes. You're gonna go after this and or you grab onto it and you're, Okay. Now you have a little bit of a map and an orientation within that map. I often wonder you know, scientists are complicated people. People think they're very boring, but they're actually very complicated because they're often living in one limited rule set of the prefrontal cortex.[1:14:09] Andrew Huberman: That's how you get good at getting degrees This is by understanding the rules of academia and playing by those rules.[1:14:16] Rick Rubin: Yes.[1:14:17] Andrew Huberman: People tinker with the rules. You get your Richard Axles who are very playful in how they go about it, but they are systematic. He's known for rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? When I think of creative artists and musical artists, I think of A bit more zany or loose or you watch the documentary about the Ramones, and you're like, wow.[1:14:35] Andrew Huberman: There's all this chaos. How Because so many of the brilliant artists musical artists that are out there seem to have some chaos inside them or their lives aren't always structured, oftentimes And science too, by the way, there are substance abuse issues and personal life issues. How since you don't have 100% control, they need to play the instruments, sing, etcetera. How do you work with people who have it in them but are getting in their own way? Right?[1:15:10] Andrew Huberman: And do you think that that kind of the internal chaos that a lot of artists seem to have, do you think that sometimes is Actually, an essential piece of the creativity picture that you can't disentangle it.[1:15:23] Rick Rubin: Yeah. I don't think it's an essential piece in general, But certain artists, that's their that's how they do it. I would say I rarely get to see the chaotic Part of artists, for whatever reason, they they rarely show it to me. And most of them, like like most comedians I know, are much more serious about what they're doing than what it looks like from if you see them on stage. There's much more to it, and there's much more Focus on craft going on and digging deep than would necessarily be obvious Seeing him jump around on stage.[1:16:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm a fan of boxing, track and field and boxing, the sports nobody really cares about that UFC is so popular and and track and field is a it's a little bit like wrestling. When you go, the people that there are there because they really love it. We'll talk about wrestling in a little bit, professional wrestling. But, you know, Floyd Mayweather is obviously a colorful character and one of the Best records in boxing of all time.[1:16:28] Andrew Huberman: And a few years back, I got into watching his stuff, and and it it what one sees is the The cars and the money, they call literally call themselves the money team, you know, and the spending and the and and there's all the outrageous stuff, But I know someone who is in his in camp with him, who actually was a sparring partner for him, and The lore has it. They have very closed door, sparring, or clamps, but the lore is that he would do you know, because nowadays, it's 12 3 minute rounds, right, with a minute in between. Used to be 15, but now neuroscientists stepped in, and it turns out a lot of the deaths were occurring when it was more than 12 rounds. Wow. For whatever reason, you cut off at 12, Really seemed to truncate the death.[1:17:08] Andrew Huberman: There are other things too. If the dad is apparently a corner man we have someone else here at the podcast who knows more about this than me, but fascinating. Yeah. The kid not wanting to disappoint the parent. Correlated with death.[1:17:17] Andrew Huberman: There's and I'll get some of this wrong, and then and this they can come after me. But in any case, This guy who was in Floyd's camp said that he would do 30 to 60 minutes of sparring, bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest, that he would run 3 or 4 times per 24 hour cycle despite all the critical need for sleep, that his training was Unbelievably intense to the point where he would just just chew out chew up and destroy all training partners. And yet the perception that we see is it's kind of a it's playful for for him. So it sounds very similar. Like, what we see is often not what goes into it, that people are intensely rigorous.[1:17:59] Rick Rubin: Yeah. And I think in a way, from a psychological perspective, if you knew you were fighting someone who Wasn't taking it seriously, that would give you some confidence, and that would not be a good thing if you're if the person was actually, Working really hard, outworking you. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, it's from a psychological perspective that makes sense to me.[1:18:26] Andrew Huberman: So I keep coming back to is that I'm imagining in my mind, kind of, 2 ends of the continuum. 1 that is about fairly narrow focus, Training, training, strategy implementation, cultivating craft, building craft. And then the other side is this, the cloud. Yeah. It's very nebulous.[1:18:41] Andrew Huberman: Right? And it, there's this, word that I learned from a colleague of mine when I was down at the Salk Institute when my lab was there because he studies this. There's this phenomenon, that I don't wanna mispronounce because then it sounds like something else. But the correct pronunciation is pareidolia. And pareidolia is Our tendency to look at an amorphous shape like a cloud or a tree and think that it looks like something else, An ice cream cone.[1:19:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The man in the moon. Yep. And that again reveals the extent to which the brain wants to place symbolic filters on things. And we need this.[1:19:21] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because I see you walk in the door and, Rick, I I recognize you. In fact, we have a brain area called the fusiform face gyrus that Literally, it's a face recognition area. And you could be at any orientation, or I could just see your eyes and Know that it's you. There's a phenomenon called propostignosia where people can see faces.[1:19:40] Andrew Huberman: They can describe everything in the face, but they Don't know, for instance, that it's JFK or Madonna or Lex Fridman.[1:19:51] Rick Rubin: It's quite the list.[1:19:52] Andrew Huberman: Quite the list. There you go, Lex. Run for office, Lex. Just kidding. It's hard enough to get you to respond to my text as it is.[1:20:02] Andrew Huberman: So we have these filters, and so we're taking this cloud, and we're we're deciding what things are. Yes. And what I wanna go drill into your process a little bit, more deeply, when you approach A project. So everyone's meets each other, shakes hand. Here are the engineers.[1:20:19] Andrew Huberman: We're gonna sit down. We're everyone knows what they're doing because you work with professionals, and you start Going are you trying to be with the cloud or in the implementation? Like, where are you in that continuum? And forgive me if I'm, Like, trying to, surgically go into your process in a way that would disrupt it in any way. But I trust you've been doing this for a while, and there's no there's no threat[1:20:40] Rick Rubin: to that. I'm not at I'm I'm In the cloud with the exception of I'm aware of what could go wrong on a technical side, and I might, Like, if something good is happening, I might look over and make sure that we're rolling. So[1:20:58] Andrew Huberman: that's a leap over to here momentarily, but then you're back to[1:21:01] Rick Rubin: the point. I I maybe. If I if I feel like if I was In the moment, I would be in the cloud. And if something good starts happening, it would Trigger something in me like, uh-oh. I hope this is I hope we're really doing this because I don't know if we can ever do this again.[1:21:23] Rick Rubin: That'll that that would be a thought of when the 1st time the real world would come into the picture would be something good is happening. Let's not lose it.[1:21:36] Andrew Huberman: And when that happens, do you never been in a in a studio besides a podcast studio? Do you say, Hey, guys. That sounded good. More of that. Or do you wait?[1:21:47] Andrew Huberman: You let them continue? Because, obviously, you don't wanna break their their flow.[1:21:50] Rick Rubin: We'd never wanna break any flow once it's happening. Yeah. Once something's happening, just kinda sit back and watch.[1:21:57] Andrew Huberman: And do do you think there's resonance? Like, the the team of engineers and other people know when it, quote, unquote, is happening?[1:22:05] Rick Rubin: If everyone's paying attention, yes. When everyone's paying attention, it's usually pretty obvious. Sometimes the threat will be something different than expected, and maybe not everybody would pick up on it. And that might be a particular That might be particular based on my taste or an artist's taste or, someone involvement might say that was. Let's listen back.[1:22:27] Rick Rubin: I think that was better than what than we thought that can happen. I you you said several things, and, It was like you said enough for there to be several conversations.[1:22:38] Andrew Huberman: I tend to do that. Sorry. Especially with you. I don't get to see you as nearly as often as I would like. And so when I do, I confess that I'm a little bit of a kid in a candy shop.[1:22:47] Rick Rubin: Down, the brain tells us stories. So you talked about, I walk in certain data points. You recognize me, but it's a real like looking at a cloud shorthand. We go through we go through our lives doing this all day with everything we see. And the shorthand in the case of me, you know me, the shorthand turns out to be right.[1:23:13] Rick Rubin: It it it checks out. If it's something we don't know or something we're not familiar with, Something happens. We we we experience something on the street. Something happens, and It doesn't make sense. Something out of the ordinary happens.[1:23:33] Rick Rubin: First thing is is this doesn't make sense. Then what we do is, again, sub subconscious, unconsciously. I don't know if it's unconscious or subconsciously. Without thinking, We create a story that explains what just happened, a hypothetical that makes it okay That what just happened happened, and, oh, maybe he's running because his dog ran away and he's chasing his dog. Maybe that's why he's running.[1:24:04] Rick Rubin: And as soon as we have that thought of what it might be, we relax because now it's not just a guy running, and this is weird, but it's A guy running always probably running after his dog. And now we register that story that we just made up Without even knowing we were making it up as what happened. And then later in the day, if someone says, yeah. Do you see that guy running out of the box? Like, yeah.[1:24:31] Rick Rubin: He was chasing his dog. I saw that. And you you won't even realize that it was the maybe hypothetical story that was the first possible explanation That allowed you to continue walking. Do you know what I'm saying? That's our whole lives.[1:24:48] Rick Rubin: We our whole lives are reacting to things, Making up a story of what we think may have happened without realizing that's what we're doing, and then living the rest of our lives as if That thing that we made up really happened, and we never know.[1:25:05] Andrew Huberman: I completely agree. We confabulate From birth until death, there's this, well observed phenomenon, in people who have memory deficits. You know, so there's the sad example of this, and then there's the everyday typical nots who knows sad or not sad example. So for instance, if somebody has a slight memory deficit or someone has Alzheimer's dementia, they'll find themselves in the the hallway at night and say, what are you doing here? And they'll say, oh, you know, I was going to get a glass of water, but they're walking away from the direction that would make sense.[1:25:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. People who alcoholics who drink enough develop something called Korsakoff syndrome where a certain brain area Gets messed up, and you'll ask them a question like, oh, what are you doing here? And they will come up with incredible stories, sometimes interesting stories, that have no bearing on reality.[1:25:53] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[1:25:53] Andrew Huberman: You ask them who their name is[1:25:54] Rick Rubin: But do they believe they believe that's what happened.[1:25:57] Andrew Huberman: With 100% certainty. And this actually relates to a lot of the, now better understood controversy around repressed memories.[1:26:04] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[1:26:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You can especially from young people, you can pull Memories from them that of things that never happened. This has been demonstrated over and over again. So courtrooms know to be very cautious now about this whole notion of repressed memories.[1:26:16] Rick Rubin: That's good to know.[1:26:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Very, very, complicated area of the law as you can imagine, because we want we tend to want to trust victims for understandable reasons. But in terms of accuracy of details, 2 people have very different accounts of the same of the same experiences, and this has been shown over and over again. And Yes. Even that, you can do well in the laboratory.[1:26:37] Andrew Huberman: It's pretty interesting. So, again, because of these selective filtering and storytelling, And we are I think it was Salman Rushdie who said we are the storytelling species. He probably[1:26:46] Rick Rubin: Wow. I was gonna say we're storytelling machines, but that's great.[1:26:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think, you know, we are The story, I would say that the big five, if I had to pick up sort of brain function, is we are very limited filters. The mantis shrimp sees 67 shades of red for everyone that we see.[1:27:03] Rick Rubin: Yeah. So[1:27:04] Andrew Huberman: they have access to things we don't have access to. Yes. They're not, as far as I know, you know, releasing albums of the, you know, Red Hot Chili Peppers caliber, but who knows? Maybe down there they are. I did see something, by the way, as a relevant tangent recently, and I don't know if it's look.[1:27:20] Andrew Huberman: It if it even if it's crazy, it's super cool. If you take A device that amplifies the electrical signals coming from cactus, and you just translate that into a simple rule of conversion to 2 or 3 pitches of sound. The music that comes out of it is beautiful.[1:27:38] Rick Rubin: Wow. That's[1:27:38] Andrew Huberman: nice. Short of beautiful. And when I saw that, the the teenager in me thought, You know, when we hear whale song, we think it's so beautiful. Like, what if they're just, like, cursing at each other the whole time? Right?[1:27:48] Andrew Huberman: I mean, maybe they're in there like a like a Rogan episode when he invites all his comedian friends in there. Who knows? Maybe it's a psychoanalytic conversation about their childhood traumas. I don't know. Yes.[1:27:58] Andrew Huberman: But we decide whale song is beautiful. Yes. We decide cactus are just plants.[1:28:04] Rick Rubin: And it's beautiful to us. And and we're right that it is beautiful to us, but we are it doesn't mean we know anything about it.[1:28:11] Andrew Huberman: That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So we have these filters, perceptual filters. We only can see and hear, smell and taste what we can.[1:28:18] Andrew Huberman: And then the brain likes to work in symbols. We tend to like to match that person whose shoes are messed up must be homeless. I've had a couple instances in life where I saw what I thought was a homeless vagrant inside a building at an academic's institution. It turned out it was the most, accomplished person in the field. That's always cool.[1:28:42] Andrew Huberman: Yes. That happened at Berkeley. Then the other thing that we do is we tend to put, you know, symbol so we said perception, symbol representations, and then Our memories are entirely confabulated based on already deficient symbol and perceptual representation.[1:29:03] Rick Rubin: Yes.[1:29:03] Andrew Huberman: And so I never liked the statement that we don't know how the brain works.[1:29:06] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[1:29:06] Andrew Huberman: I think we do know how the brain works, but that it works through very limited filters. Yes. Okay. So knowing that and accepting it, and it seems to me that this idea of Looking to nature, looking outside us is so critical. And in fact, I I hope you won't mind me sharing this, but a few years back, I had sent you something by text, and I was kind of in disbelief about something I'd seen in the media.[1:29:35] Andrew Huberman: I was like, they got it all wrong, and I knew the person involved, and it was It was not a good situation for them, and I was like, they got it all wrong, and you wrote back. And you said, it's all lies. Back to nature, the only truth.[1:29:50] Rick Rubin: Wow. And That's wild.[1:29:52] Andrew Huberman: And I wrote that down. I put it over my desk. Wow. And I still you know, I'd, Tattoo it on my forehead if I didn't already have it well well committed to memory. But I think I know that's true.[1:30:05] Andrew Huberman: Like, nature, we can look at, and it's[1:30:07] Rick Rubin: But when when I say it's all lies, you just talked about our ability to how limited our facility to See and understand what we see. Yes? Yes. So based on that, that leads us to We can't know much. Do you know what I'm saying?[1:30:28] Rick Rubin: Our resolution is so low on everything that We're we're really just like we're grasping at straws. We have no idea. We have no idea, And there's great power in knowing that. Because if you think you know what's going on, chances are you're being deceived. Not because somebody's deceiving you, but because they're telling you what they see, and they don't know.[1:30:58] Rick Rubin: Mhmm. It's all do you know what I'm saying? It's all made up. Everything that we Everything we know is made up. Maybe maybe it's true.[1:31:07] Rick Rubin: This brings us to pro wrestling. It's it's it's the reason That pro wrestling is closer to reality than anything else we can watch or any other content. It's we know it's made up. We know that it's a performance. It's storytelling, and That's how everything is, except we think wrestling's fake, and the world is real.[1:31:35] Rick Rubin: Wrestling's real, and the world's fake.[1:31:37] Andrew Huberman: You talk about in the book, we're definitely going this direction. In the book, you talk about the op this notion of Entertaining the idea of the opposite being true Yeah. As it and and there's our not only emerging, but established fields of psychology that are making great Ground, I think, into the human psyche, Byron Katie's work, and others where you take a statement and you start playing with that statement for You poke at its authenticity.[1:32:03] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[1:32:04] Andrew Huberman: And when I first heard that, I thought, this is kinda hokey. Right? It's just words. And then I realized how foolish I was being because She's really on to something, and there are others too, of course. But in science, that's exactly what you do.[1:32:18] Andrew Huberman: You don't really ask questions In science, you are forced to raise hypotheses and try and say true or false. Now there are limitations to that approach, Certainly. I mean, pure observational studies have been incredible, in terms of what they've revealed to us, especially in medicine. You know, a patient that has a bullet hole a certain area of the brain, you don't go in and say, oh, I hypothesized that person will have a deficit in seeing faces. No.[1:32:43] Andrew Huberman: You the person wandered into the clinic, and they go, this person cannot see Sees faces but can't make sense of them, and then you you, reverse an you you forensically arrive at an understanding. So But in general, we we go about things in this way. And considering that the opposite might be true Well, that's a little bit, I I suppose, of, like, seeing the whale at the surface of the water. It's like well, the opposite of my experience, which is all above water For the most part, is maybe not the complete experience of life. Yeah.[1:33:17] Andrew Huberman: You start seeing the inverse all the time. So I wanna[1:33:20] Rick Rubin: Consider the inverse all the time, and it it really relates to the way that you you described how we see colors is based on contrast. So maybe blue's only blue in relation to yellow. So if blue is our choice, If we're not considering yellow, blue doesn't exist. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like We talk about night.[1:33:46] Rick Rubin: It's only night because there's day. If there was no day, there is no night. In in all of our cases, like, It's like the yin yang. You know? It's like it's we there's the the light and the shadow always.[1:34:00] Rick Rubin: There's always another side For everything, and we we focus on one aspect. But if we look at the other aspect, Chances are we'll learn something too. Mhmm.[1:34:13] Andrew Huberman: The the nervous system is not just able to do this. It's the way it does everything. Two experiments I'll just briefly describe. My scientific great grandparents, David Hubel and Torrance and Weasel, showed that if you force a person to look at something for a long period of time Without moving their eyes, there's a way that you can do this. The image disappears because normally your eyes are making little microsaccades, and you're comparing what you're seeing to what's right next to it.[1:34:38] Andrew Huberman: Pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel, Pixel by pixel.[1:34:39] Rick Rubin: Pixel by pixel.[1:34:40] Andrew Huberman: If we don't even have to use the example of pressing on the arm. We're sitting in chairs right now. And until I said, You know, what's going on at the level of sensation on the backs of your thighs? You are unaware of it because if you experience a pressure or a smell in a room, you ever walk in, the smell is either good or not good. Pretty soon, the smell disappears.[1:34:56] Rick Rubin: Yep.[1:34:56] Andrew Huberman: The neurons are still firing like sledgehammers on a on a bell, but we become blind and deaf to it Because the nervous system likes to habituate the value of that signal when it's there often, and it's only the stuff that goes comes through signal the noise that Kinda jolts us into, you know, attention and awareness, and I wanna return to attention awareness, which are, prominent themes in the book. And I think it In an important way, not just, oh, attention awareness is important, but you also give insight into how to pay better attention, how to Pay awareness with the understanding that people are gonna go about it differently. But I do wanna ask you about wrestling. Because when I was growing up, I was not I live south of the Cow Palace, and there was some wrestling going on there. I think back then, it was WWF.[1:35:48] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. There was a short stint in my childhood where I paid attention to, in particular, was it Coco beware, the guy that had a macaw? I was obsessed with tropical birds, and he would come in and he put his tropical bird on thing. And then who's the George the animal steal, the guy that would eat the ring. Yeah.[1:36:05] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So, and[1:36:08] Rick Rubin: I believe he was a professor. Serious seriously. Seriously. Was he real? In real life[1:36:13] Andrew Huberman: Amazing.[1:36:14] Rick Rubin: He was a professor, but he played Georgie Animal Steele as a wrestler.[1:36:17] Andrew Huberman: And I loved the movie, the rest the wrestlers.[1:36:21] Rick Rubin: Darren Aronofsky movie.[1:36:22] Andrew Huberman: It was, Mickey Roy. Yeah. One of the reasons I liked it is I once visited, Asbury Park. Is that where that was filmed? There's a there's a Vacant, he goes to visit his daughter.[1:36:34] Andrew Huberman: There's a vacant, amusement park or abandoned amusement park scene there that was really eerie. Still kinda haunts me a little bit. There's something about the East Coast In in kind of fall, all the places that people normally go for just for the summer Yeah. That we don't have out here in the West Coast. People in the East Coast are just tougher than than we are.[1:36:52] Andrew Huberman: It still haunts me. Great movie. But I remember watching wrestling, and It was at that age, I think I was probably about 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, where, you know, you're Kinda entering puberty. So and I I you know, puberty is a fundamental landmark of of development. It's the most rapid period of aging.[1:37:15] Andrew Huberman: It's also when we start to change our rule set. Like, certain people in certain kinds of interactions take on profoundly different meaning. Right? It's not just a reproductive competence time and when kids chain their bodies change. The rule book changes fundamentally.[1:37:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:37:33] Rick Rubin: Our understanding of the world changes in that moment.[1:37:35] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I mean, the moment that a child understands really what sex is Yeah. And kinda how they got there and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world is is kind of passively or not so passively being sent through that filter. It's like It's it's it's something. It changes the the rule the the rule book of perception.[1:37:54] Andrew Huberman: I view this age, from about 11 to 13, at least for me, was a unique transition point where the Gap between what I perceived as reality and fiction was kind of blurry. This is captured pretty well in that movie stand by me where they're hanging around the campfire at night, and the kid says, Who do you think would win in a fight between Superman and mighty mouse? And the other kid says like, you idiot. Like, mighty mouse is a cartoon. Of course, Superman would win.[1:38:24] Andrew Huberman: Right? And, like, to me, that's being 11a half or 12 years old where Your understanding of reality as you know it is changing, but it's not completely crystallized into an adult form reality.[1:38:37] Rick Rubin: That sounds like a really healthy place To be to me like that.[1:38:40] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:38:41] Rick Rubin: Not letting it crystallize. I think that's the, there's where the downfall happens.[1:38:47] Andrew Huberman: So I have questions specifically about wrestling, but it's really about process. Yeah. I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling because It allows you to access the energy state in your body and mind and that kind of mode of thinking in which reality as if one Conceives it as somewhat blurry, or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine? Is that the energy you're trying to export and bring to the creative process elsewhere to life? Is it that anything is possible or that we're dealing with archetypes.[1:39:25] Andrew Huberman: Because it doesn't matter if it's Coco beware or Randy Macho Man Savage or George the Animal Steel and the lovely Elizabeth. I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling. They're they are archetypes much like the Greek myths or the bible or[1:39:37] Rick Rubin: Yes.[1:39:38] Andrew Huberman: You know, no disrespect to the bible or the Greek myths or to wrestling for that matter. Archetypes are are a powerful filter for humans, but we know that they're a very limited filter too because people aren't built like Square wave functions. We have curves and contours and complexity. So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling?[1:40:00] Rick Rubin: I think it it maintains that kind of playfulness. Anything is possible. We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling, And it's and it's a way to have a kind of a feeling of the energy of a sport With with no competition. It's everyone is working together to put on the best show they can. So it's more like a ballet than it is like a a sporting event, and and there's great skill involved.[1:40:35] Rick Rubin: It's one of the few things that I can watch and really feel relaxed. It relaxes me. I don't feel like I have to think about it. I could just relax and enjoy[1:40:45] Andrew Huberman: it. This brings up a a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, which is this notion of dopamine schedules. I never wanna reduce everything to But dopamine is the universal currency of delight, pleasure, motivation seeking. There are other chemicals involved too, but there's a Beautiful experiment and a couple of examples that I'll use as a foundation to more questions about wrestling and why it's powerful and why other people May want to use wrestling or some other endeavor as a way to access creative energy and source. Earlier, we talked about, you know, you can train an animal to press a a lever 3 times and then get reward, and it will learn.[1:41:24] Andrew Huberman: Three is the magic number for reward, and then it can switch. Takes a little bit of training, and then they can switch. But they can't do prime numbers. They can't do high abstraction schedules. Humans either We're not very good at figuring out the rule set for optimal foraging.[1:41:40] Andrew Huberman: We do it well enough to persist as a species at least for now, But it's very likely that we are not tapping into that system as well as we could. And how would we know if we don't know? It's one of those you don't know what you don't knows. There's a beautiful experiment that explored when dopamine is released In the context of watching sport or watching comedy, believe it or not. And with the comedy stuff, it was every time there was a So it was kind of that jarring, like, and they'd measure people dopamine people's dopamine output.[1:42:11] Andrew Huberman: They were also brain imaging. In a game of basketball, It's a beautiful opportunity experimentally because every time 1 team gets the ball or shooting free throws or something, they're going down court, and it's either gonna end up in the basket or it's not. Might end up on the free throw line, but it's never not. So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation was every time there was a switch of which team got it. So you're waiting, waiting, and then it's, you're waiting, waiting.[1:42:37] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Waiting, waiting, 3 pointer. Oh, awesome. And if something happened where it looked like they were Gonna make the 3 pointer, but then somebody basically swatted the ball away and then went for a half court shot. Like, you don't that very often, bigger dopamine release.[1:42:52] Andrew Huberman: Okay? So that's kinda how the dopamine thing works. When you describe wrestling, I wonder it Because you don't know the script, it's not 1 team gets it, then the other team gets it. You don't know who's gonna win. Anything could happen is what you said.[1:43:06] Andrew Huberman: Yes. The availability of that dopamine surge or drip, which is a powerful thing, is completely It's completely out of your reach in in terms of anticipation. You don't know when it's gonna come, but it must arrive often enough that you return to it 11 hours a week of watching. In many ways, the way I'm starting to conceptualize the creative process is a little bit the same. You don't know where those nuggets of gold and those loose threads are, but you have enough experience.[1:43:39] Andrew Huberman: And in this case, I am referring to you, specifically, to know that they're in there. The people walking in this room have a certain level of ability and talent to to create that The map will form itself as we are going through the voyage, and those nuggets of here, I'm calling them dopamine, but they're they are Out there, and that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again and again to trust the process. Mhmm. So I actually think, the way you describe, wrestling as you know, it's the energy of the sport. It's not the whether or not it's this move or that move or who wins or who loses.[1:44:18] Andrew Huberman: It's the energy, and I'm guessing it's the energy that it creates in you as an observer.[1:44:25] Rick Rubin: Yes. It's the energy it creates in me and The reality that it's honest in what it is in a world where Seemingly nothing is honest at at what it is. And, again, not not not because people are lying all the time. We have little data. We make up a story to explain it, and then we say that's what happened.[1:44:49] Rick Rubin: And And we have, trusted sources who do exactly what I just described and who Pass this down as gospel of what what we teach, and we're and maybe it's true and maybe it's not. With wrestling, we know maybe it's true, maybe it's not. We lean towards it not being true. But what's really interesting about wrestling and maybe one of the most fun things about it is that sometimes real life works its way into the story. Like, rest 2 wrestlers get married.[1:45:28] Rick Rubin: Now[1:45:29] Andrew Huberman: In real life.[1:45:30] Rick Rubin: Well, we don't know. It's like that. You never know. It's like In the storyline, they're getting married or getting divorced or best friends turn on each other. And it could be part of the story, and it could really be happening because they do write someone gets someone breaks their leg.[1:45:51] Rick Rubin: So they're out because their leg is broken. Did they break their leg? We don't know. They're out. Do you know what I'm saying?[1:45:58] Rick Rubin: The We're told they broke their legs, so there's always this, like, I wonder what's true. You know, I want I wonder where the line is. We know that it's scripted or and or predetermined. That's how they say. It's predetermined, But we don't know where reality is and isn't.[1:46:20] Rick Rubin: And in some ways, That's our real experience of the world is this we don't really know where reality is and isn't. We have an idea, maybe. I think in some ways, wrestling's more honest or legitimate because we start with the idea that it's, that it's fixed. When we go to a boxing match, we don't go to a boxing match thinking it's fixed, yet it might be. And historically, it's happened.[1:46:50] Rick Rubin: You know? Or there was just something in baseball where, was it baseball?[1:46:54] Andrew Huberman: I don't follow baseball. I should know.[1:46:56] Rick Rubin: There was just there was just a big, sports,[1:47:02] Andrew Huberman: one of the[1:47:02] Rick Rubin: one of the teams that that[1:47:04] Andrew Huberman: plays, basically. Yes. So they was it the call signals of the Yes. Of the catcher?[1:47:08] Rick Rubin: Yes.[1:47:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They were they were you're not supposed to deprogram the or deconstruct the call the call signals of the Other team, and I guess maybe some a team got caught doing that.[1:47:19] Rick Rubin: Yes. And the team that won whatever the, you know, world series was. So it's like with wrestling, you don't that that wouldn't be a scandal. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like[1:47:30] Andrew Huberman: because that almost anything goes.[1:47:32] Rick Rubin: Anything goes, And that's what the world is really like. So in some ways, it's comforting, and there's still this mystery of like, wow. I wonder if that's true or not Because we never really know. Someone gets hurt. Did they really break their back, or are they just going on vacation?[1:47:48] Rick Rubin: We don't know. We'll never know. Fascinating.[1:47:51] Andrew Huberman: It is fascinating. And I feel like there are certain people who show up in a way that is surprising in in not just one direction, but in all directions. Like it's one thing for a celebrity to come out and make a statement that can be interesting or not interesting depending on the celebrity and the statement and the delivery. But and I'm probably gonna get this wrong because I'm terrible at pop culture things, most of them anyway. But as I recall, you know, Lady Gaga showed up to some event wearing an outfit made of meat, and I can't tell you for the life of me whether or not that was Statement against meat or for meat.[1:48:26] Andrew Huberman: Maybe it was a statement for the carnivore diet. Maybe it was a statement for veganism. I don't know.[1:48:30] Rick Rubin: Yeah. Either way. Or maybe neither.[1:48:32] Andrew Huberman: Or maybe neither. But it was definitely a statement in that it broke with the norm. Mhmm. And it said to me, okay. She Creates different rules for herself or sort of breaks boundaries that other people had I never heard of anyone doing that before.[1:48:50] Andrew Huberman: So doesn't mean they hadn't, but I never heard of anyone doing it before. But we do tend to associate, you know, Outside the current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless it crosses a line, in which case It becomes something else. It becomes almost theater for sake of theater. But what you're telling me is that within the realm of wrestling, theater is the goal at some level, And everybody knows it who goes into those arenas who watches it.[1:49:20] Rick Rubin: Yes.[1:49:21] Andrew Huberman: Everybody.[1:49:22] Rick Rubin: Yes.[1:49:23] Andrew Huberman: And everyone agrees to kind of suspend Outside reality and say, this is reality.[1:49:29] Rick Rubin: Yes. And they boo for the bad guys and cheer for the good guys knowing that backstage, they're probably friends.[1:49:36] Andrew Huberman: Except for the kids that are 11 who think it's really real.[1:49:39] Rick Rubin: I don't know. I don't even know if they know. I'm not sure.[1:49:42] Andrew Huberman: The only other person I know who, has Vocalize their love of of rest professional wrestling, to the extent that you have is, Lars Fredericksen, the rhythm guitar player for Rancet who, like, loves wrestling. But his Statement and forgive me, Lars, while I'm getting this wrong, is that because he grew up in an area of the South Bay where, like, there were no teams. Now there's the San Jose earthquakes, but there was no football team in San Jose. He's from Campbell. But there were there were no, like, good teams, no sports teams, but they had wrestling.[1:50:11] Andrew Huberman: And he had it where? On the television set. And so if you didn't have a like, I didn't grow up with any organized sports thing. The 40 niners were up the road, but for me, it was skateboarding, and I love it for the same reason. You actually never really know what's gonna happen.[1:50:27] Andrew Huberman: There is no rule book. The rule book is made up.[1:50:30] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[1:50:31] Andrew Huberman: But they are very, it's a unique sport in that surfing's a bit like this too In that, they are absolutely maniacal about making things look a certain way. It's not about just doing it. It's about doing it and making it look Good. Yeah. Smooth catching it with the front foot.[1:50:49] Andrew Huberman: You know? And then the the trends change.[1:50:51] Rick Rubin: Styles. There's It's a style.[1:50:53] Andrew Huberman: Style is and it that style is this, like, nebulous thing of, like, you know, in fashion or[1:50:58] Rick Rubin: in sport.[1:50:58] Andrew Huberman: Right? Whereas with a football, there's some amazing Catches, there's even, like, the catch, which I happen to know is a is a 4 you know, the catch during the Super Bowl. But in general, it's like the goal is getting the end zone, win the game. And I'm sure football players are, like, cringing as I say this, but it doesn't matter if you run ugly if you run fastest. In skateboarding, that would never fly.[1:51:19] Andrew Huberman: In fact, you'll basically be, ridiculed out of the sport. Mhmm. In wrestling, is it the same? Are there is there style to wrestling?[1:51:27] Rick Rubin: It's all it's all performance. It's all the charisma of the people involved. There's the the physical ability, The ability to talk and tell a story and the, how charismatic the performers are, whether you wanna watch them, whether you wanna see them win, when you wanna see them lose and whether you're interested in cheering or booing for them. I was[1:51:50] Andrew Huberman: gonna say it reminds me of opera, But operas get released over and over again. You know the story and how it ends when you walk in if you've listened to it before.[1:52:01] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[1:52:01] Andrew Huberman: So wrestling does seem to be unique in that way. It's real time iteration, at least from the perspective of the,[1:52:08] Rick Rubin: And and it's real time iteration based on because people get hurt all the time. They're doing really crazy physical stuff. So If someone gets hurt, the story has to change because in real life, they can't show up next week and do what was planned in the script. So it's It's very alive, and there's a a lot of Something interesting and unexpected is always happening.[1:52:37] Andrew Huberman: Well, in a much more, calm form, I'll I'll share with you something. I just like your perspective on it. For years, I I used a tool In order to try and access ideas, since I was a little kid, actually, because I I have a little bit of OCD, a little bit of a Tourette's. When I get tired, I'll do that. Like, very, like, strategy implementation oriented.[1:53:03] Andrew Huberman: I had that when I was a little little kid, I need all my stuffed arranged in a certain way. Legos had to be, you know, all neurotic, you know, or a lot. Yeah. And then science is very much about you have to do things with a lot of precision. And I discovered that the ultimate reset for me when I was in graduate school or a postdoc, if I couldn't make it to a really good, Like, agnostic front show or like chaos.[1:53:24] Andrew Huberman: Like, the chaos of a punk rock show for me was a kind of this reset. I was like, could, like, release all this thing, and I got energy from it. 1st time I saw transplants play and, you know, it's like, because you don't know what's gonna happen. And it was scary, and I loved it. The other thing that I used over time to kind of reset this ability to to think in a structured way without it feeling like it was overcoming me, maybe even access the same thing in some ways that you're accessing with wrestling was I like to stare at aquaria.[1:53:52] Andrew Huberman: Like, I like to go to aquariums or I'd build aquariums, and I would just sit there because you never know which way the fish are go. You think it's going that way, but then all of a sudden, they'll turn and go the other way. It's completely unpredictable. And I love aquaria because of the tranquility and[1:54:05] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[1:54:05] Andrew Huberman: Had them in my lab for a long time. I just adore aquariums because of the nonlinearity of it. Mhmm. It's not a, b, c. It's a z z EQ.[1:54:17] Andrew Huberman: You know? And I think this is what some people try and access through psychedelics, but that didn't seem to me like a very good way to do it on a regular basis. Whereas with Aquaria, you just the tanks are there. So in your book, you talk about something that, I also share a love for, which is how, You know, the the ocean and aspects of nature like clouds and ocean, they have a predictability to them. We know where they are and where to find them.[1:54:45] Andrew Huberman: Fortunately, the sun rises and sets every day, at least for now, and We can count on them with a 100% reliability, and yet they are from the perspective of, like, what physicists would say, they're very chaotic. They You can't look at a wave and know exactly how the foam is gonna roll out. You know it's gonna roll in and roll out. We have the tides. But when I hear about wrestling, I think about my love of aquaria, when think about my love of punk rock music, for instance, or I think about the ocean, I think in that way that We actually have a need to source from things that have both a combination of structure and no structure.[1:55:25] Rick Rubin: I think it's interesting that there are some places that don't change, and some places that change a lot. And I can remember Thinking about this, I was walking. There's a beach that I walk on in in Hawaii that I walk on every morning when I'm there. And If you walk on the same beach every day, you kinda get a sense of what it's like. And I remember I I was in Hawaii, walked on the beach every day for a year, however long it was.[1:55:50] Rick Rubin: And then I left for 6 months, and I came back. And the next time I walked on the beach, it was an entirely different beach, entirely different. And and I remember thinking in that moment, it's like, this is an unusual place because I pictured, The house that I didn't even grow up in the the house I was, I lived in maybe for the first 7 years of my life, and I think about what the backyard looked like, and I think about a particular old tree that was there. And I don't know this for sure, but my sense is if I were to go back to where I grew up and go to that place And look in that yard, it would probably look pretty similar. Yet here was this beach that I was walking on in Hawaii That in the course of 6 months, completely changed its face and just how interesting both of those things are.[1:56:48] Rick Rubin: Meant depending on the project we're working on, to be able to go to a place that we know has the potential to change a lot and what that would do to our, To our, connection with the earth when we're when we're experiencing that versus go to going to a place that Has very little change, and you can kinda count on it being the way it's always been. That both of those are interesting things to be able to draw upon Depending on what we wanna open in our in our psyche.[1:57:22] Andrew Huberman: I have an almost Unhealthy fascination with New York in the mid eighties nineties, and,[1:57:29] Rick Rubin: I mean live there, though?[1:57:31] Andrew Huberman: No. But I since I was a kid, I went there when I was a little kid, and I was fascinated by it. There's also a very interesting migration of East Coast to West Coast Creatives, including yourself that is it played an important part of my life just seeing things and hearing things that were meaningful to me. But I like, for instance, I love the movie. I haven't seen the documentary, but the one about Jean Michel Basquiat Basquiat because of the characters that are in it and the huge number of people in that, like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Wall and on and on.[1:58:00] Andrew Huberman: Those images of New York at that time are so exciting in what was happening. I wish I could transplant myself to that. If I had a time machine, that's where I'd land first. I hear a lot of people say, you know, New York isn't what it used to be. Francisco isn't what it used to be.[1:58:15] Andrew Huberman: Whatever. LA isn't what there does seem to be something that feels a little bit disruptive to people about cities changing, But the idea that natural landscapes change is actually we even accept like, hey. Fires sweep through places, and assuming they weren't started by humans, We accept that that change and the reordering of landscapes is normal and healthy. And I always tell myself, yeah, the kids growing up in New York or San Francisco or Cargo now, they only know it that way. So to them, it's as cooler, as uncool as it's ever gonna be.[1:58:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right? They either wanna get out or they're loving every piece of it. Mhmm. And this happened for all the people that came before us.[1:58:53] Andrew Huberman: So my question is a very basic one. Do you miss the New York that you came up in are you somebody who is attached to the past?[1:59:01] Rick Rubin: I'm not attached at all. I'm not attached to anything in the past. I don't look back at all.[1:59:06] Andrew Huberman: Don't think about, like, oh, in my dorm room at NYU, Beastie Boys, this. Like, I miss no. Your your optics are forward. Present and forward.[1:59:14] Rick Rubin: Only only present and forward.[1:59:18] Andrew Huberman: Is there a process to that, or it just happens to be where you default to?[1:59:22] Rick Rubin: I don't know. I'm not sure, but that's that's how I do it.[1:59:25] Andrew Huberman: Nostalgia is not you in Rick Rubin's brain. No. Oh, lucky you, man.[1:59:31] Rick Rubin: No.[1:59:32] Andrew Huberman: I say that with with with genuine, like, admiration. So you can hear a song that maybe you had a a role in producing or not, something from the past, and you're accessing a state, presumably, but you're not pining for wishing how it was.[1:59:52] Rick Rubin: Never.[1:59:54] Andrew Huberman: I'm no psychologist, But I'm gonna venture to say that I think that's a very unique quality. I think a lot of people wish for or wish that things did not happen the way they did, that there's a lot of living in the past. There's a lot of this notion of, like, people future trip. Yeah. I don't actually think that's the default state of the brain.[2:00:15] Andrew Huberman: I think a lot of people live in emotional anchors to the past, good and bad.[2:00:19] Rick Rubin: Yeah. I I have none.[2:00:22] Andrew Huberman: And watching wrestling is one way that you cleanse the palate. Yeah. Like, when you It's true.[2:00:28] Rick Rubin: You know, when you[2:00:28] Andrew Huberman: go to a meal and you're they pass around this that They do the same more, but pass around a little bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate. Turns out there's a a biological reason for that. There's a kind of neutralization of the taste There's between savory and sweet, etcetera. So if wrestling is your new a palate neutralizing[2:00:44] Rick Rubin: if I watch wrestling before I go to sleep, it's gonna be a good night's sleep.[2:00:49] Andrew Huberman: Do you dream about wrestling?[2:00:50] Rick Rubin: No. Never. But it's but it's it's just relaxing. It's, It's just relaxing.[2:00:59] Andrew Huberman: Do you anticipate when you watch it? Like, here comes the dopamine hit.[2:01:03] Rick Rubin: Sometimes. Sometimes when it happens, it's exciting. Pointer. Yeah. Sometimes it's exciting.[2:01:09] Andrew Huberman: But do you enjoy[2:01:10] Rick Rubin: when Even men, it's like the stakes are low. It's like, I don't really care what happens, which feels good. You know that, I'm just being entertained.[2:01:20] Andrew Huberman: Do they actually get hurt sometimes? You said they do.[2:01:23] Rick Rubin: A lot. Often, they're do I mean, they're basically stuntmen. So imagine stuntmen getting hurt doing a crazy stunt. It happens all the time.[2:01:30] Andrew Huberman: Well, in the movie the wrestler, I remember he got Staple stapled into them, and I thought that's pretty intense. I once went and saw, I guess they called it Mexican wrestling. I don't know if they call it that anymore, where where the guys dipped their[2:01:40] Rick Rubin: hands debris.[2:01:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They dipped their hands in glass. This was in Sacramento, and I went on I honestly didn't have a stomach for it. I really didn't.[2:01:47] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[2:01:47] Andrew Huberman: I couldn't believe it was legal. It might not have been legal.[2:01:50] Rick Rubin: Yeah. But I thought There's crazy stuff in wrestling sometimes. Wow.[2:01:56] Andrew Huberman: So before sleep, is that typically when you watch wrestling?[2:01:59] Rick Rubin: Yes.[2:02:01] Andrew Huberman: Do you think it's useful for people to have some activity that allows them to kind of, clear their mind in a in a and create peace before heading off to sleep?[2:02:10] Rick Rubin: I think and I think yoga nidraj would be a good like, it's like yoga nidra, pro wrestling, any of the, Mhmm. Yeah. Any of those type of things.[2:02:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Not watching the Dalmer thing. I won't watch That I I,[2:02:21] Rick Rubin: I don't watch any horror, any anything, or I don't like violent things.[2:02:26] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I know it exists. I know horrible things happen in the world, but I certainly don't wanna do that before sleep. I think these liminal states before and emerging from sleep are very powerful. When you wake up in the morning, are your thoughts immediately structured, or do you enjoy the kind of clearing of the clouds?[2:02:44] Rick Rubin: It's a It's a slow process for me to wake up, and I like that. I like not engaging too much too soon. I also, another I usually fall asleep listening to a lecture or, something speaking because that if I'm if I don't, I can get caught in my own thoughts, and listening to something is enough of a focus point that it stops me from talking to myself.[2:03:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Do the same. My grandfather listened to the radio, to, sports on the radio, and he would fall asleep. Oftentimes, he was a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth. His wife's responsibility was to stay up later than he did and make sure he didn't burn everything down.[2:03:32] Andrew Huberman: And then when you wake up, you said it's a slow process. Is it an hour or 2 before you feel like you're[2:03:39] Rick Rubin: I would say probably an hour. I usually wake up and try to get in the sun as soon as I possibly can and hope to spend Hope to spend about an hour, and then I'll usually go for a walk on the beach, for another hour or 90 minutes depending.[2:03:57] Andrew Huberman: Are you with family members and other people at the time?[2:04:00] Rick Rubin: I'm usually focused by myself. Phone? I'll be listening to something. I don't look at the phone, but I listen I listen to, again, a lecture or podcast or audiobook. I like audiobooks a lot.[2:04:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I do too. If an idea comes to mind, do you write it down?[2:04:18] Rick Rubin: I may. It depends. I like to. I usually, Haven't would do a note in my phone. Mhmm.[2:04:26] Rick Rubin: I don't usually carry pen and paper with me when I when I'm walking.[2:04:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I do the same. I do a long Sunday hike or jog, and I I will audio script into my phone. People sometimes give me funny looks because I'm talking to myself, and I[2:04:38] Rick Rubin: That's a nice way to do it, though. I I I'd like to learn more of the Audio methods of doing it instead of the typing methods. Right now, I type, and I I don't think it's the best way.[2:04:48] Andrew Huberman: The voice memos function in, the iPhone and other phones is really good, and they're now, companies like rev.com that will turn those into Word doc scripts Great. That are fairly well, corrected.[2:05:03] Rick Rubin: Great.[2:05:05] Andrew Huberman: Fairly inexpensive. No. They're not a sponsor of the podcast. I just happen to use it. It's great.[2:05:09] Andrew Huberman: I actually learned that trick from Richard Axle, the Nicorette chewing Mhmm. Wild man, Nobel Prize winner. He writes manuscripts, and by walking around his office pacing and talking into his phone[2:05:23] Rick Rubin: I always of the, Woody Allen movie where the, Alan Alda character is[2:05:30] Andrew Huberman: With this[2:05:31] Rick Rubin: You know, talking about yeah. He's he's Speaking comedy ideas into the phone, it's really pretentious. Yeah.[2:05:37] Andrew Huberman: I liked that movie about Harvey Milk.[2:05:39] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[2:05:40] Andrew Huberman: That Sean Penn played Harvey Milk, because that all took place before Before I was alive, mostly in the Bay Area, but there's this these beautiful scenes of him, as I recall, sitting there at his kitchen table talking into a tape recorder at night, Talking about how he predicted that he would be possibly assassinated, etcetera. And this goes back to the strummer thing about writing things down. I You know, I think that a lot of people, including myself, feel a little bit of, like, egotistical guilt around, like, who am I to think that My ideas could be worthwhile or something, but, you know, I think over time, I've come to realize that the ideas about experiments or Health questions I have about health were the, they they don't always, but oftentimes can lead to real, know, seeds that grow into[2:06:24] Rick Rubin: the trees. That's interesting to you. It's it's it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. You know? Like, Most of my notes are not for anyone else's Right.[2:06:34] Rick Rubin: You know, for anyone else's use. Like, I I hear about something that's interesting to me and I think about, okay, I wanna learn more about this, Whatever it is. And then sometimes those things work their way into things I'm doing because the universe seems to work in that way, but I rarely am Learning something with the idea of using it. I learn things with the idea of this is what I wanna know. This is what's interesting to me.[2:06:59] Rick Rubin: And then often those things that are interesting to me can find their way into other projects just Because they do. Mhmm.[2:07:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's almost like coal or kindling, but the moment that you think of it that way, it it sort of It sounds so extractive. Right? But if you so you you take this walk, and you're and you're, writing down the occasional Idea, perhaps. And then, what is the next sort of the way that here are less than do this, then this, then that.[2:07:31] Andrew Huberman: I'm interested in, like, where does your mind shift to? Does it become more structured as the day goes on? Does your thinking become, more structured around projects and plans?[2:07:39] Rick Rubin: I try to Deal with things that need dealing with after that and in preparation for going to work. And welcoming something good, welcoming something good, paying attention, and, maybe trying to will it to happen, but never, But knowing, I I don't have the ability to make it happen. I can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive.[2:08:16] Andrew Huberman: Some of the, more surprising and I I found really interesting and useful features of the book were about, so dancing with structure and lack of structure. So when I think of structure, I think of, like, deadlines. So when you are in the process of Creating something. Obviously, deadlines are relevant. Time of day.[2:08:40] Andrew Huberman: Right? There's only so many hours in the day where one can stay in the groove or this of, like, readiness to receive. Have you ever found yourself in that mode where you're kinda grinding. Like, like, here we are. Like, okay.[2:08:54] Andrew Huberman: I'm not coming home for dinner tonight. It's the next you know, we're gonna push. We're like, they put put on the coffee pot kinda thing.[2:09:00] Rick Rubin: A lot a lot in the over the course of my life a lot, not as much now. And one of the things that I discovered through working on the book was The phases of work, we're not required to treat the different phases of work in the same way. Whereas before, I did. Before, Everything was in this state of play. Everything had an, wide open time schedule.[2:09:31] Rick Rubin: It happens when it happens, and if it takes 2 years or 3 years, it doesn't matter. It's not about that. It's only about this thing has to be great. And what I came to realize in working on the book is that there there are different phases. And the first phase is this seed collecting phase, which is kind of an ongoing Part of life in general.[2:09:52] Rick Rubin: I do that I do that always whether I'm whether I'm working on something or not. I'm always in seed collecting phase, and there's no deadline or, just anything that interests me that I think I wanna learn more about or has potential to be something anything. Something I hear something, think, I'd like to read more about that, or I wonder if I wonder if there's a movie about that. Is there a movie about that? If not, maybe there's a movie to be made.[2:10:21] Rick Rubin: You know? I could again, I want this is something I want In my life, let's see if it exists. If it doesn't exist, then maybe that's something interesting to pursue. But I know that the desire is there because I have it. So in the seed phase, there's no deadlines.[2:10:36] Rick Rubin: It's just a wide open part. And then the next phase is called the experimentation phase where you we We start experimenting to see what the seeds wanna do. You're involved, but you're more of a, You're not really dictating the action. You're you're setting the stage for something to happen, But it's not about you yet. So it'd be like the equivalent of you'd plant the seed, you would water it, You would make sure it was in the sun, and you'd wait.[2:11:15] Rick Rubin: So you're involved, but you you can't make it grow. You know? And then when it sprouts and it grows and or if it turns into a plant, then you can look at the plants. Like, okay. How does this plant What's the potential of this plant?[2:11:31] Rick Rubin: And then you and then that the 3rd phase is the crafting phase where it's like, okay. I have this plant. Maybe I'm gonna trim it, Or maybe I'm gonna, combine it with these other plants to make some something else with it. Now it's like material that you have. And then finally is the The completion or or finishing phase, which is the final edit get getting to the version of it.[2:11:55] Rick Rubin: The the version of it, that's the one that you can share with the world if if that's something you're gonna do. And I've come to realize that by the time you're Going into the completion phase, you can have a deadline, and it won't hurt the project. In fact, it might help the project. And I didn't know that before. So I've worked on projects that have gone longer than they necessarily needed to And maybe not in the best interest of the project because I didn't know that.[2:12:25] Rick Rubin: I didn't understand that that the timing of that Because I because I am so aware of the necessity in the experimental phase To not have a deadline that I assume that that held through the whole project, And and they're not it's not a clear phase 1 finishes, and then you start phase 2, phase 2 finishes, and you start phase 3. You move back and forth between them. I'm collecting seeds all the time. I'm always in phase one. And then Probably to some degree, there's always some version of experimentation going on.[2:13:05] Rick Rubin: Maybe not now, but if something's on a list of things I wanna look at, hopefully, I'll get Get to the list and give them some experimentation and see what they can turn into. And then if they do turn into something, then they get to the crafting phase where it's more Okay. Now I have this thing. What do what do I know about this kind of thing? What can I match this with?[2:13:27] Rick Rubin: What can I use this for? How can I Be involved as a craftsman? And by the end of the crafting phase or deep into the crafting phase, You can start seeing the end. You know, you can start seeing an end, and then you can even dictate an end. But I recommend, if you do, just dictate it for you, not for anyone else.[2:13:48] Rick Rubin: If something comes up where you learn if if you, set a deadline, a public deadline, And then a new discovery happens along the way and you realize, oh, this could actually be much better than I thought, but I need more time. It's harder to do that if you set the deadline. So I would say have an internal deadline to get to finish it. That said, if an unusual situation comes up and it's better for everything not to meet that deadline, It's a it's a one of those rules that you set the rule to break it if it's what's best for the project. But that that was a new thing for me, and it it It helped me a lot.[2:14:30] Andrew Huberman: When did you realize that?[2:14:33] Rick Rubin: In collecting the material for the book and thinking about it, when I when I realized that it was phases. I didn't I didn't know any of this. When when I started writing the book, I didn't know any hardly any of the things in the book. They're more most of it would be reverse engineering something that I had experience A successful experience, using these methods without knowing they were methods, just following my instincts Got me to something good. And then I would look back at why did I wanna do that?[2:15:10] Rick Rubin: And is there a a principle at play that could be of use outside of this case? And How do I explain that? And that and that's what the book is. It's these reverse engineered principles that have led to, good decision making and trying to make things.[2:15:32] Andrew Huberman: The chapter on self doubt was really interesting to me. As we're all[2:15:37] Rick Rubin: Tell me what it says because I can't remember.[2:15:39] Andrew Huberman: Well, you know, I'll read the first sentence of it, which is that self doubt lives in all of us. And while you may wish it was gone, it is there to serve us. And it goes on to describe how to dance with self doubt In not so many words, I think, you know, there's a saying that, is actually from the landscape of psychology, which which is, generally discussed in, in a kind of pathological context, which is, if nothing matters, anything goes. This is usually the phrase used to describe people who feel as if, like, there's no use in living, so just go crazy, often to self destruct. But there's a light version of this, I realized, where, in some sense, the creative process seems to have something to do with, You know, if you're not paying attention to what outcomes are, like who likes it, who doesn't like it, and you're just doing it for you, you you make the the rule play, I wanna delight myself, Well, then anything goes, and you have an infinite rule set there to to extract from, at least initially.[2:16:47] Andrew Huberman: So As one gets better at their craft, you can imagine self doubt goes down. I think that's the perception of a lot of people. Right? You get better at what you're doing. You know, you can, land more 3 free throws as a basketball player.[2:17:02] Andrew Huberman: You can hit more home runs as a baseball player. You can produce more, you know, platinum albums as a as an artist. You you know, self confidence goes up, self doubt goes down. But I think you and I both know a number of people who are successful enough to know that oftentimes there's a mirror image that where people feel pressure because they did it once, now they gotta do it again.[2:17:22] Rick Rubin: Yes. Or that You think you're so good at it that it it comes easily, and you don't have to apply yourself.[2:17:34] Andrew Huberman: Arrogance.[2:17:35] Rick Rubin: Yeah. So self doubt is a it's like a It's a check on yourself. It can either be really helpful or it can undermine you. So it's something we all have. And if we let it undermine us, then we don't make anything.[2:17:53] Rick Rubin: That's not good. But when Used as a a balancing tool in our lives, it serves a great function where we really do. It's okay to have all the confidence in the world and still second guess, is this the best it can be? It it it you can doubt I think the the phrases in the book, you can doubt your way to a great work, you know, to a masterpiece. Sometimes that questioning allows you to push further than just accepting I made it so it's good.[2:18:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I've encountered more people that seem to be driven by, self doubt and the need to constantly Perform and perform again, then I have real arrogance. Just has been my experience, fortunately. I've met some arrogant people in my life, but, and, of course, we never as a psychiatrist, who I admire a lot and bioengineer, who was a guest on this podcast, Carl Deisseroth, said, you know, we We never really know how other people feel. I mean, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel.[2:19:03] Andrew Huberman: Again, language is a very deprived format for explaining feelings. So we think somebody feels one way, but we can observe and it could be another, but we observe their behavior. So in in the sense of Turning to the work, you know, just always returning to process. Sounds like your routine is fairly scripted at least now. But the things that you are getting in touch with, wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean, There's a predictability of them because you can access them in a predictable way, but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them.[2:19:37] Andrew Huberman: The ocean is completely unpredictable.[2:19:39] Rick Rubin: I I also listen to a lot of music that I don't know. So I listen to a lot of classical music And, less so, but some jazz and a lot of old music that I never heard before. And I like I like being surprised by music, and sometimes it really catches me off guard. Like, I'm I Shazam a lot, you know, when when I hear something I like.[2:20:09] Andrew Huberman: Have you ever encountered music that really works well live but just does not work in a recording. Or that is that much better live, but the recording is sort of meh. You don't have to name names.[2:20:21] Rick Rubin: Yeah. I don't think so. I feel like maybe there are some artists who are great live who've never captured it well on record. Example would probably be the Grateful Dead's good example of a band where I feel like their albums are not their strong point. But there, if you hear live recordings, they're really interesting and really different from each other.[2:20:42] Rick Rubin: And that's kinda part of what makes the Grateful Dead interesting is their Unpredictability.[2:20:48] Andrew Huberman: I confess, I I a sister who listened to the Grateful Dead and I got taken to a few shows when I was younger, and they would do that. What is it called? Space. It was like these Drum solos that would go on for hours and hours. This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows where songs are, like, 90 to a 120 seconds.[2:21:02] Andrew Huberman: And, like, You know? And I remember thinking like, what is this? What is this? But people I know who love the Grateful Dead Love that uncertainty about where the that drum thing. I think they do call it space.[2:21:17] Andrew Huberman: Forgive me dead heads. I'm not enough of 1 to get it right.[2:21:21] Rick Rubin: But they're looking for something. Mhmm. And sometimes they find it. Mhmm. And if you're there when they find it, it feels exciting because it's not just, it's not just following a script.[2:21:34] Rick Rubin: It's like something is really happening. It's a it's a real moment. It's, something that I I aim for in the studio is to create real moments that when you hear them, they don't necessarily sound perfect. They sound like something that really happened. And in that moment, something happened, and it's a special moment.[2:22:00] Rick Rubin: And You've you can feel that if they were to play it again, it wouldn't be like that. There's something really exciting about that. It's it's really what it's how jazz jazz works as well. And, I think some of bringing some of that jazz mentality into other types of music is is really interesting. It makes for Compelling things.[2:22:27] Rick Rubin: Because when you hear them, there's a certain amount of, you you you really have To pay attention to do it. When you're doing it, you're really paying attention. It's like, I don't really know. There's no music. There's no, you know, there's no, There's no map to follow, and now we're working together to make something.[2:22:50] Rick Rubin: Do I play or not play? When do I play? And you're really paying attention, and can I add or you go to start adding something and someone else added something, like, oh, I can't do that? And it's like everyone's just in this thing in this moment, experiencing this thing at once that you can feel as a listener, and we get to we get to hear their excitement of finding it, And it's thrilling when it happens. So I I I like that experience.[2:23:25] Rick Rubin: I feel like that's kinda what the dead do live. They'll play songs in different ways. And again, I don't know very much about the dead end. It's sort of a newer, it's newer for me to listen to the dead. Growing up, I never listened to the dead.[2:23:39] Rick Rubin: But probably because I heard songs on their albums and thought this doesn't really speak to me. But I think that the albums don't really reflect What's special about them?[2:23:49] Andrew Huberman: I think a lot of their shows were recorded, right, or videotaped.[2:23:52] Rick Rubin: Yes. So they show By by fans Yeah. Which they, supported. They supported that everybody come, everybody tape, everybody, you know, trade tapes. It made sense for who that band was.[2:24:04] Andrew Huberman: They redefined or they defined, excuse me, the notion of followers. I mean, people literally gave up their lives or spent much of their lives[2:24:12] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[2:24:12] Andrew Huberman: Literally driving from city to follow them.[2:24:15] Rick Rubin: Because it's not like going from city to city to watch a movie over and over because it's not a movie. It's different every night. It's changing.[2:24:26] Andrew Huberman: Pretty incredible phenomenon. I I don't know of anything else quite like it except cults, and and those often don't end well. I think a guy that, mixed the punch at the for the Jonestown massacre went to my high school. That was the Is[2:24:41] Rick Rubin: that true?[2:24:42] Andrew Huberman: I think so. Yeah. Amazing. My sister is really good at all this kind of, like, seventies, eighties, like, like, dark psychology trivia. Yeah.[2:24:51] Andrew Huberman: She's a very light person, but[2:24:52] Rick Rubin: Did you read, season of the witch? No. It's about San Francisco in the sixties. It's great. You'll love it.[2:24:58] Andrew Huberman: 1 Great book. I have to check it out. The way you describe, experiences going by in time and or or things emerging in time and the creative process being a way of sort of grab it catching capturing those moments, maybe Rearranging, maybe watering, etcetera, I thought was beautifully captured in the in the analogy you gave about A a kind of a convey a conveyor belt going by of things. Right? That we think of the creative process like it's gonna land in us Or we're gonna enter it or that we're gonna sit there in a chair and, like, grid our teeth.[2:25:36] Andrew Huberman: You know? There's, like, a some Hemingway quote, where you just sit there and stare at the page until the beads of blood on your forehead or something. Maybe it was him. Maybe it was I don't know. Sounds like Bukowski or something.[2:25:45] Andrew Huberman: Anyway, I'm gonna get this wrong. People tell me in the comments. Maybe no one said it. It was a dream, but I love this conveyor belt[2:25:54] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[2:25:55] Andrew Huberman: Thing. The that reminds me of being in laboratory, Doing experiments, thinking I was trying to solve one thing and then seeing something else and then having to make the decision, like, is that really cool enough to drop everything and go that direction or to Kind of spend a night or a week or a career going that way. I mean, these are kind of big decisions given that, at least as far as we know, we're we're gonna live a 100 years or less. And but this idea that we have, you know, thoughts and experiences in our past and we can draw on and, like, try to make good decisions, do we do we, like, grab these things off the conveyor or not. I'm hearing you, and I'm starting to realize that being attached to the past might be the worst thing that one could do in terms of being able to make good decisions in this context.[2:26:43] Andrew Huberman: Because if we have a kind of a playbook of what's worked and what hasn't worked, but you actually talk about this. There's a a passage in the book, you know, that I'll just read it. To be beware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it's the way you've done it before. I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes, which is not something I do very often. Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit.[2:27:10] Andrew Huberman: I mean, we want to have, you know, mechanisms and routines we can trust. Yeah. But This is, I think, an important warning.[2:27:19] Rick Rubin: Yeah. When when something works, it's easy To be fooled into believing that's the way to do it or that's the right way. It's just a way, and it's just a way that happened to work that time. And this plays into when You get, advice from people who have more experience than you. You explain your situation.[2:27:50] Rick Rubin: They tell you their advice. The advice that they're giving you is not based on Your life or your experience is based on their life and their experience, and the stories that they're telling are based on experiences they've had that are that have very different data points than yours. So maybe They're giving you good advice, but maybe they're giving you good advice for them and not giving you good advice for you. And It's it's easy when we try something and have a result, a positive result, thinking This is everybody can do this. You know, the way I I, was vegan for a long time, 22 years.[2:28:38] Rick Rubin: And then I started eating, I started eating animal protein And then eventually changed my changed my diet a few times to the point where I lost a lot of weight. The way that I did it worked for me. Right before that happened, I did, something that I was told that everyone else who did what you did, they all lost weight. For whatever reason, I didn't. So The idea that we know what's right for someone else, I I think it's hard enough to even figure out what's right for ourselves.[2:29:19] Rick Rubin: And If we do somehow crack the code of what's right for us, be happy we have it, and then still know, I wonder if that's the only way. Maybe there's an even better way that we're not considering. You know, like, not to get comfortable with thinking we know how it works Just because we get the outcome we want.[2:29:42] Andrew Huberman: I was raised in science with a principle. It was literally dictated to me as a principle, almost like a rule of religion, which was That the brain is plastic. It can change and learn until you're about 25, and then the critical periods end, and that's it. And this was A rule, essentially, it was dictated a Nobel Prize, which was very deserved given to my scientific great grandparents. They deserve it.[2:30:06] Andrew Huberman: But I was told there was no changing of brain structure function in any meaningful way after age 25 or so. Turns out that's completely wrong. Sorry, David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong.[2:30:21] Rick Rubin: Wow. Oh, yeah. Interesting.[2:30:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It was actively suppressed because of the competitive nature of prizes and discoveries at that time. And a guy named Mike Merzenich and his student, Greg Recanzone, we're showing that adult plasticity exists, and only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme. Right? Just crazy.[2:30:42] Andrew Huberman: Like, there were so many reasons, and the textbook said it. We were all told it, and it changed our behavior. Now we know this to be completely false. There's plasticity throughout the lifespan. There's limits to it here and there, but, like, it's just Far and away a different story.[2:30:58] Rick Rubin: So why would that be the the only time that ever happened?[2:31:01] Andrew Huberman: Right. Exactly. And and but the field was run by a very small cabal of people at that[2:31:07] Rick Rubin: All fields are run by a very small cabal of people who who have an investment in things being the way they are now Right. Because they're in charge.[2:31:15] Andrew Huberman: Right. And one of the great things about getting older is that, well, fortunately, everyone eventually ages. And I I hope that, you know, David, unfortunately, passed away. He was lovely. Torrington's lovely.[2:31:25] Andrew Huberman: He's still alive. And they would say I think Torsten would say, yeah. We should have been a little more open or kind in in allowing these other ideas. But I think that[2:31:35] Rick Rubin: But just think about all the years that were wasted with this Misunderstanding.[2:31:41] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. Absolutely. And and it went beyond that, and there were BBC specials that helped propagate this. And, you know, One of the goals of the podcast has been to try and shed shine light on ideas that at first seem crazy. Like, I know you and I are both, Semi obsessed with the health benefits of light.[2:31:59] Andrew Huberman: And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy. Sounds crazy. Right? Sounds like something you Only hear about it at Esalen or in Big Sur. Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood is based on really amazing work out of Columbia by a guy named Michael Turman.[2:32:15] Andrew Huberman: The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916, was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupus. Like, this idea that certain wavelengths of light can help Treat medical conditions is not a new idea, but somehow we see a red light. We're not used to seeing red lights except in sunsets and on stoplights, And somehow it bothers people or it makes them feel like[2:32:38] Rick Rubin: Well, it undermines a, a business model Mhmm. That doesn't take red light into consideration. Right.[2:32:47] Andrew Huberman: Until it does, and then it was and then it's Co opted there. And the place what I look to is acupuncture. You know, for a lot of years, people said, well, acupuncture, this is like no mechanism. No mechanism. New Mexico, there's a a lab at Harvard, a guy named Chufu Ma, who I know reasonably well, whose laboratory is dedicated to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms of acupuncture, and they are discovering What everyone has known for 1000 of years, which is that incredible effects on anti inflammation, the gut microbiome.[2:33:15] Andrew Huberman: So, I[2:33:16] Rick Rubin: have a friend who was having a terrible back problem, and I suggested that he see an acupuncturist. And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested, And his back problem completely healed almost instantaneously. And I asked him, do you know, have you been keeping up? Because he had another another flare up. He's like, no.[2:33:38] Rick Rubin: I I I can't go back there because acupuncture doesn't work. I said, well, You saw it work for you. It's like, yeah, but there's no science. Wow. Yeah.[2:33:49] Andrew Huberman: Oh, he's got it. There now there's good science and published in premier journals. It you know, what's interesting is is a little bit of science editorial, but since we like to exchange information about health and things of that sort, The editorial staff of a journal dictates what gets published and what doesn't, and the premier journals have a an outsized effect on what the media covers. And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now is of the age that they grew up Hearing about acupuncture. Hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect if it's done right, yoga nidra and similar practices.[2:34:26] Andrew Huberman: And so the tides are changing, but I sometimes like to take a step back and think, what are we confronted with now that seems crazy That in 10 years, the kids that will be the because to me, they're kids. Will be journal editors. Like, oh, yeah. Absolutely. You know, I'm making this up, but putting tuning forks against your head or something like that, like sound sound wave therapy.[2:34:49] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. I think when one adopts a stance of, like, We we have to filter everything through the limitations of our biology, but also through the the Sociology of a like, the way culture goes, it becomes a different story. How do you deal with that? Not just in terms of of health, but in terms of Thinking about anything. Sounds like you don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what people are gonna think is cool or not.[2:35:19] Rick Rubin: No. I can't rocker at heart.[2:35:21] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Yes. You still are.[2:35:22] Rick Rubin: There you go. I I can't. I can't. I I just know what I like and what I don't. I know what works for me and what doesn't.[2:35:29] Rick Rubin: You know, I try things, And I'm constantly looking for new better solutions to anything. And wherever they come from doesn't matter. It could come from It could come from Stanford or it could come from the guy, talking to himself on the street. If it works, I'm good. You know?[2:35:46] Rick Rubin: It doesn't really matter to me at all. I I I don't hold, I don't hold any of it tightly.[2:35:54] Andrew Huberman: Well, fortunately, there's now a division of the National Institutes of Health called, complementary health complementary and alternative health, and it's It's amazing. NCCIH is run by a woman who has published on, this is interesting, the, some of the Anticancer effects of things like acupuncture. Not that Acupuncture can cure all cancers, but but real, you know, real data Yeah. That I think For a lot of people, you know, certainly, the generation above us, you know, they just are, like, not interested. It it sheds new light on the, Andrew Wiles, The Paul Stanmitz', you know, the the wild ones.[2:36:40] Rick Rubin: You know, ozone therapy or there's so many. There's many we can look at. I mean, for a long time, nutrition was just thought of as something that's doesn't matter what you eat. It's It's what medicine you take and what you know? It's like the food is everything.[2:36:58] Andrew Huberman: Food food is a powerful A powerful variable. In the landscape of of online nutrition, it'd be it's sort of one of the 3rd rails for, anyone like myself who's Out there on social media, you do a very good job of putting out posts on Twitter and Instagram, but each day you take it down, you put up a new one.[2:37:15] Rick Rubin: And I don't Talk about any I only talk about I you know, I talk about creative ideas. I don't talk about anything specific related to, Anything other than, you know, maybe something like don't believe what you hear. Right. Exactly.[2:37:32] Andrew Huberman: Well, in the landscape of nutrition, sometimes I I now place it through the filter of of professional wrestling. You've got your your vegans and your omnivores and your, your CarnivoreMD, and you've got Liver King, and you've got everything in between. Right? So You could translate that to any number of different areas. Fashion probably has its people.[2:37:54] Andrew Huberman: I'm just not aware of it. Music has theirs, and, Sports has theirs, and science has theirs. Characters.[2:38:01] Rick Rubin: Mhmm.[2:38:01] Andrew Huberman: Like so are we all just pro wrestling like Characters in these different domains, and we're taking each ourselves and each other way too seriously.[2:38:10] Rick Rubin: Yeah. It's all we we don't know anything. It's all If someone has an idea and it sounds interesting to you, try it. And if it doesn't work, it's okay. Try something else.[2:38:19] Rick Rubin: It's like[2:38:20] Andrew Huberman: You're an empiricist.[2:38:21] Rick Rubin: Yeah. Yeah. Whatever works. Whatever works. And if something seems interesting to you and you're excited by it, why not try it?[2:38:29] Rick Rubin: It's, You know, I tried very fringy things. I like in some ways, the more, Unrealistic, it seems, the more interesting it is to me. Because I feel like that's getting closer to something that Somebody doesn't want me to know. You know?[2:38:50] Andrew Huberman: But you're not a big drug guy. Like, the big psychedelic craze that's happening now and that happened Yeah.[2:38:55] Rick Rubin: I'm not I'm not against it. It's just has never been something that I've done.[2:38:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. That's it's an interesting area that's definitely making it Headway inside of standard academic science and medicine now.[2:39:10] Rick Rubin: So that I'm interested in non far pharmacological Approaches to things, whatever they are. Yeah.[2:39:16] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm a big believer that, also that behavioral dos and don'ts Yeah. First are the they're the most fun to explore because in general, unless it's something like, you know, jumping between, buildings, doing parkour or something, most of the time, you're not gonna Injure or harm yourself. There's more room for iteration than there is with a pill or a potion, although, you know, certainly, pharmacology has its place. So you've had creative works certainly within the realm of music, also comedy and producing film, and other things. For somebody out there who of whatever age, they they maybe they're creating, maybe they they they're They know they have this creative antennae.[2:40:02] Andrew Huberman: Not the source is outside. What was it that Strummer said? I actually wrote this on the wall of my laboratory. No input, no output.[2:40:11] Rick Rubin: Wow.[2:40:11] Andrew Huberman: That's Strummer's law. It's written in my laboratory. The people in my lab were so like, what's going on here? I think 1 guy under knew what that was, but it was a picture of him and Picture my bulldog and, you know, no input, no output. I don't think I can just stay in a room with 4 walls and a ceiling and nothing else and create.[2:40:27] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I know that there's certain number of things in here, but I I do think accessing the world[2:40:32] Rick Rubin: is important. World is giving us clues all the time if we're paying attention. That's not a part of it. Like, if you're paying attention, the thing that you are looking for is being either whispered or screamed at you in the outside world if you're paying attention.[2:40:52] Andrew Huberman: Well and I, I forget the exact title of the chapter, but, there's a chapter about Staying open to clues or or being on the lookout for clues.[2:41:05] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[2:41:06] Andrew Huberman: Now I feel tempted to look for the exact title of that chapter, but It's[2:41:10] Rick Rubin: probably look for clues.[2:41:11] Andrew Huberman: It's what I guess. Look for clues. Sounds like It sounds right. And since you wrote it, I'm I'm guessing that's right. Something.[2:41:17] Andrew Huberman: So do you think there are clues in in every everywhere?[2:41:21] Rick Rubin: Yes. Think there are clues everywhere for if we pay attention, we'll hear a phrase, it'll trigger a thought, We'll see something unexpected, in the if someone recommends something to you, Maybe it's a coincidence. If 3 people recommend the same thing to you, maybe it's not. You know? Who knows?[2:41:45] Rick Rubin: Who knows? I do believe the universe is on the side of creativity, And the universe is supporting things to happen, and they could happen through you, or they could happen through someone else. So if you're paying attention, maybe it'll happen through you.[2:42:09] Andrew Huberman: We had a guest on the podcast named Justin Sonnenberg. He's an expert in the gut microbiome, And he applied something that without knowing, he applied the opposite principle. The opposite is true principle. We're talking about these trillions of gut microbiota that clearly are doing amazing things to create neurotransmitters and govern our brain and even decision making, How much sugar is in our system driving appetite, etcetera. And he said, you know, we think of them as cargo, But, like, maybe we're just vehicles, and they're in charge.[2:42:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That all of our interactions like, every time we shake hands or touch our eyes, we're exchanging gut microbiota.[2:42:47] Rick Rubin: Yeah.[2:42:47] Andrew Huberman: And we think of intelligence as a as thinking and intelligence, and he's a a microbiologist. And in in all seriousness, he said, Maybe we're the ones being manipulated. We're the house cats. And we think here we are. We're falling in love and kissing and shaking hands and washing hands and, doing all sorts of things to isolate or or connect with one another.[2:43:09] Andrew Huberman: And maybe the gut microbiota are really trying to optimize their survival.[2:43:13] Rick Rubin: That's what Laird Hamilton said that one point in the sauna that when you're in the sauna, it's really hot. The feeling that you have of wanting to get out Could be the bad critters in your body that can't handle it.[2:43:30] Andrew Huberman: Like, let's get out of here.[2:43:32] Rick Rubin: Are Trying to convince you from the inside to get out. Maybe that's where the that feeling of being compelled to get out comes from.[2:43:41] Andrew Huberman: So Elon getting us all to Mars might be a bit of, maybe they just wanna get to Mars. And so they're, maybe. As I'm starting to feel like I'm channeling Lex Fridman here for a moment. No. I think this considering the opposite is really key.[2:43:56] Andrew Huberman: And while it might sound mystical to people or a little bit like we're just Playing with ideas, that's exactly what you do in science. Someone walks in with a result and says, I found this. This is true. And you say, but what if it's all Something else a good example might be here I'm pulling from podcast episodes that we've had, but Aliyah Crum, is this amazing psychologist who works on belief effects. Your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcome.[2:44:21] Andrew Huberman: And she had this amazing graduate thesis where she said, what if all of exercise is placebo? All of it. Yeah. It burns some calories and does some things. Turns out this isn't the case, but it turns out a lot of the effects of exercise, positive effects, lowering blood pressure, relieving stress, positive or placebo.[2:44:40] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And but nobody thinks of it like that because we're so attached to calories burned, etcetera.[2:44:47] Rick Rubin: I think that's a big point that the belief part of it is a huge part of the conversation about everything. You know, what we believe has power. If we believe we could make something great, the chances of us making something great are better than if we Don't believe we can. So, I I would say any ability to harness your belief on your behalf is a really healthy thing to do.[2:45:16] Andrew Huberman: And one thing that you make very clear is that while our own abilities may come into question from time to time, you absolutely believe that the elements from which to create are out there.[2:45:32] Rick Rubin: Absolutely. All all the elements are all are are here. Everything is here. We get to pick and choose. We get to the conveyor belt's going by with little the little gifts, And we can first first, we have to notice there's a conveyor belt, then we notice the gifts, And then that's the starting point.[2:45:52] Rick Rubin: And then we may even feel, empowered enough to grab one of the gifts open it up and see what's inside. And then maybe that's the start of something really beautiful that we wouldn't have we wouldn't have done. Everything Everything that that I make or have made has always been based on something that I see or hear that allows me to see something that I didn't see before.[2:46:25] Andrew Huberman: So I was gonna ask you whether or not It's important to be happy in order to create. But, certainly, a lot of people that were unhappy were still able to create. But the more I listen to you, it seems that It's really about an ability to pay attention. Yes. So if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy, may not be as relevant As whether or not I'm able to stay undistracted.[2:46:49] Rick Rubin: Yes. I would say that's I would say being able to stay present in the work is probably the most most important part of it. And how you feel is less of an issue unless how you feel Gets in the way of you feeling how the work makes you feel. Do you know what I'm saying? If you're in a lot of pain And you're looking at a piece of art, it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel because you're The the big signal in your body is the physical pain.[2:47:25] Rick Rubin: I'm sure there are some people who can do that too, who can even through the physical pain can feel it.[2:47:30] Andrew Huberman: And there's this idea of transmutation of taking one emotion and contorting it and co opting it into an another action in an adaptive way. But this idea of distraction being a problem, I I this really resonates. I think, when I think of times of great productivity is when I was able to be undistracted, The I could also see how success can be its own distraction. This is often discussed in the context of fighting sports where someone starts making a lot of money, and pretty soon their focus becomes all things they can access with their success as opposed to the thing that got them there in the 1st place. Keeping an underdog mentality.[2:48:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. Before we conclude, I do wanna ask you about one other aspect of process, which is meditation. Meditation is interesting to me because when we close our eyes, as most meditations are done, and we focus on our brain, Our brain has no sensation.[2:48:25] Rick Rubin: Like, if we I wouldn't say we focus on our brain.[2:48:27] Andrew Huberman: Oh, or we focus on something other than our normal experience? Was that how would you define meditation?[2:48:34] Rick Rubin: Well, there's different there are different types of meditation. Usually, Either way, we're we I would say there's no form of meditation where we're focused on our brain. Okay.[2:48:47] Andrew Huberman: Good. I'm glad we disagree. Yeah. No.[2:48:59] Rick Rubin: Almost like a creating a transfer ourselves, not unlike listening to something when we go to sleep that would distract Our conscious mind from participating, we would be overriding our, the the talking mind with just a sound that we're generating or a word or a phrase series of phrases. A meta meta meditation is, a loving kindness meditation with phrases. Could be that, or it could be focused on the breath. But the purpose of being focused on the breath is to not Hear the self talk that we normally have. It's a it's a single pointed Focus exercise in those that I described.[2:49:49] Rick Rubin: The other version is an awareness meditation where you're closing your eyes And you're being with whatever is and noticing. So if we were to do it now, And you could do an eyes opener, eyes closed with an awareness practice. But the first thing that I would do is I would feel, I feel a little ringing in my ears. It might be from the electronic equipment around us, and I don't mean that I hear the sound. It's like A vibration.[2:50:23] Rick Rubin: I hear cars passing in the distance. See what else comes up. I can feel, feeling in my chest. I can feel this part of my face. Not sure why.[2:50:47] Rick Rubin: Feels like it's related to my jaw. More car sounds. I'm aware of a little feeling of warmth. So now I would say the room the room feels a bit warm. I wasn't aware of that Before when I wasn't just being with what's happening, feel a little itch on my left shoulder.[2:51:14] Rick Rubin: So, you know, that that would be an awareness practice, which is another kind of meditation where you're just paying attention to what's going on. There's no story. There's no this means this. None of those things. Just like an inventory almost of Everything that comes up when it comes up, and you do that for a period of time.[2:51:34] Rick Rubin: But in in all of those cases, In in the example of doing the awareness meditation or doing a mantra meditation or focusing on the breath, in none of them Am I thinking in none of them? Am I concentrating on I'm I'm I'm being aware of the of sense perceptions in the awareness one or in the other meditations, I'm doing a practice So that I'm not aware of thinking about anything else.[2:52:08] Andrew Huberman: When do you start meditating, and how often do you meditate now?[2:52:12] Rick Rubin: Learned when I was 14, and, I started with TM, and that's probably the the meditation that I've done the most in my life And I come back to although I tried many different kinds, and also different physical forms of meditation, tai chi, things like that. I meditated for 5 or 6 years, and then I stopped when I went to school to to university. And then I started again several years later. And when I started again, I realized how profound it was in in me that I had done it when I did it. So I usually have some sort of a some sort of a practice.[2:52:52] Rick Rubin: In some ways, The beach walks could be a form of meditation. But the for for me, typically, I would wake up. It'd be the first thing I would do During that sort of in between time, maybe go out in the sun, close my eyes, and meditate before starting my day. If I'm doing it twice a day, the 2nd time would probably be right before dinner if I'm doing it on a regular schedule. Then if, if I find myself on an airplane, I might meditate for an hour or for the I Can remember one time meditating the entire flight from New York to LA just it was a great opportunity to do a a deep dive.[2:53:36] Rick Rubin: And time passes. You lose track of time. You know? You don't even know. It's like going to sleep and waking up.[2:53:43] Rick Rubin: You don't feel like that was 8 hours. You know, it's just time stops. Not always, but when it does, a great feeling.[2:53:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You've sent me some meditations in including the one that you did on that transatlantic or transcontinental flight, and and I've been trying to get do longer and longer meditations, but I'm I've always meditated a little bit, but your meditation practice is one that I'm starting to adopt. If, maybe we could convince you to give us suggestions of 1 or 2, and we can link out to them for listeners. Sure they'd appreciate that.[2:54:16] Rick Rubin: And there's also Meditation like practices to do that involve, like, there's there's something called the The surgical series from the Monroe Institute, which I used when I had a surgery. You'd listen to this recording, and it both allows your body to heal much faster And, remove some of the trauma that goes on when, you know, getting cut open. It's traumatic. But just through listening to certain things, you can, can have a really powerful effect, heal much faster. I remember, I was, about to be put under for a surgery, And, my eyes were closed, and I wasn't communicating with anyone there because I was going inside.[2:55:18] Rick Rubin: And, and my wife was with me, and they came in, and they said, oh, so they already gave Rick Rick the sedative because he's rated at Will Inch. Can't give him anything. He's like, look at his numbers. Like, yeah.[2:55:32] Andrew Huberman: I love it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a It's an amazingly powerful practice that I I like because anyone can cultivate. There's no[2:55:41] Rick Rubin: Absolutely. Absolutely. There's and there's no Good or bad version, it really is just if you learn a technique and show up and do it, it works.[2:55:53] Andrew Huberman: Well, I love that you're so willing to share what you do and your process. And, now I just wanna say thank you for a number of things. I wanna thank you for the music you've created and that you are to create because we wanna be Still ongoing, certainly for your time today and sharing your thought process and a bit of what goes into This incredible creative process. And I wanna thank you for writing the book. You know, I don't talk about or feature many books on the podcast.[2:56:24] Andrew Huberman: It's just not something we typically do. But, I've seen a little bit of the evolution of it, and then I've seen it now and read through it in its final form twice, as I mentioned. I'm gonna Continue to read through it again. It is one of those books where it is so filled with gems. Like, every chapter, like, I could take notes on this and take notes on this, and it's Assembled in a very digestible way that allows people to extract the The meaningful parts in every chapter, and there's so many in in a way that's very straightforward.[2:56:56] Andrew Huberman: So, I love the book, thank you for doing it because you certainly didn't have to write a book, but I'm so happy that you did. And I know that I've already benefited. I know so many people are going to benefit. It's an amazing book, and I couldn't help but put my neuroscience lens on it. But I also about halfway through, I learned to Guard my preexisting lens a bit and start to see things what I through what I think is a different perspective.[2:57:22] Andrew Huberman: So I just wanna thank you for being such an incredible portal and also for being an amazing friend.[2:57:27] Rick Rubin: Thank you. I love you. I'm so happy to be here with you, and anytime I get to see you, it's a good day.[2:57:32] Andrew Huberman: Likewise. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Rick Rubin, all about creativity and the creative process.
