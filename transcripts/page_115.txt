Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions.[0:01:19] Andrew Huberman: And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible. The first question today is about adaptogens. Some of you may have heard of adaptogens. I'm guessing many of you have not heard of adaptogens. The strict definition of adaptogens is still evolving, meaning no one really knows what adaptogens mean and what's included in adaptogens and what's excluded from adaptogens.[0:01:44] Andrew Huberman: But the most common definition of an adaptogen is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug, although it could be a behavior, if you really think about it, that helps you adapt to and buffer stress. So when you hear about adaptogens, there are 3 main categories of adaptogens that come to mind. The first are things that are contained in food. So these would be vitamins or micronutrients that one could easily find in food, But one would have to consume a fairly restricted number or type of foods in order to obtain those things or consume a lot of those foods in order to get sufficient dosages of those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress. Some good examples of these would be any kind of vitamin, Either water soluble or fat soluble that can adjust or reduce what are so called reactive oxygen species.[0:02:38] Andrew Huberman: And then that's what gives rise to this idea that Antioxidants are good for us. Now over the last 10 years or so, there's been a shift. What shift has occurred? Well, about 10 years ago, you often heard about antioxidants antioxidants and vitamins, antioxidants in this food, this superfood, etcetera. And why were people talking about antioxidants?[0:02:57] Andrew Huberman: Well, just to remind you, reactive Active oxygen species are types of reactions and molecules that occur in cells when cells get Stressed and or age and antioxidants are the compounds that reduce those reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are bad for cells because they tend to hinder the function of mitochondria, which are associated with energy production in those cells. So what do we know for sure? We know that as cells get older or as any cell or biological system, organ, tissue, etcetera, get stressed a lot over time, The number of reactive oxygen species increases in those cells and tissues and organs, and antioxidants, which can include certain vitamins, but also some micronutrients are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species. Now what's occurred over the last 10 years is that we know that active oxygen species are a major source of depleting cellular function by way of depleting mitochondrial function, but they are Just one of many mechanisms that can deplete cellular function, mitochondrial function.[0:04:02] Andrew Huberman: So nowadays, you'll hear about reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, but not as much As you used to, now you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines also being an issue. And the truth is all of these Things are an issue. So going back to this question about adaptogens, adaptogens include these 3 categories. I've told you the first, which are the vitamins and micronutrients that are contained in food that can reduce reactive oxygen species and other aspects of cellular stress such as Inflammatory cytokines. What are some of those things that occur in foods?[0:04:36] Andrew Huberman: Well, in order to answer that, let's just think about what sorts of foods themselves can act as adaptogens. It's commonly held that the dark leafy greens type foods, for those of you that eat plants, and I think the majority of people out there do eat plants. I know The carnivore diet and lion diet and, some other diets tend to exclude plants. We'll address that in in briefly at some point, in today's Discussion. But dark leafy greens are known to contain a number of compounds in the form of vitamins and micronutrients that are very effective in reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines.[0:05:12] Andrew Huberman: So if you're somebody who's interested in Adaptogens and adaptogenic processes reducing stress and buffering stress, which, of course, has its role in buffering daily stress in order to help you sleep better, to improve seller function for longevity, sports performance, cognitive performance, that is all good, and it makes sense why people would be interested in adaptogens. But remember that the 2 main adaptogens That you should think to first are going to be behaviors and nutrition. I've started with nutrition on purpose. As I mentioned, we'll get to behaviors in a moment. So if you're interested in adaptogens at all, I highly recommend that you include at least 2 to 4 servings of dark leafy greens and or cruciferous vegetables per day.[0:05:51] Andrew Huberman: I think that'd be highly advantageous. And just be aware that excessively heating dark leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables Can actually destroy the very nutrients and micronutrients that act in an adaptogenic way. That does not mean that you need to eat raw broccoli or cauliflower. Just the thought of that makes me nauseous. It's very hard to digest.[0:06:09] Andrew Huberman: Some people might like that or can digest it, more easily than others. So it's perfectly fine to cook your cruciferous vegetables and dark leafy greens, but you don't want to over Cook them. What's overcooking and what's, undercooking? There's, no strict cutoff in terms of temperature. But, basically, what the literature says is that if you heat vegetables to the point where the colored fluid is leaching out of them into a broth type, you know, into water or Whatever fluid surrounds them, well, then you would be well off to ingest that fluid as well because contained in the the water or the fluid that's Leaching out from the cruciferous vegetables or from the dark leafy greens are gonna be a lot of those very adaptogenic molecules that you're interested in the 1st place.[0:06:51] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So I probably surprised some people by starting off my answer to the question of what are adaptogens. Are they worth thinking about and pursuing? And if so, How can I get them? By talking about food.[0:07:01] Andrew Huberman: But I think it is important to understand that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food. And indeed, some of the best adaptogens do come from dark leafy greens and cruciferous So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that. The other 2 categories of adaptogens are going to be supplement based adaptogens and then behavioral adaptogens. Again, Here, adaptogen defined as anything that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way in order to support cellular health, organ health, and overall daily living and and and functioning, including sleep and performance and mental health. So the 2nd category of adaptogen are going to be supplements.[0:07:36] Andrew Huberman: And here again, I just wanna take a step back, make sure that we are clear about our operational definition about what a supplement is. We had an episode all about How to design a rational guide to supplementation, which included, for example, the idea that for some people, the optimal dosage of supplements is going to be 0, and for other people, the dosage will be something else. But to really pinpoint the key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now, But the key but a key message from that episode that I'd like to reiterate now is that many people think of supplements as just vitamin supplements. And for that reason, you'll often hear the argument, oh, well, aren't supplements just expensive urine? Couldn't you get all of that from food?[0:08:18] Andrew Huberman: Aren't you just urinating out all the water soluble Vitamins and maybe even storing excess amounts of the fat soluble vitamins in a way that's unhealthy or not cost effective and so on. When we talk about supplements, Yes. It can include vitamin supplements. However, there are many compounds that we would describe as supplements that are not vitamin supplements and that you could not obtain from food or that you could never obtain from food insufficient enough qualities to have a robust positive biological effect without consuming the enormous number of calories or overriding your your gut, mechanically. For instance, if there were, say, a herb, And we'll talk about such herbs in a moment that contained an effective adaptogen, but you would never want to eat the plant itself or include that herb in any kind of recipe, well, then chances are this herb, which we'll define in a moment, is not a vitamin supplement.[0:09:12] Andrew Huberman: It is Probably not even best thought of as a supplement. It's best thought of as a compound that's sold over the counter much like a prescription drug, although it's not prescription. It doesn't require to get it. So there are a lot of things like that that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements. And, unfortunately, because of that, A lot of people think, oh, you don't need supplements.[0:09:31] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, you don't need supplements per se, but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them. In the context of adaptogens, there are 2 or 3 in particular that can be very beneficial for buffering the stress response, especially over short periods of time of about 2 to 3 weeks. So when would you use these? Well, for instance, if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life either because of family or relational or school or Work demands or new kid in the house or any number of different things or you've been ill or you're recovering from injury, taking an adaptogen in the form Supplement can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone and the general systems it's associated with called Cortisol. It's very healthy to have high levels of cortisol early in the day shortly after you wake up, and then that ought to taper off toward the afternoon and evening.[0:10:19] Andrew Huberman: However, if cortisol is Chronically elevated throughout the day or if that peaking cortisol is arriving too late in the day, that is known to be associated with mental health and physical health issues. It's been by labs at Stanford and elsewhere. It's been shown in animal models and in humans. Talked many times before, and I'll just remind you again, that one of the best ways to restrict that Cortisol peak to the early part of the day is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can. Once the sun is up, get outside facing the direction of the sun, even on overcast days, don't wear sunglasses.[0:10:50] Andrew Huberman: Look at it for 5 to 30 minutes. Definitely blink so you don't damage your eyes, so on and so forth. Why 5 minutes or 30 minutes? Well, 5 minutes on a clear day should be sufficient. Longer would be fine.[0:11:01] Andrew Huberman: Again, blink so that you'd protect your eyes. Blink as needed Facing the general direction of the sun, on days when you have a lot of overcast or it's really dark dense cloud cover, well, then you'd wanna be outside longer. And if you don't have access to sunlight for whatever reason, then you want to do the same thing with bright artificial lights indoors, either so called sad lamp or otherwise. That's a great way to restrict that cortisol peak to early in the day. But even if you're doing that, if you have a stressful life for whatever reason, even if you're getting that morning sunlight, which I hope you are, you're getting your exercise, you're trying to sleep better, and more as we all should most of the time.[0:11:35] Andrew Huberman: Well, then, you're you may be somebody who wants to take a Adaptogen in the form of a supplement. And the 3 supplements that could be very effective in buffering cortisol are ashwagandha, which I'll talk about first, lion's mane and chaga. Lion's mane and chaga are in the, fungi, group. So they count as mushrooms. They are not psychedelic mushrooms.[0:11:58] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about ashwagandha first. Ashwagandha is at the top of the list because it is indeed a very potent adaptogen. How can I say that? Well, there are a number of studies now, including, several excellent ones in humans that report that taking Two doses of 300 milligrams of ashwagandha per day can very dramatically buffer for cortisol. So this is something that you would have a near impossible time accessing from food.[0:12:28] Andrew Huberman: I can't imagine Imagine that unless you're cooking with the very sources of ashwagandha, and extracting exact amounts that you'd be able to get this in any other form Except, supplement form. So here, I'm gonna just briefly reference a paper, and we can provide a reference to the a reference link to this that is. This is a a paper from 2012 that's had a lot of of excellent follow-up papers that support it. The title of the paper is a perspective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of safety and efficacy of high concentration of full spectrum extract of ashwagandha root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults. And it's a really nice study, Not a huge subject pool, but both men and women, and it's carried out for long enough that they got to see some really interesting results.[0:13:06] Andrew Huberman: And the the, I think the the most interesting result is that taking 300 milligrams of ashwagandha twice a day led to Enormous I mean, just enormous changes in serum cortisol. The statistical significance, that they observed in the study was really, Fantastic. Fantastically, high statistical significance. They saw the effects of ashwagandha on day 15, having initiated the The ashwagandha, consumption on on day 1, of course, day 30 and day 45. And, again, this was dramatic reductions in stress As perceived by people, so subjective stress and cortisol levels.[0:13:47] Andrew Huberman: So ashwagandha is very potent at reducing cortisol. How would you Recapitulate this if you wanted to use ashwagandha to buffer stress, well, a couple of key points. Mentioned earlier that you want your cortisol peak to come earlier in the day. Therefore, you would not want to buffer cortisol early in the day. In fact, cortisol peaking early in the day provides an anti inflammatory, Immune supporting, focus, and mood supporting effect all day long.[0:14:16] Andrew Huberman: So I would recommend that people take their 1st dose of ashwagandha anywhere from 250 to 300 milligrams sometime in the early afternoon and again in the evening as opposed to taking a morning dose and an afternoon dose. Also, if you're somebody who's exercising for sake of trying to induce adaptations like hypertrophy, the growth of muscles, or Strength or improve your endurance in any way, muscular endurance or more traditional cardiovascular endurance, then I recommend that you not Take your ashwagandha prior to exercise because part of the adaptation response is triggered by increases in cortisol during exercise, sort of In the same way that some of the best adaptations to exercise are reductions in blood pressure and resting heart rate, And those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate during exercise. That's just how these biological systems work. So The takeaway is pretty simple. If you're interested in, using ashwagandha as an adaptogen, I would restrict it to later in the day if you can and not Before exercise, divided into 2 doses of 250 to 300 milligrams.[0:15:20] Andrew Huberman: That's, what this paper and other papers Like it, it seemed to indicate. And then a very important final point about ashwagandha, which is that if you're going to take ashwagandha, I recommend not taking it for longer than a month and a half as they did in this study. In fact, I would suggest that you only take ashwagandha around periods of Kind of moderate to extreme stress. What's moderate, what's extreme is going to depend on what you're going through. Only you know how much stress and life events can tolerate.[0:15:47] Andrew Huberman: So if you've had trouble sleeping and that's unusual for you or you're dealing with a very difficult life circumstances or, you know, Excessive work demand or a new kid, as I mentioned before, well, then buffering stress with ashwagandha, buffering cortisol in the afternoon and evening can be very beneficial for you. But then I would After about, 30 days maximum, I would take at least 2 to 4 weeks off. 2 weeks is probably enough, but 4 weeks off because you don't want to chronically Buffer cortisol. It's just not a good idea. But that said, I think ashwagandha is a very powerful adaptogen.[0:16:20] Andrew Huberman: I Place at the top of list of supplement based adaptogens. But keep in mind that even if you're taking a supplement based adaptogen, that's no reason to Abandon the nutrition and behavioral type, adaptogenic effects that you can create through eating dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, then we'll talk behaviors in a moment. The other 2 supplement based adaptogens, as I mentioned, are lion's mane mushroom and chaga. And, I get asked a lot about lion's mane and chaga for sake of, Their purported roles in acting as nootropics, as quote, unquote smart drugs, there are Fewer data on the beneficial roles of Lion's Mane and Chaga for sake of, nootropic effects. We do an entire episode on nootropics at some point.[0:17:03] Andrew Huberman: But, there have been a few studies showing that lion's maiden supplementation and supplementation can improve memory and maybe even divergent thinking associated with creativity and things of that sort. Again, these are not Psychedelic mushrooms. That said, there are good data showing that a 1,000 milligrams, that is 1 gram of lion's mane per day, And or okay? These we'll talk about the and or portion in a moment. And or chaga mushroom at 500 to 1500 milligrams Per day can act as adaptogens in, again, reducing cortisol, but also and mainly Reducing some of the anti inflammatory cytokines that are known to circulate in high abundance when you're under a lot of psychological and or physical stress, Things like interleukin 6 and some related molecules.[0:17:55] Andrew Huberman: So here's what I would recommend. If you are, interested in exploring I'm a big fan as some of you probably know if you heard that, episode on rational guide to supplementation. I'm a big fan of mainly focusing on taking supplements In single ingredient formulations so that you can figure out what dosages are best for you and so that you can toggle in and out Those adaptogens as needed. So I, of course, am a fan of taking certain blends and mixes. The one that we talk about a lot on this podcast, and we I've been a sponsor from the beginning.[0:18:25] Andrew Huberman: I've taken for a decade now, long before I ever had a podcast, is Athletic Greens, which some of you might note does contain some ashwagandha, although the Levels of ashwagandha that are contained in athletic greens are low enough that I don't see any issue with taking the, athletic greens, consistently day to day, every day because you're not getting anywhere near that 600 milligram dosage. But the idea is that if you are going to take any Optogen, for sake of buffering stress over the short term, say for a week or 2 weeks or a month, and then taking that, recommended time off, I would start with ashwagandha. And then if you feel you need something else to buffer stress, keeping in mind, of course, that you're the behavioral and the nutritional things to buffer stress as well. You can never abandon those. Right?[0:19:08] Andrew Huberman: Well, then I would suggest adding a 1000 milligrams or a 1000 milligrams of chaga per day and seeing how that further, benefits your your system in terms of buffering stress. How would you measure if your stress being reduced well. You're going to be sleeping better at night. You're going to feel subjectively better, lower levels of anxiety, all the things that are measured in the types of studies I described before. Now, of course, there's nothing preventing you from taking 600 milligrams of ashwagandha, a gram of lion's mane, and a gram of chaga.[0:19:36] Andrew Huberman: I know some people like to Just kinda go, full tilt into everything. But I am a big believer in really trying to isolate which supplements and molecules work best for you and which ones don't. Do you need to cycle on and off Lion's Mane and Chaga? I'm not aware of any data showing that you do. If, however, you're taking them every day, I recommend that you cycle off them after a period of 30 days or so.[0:20:00] Andrew Huberman: And I want to be very clear about this. Just because I said cycle off after a period of 30 days or so does not mean that you can't take them for a shorter period of time. So for instance, if you know that you're coming up on a big week of stress, well, then you could take Ashwagandha and or lion's mane and or chaga for that week or just that week or heading into that week or in the following week and then stop. There's no reason why you couldn't take them even for one day. Although the the effects tend to be, a bit cumulative, at least when we're talking about, buffering anxiety.[0:20:30] Andrew Huberman: In terms of buffering cortisol, that's a very potent effect that, far as we know, it's going to take place on day 1. Again, keep that cortisol buffering effect away from exercise. At least don't take it before exercise, and Try and buffer your cortisol in the afternoon and evening. And this is assuming that you're working a conventional shift and you're not up all night and sleeping all day for sake of of of shift work. K.[0:20:52] Andrew Huberman: So hopefully, that clarifies things about what adaptogens are. In fact, I never actually read the specific question, but I think I've touched on a number of of issues that relate to this specific question. And then I'll answer the the last portion of the answer to this question in a moment, as it relates to behavioral tools, that can act as adaptogens. The question itself was there's a lot of mixed information about out there about adaptogens like ashwagandha, and I think that relates to what I earlier, which is that the definition of an adaptogen has not really been cemented, in, various, It's different in different communities, and it's, generally, used as a matter of convenience rather than really strictly defining what it is. And hopefully, we've defined it, Accurately and and broadly enough today is something that buffers stress.[0:21:38] Andrew Huberman: The second part of the question was, what does Scientific evidence say about adaptogens and their ability to mediate body stress response. They say quite a lot, and they they say that the stress Fonts can be buffered substantially by certain adaptogens, mainly dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga, and, of course, all the behavioral things that are critical that we'll list off in a moment. And then the 3rd portion of the question is, is there any solid evidence it has an effect on neurotransmitters or the HPA, which is part of the, stress modulation axis. The best evidence is that adaptogens can reduce Cortisol itself. There is very little evidence that adaptogens can directly modulate neurotransmitters or neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, etcetera.[0:22:23] Andrew Huberman: But by adjusting the timing and levels of cortisol, especially in the afternoon and evening, That is going to have indirect effects on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, etcetera, and serotonin, but not direct effects. So the general contour that makes for an ideal diurnal schedule you heard of nocturnal? Well, the opposite is diurnal, being awake during the daytime and asleep at night. The ideal And a landscape of neurotransmitters is higher levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the early part of the day and cortisol, so called catecholamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and high levels of cortisol early in the day as directed by sunlight, exercise, caffeine, hydration, Movement, all that stuff, being awake and busy and outside or indoors with bright lights and moving about in the early part of the day and into the early afternoon. That's The best possible way that we are aware of to try and get those catecholamines released at the highest levels in the early part of the day, and then the ideal contour of a 24 hour cycle will be in the later half of the day.[0:23:22] Andrew Huberman: The evening and nighttime, you have higher levels of things like serotonin, the GABAergic system, all the things that are somewhat Sedative and preparing you for sleep and lower levels of the catecholamines and cortisol as I described before. So to directly answer the question, is there any evidence that adaptogens can alter your neurotransmitters? Yes. But only indirectly. And yet, that indirect control over neurotransmitters is substantial and is important.[0:23:48] Andrew Huberman: And if you do what I described, such as getting morning sunlight, and ideally, you'd get a little bit of deliberate cold water Exposure, by the way, to boost adrenaline and nor Norepinephrine and dopamine, those catecholamines early in the day. So quick 1 minute cold shower even or a 3 minute cold shower or You have access to an ice bath early in the day plus some sunlight. Doesn't matter which one you do first. Doing that early in the day is really going to create that peak of Cortisol, dopamine, epinephrine early in the day, I can't emphasize how beneficial all of that can be, and exercise if can early in the day. Some people can't exercise till later in the day.[0:24:21] Andrew Huberman: I'd rather see people exercise later in the day than not at all, provided it does not disrupt their nighttime sleep, which, of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. So, yes, there's modulation neurotransmitters, but most of those are downstream of the effects on cortisol that we've been talking about. So we've defined Adaptogens, supplement based adaptogens. Although, I don't really like the word supplements anymore unless we're talking about vitamin supplements reasons we talked about earlier. And then there's the 3rd category of adaptogens, which are the behavioral tools that you can use to buffer stress, which qualifies those as an adaptogen.[0:24:53] Andrew Huberman: And I think it's really important that we always keep in mind that, yes, there are supplements. Yes, there are prescription drugs out there. In fact, there are prescription drugs that You can get from a doctor that will potently zero out your cortisol. But most doctors are very reluctant to Prescribe those drugs because cortisol provides a very important and functional role early in the day. Behaviors are very effective at reducing cortisol.[0:25:18] Andrew Huberman: What are the most effective behaviors to reduce cortisol? Well, we talked about, 1, to restrict cortisol the early part of the day, which is viewing morning sunlight. But how would you buffer cortisol in the late afternoon? It's going to be all the things associated with reducing stress. For instance, 10 minutes or even my laboratory and other laboratories have shown is even 5 minutes a day of just What would be called mindfulness meditation.[0:25:42] Andrew Huberman: Very simple. You don't need to overcomplicate this. You could use a great app like the Waking Up app or another app of that sort, or you can simply sit down, eyes closed, Breathe through your nose and just concentrate on your breathing. Every time your mind drifts to something else, bring it back to your breathing. That's shown to reduce stress.[0:25:58] Andrew Huberman: You could do a 5 minute deliberate breathwork practice. My laboratory has published some work related to that. The breathwork practice could be any number of things. The 2 that I Recommend the most would be double inhale followed by a full exhale, and then repeat for a period of 5 minutes, known to substantially reduce anxiety, stress, and the various physiological will substantially reduce stress. I'm a big fan, as many of you know, of yoga nidra, which involves no movement.[0:26:30] Andrew Huberman: It involves just lying there, listening to a script. Lots of yoga nidra It's available online. If you're not interested in the intentions and other things including yoga nidra, you can buffer stress using an adaptogen like NSDR, non sleep deep rest. If you're interested in trying these, sorts of things, there's a, NSDR protocol that's 10 minutes long. Just put my name, Huberman, And NSDR into the search browser on YouTube, and Virtuosan has provided an, NSDR that's completely zero cost and works very well reducing stress, it will also help teach your system and teach you how to, learn to fall asleep better at night.[0:27:07] Andrew Huberman: So any of those practices, 5 to 10 minute Breathing practice or meditation or a, NSDR or yoga nidram. If you can do longer 20 or 30 minutes in the afternoon, that's known to buffer cortisol substantially as well. Anytime you're encountering stress in real time, I highly recommend a tool over and over because it's so effective. The fastest way we know to For stress and calm down is the so called physiological sigh. Big inhale through the nose till your lungs are empty, but then sneak in a little bit more air by a second inhale, Maximally inflate the lungs, then a long exhale until your lungs are empty.[0:27:41] Andrew Huberman: 1 to 3 of those will reduce your stress substantially. Over time, that should reduce that is Buffer your cortisol acting as an adaptogen. There are a lot of things. You could take a hot bath. You could take a hot shower.[0:27:52] Andrew Huberman: You can listen to some pleasant music. You know, anything that reduces stress, technically, is an adaptogen. So I hope I've thoroughly answered your question by, yours. I mean, this of course, this answer is going out to all of you. This is a question that was asked by Justine Bevelacqua.[0:28:06] Andrew Huberman: I hope I pronounced that correctly, Justine. And thank you for that question. I think there are a lot of people interested in adaptogens. So now you know you can use nutrition, such as cruciferous vegetables, dark leafy greens. And I should also mention, if you're not ingesting enough calories each day, Well, then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress.[0:28:24] Andrew Huberman: That's not to say that some people shouldn't take in fewer calories than they burn in order to Lose weight. Some people really need to do that for their health or for whatever other reason. But if you restrict calories too much, you are going to increase cortisol output. So Keep that in mind. So ingest sufficient calories for you and for your goals.[0:28:43] Andrew Huberman: Aim to get dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. Don't overcook them. If you wanna explore supplements, the best supplements that act as adaptogens are gonna be ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga. 1 or 2 or 3 of those, although, if you're going to pick 1, I'd recommend ashwagandha, 600 milligrams per day taken in the later half of the day. And then there are the behavioral tools We just talked about now, which are anything that reduces stress can reduce cortisol, and in doing so, are Technically, adaptogens.[0:29:13] Andrew Huberman: If you wanna know more behavioral tools and other tools for adjusting stress and learn more about adaptogens, we did a whole episode called Mastering Stress. So you can look to that. It that episode also pretty clearly defines, I I like to think, what short term, medium term, and long term stress Keep in mind, stress is part of life. Learning how to work with it, how to dance with it, how to buffer it is terrific, but zeroing out cortisol is not the goal. The goal is to learn to modulate and control your cortisol, and that's really what adaptogens are all about.[0:29:42] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode, and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. To remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not gonna change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast and to fund research.[0:30:22] Andrew Huberman: In particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that We are most interested in, and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those Protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel, but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to Give you information to your burning questions in-depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the 1st place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.[0:31:16] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to sign up for the Humberland Lab premium channel, again, there's a Cost of $10 per month or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year, that will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes are not found elsewhere. And, again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and Performance.
