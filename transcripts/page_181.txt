Kronikle AI - Dr. Adam Grant: How to Unlock Your Potential, Motivation & Unique Abilities - TranscriptDr. Adam Grant: How to Unlock Your Potential, Motivation & Unique Abilities - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is doctor Adam Grant. Adam Grant is a professor of organizational psychology at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania. He has authored 5 best selling books and most recently, has authored a new book entitled Hidden Potential.[0:00:28] Andrew Huberman: He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University and his doctorate the University of Michigan. Today, we discuss peer reviewed studies and tools based on the data from those studies that can enable people To meet their goals and overcome significant challenges, including how to overcome procrastination, as well as how to see around or through blind spots, as well as how to overcome sticking points in motivation and creativity. We also discussed the research on and practical tools related to the underpinnings of performance in any endeavor, including how to increase one's confidence and how to have a persistent growth mindset. By the end of today's episode, it will be clear to you that doctor Adam Grant Has an absolutely spectacular depth and breadth of knowledge, and that knowledge is both practical. It is based on peer reviewed research, And he conveys those tools with the utmost clarity and generosity.[0:01:22] Andrew Huberman: Indeed, by the end of today's episode, You will have more than a dozen new tools never discussed before on the Huberman Lab Podcast that you can apply in your academic endeavors, in athletic endeavors, in creative endeavors, in fact, in any area of life. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is 8 Sleep.[0:01:55] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact That getting a great night sleep really is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. One of the key things to getting a great night sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping is correct. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees.[0:02:25] Andrew Huberman: With 8 Sleep, you can program the temperature your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle, and end of your night. It has a number of other features like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement and slow wave sleep that you get, Things that are essential to really dialing in the perfect night sleep for you. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for well over 2 years now, and it has greatly improved my sleep. I fall asleep Far more quickly, I wake up far less often in the middle of the night, and I wake up feeling far more refreshed than I ever did prior to using an Eight Sleep mattress cover. If you'd like to try 8 sleep, go to 8 sleep.com/huberman.[0:02:58] Andrew Huberman: Now through November 30th, as a special holiday discount, 8 Sleep is offering $500 off their bundles With a pod cover. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, the UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose Monitor.[0:03:25] Andrew Huberman: One of the most important factors in your immediate and long term health is your blood sugar or blood glucose regulation. With Levels, You can see how different foods and food combinations, exercise, and sleep patterns impact your blood glucose levels. It's very easy to use. You just put the monitor on the back of your arm, And then you take your phone and you scan it over that monitor now and again, and it downloads the data about your blood sugar levels in the preceding hours. Using Levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about what works best for me in terms of nutrition, exercise, work schedules, and sleep.[0:03:57] Andrew Huberman: If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor, you can go to levels.link/huberman. Levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous version. Right now, they're also offering an additional 2 free months of Membership. Again, that's levels.link/huberman to try the new sensor and 2 free months of membership. Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.[0:04:22] Andrew Huberman: Waking Up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocols. Started using the Waking Up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditations since my teens and I started doing yoga nidra about a decade ago, My dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations and had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a Try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate. Other times, I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can For different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation I do.[0:05:17] Andrew Huberman: I also love that the Waking Up app has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, Yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still, but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent Scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest or NSDR can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy even with just short 10 minute session. If you'd like to try the Waking Up app, you can go to waking up .com/huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, That's waking up .com/huberman to access a free 30 day trial.[0:05:53] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Adam Grant. Adam, welcome.[0:05:58] Dr. Adam Grant: Excited to be here.[0:05:59] Andrew Huberman: Very excited to have you here. Your career, both public facing and academic career Covered an enormous range of topics, so we have a lot to cover.[0:06:08] Dr. Adam Grant: Look who's talking.[0:06:10] Andrew Huberman: And anytime, 2 professors sit down or even 1 professor, says we have a lot to cover. I think everyone listening braces themselves like, oh, no. But these topics, I assure everyone are of The utmost interest, and you cover them in such both fabulous detail, and you make it very clear. So I'm really looking forward to this. I'd like to start off by Talking about something that I'm obsessed by and I know a lot of people are obsessed with and struggle with.[0:06:40] Andrew Huberman: And I know you also have a recent publication on this topic, which is procrastination. I am a bit of a procrastinator, but a different way of stating that is that I love deadlines. I learned in college that I love, Love love deadlines because it seems to harness my focus and my attention. I like just enough. I guess you call it anxiety or autonomic arousal for the, you know, neuroscience or physiology oriented folks.[0:07:10] Andrew Huberman: For me, it just brings about A total elimination of all of the distractors, and it seems to both slow and would prefer to not have to procrastinate in order to self impose deadlines. I prefer that other people impose those deadlines, in fact. So What do we know about procrastination? Why do some people complete things well in advance? Why do other people procrastinate?[0:07:42] Andrew Huberman: Is it that they're seeking deadlines As I believe I am. And interestingly, and sort of alluding to this recent paper of yours. What is the relationship between procrastination and creativity?[0:07:57] Dr. Adam Grant: I feel like we should just deal with all that later. Let's put it off.[0:08:00] Andrew Huberman: No. Good one. By the way, there's extra credit for science funds on here. So[0:08:06] Dr. Adam Grant: Wait. But but Mostly done. Of the best articles on procrastination ever written was titled, at last, my article on procrastination.[0:08:13] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. I love it.[0:08:15] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. It just made me smile. So I think the the the basic question, I think, to start with is why do we procrastinate? And I I thought I was immune, actually, when I came into this topic. I was the the person who annoyed my college roommates by finishing my thesis a couple months early.[0:08:33] Dr. Adam Grant: I found out there was a term for me. I'm a procrastinator. So the, you know, the focus and the pressure that you get from a deadline, I get that the moment the project starts, and sometimes months or years in advance. And so I was really proud of finishing everything early. And then I discovered there are things that I procrastinate on too, which was a little bit disappointing.[0:08:54] Andrew Huberman: Are you willing to share what some of those[0:08:55] Dr. Adam Grant: I am. So I, I procrastinate on anything that's administrative. So I'm right there with you. Get time on my calendar? It could take me weeks to respond.[0:09:05] Dr. Adam Grant: You asked me a question about social science. I will be back to you in a minute. I procrastinate on grading. Takes me forever. I basically put off a whole bunch of tasks that I The thought had nothing in common.[0:09:20] Dr. Adam Grant: It turns out that I procrastinate when I'm bored. Like, boredom is I I guess it's probably my most hated emotion. And so I will do anything to avoid a boring task. And I think this goes to why people procrastinate, which is a lot of people think it's laziness Or you're not disciplined enough, but, actually, the the research on this is really clear that you're not avoiding work when you procrastinate. In fact, a lot of our procrastination is is focused on doing things that involve a lot of energy.[0:09:45] Dr. Adam Grant: You've seen people probably clean their entire houses when they're putting off a task. So it's it's not that you're being lazy. It's that you're avoiding negative emotions that a task stirs up. So for me, it's boredom. For a lot of people, it's fear or anxiety.[0:09:59] Dr. Adam Grant: I don't know if I can pull this off. I have an extreme case of imposter syndrome in this role. The the challenge in front of me is too daunting. For some people, it's confusion. I haven't figured it out yet, and so I I can't work on this because I I feel like I'm stuck.[0:10:14] Dr. Adam Grant: So what's I guess the big question for you then, Andrew, is what's What's the emotion that causes you to procrastinate?[0:10:20] Andrew Huberman: You know, it's hard for me to identify the stick here. I think A bit more is the carrot that comes with deadlines. And, again, I I don't consider myself a procrastinator per se. I just really love deadlines, and procrastination is a terrific way to simulate the deadline. So for me[0:10:39] Dr. Adam Grant: So you wait. So you delay starting or finishing a task In order to have a a sense of time pressure.[0:10:45] Andrew Huberman: That's right. It builds a certain amount of internal arousal in need to know, Okay. I've got 72 hours to complete something, and it's now game time. I like the game time before the game time. Before a podcast, I'll put in anywhere from, you know, several days to weeks or even months in preparation.[0:11:04] Andrew Huberman: So it it's really elastic depending on the topic. But when it came to exams in school or if it comes to writing deadlines, I consider the the shipping of the product or the presentation of the live event that I happen to be doing as the 2nd game or event. The first event is the pressure and the excitement of getting into the groove of doing focused work. Because for me, that's such a drug. I mean, it feels like All having all the systems of my brain and body oriented towards one specific thing is just sheer bliss for me.[0:11:41] Dr. Adam Grant: So it it sounds like then you're you're actually not a a chronic procrastinator.[0:11:45] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. At all. I've never that's never been, the way I viewed myself, but now I'll I'll I'll take that.[0:11:50] Dr. Adam Grant: It's a strategy for you. Mhmm.[0:11:52] Andrew Huberman: It is a strategy. That's right. And I I don't you know, I was fairly wayward youth, barely finished high school, etcetera. So by time I got serious about school, which was my Year of university. When deadlines were presented, like, there's an exam there's a midterm exam on a given date, that was exciting to me.[0:12:09] Andrew Huberman: That was exciting. I was like, okay. That's the big thing. That's my opportunity to to prove myself to myself because I was really coming from behind. And then The opportunity to or I should say the the feeling of dropping into that groove, like, this is the exciting part is the preparation.[0:12:25] Andrew Huberman: Likewise, with podcasting for our solo podcast, I love the research as much as I love presenting the material.[0:12:32] Dr. Adam Grant: Maybe more.[0:12:33] Andrew Huberman: Maybe more. Maybe more. Right? Likewise, for university lectures or for traveling and giving seminars as a traditional academic. I'm sure you're familiar with that.[0:12:40] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's like a preparation is where you realize it's almost like I I think of it as somebody like like a miner in a mine and just finding a gem. And, of course, there Then there are all the thoughts of what you can do with that later, and you're gonna show people that it has a certain value to the world, etcetera. But but it's the the searching and finding Those gems that is, like even as I talk about it, I feel like my body's gonna float out of the chair a little bit.[0:13:03] Dr. Adam Grant: I've I've the same experience. It's the it's the the sort of the unleashed curiosity And then the rush of discovery. And by the time you're teaching it or explaining it, like, but I already know this. Like, I'm not learning anything anymore. And, yes, I'm excited to share it, And I hope it's helpful to other people.[0:13:18] Dr. Adam Grant: Mhmm. So, you know, I think as as you talk about what your process looks like, I don't even think what you do qualifies as procrastination, technically.[0:13:27] Andrew Huberman: It seems[0:13:27] Dr. Adam Grant: to be getting better and better. I mean, seriously, if if you think about how procrastination is is defined, it's is delaying despite an expected cost. And you don't think there's a cost. You actually see a benefit.[0:13:39] Andrew Huberman: That's right. And I've tried starting[0:13:40] Dr. Adam Grant: not procrastination. That's just delay.[0:13:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I've tried starting this earlier, and, and I should say that my process often begins much earlier than the physical process. If I was being observed in an experiment, be okay. You know, Andrew's finally sitting down to write this book chapter or, you know, finally sitting down to research Some papers for an episode, but I'm thinking about it all the time. Yeah.[0:14:04] Andrew Huberman: I mean, much to the dismay of people in my life. You know? I'm I'm I'm Constantly thinking about these things. I mean, walking to take out the recycle. I'll have ideas, and then I'll write them down.[0:14:14] Andrew Huberman: I constantly am writing things down, Voice memos into my phone. I have a method of capture where I basically try and just grab everything and then filter out what's useful. Do you have a process like that for For gleaning ideas?[0:14:25] Dr. Adam Grant: A little bit. I do now. So, when when and I started this research on procrastination, She had she had come to me. She's a very creative doctoral student, and she said, I have my best ideas when I'm procrastinating. Mhmm.[0:14:39] Dr. Adam Grant: And it It was it was one of those moments where I didn't believe her, but I thought it was an interesting enough idea that it was worth exploring. And I said, show me. Like, get let's get some data. Let's see if we can we can test this. And she ended up, gathering data in a Korean company where she surveyed people on how often they procrastinate and then got their supervisors to rate their creativity.[0:15:00] Dr. Adam Grant: And sure enough, found that people who procrastinate sometimes were rated as more creative than people who rarely do like me, the procrastinators. And I remember asking her, what about the chronic procrastinators? And she's like, I don't know. They never filled out my survey.[0:15:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. As I recall From that paper, there's, you know, the inverted u shaped function with procrastination on the vertical axis and and, and creativity on the Horizontal access is it? Flip. Sorry. Okay.[0:15:28] Andrew Huberman: So, explain to me then the relationship between procrastination and creativity.[0:15:33] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. So, basically, the the peak of creativity is in the middle of procrastination.[0:15:37] Andrew Huberman: Ah, okay.[0:15:38] Dr. Adam Grant: Got it. And, yeah, there's a there's an upside down u curve there. And so then thought this was fascinating. So then, you know, you we go into the lab to say, can we replicate this? Can we control it in an experiment?[0:15:48] Dr. Adam Grant: And the hardest part of that was, How do you randomly assign people to procrastinate? To my knowledge, never been done before, and we eventually figured out that we could Give people a a bunch of tasks to do and then tempt them with highly entertaining YouTube videos, that were sort of placed on their screen, and we put different numbers of YouTube videos there So that, you know, if there's only 1, you're not tempted to procrastinate much. If there are 4, you're probably gonna get sucked into a little bit of a YouTube spiral. If there are 8, you might be putting off the task that's much less exciting than, than, you know, watching Jimmy Kimball's mean tweets, for example.[0:16:23] Andrew Huberman: And this was done in a fairly naturalistic environment for these folks?[0:16:27] Dr. Adam Grant: People are people are on a a computer. They're they're asked to, you know, to solve some creative problems that look pretty similar to what you Doing your job, and then we're gonna score your creativity later. And, it turned out that the people who were attempted to procrastinate moderately, ended up generating the most creative ideas. So why is that? There are a couple things that happen, and you have to look at both sides of the curve.[0:16:47] Dr. Adam Grant: So what's wrong with the procrastinators and also What happens to the the extreme procrastinators? And in both cases, what happens is, you end up with a little bit of tunnel vision. So, when I dive right into a task, I'm stuck with my first ideas, and I don't wait long enough to incubate and get my best ideas. I'm less likely to reframe the problem. I'm less likely to access remote knowledge because I'm just I'm just diving right in.[0:17:12] Dr. Adam Grant: And meanwhile, the chronic procrastinators, end up in the same boat because they don't get started until the last minute, and so they have to rush ahead with the easiest idea to implement as opposed to really developing the most novel idea. And meanwhile, the the people in the middle who, you know, are starting to feel that pressure of, like, wow. I, you know, I kind of spun my wheels for 10 minutes watching a bunch of YouTube videos. I'm running out of time for Ask. They still have enough time to work on the ideas that were active in the back of their minds, and and that gives them a a shot at more novel ideas.[0:17:41] Dr. Adam Grant: So I've tried to adopt this to answer your question. I've tried to adopt this as my process now to say I will still dive into a project ahead of schedule, but I will not commit to an idea Until I've let it incubate for a few weeks, and I'm working on other things. Whereas an earlier version of me, like, when I'd sit down to write a book, as soon as I had the book idea, I would start writing on day 1. Now I have the idea. I file it away, and I give myself at least a month before I begin drafting.[0:18:06] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think It feels less productive, but it's far more creative.[0:18:11] Andrew Huberman: What are your thoughts about some of what you described Being an unconscious way of seeding the mind and the unconscious with an idea. So for instance, let's take a a School academic scenario where, students get an assignment, and the assignment is contained within a folder. And it just says assignment. Okay. And it's, due on a particular date.[0:18:33] Andrew Huberman: And it says due on that particular date. And they're given the folder, but they have no sense of what the assignment is. You can imagine 1 category of procrastinator that will take that thing and put it down and avoid looking at it entirely versus another category of procrastinator that will flip flip it open and take a look at, okay, this is gonna be an essay on, don't know. Something about economic theory in the late 1700. Close it and then procrastinate.[0:19:01] Andrew Huberman: There is an idea which I, frankly, extensively about the unconscious and how the unconscious mind is always working with ideas, things that we are concerned about, performance, these sorts of things even if we're not aware Them. What what are your thoughts about the creativity that's seeded by slight procrastination being related to actually knowing what you're Procrastinating on specifically.[0:19:32] Dr. Adam Grant: I I think it turns out to be I don't wanna say essential, but critical. Mhmm. So one of the things we found is In order for moderate procrastination to fuel creativity, you have to be intrinsically motivated by the thing you're procrastinating on. Interesting. And so What what happens is if, yeah, if you if you're bored, for example, by the topic, you're not gonna open the folder.[0:19:53] Dr. Adam Grant: You're not gonna start thinking about it at all. It's not gonna begin. You're gonna do any subconscious processing. You're not gonna have any unexpected connections, between this topic and something else you've learned, learned about or or been curious about. If you're interested in the problem, then when you put it off, you're much more likely to still keep it active in the back of your mind.[0:20:13] Dr. Adam Grant: And that's when when you begin to to see you know, I I imagine you could explain the biology of this. I I imagine, for example, there's, there's probably, there are probably more neural networks, that are connecting. You probably get you get access to ideas that previously would have been, of separate nodes. And so I think that you you wanna know what the topic is. Right?[0:20:39] Dr. Adam Grant: You don't wanna just see the blank assignment, but you also have to find a reason that this is exciting to you. Otherwise, you're gonna avoid it as opposed to letting it percolate.[0:20:48] Andrew Huberman: That brings us to the topic of intrinsic motivation, and I'd like to link that up with The topic of performance. So when I was in university, there were many topics that I was excited to learn about some more than others, of course. But occasionally, I'd be in a class or I'd get an assignment that frankly, I'd had minimal interest in. Never zero, but minimal interest. And as a way of dealing with that, I embarked on a process of literally lying to myself and just telling myself, okay.[0:21:19] Andrew Huberman: I'm super interested In reading this, and I'm gonna force myself to be interested in reading it. And lo and behold, I would start falling in love with certain things. Maybe it was It was even the, you know, the arrival of a word that I didn't recognize. And then I would go look it up, and I knew I was studying for the GRE At that time, so I had to file that away. I still have my notebooks of all the vocabulary words that I learned in the course of my university courses that Frankly made the verbal portion of the GRE pretty easy, you know, which if you ever try and study for that at the end, it's pretty tough to commit all those new words to, to memory In context, so I could find little hooks.[0:21:56] Andrew Huberman: And and through those hooks, I could kinda ratchet my way into a larger interest. And then lo and behold, I'm Really interested in Greek mythology, you know, or that actually like that one at first, but, I didn't have to trick myself. But, you know, Maybe we could spend a little bit of time talking about what is true intrinsic motivation. Is it always reflexive? Can we make Ourselves intrinsically motivated about a given topic or scenario or group of people.[0:22:26] Andrew Huberman: And then let's talk about how intrinsic motivation links to Because there's a rich literature on this as I recall, and I remember, you know, the Stanford study of rewarding kids for things that were already[0:22:34] Dr. Adam Grant: intended to be[0:22:35] Andrew Huberman: motivated to do. Maybe we could touch on that a little bit and remind people who haven't heard about it. But I'm fascinated by this topic because I feel like so much of life is about doing things that initially we don't feel that excited to do. Yeah. And yet succeeding in life, you know, until you can afford to offload your, administrative work to somebody else, which hopefully, by, you know, by now you have.[0:22:55] Andrew Huberman: By the[0:22:55] Dr. Adam Grant: way to get it[0:22:56] Andrew Huberman: Right. This is fundamental to being a functional human being, frankly. Not just successful in air quotes, but Functional. We gotta do stuff that we don't enjoy doing.[0:23:07] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. So I think we we can talk about a couple different ways to nurture intrinsic motivation. We can think about How the task itself is designed, we can think about reward systems, and then we can think about also the things we say to ourselves and others, which I hope are not lies, But rather, persuasive attempts. Mhmm. Let's let's start on that one, actually.[0:23:26] Dr. Adam Grant: I I don't know a lot of people who are that good at Liberate self deception.[0:23:31] Andrew Huberman: Well, it well, I like to think it was only around a particular set of, goal motivated pursuits. But at that time for me also is Survival. As I mentioned, I didn't do well in high school. I really want to perform well in university, but I knew that working just for the grade Heightened neuroplasticity. We know it never closes, but, but I think I also fell in love with the process of learning how to do what I just described.[0:24:05] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. So I think for most people, the best method of self persuasion is actually to convince somebody else. Something of Elliot Aronson's classic research on cognitive dissonance where He would he would ask you to go and tell somebody else a task you hated is really interesting. And if he paid you a lot to do it, You still hated the task because you had a justification. Like, I got $20 to, you know, to kinda fib a little bit about this task.[0:24:32] Dr. Adam Grant: You know, the task is bad, but I did it for the for the payment. When he paid you $1 to go and tell somebody that you loved a task that you didn't, You ended up liking it more.[0:24:42] Andrew Huberman: Wow. And maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but maybe you should tell me why I shouldn't be surprised. Wow. Because I hope people got what just said very clearly, Ed, if they didn't if you don't like doing something, going and reporting to somebody else how great that thing is, so lying about it to somebody else, is one way to increase the degree to which you like or enjoy that behavior or topic. And if you're paid $20 To go lie to somebody in the positive direction, so against your true belief, it's less effective in shifting your Underlying affect about that thing, your emotions, then if you're paid less.[0:25:19] Andrew Huberman: Correct?[0:25:20] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. Exactly. Now I think, obviously, in the experiment, Lying was, an easy way to to show the effect. But in real life, I think the way that you wanna apply this is to say, alright. I've gotta find something about this task That's interesting to me.[0:25:33] Dr. Adam Grant: And then in the process of explaining it to somebody else, I'm gonna convince myself because I'm hearing the argument from somebody I already like and trust. And I've also chosen No. I've chosen the the reasons that I find compelling as opposed to hearing somebody else's reasons. And so I think this this goes to the point that you were making, which is if if you're trying to to find a hook to make a topic intriguing, you've gotta figure out, okay, what is it that would make this fascinating to me? And, you know, in a lot of cases, what you're looking for is a curiosity Gap.[0:26:05] Dr. Adam Grant: I I think social scientists like to talk about curiosity as an itch that you have to scratch. So there's something you wanna know, And you don't know it yet. So I would say I'd I'd tell my students often, like, take your least favorite class and find a mystery or a puzzle. Like, something that you you just do not know the answer to. Like, I've actually, I've talked with our kids about this.[0:26:26] Dr. Adam Grant: Like, what what really happened to King Tut? Do you know? Can you get to the bottom of that? And all of a sudden, you're like, I wonder. I I need to Google it, and then I need to see if Wikipedia has credible information on this.[0:26:36] Dr. Adam Grant: And the more you learn about that, the more intriguing it becomes. And I think that's that's the beginning of the process of of finding intrinsic motivation.[0:26:44] Andrew Huberman: I see. So inherent in your answer is the idea that there's something wired into our neural circuits, and therefore, psychology, that curiosity as a verb, the act of being curious and seeking information Where well and I should say, I define curiosity, and I hopefully, you'll disagree with me or agree. Either way, it doesn't matter as long as we can get a bit deeper understanding. I define curiosity as A desire to find something out where you are not attached to a particular outcome. Yes.[0:27:17] Andrew Huberman: Is that right?[0:27:17] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I'd I'd in psychology, it's typically defined as wanting to know. Mhmm. And that means you're driven by the question, not a particular answer, which is exactly what you're driving at.[0:27:26] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Great. So and I think it was Dorothy Parker that Said, the cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.[0:27:34] Dr. Adam Grant: As there there shouldn't be a care For curiosity. Right.[0:27:36] Andrew Huberman: So, and by the way, folks, we don't know what neural circuits subserve curiosity in the brain is. Gotta be a distributed network. There's no brain area for curiosity, but it's gotta be linked up with the reward systems of dopamine, etcetera in some way. Because when one discovers something new That satisfies some curiosity that's clearly, there's a there's a internal reward there. Okay.[0:27:59] Andrew Huberman: Let me back up. So If your child or an adult is dreading working exploring a topic or Going about an assignment of any kind. You will give them a question that they then need to resolve. What if the the assignment is like, rake the leaves off the front Lawn. Do you, do you say, you know, count the leaves?[0:28:22] Andrew Huberman: Or I mean, how how does one get, past the sort of, Procrastination and, generate some intrinsic motivation for things that one dreads where it's unlikely that they're going to discover some knowledge that's exceedingly useful for the for future.[0:28:37] Dr. Adam Grant: You always start with with okay. What's what's the first experiment I can run? Find the most interesting looking leaf for your favorite leaf, and then that that Last for about 2 minutes and okay. Now we still have a lot of leaves there.[0:28:47] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:28:47] Dr. Adam Grant: I think not all tasks can be made intrinsically motivating to everyone. And so when when intrinsic motivation is difficult to find, what you wanna substitute with is, is a sense of purpose. Maybe a better way to say that is, when the process is not interesting to you, you need to find a meaningful outcome. So there's, there's some research on, on the boring but important effect Where kids who have a purpose for learning, this goes through high school, and think, you know, this is not just interesting to me, but I'm gonna be able to use this knowledge to, to help other people one day. They they're more persistent in their studying.[0:29:23] Dr. Adam Grant: They end up getting better grades. And so I think, you know, intrinsic motivation is often driven by Curiosity about the how. A sense of purpose comes from really thinking hard about the why. Why does this matter? And so I I'd say with the, know, the raking leaves, let's try to connect that task to something that else that you care about.[0:29:40] Dr. Adam Grant: Are you going to, you know, pleasantly surprise your parents When they get home, are you going to, you know, have a place to play soccer that you didn't before? And I think then the, you know, The the process of of getting to that, I guess what I'd say is, like, if you're trying to motivate yourself, it's a little bit harder than if you're trying to motivate somebody else This, if I was gonna motivate somebody else, I would take a a page out of the motivational interviewing playbook where I would say, okay, Andrew. Actually, this plays out for a second. So you're gonna rake a pile of leaves. It's a 2 hour 0 to 10, how excited are you about that?[0:30:15] Andrew Huberman: A 3. 3. Really? Mhmm.[0:30:18] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm surprised. I I thought you're gonna say 0 or Why is it not lower?[0:30:23] Andrew Huberman: I like any sort of physical activity because it allows me to move, and I just like moving my body.[0:30:28] Dr. Adam Grant: There we go. Okay. So you just identified a potential source of purpose for that activity. Mhmm. And I'm I don't have a I don't have a vested interested in convincing you to do this task.[0:30:37] Dr. Adam Grant: I am genuinely curious about what would motivate you to want to do it. And as you start to articulate it, boom, self persuasion kicks[0:30:46] Andrew Huberman: Love it. I'm gonna start using these, these approaches.[0:30:50] Dr. Adam Grant: Try it at your own risk.[0:30:53] Andrew Huberman: As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course, our physical health, but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning, our memory, our ability to learn new things, and to focus. And we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality, unprocessed, or minimally processed sources, as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically all the cellular functions in our body, including the gut microbiome. Now I, like most everybody, try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods. Ideally, mostly from minimally processed or nonprocessed foods. However, one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and probiotics that often accompany those fruits and That's why way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG one.[0:31:45] Andrew Huberman: And so I'm delighted that AG one is sponsoring the Huberman Lab Podcast. The reason I started taking AG one and the reason I still drink AG one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it provides insurance That I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to try AG one, you can go to drink agone.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They're giving away 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of Vitamin d three k two.[0:32:18] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drinkagone.com/huberman to claim that special offer. I have a question about extrinsic motivation. So if We grow up being incentivized by extrinsic things. You know? You'll get your allowance if you Do blank.[0:32:39] Andrew Huberman: You can spend the money that you make in, you know, on your paper route doing the things you really want to do. Is there any value in those kinds of learning based incentives, for kids and for adults? Because, I mean, that's the real world as Well, I know I know plenty of people. I have family members that only work for a paycheck, and they're pretty okay because they like Spending their paycheck. Yeah.[0:33:03] Andrew Huberman: Probably more than I you know, I'm not intrinsically attached to money. I mean, I certainly have needs in in life, but but I don't Enjoy spending money for the sake of spending it or for gaining more possessions. But I know people that do, and I certainly don't judge. Are they somehow existing in a, in the diminished landscape of happiness? Or or because they seem pretty happy to me.[0:33:26] Andrew Huberman: But they seem to have also worked out this relationship. They do certain things to get the extrinsic rewards, and they really enjoy what they can do with those extrinsic rewards.[0:33:35] Dr. Adam Grant: There's a so there's a huge body of evidence on what are the effects of extrinsic rewards on motivation and performance. And I think the latest conclusions, if you look at the the latest meta analysis, so, you know, huge study of studies trying to accumulate, like, what's the average effect of adding a financial incentive to a task that wasn't incentivized before or to a job where, you know, you were paid salary, and now we're gonna give you compensation. There is a boost. So in general, people are, are more productive When they're incentivized for their output. But, these incentives are better for, for motivating quantity than quality.[0:34:12] Dr. Adam Grant: So you see people get more done, they're not necessarily more careful or more thorough.[0:34:17] Andrew Huberman: Are they less careful unless thorough?[0:34:19] Dr. Adam Grant: No. Actually, there there's still positive effects on average. They're just weaker. And, of course, you could then start to say, well, how do I incentivize, you know, being fast and careful? Mhmm.[0:34:30] Dr. Adam Grant: But I think Where where we do have to be really cautious is, there's an undermining effect of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation, and you were you were alluding to this earlier dating back the early seventies where we know that if we take an interesting task and then we pay you for it, you might conclude that you're only doing it for the outcome, And you lose interest in the task. So the the classic demonstration, Mark Lepper and colleagues is kids playing video games, and they're, they're playing them because they're fun, and then you start to add in a an incentive. And then when the incentive's taken away, they don't wanna play anymore because the meaning of the task has changed. And now I'm doing it because I wanna get something out of it as opposed to I love the process. I think that that, that phenomenon, does not have to exist.[0:35:13] Dr. Adam Grant: So we know, for example, at work, if managers, as long as they give people autonomy, they don't present the rewards in a controlling way. So instead of saying, you know, Andrew, in order to earn this, you need to do the following work. If they say, hey. Look. You know, I'd really love it if you, you know, if you would deliver the following.[0:35:34] Dr. Adam Grant: And in order to make that worth your while, I'm offering this incentive. People react very differently when they have a sense of choice and control. So I think that that's, I guess, the starting point. In the presence of autonomy, I don't I don't think there's a major downside of of extrinsic rewards. I think you also have to be careful that, yeah, I guess that you're not over justifying the task.[0:35:55] Dr. Adam Grant: In other words, you're not, you're not Swapping people's intrinsic reason for doing it, but you're adding a reason to try it. So, actually, if we if we go to a different domain for a second. So, Look at kids who don't wanna eat their vegetables. Exterans and incentives are very effective to get kids to try vegetables for the first time. But then the hope is that they discover a vegetable or two that they don't mind, and then they find reasons to keep doing it.[0:36:24] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think that that's how I want a lot of rewards to work. I don't think that rewards should be carrots that we dangle to try to control people's behavior. I think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate and value a particular behavior. And if you frame them that way, it's a lot easier for people to say, yeah. You know what?[0:36:41] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm that that reward is something that I really want, but I'm I'm not only doing the task for that reward.[0:36:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That You basically answered the question I was going to ask, which is and you're at risk of sounding, but we are sitting in California. I could imagine that when one is focused on the extrinsic rewards, so a physical task or a cognitive task for an extrinsic reward, If I'm focusing on the extrinsic reward, I'm also, air quotes again, not present. Right? I'm I'm thinking about the outcome.[0:37:14] Andrew Huberman: I'm not thinking about process. And I think there's and perhaps you can, flush out some of what this is exactly, but I think there's a fairly extensive, data to support the idea that when we are physically and mentally present to the task that we're going to perform better. And, presumably, our our, Or, intrinsic liking of that task or performing that task increases as well. Is that true?[0:37:37] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I think so. I think So if we wanna break down the mechanisms for why intrinsic motivation is useful for for performance, 1 you touched on earlier, it's focus of attention. You're it's much easier to find flow when you're intrinsically motivated. You get into that state of deep absorption where, time melts away.[0:37:52] Dr. Adam Grant: So you mentioned, you know, sort of Either speeding up or slowing down your your sense of time. You forget where you are. Sometimes you even lose track of your identity, and you're just, you're just merged into the task. And so that that that concentration is helpful. There's also a a greater persistence effect that when you enjoy what you're doing, you're less likely to give up in the face of Goals, you're more likely to think about it when you're not doing the task and come up with great ideas.[0:38:16] Dr. Adam Grant: And so, you know, I think there's a working harder. There's a working longer. There's a working smarter, and there's also a thinking more clearly effect.[0:38:26] Andrew Huberman: This is a, brief but related tangent. One of the things that I found incredibly difficult In recent years is that, you know, most of my life, really since I was a small kid, I was forging for things, and then, you know, I used to give Lectures on Monday in class if they let me until they eventually stop me about the stuff I was reading about all weekend. So got an early start in the in the professorial, front. But now, if I'm reading something and I discover what I think is a really valuable piece of information or a tool or a protocol. Like, wow.[0:39:00] Andrew Huberman: This is really cool. These findings are, oh, so cool. There's a problem, which is that now I have an opportunity to cast that out to the world through social media. We all do. This could be a Wait.[0:39:13] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm sorry. You're on media?[0:39:15] Andrew Huberman: From time to time. I do what[0:39:17] Dr. Adam Grant: You're all over my page.[0:39:18] Andrew Huberman: You and and I both do our own social media, by the way, which I really appreciate. Thank you. One can always if if someone else is handling someone's social media. So, yes, I'm on social media, and and I love that I have the opportunity to both, send out ideas and information and also receive feedback. I really love the comment section, and always encourage comments.[0:39:37] Andrew Huberman: I I learned from it, frankly.[0:39:39] Dr. Adam Grant: Love is a strong word.[0:39:40] Andrew Huberman: I learned from it. You know? And and you and I were weaned in the academic culture where, frankly, the the kind of hazing that that one receives in academic culture is very different than the kind of hazing that one receives on Social media, but, let's just say that if you come up through academia, you develop a pretty thick skin.[0:39:55] Dr. Adam Grant: I agree with that. I I do have to say, though, that there there was a part of me that was really when I started posting on social that I love I love constructive criticism. I was unprepared for the number of people who will knee jerk criticize study without even looking at whether the methods are rigorous.[0:40:10] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:40:11] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm like, come on. If I posted this, surely, it's at least worth considering the possibility that there's strong evidence Right.[0:40:16] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's where a, a, a brief, I wanna call it a rhetoric, but a response of, you know, you know, Clearly, you should read the study further because I think you'll be satisfied with the answer or something. I don't know. But I agree. It it can be a little bit in there sometimes. But, you know, the social media, channels are I think have you know, they have it's a double edged blade.[0:40:41] Andrew Huberman: They obviously have their issues, but, can be a wonderful opportunity to share information and share it quickly. The problem is that it takes me out of what I was doing initially, which was learning, searching for those gems with with which to share later. And I think there's a broader landscape to consider this where people, for instance, are, I was at the beach yesterday. It was Just absolutely spectacular day at the beach, especially for this time of year. And everyone was taking pictures of that experience on their phone And probably sharing that experience either social media or with friends, this is very different than taking a photograph and Not seeing that photograph until later or not sending it out.[0:41:20] Andrew Huberman: And so there are now near infinite number of circumstances where We are taken out of the rewarding experience. I should rephrase that. We are taking ourselves out of the rewarding experience and focusing on a different Rewarding experience that, I think, by definition, is an extrinsic reward. So we are taking ourselves out of our intrinsically rewarding experiences and activating these extrinsic rewards. And do you think in any way that's undermining our experience of things that we really enjoy?[0:41:51] Andrew Huberman: Again, not to demonize social media or these channels, but Yeah. I've personally found it difficult to refrain from Sharing this knowledge, I'm so excited to share, but I deliberately delay. And there's a lot I have a deep list of folders full of things that I wanna post, But I'm just doing it, you know, systematically over time because I really fight the temptation to to do this mostly because I want to continue to enjoy this learning process in this seeking process so much.[0:42:18] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I I feel the same the same, I feel torn. I think I think it was EB White who said, I I rise in the morning torn between the desire to enjoy the world and the desire to improve the world, and this makes it difficult to plan the day. And I I I feel that every day. I think I mean, I I even I felt it this morning.[0:42:39] Dr. Adam Grant: I was like, okay. It's time to it's time to leave to To come to the the Huberman podcast, I'm like, wait. But I I I didn't hit my minimum sunlight viewing. So what what do I do? Do I show up on time for you, or do I meet your criteria?[0:42:53] Andrew Huberman: The the, the explanation, I was getting my morning sunlight, And, therefore, I'm x number of minutes or even hours late would have been completely fine I feel too much. Yes. Absolutely.[0:43:03] Dr. Adam Grant: That's a built in acceptable excuse with you. I think I mean, I I think everybody experiences a version of this, and, it's definitely gotten worse with, with social media and with smart Bones. I think so one of the the most startling data points for me was, the Gloria Mark first put this on my radar. Before COVID, The average person was checking email 72 times a day. How do you ever concentrate for more than a couple minutes if you're self interrupting that often?[0:43:32] Dr. Adam Grant: You can't. Brigitte has a great term for this. She she calls it time confetti. And she says we're taking these meaningful blocks of time, and we're slicing them up into these, Tiny little dots of confetti. And, not only can we not accomplish anything, we're also eroding our own sense of joy, Because it's really hard to enjoy the, you know, the 32nd blip of time that you get on a task.[0:43:57] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think We know a lot more about the existence of these problems than than how to solve them, but one thing we do know is, blocking out on Interrupted time is meaningful. There's a great Leslie Perlo experiment where she takes engineers, and she has them, she sets a quiet time policy. No interruptions Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon. 65% above average productivity.[0:44:20] Andrew Huberman: Could you repeat the, the protocol, again?[0:44:23] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. So quiet there are a couple iterations of it, but I think the most effective one was Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. No meetings, no interruptions, no Slack, no emails before noon.[0:44:33] Andrew Huberman: And during those periods of no interruptions, one could tend to whatever their primary purpose is at work. Yeah. You have Testing. Obviously, I would don't have my phone in here and never do. But it doesn't mean no interaction with anyone else.[0:44:48] Andrew Huberman: It means focusing on the major task.[0:44:50] Dr. Adam Grant: The task. Exactly. And you come in with a clear sense of priority and purpose. And I don't think there's anything magical about Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon. It's just the idea of setting a boundary and collectively committing to it that that seems to be important.[0:45:03] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think, you know, I when I think about this, I'd be I'd be really curious about your take on, on chronotypes here because I think one thing I've learned in the last couple years is that if you're a if you're a morning person, you do your best analytical and creative thinking in the morning, and so the quiet time block would work very well for for me as a morning person. If you're a night owl, you probably want that block in the late afternoon. And I was encouraged. There's there was some evidence during COVID that, people have their best meetings right after lunch, that they're something like 30% less likely to multitask in an after lunch meeting. And I guess, you know, you you could probably unpack the, like, the, you know, getting reenergized by other people, but It's led me to wonder if we should all be protecting the 1st few hours and the last few hours of the day for deep work and then doing our core meetings and interactions and kind of off task activities in the middle.[0:45:57] Dr. Adam Grant: What do you think about that as a sequence?[0:45:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, I have a lot of questions about this for you, but, I love that sequence. It certainly fits with my natural rhythms. I I think there's ample evidence to support the fact that provided one is Sleeping well at night and is on a more or less a standard schedule. When I say standard, I mean, going to bed somewhere between, let's say, 9:30 and 11:30 PM, waking up sometime between, Let's say, 6 AM and 8 AM, maybe 5:30 or 7:30, something like that.[0:46:26] Andrew Huberman: So not highly unusual night owl or super early bird. For people that are following that sort of schedule, the first let's just say from 0 to 8 hours after waking, there tends to be a a fairly robust increase in all the catecholamines. So dopamine, Norepinephrine, epinephrine, which generally okay. Generally speaking, lead to increases in alertness, attention, and focus that are great for analytic work, Great for implementation of strategies that you already understand and you need to churn through a lot of stuff. And of course, there's a big Increase in the morning, especially if you view morning sunlight.[0:47:07] Andrew Huberman: A healthy increase, I should say, in cortisol. Cortisol is not bad, folks. You you want cortisol, but you want that peak early in the day. We know that. Okay.[0:47:13] Andrew Huberman: So, for most people, it seems at least my understanding is that, that period of time, 0 to 8 or, 8 hours after waking Or so, is best devoted to the quote, unquote most critical tasks. But one of the common problems is that people take that, ability to implement a known strategy, and they start battering back all the emails. Or talking to all by the way, talking to coworkers great, and it's often required, but it's what the question is whether or not it's productive conversation or whether or not it's just conversation. And we tend to have a lot of energy Early in the day. And I'm I'm obsessed with the idea of neural energy as opposed to just caloric energy.[0:47:53] Andrew Huberman: So there we're talking about neural energy. And then post lunch So really, as we get to this sort of, you know, 9 to 17 hours after waking, there is a dip in autonomic arousal that During the middle of the day, that post perennial dip, those are post lunch sleepiness, that can be partially offset by delaying your morning caffeine a bit if you have the afternoon crash. But it's interesting that you know more productive meetings and less task switching and distraction occurred, in meetings set after lunch because That makes me think that perhaps being a little bit less alert is going to lend itself to more focus. And, indeed, that's the the sort of optimal state, relaxed but focused. You know?[0:48:34] Andrew Huberman: You're not sleepy, but you also don't have so much Intrinsic energy that you're, you know, tending to a bunch of things, because I think a lot of people do feel that way. You know? And I'm drinking, you know, double espresso right now, late mid morning, late morning. And, you know, I can sit still, but I think, certain Zoom meetings how do I say this? I don't wanna offend any of my colleagues.[0:48:55] Andrew Huberman: I mean, they they are boring enough. Like, they are not content rich enough to, to grab all my attention. And nowadays, of course, there are multiple screens. Typically, I've got 2 phones and a computer, and you have to really spend some work to flip over those phones while I'm on a Zoom and things like that.[0:49:10] Dr. Adam Grant: So[0:49:10] Andrew Huberman: maybe it's[0:49:10] Dr. Adam Grant: were you saying? I was[0:49:11] Andrew Huberman: gonna say So it's maybe the reduction in autonomic arousal that that supports what you just described, but I don't know. My my thinking, or my understanding rather was that creative work and kind of brainstorming Was best accomplished in the late afternoon. I've noticed when lecturing, I'd be curious what your experience is with, in university lectures, when I held courses in the evening, I used to like to hold my courses 5 to 7 PM or even 7 to 9:30 PM I was teaching undergraduates, that people were much looser and more relaxed, and I always, thought that that might have something to do with an increase in GABA transmission that's known to happen late in late evening. The people are just kinda more relaxed, more and less social anxiety. They've been around people for much of the day.[0:49:59] Andrew Huberman: And, Lauren, I I I send back more reflections than answers. I I don't have any firm neuroscience explanations for what you described, but but there are some emerging theories about how that work, and it has this 0 to 9 hours, phase 1, 9 to 17 hours, phase 2. And then, of course, from 17 to 24 hours, I'll call it phase 3. You should be asleep. Yeah.[0:50:18] Andrew Huberman: Ideally.[0:50:18] Dr. Adam Grant: Well, that I I think there's there's a there's a confound in your your teaching experience, which is Undergrads often sleep in until, what, noon, or they might be up until 4 AM.[0:50:28] Andrew Huberman: Or at least 10 AM seems to be a typical rise time for the undergrad.[0:50:32] Dr. Adam Grant: So a morning class might be too early for them to be fully awake, but there is, there's some brand new evidence that I at least on creativity at I read a a series of I think it was 3 studies recently showing that early birds actually did do more creative work in the morning. And in part, I think, again, the I don't I I don't think any neuroscientist has has touched the mechanisms on this yet, but in terms of the psychological processes, early on, there's just there seems to be a benefit of, of the energy level, and some of that energy leads to more divergent thinking. And later, if you're a morning person, you might lose the ability to to diverge quite as much, and so you end up in a more conventional space of thought. Does that does that track at all with your understanding of how it might play out in the brain?[0:51:16] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is to be a little bit in it would be individual, but, You know, there is something to these liminal states between sleep and waking. So maybe we can, wrap a convenient bow around what, I said in what you what you just said, which is, that we know that in the transition states into and out of sleep, And it doesn't necessarily have to be within the 1st half hour in and out of sleep that, there seems to be more divergent. Thank you. Or at least activation of neural networks So that, are not as constrained as one observes when they're in a in a sheer task and strategy implementation mode. Right?[0:51:51] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I think[0:51:52] Dr. Adam Grant: Is that similar to the shower effect? Mhmm.[0:51:54] Andrew Huberman: The shower effect. So people have ideas in the shower or while running or, while falling asleep or My best ideas always come within the 1st hour after waking. That's why I carry a notebook around and, much to the dismay of people in my life. Oftentimes, I I don't wanna hear or Talk to anyone first thing in the morning. This is problematic, and I had to make adjustments.[0:52:14] Andrew Huberman: We'll talk about adjustments between, productivity and control and and family interactions. This is something I know you've you've worked on and and written about. But those liminal states are are interesting. And and I'd love your thoughts on this. I've had several guests on this podcast talk about their creative process, namely Rick Rubin, is famous for his work in music producing.[0:52:38] Andrew Huberman: Also has a great podcast, Tetra Grammaton, As well as Carl Deisseroth, a colleague of mine who's really in the 0.0001% of, super talented bioengineers neuroscientists who also Carl's process involves the following. Late at night for him, but it could really be any time of day, deliberately making his body as Still as possible and forcing himself to think in complete sentences. Rick's creative process, although it includes a lot of different things, has a lot to do with also getting very still, lying down. Okay. Other folks that I've spoken to, academics and and artists, have referred to getting their body into motion but quieting their mind.[0:53:31] Andrew Huberman: So these are 2 opposite processes. One case, The body is still, but the mind is deliberately very active. In the other scenario, the body is very active, but they're making their mind Sort of in free association, not still, but they're not deliberately thinking about any one thing. Fascinating. And I'm obsessed with this.[0:53:48] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you and I could work on this. You know, I'm due for a sabbatical. Maybe we could figure this out because I You've never[0:53:53] Dr. Adam Grant: seen anyone study this before?[0:53:54] Andrew Huberman: Right. Because the the, the nervous I'm not aware of anyone who has done it formally either. The nervous system, of course, is a is a brain body phenomenon. And so what happens when we sort of cut off the deliberate operations of brain or body? And it it doesn't seem to matter whether or not of brain or body.[0:54:09] Andrew Huberman: And it it doesn't seem to matter whether or not it's brain or body as long as one is deliberately shut off. And so, anyway, I'd love your thoughts on this. I don't consider myself, like, a ultra creative or creative type, to any great degree. But[0:54:21] Dr. Adam Grant: Me neither. That's why,[0:54:23] Andrew Huberman: but I'm fascinated studying it. Right. But I'm[0:54:24] Dr. Adam Grant: doing it.[0:54:25] Andrew Huberman: Right. But that's but I'm fascinated by these deliberate tactics that highly creative people have have, undertaken, in order to bring about ideas. I certainly have some of my best ideas when I'm running, and I'll just be running along like, my goodness. I wasn't even thinking. But now I need to write this Down okay and then continue.[0:54:44] Andrew Huberman: I tried the approach, and the the Rubin approach actually just spent a week with Rick, overseas. And, Indeed, he spends a lot of time just still thinking, and it's a very hard practice to to get, to get consistent with.[0:54:59] Dr. Adam Grant: I wonder I wonder if there are individual differences here on on which needs to be stable or steady. I'm think you know, I'm thinking about a huge part of creativity is, is overriding your default instincts. And if you're somebody whose default is to have your mind constantly going, Then quieting would probably shift your your train of thought to something more original or unconventional. The opposite be true. If you have a naturally quiet mind, I would imagine you need to you need to sort of jolt yourself out of that with lots of access to, You know, to free ranging thoughts.[0:55:33] Dr. Adam Grant: And so, it'd be interesting actually to study whether we can predict what you should still based on your personality.[0:55:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I want and maybe what we could do with that study, I think we have a collaboration brewing. You know, there's a joke, you know, 22 scientists walk into a room and what comes out is a collaboration. So I'd wanna put people in a scanner. It's hard to get people treadmilling in a scanner because of movement artifact.[0:55:55] Andrew Huberman: But and just look at net, resting network activation[0:55:59] Dr. Adam Grant: Mhmm.[0:55:59] Andrew Huberman: And compare that to resting network activation when people are completely still and forcing themselves to think in deliberate deliberate sense. And then look Get the overlap in that Venn diagram. That's what's of interest to me. They may be completely different brain states. They might actually have more similarity than differences.[0:56:16] Dr. Adam Grant: I wonder then if you can tie that to differences in the quality and quantity of output. So I would imagine that one of the benefits of either kind of movement is that you, you end up increasing the volume of ideas, which we know is good for variety and ultimately increases the probability that you stumble onto something new. But then I think this the being still part is probably better for the filtering process of I think one of the hardest parts of creativity is actually judging your own most most creative people have many terrible ideas. In fact, the most creative people have the most horrible ideas, because they just have a lot of ideas. And, I think that maybe there's a there's a way in which quieting either your body and or your mind allows you to gain some distance from the idea and see whether it's boneheaded or promising.[0:57:06] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a Tracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information.[0:57:37] Andrew Huberman: With InsideTracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized form that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, etcetera, but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to Nutrition, behavioral modification, supplements, etcetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, go to insidetracker .com/huberman. As a Cyber Monday sale, which will include Monday, November 27th, and Tuesday, November 28th, InsideTracker is offering 50% off their full website. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman. Along those lines, when one is trying to gauge the quality of their ideas, how do you cope with, Or how does one cope with not placing a judge on that that, causes some, you know, false negatives where you're where you're wiping out great ideas?[0:58:31] Andrew Huberman: Because, you know, Rick Rubin talks a lot about, you know, don't give the audience what they want. They don't know what they want. They haven't seen it yet. If it's a truly creative idea, they haven't seen it. And, but, of course, we all have to develop our own sense of taste.[0:58:46] Andrew Huberman: So, well, how does this process work for you? I mean, you've written about and worked on a tremendous range of topics, and always, you know, I must say with with such rigor and such clarity of communication about those topics. Yeah. It's absolutely true. I mean, like, 100%.[0:59:02] Andrew Huberman: So we say around here, no weak sauce.[0:59:04] Dr. Adam Grant: You know?[0:59:04] Andrew Huberman: And That's a great phrase. There's no weak sauce in your game. It's incredible. So, When do you get your ideas, and how do you filter those ideas?[0:59:15] Dr. Adam Grant: I feel like the when could be anytime. I think the I mean, you've you've you've clearly experienced this too. For me, the best thing about hosting a podcast is I have an excuse to learn about anything I want from almost anyone I want, and I get to call that part of my job. And so I feel like, you know, that having that built in mechanism for learning means ideas could could come at any moment. The the filtering process for me is, it's evolved over the last few years.[0:59:42] Dr. Adam Grant: What I what I do now is if I'm let's say I'm I'm starting a new book, I'll write a draft of the 1st chapter, and I send it to 5 to 8 people whose judgment I trust. And by design, some of those people are in my field. They're, you know, deep seated in organizational psychology. Others are, you know, very far outside, but curious about the topics I'm interested in, and I asked them for a 0 to 10 score. This is something I learned to do as a as a springboard diver, where, you know, I would I would Take off, and, you know, I'm doing a a few flips or twists.[1:00:16] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think my dive is good, but I can't see it because I'm hurling in midair, and it's a everything's a blur. So I have to rely on my coach to tell me if it was any good. I feel like creative work is the same way. You're too close to it to know how the audience is gonna react to it. And, yes, you don't wanna create it just for the audience, but at the end of the day, you want it to be, you know, interesting or useful to them.[1:00:36] Dr. Adam Grant: So I asked for the 0 to 10, And no one ever says 10, and then I use that as a calibration mechanism. So if everybody is in the 7 or 8 range, know that I'm onto something promising, and now I need to refine it. If I get a bunch of twos, threes, 3a halfs, I either need to rethink the idea or dramatically rewrite how I'm positioning it. And I think one of the mistakes a lot of people make is they know they need feedback on their ideas. They go to 1 or 2 people, and they start to feel a little bit defensive or threatened, and their ego gets involved, and then they don't ask for anymore.[1:01:13] Dr. Adam Grant: What they don't realize is it's actually less painful if you get more feedback. Because when 8 different people critique your work, you start to realize that a few of the comments that Sort of bruise you a little bit. We're just idiosyncratic, and no one else cared about those issues. But then 5 people had the same problem. Like, that is not taste.[1:01:31] Dr. Adam Grant: That is a quality issue, and I've gotta focus on that. And so it really helps to filter what are the what are the revisions I need to make? What are the problems and complaints I need to pay attention to? Versus what can I ignore? Because maybe this product was not for that person.[1:01:45] Andrew Huberman: I'm recalling when I was a postdoc. I had a manuscript fully prepared, and I worked in a laboratory where I didn't work on the same thing is my postdoc adviser. He was very gracious in letting me be the outlier. And he said, well, I don't know anything about this topic. So before you submit it to this Fairly prestigious very, frankly, very prestigious journal.[1:02:05] Andrew Huberman: I'll be honest. You should probably go down the hall and hand it to so and so. I don't wanna mention who it was because I'm still in the same department. And I gave it to him, this individual, and he looked out and he said, yeah. You know, it looks interesting, but I I don't think there's gonna be a whole lot of interest in this.[1:02:20] Andrew Huberman: Just, like, not I was like, no way. Like, this I think this is really cool. But I was pretty dismayed. So I was like, oh gosh. What do I do?[1:02:28] Andrew Huberman: So I went back to my adviser, and, thankfully, he's a bit of an iconoclast. And he said, that's the best feedback you could have gotten. Definitely submit it to that particular journal. And I must say that paper got accepted faster than any other paper. I've never had an experience like that.[1:02:43] Andrew Huberman: I mean, it required some revisions. I remember thinking like, wow. What an unusual Response to after having instructed me to go ask a a a more senior colleague, right, he's a, at that time, assistant professor, and then to get the Essentially, negative response and then to take that as, like, you should definitely send it out. Really taught me a lesson that sometimes one needs to invert their, their action according, to the negative feedback they get. Not always, but, that was an n of 1.[1:03:11] Andrew Huberman: Okay? So it's not, shouldn't be extrapolated to too many circumstances. But, This led me to, not seek out, feedback prior to submission of things terribly often. I mean, I check information, obviously, prior to podcast. I check the validity of the information in podcasts and papers, but, it made me realize that people's opinions can be, Like, highly idiosyncratic and and, in some cases, outright wrong.[1:03:38] Andrew Huberman: And, really, the the opinion of the journal is what what mattered most in in terms of getting accepted or not. So, how do you you said give it to the greatest number of people. But if it's anything like comments on media, there's a salience to negative comments. So how should we filter positive versus negative feedback?[1:03:58] Dr. Adam Grant: Well, there's a there's a meta analysis here. This is Kluger and Denise, looking at a 100 years of feedback research, and they found that what drives the utility of feedback is not whether it's positive or negative. It's whether it focuses on the task or on the self. So if I tell you that Your work is terrible. You're gonna get defensive.[1:04:19] Dr. Adam Grant: If I tell you that your work is great, you're gonna get complacent. If I tell you, here's the specific thing that I liked about your work, you're gonna try to learn to repeat that. And if I tell you, here's the thing I didn't like, You're gonna try to see if you can fix it. So I actually think we should worry less about whether the feedback is encouraging or discouraging And more about how do I make sure that I get input that's gonna allow me to learn from my strengths and also overcome my weaknesses? And, actually, I, one of the things I've I've learned recently is there's some, I would say, growing body of evidence at this point that Asking for feedback is not the best way to get people to help you, because when you ask for feedback, you end up getting 2 groups of people.[1:05:00] Dr. Adam Grant: You get cheerleaders, and you get critics. And cheerleaders are basically applauding your best self. Critics are attacking your worst self. What you want is a coach, which is somebody who helps you become a better version of yourself. And the way you get people to coach you is not to say give me feedback because they will then look at the past and tell you what you screwed up or what you did right.[1:05:19] Dr. Adam Grant: What you want is to say, can you give me advice for next time. And then they look at the future, and they'll give you either a note on something to repeat or something to correct. And this is such a subtle shift that it can make a big difference. Andrew, one of the things I've, I guess, I found myself applying this to a lot is, after giving speeches. I used to get off stage and say, I'd love some feedback.[1:05:40] Dr. Adam Grant: And you get back a bunch of, oh, you know, I really enjoyed that. Thanks. What do I do with that information? I'm trying to learn how to get better. And when I shift the question to say, what's the one thing I could do better next time?[1:05:51] Dr. Adam Grant: It's like, oh, don't open with a joke. The audience couldn't tell you were joking. Frequently, it's give me a little bit more of a through line. You focused a lot on, you know, a bunch of interesting points, but I lost the connective tissue. And, you know, those those actionable suggestions are much more likely to come when you just ask for a tip as opposed to an evaluation.[1:06:12] Andrew Huberman: Oh, that's so good. I think I'm gonna just pause a second, I've never taken a pause. I've taken occasional pause for, to be honest, but they're very rare, as the audience knows. Oh, that that's just gazillion dollar advice because I think that Everyone has an ego. We all want to perform well.[1:06:37] Andrew Huberman: We'd like to perform better over time, and negative feedback hurts. And it can hurt a little or a lot depending on how defensive we are, but a tool like you just described to, remove some of that defensive Armor that we all have and and actually let the information in in a way that's constructive, is really great. What you described, I think, is A way to create constructive criticism, but the constructive part is really coming from within[1:07:04] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah.[1:07:04] Andrew Huberman: As opposed to saying, I'd like some constructive criticism and then hoping that the criticism is actually constructive so you're taking control over the process in a healthy way, in a benevolent That[1:07:15] Dr. Adam Grant: that's the goal, and I think the the big question that comes up for a lot of people at this point is, okay. So I get somebody to give me advice, but it might still stink. How do I get better at taking it constructively? And I think probably my favorite technique on this I learned from Sheila Heen. She calls it the the 2nd score.[1:07:32] Dr. Adam Grant: And the idea is that when somebody gives you a piece of criticism, that's your 1st score. So let's say, you know, they like, I in my in my world, they gave me a three and a half, I wanna know how I can do better next time. How do I get myself to focus on that? What I do is say, I wanna get a 10 for how well I took the 3a half. And that's the 2nd score.[1:07:51] Dr. Adam Grant: I wanna evaluate myself on how well I took the 1st score. I I think about this almost every day. There was, actually, can I tell you a quick story? So when I was, right out of my doctorate, I got asked to teach a, motivation class for air force generals and colonels. I was 25, I think.[1:08:13] Dr. Adam Grant: 25, 26. You know, they're they're all twice my age. They've got Thousands of flying hours. They've got $1,000,000,000 budgets. They've got well, you know this community well.[1:08:24] Dr. Adam Grant: Their nicknames are Stryker and Sand Dune, And I was extremely intimidated. So I I walked in there, and I I thought I had to impress them. And I started talking about my credentials and, you all my research experience and the feedback at the end of the 4 hour session was brutal. I remember, reading the feedback forms, and 1 person had written More knowledge in the audience than on the podium. I was like, true.[1:08:49] Dr. Adam Grant: I can't argue with that. And then another wrote, I gained nothing from this session, But I trust the instructor gained useful insight, and that that was devastating. I was like, can I like, I would really like to transform into an actual bear and hibernate for the next 4 months, and then maybe I'll come out of a hole ready to hear this? I didn't have that option. I had committed to teach a 2nd session a week later.[1:09:14] Dr. Adam Grant: So all I could do is figure out, How am I gonna hear this feedback and really take it seriously? And I guess I applied a version of the 2nd score, and I said, alright. There you know, there's some generals that are gonna come back And see me again, and I've gotta prove to them that I was open to feedback. And one of the things I heard loud and clear was that, they valued humility, and I had led with too much confidence, which was just insecurity masked. And so I thought, okay.[1:09:41] Dr. Adam Grant: How do I how do I change the equation? And walked in, looked at the room, and I said, I know what you're all thinking right now. Could I possibly learn from a professor who's 12 years old? Dead silence. I'm like, oh, no.[1:09:56] Dr. Adam Grant: This This is this is gonna go horribly wrong. And then, one of the guys in the audience, jumps in, and he's like, oh, that's ridiculous. You gotta be at least 13. Everybody started laughing. It broke the ice.[1:10:07] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think what I what I was trying to do was to take myself off the pedestal and say, look. I heard your feedback. You told me that you didn't think I had anything to teach you, and I've got to acknowledge that right up front and be open to the fact that that's true. And so I wanna come in here and learn from you, I wanna see if I can curate a conversation where we all end up learning. And the feedback was night and day different.[1:10:28] Dr. Adam Grant: Afterward, I I 1 1 person wrote, although junior in experience, The professor dealt with the evidence in an interesting way. I said, alright. I'll take it. And, there's something really powerful about about saying, look. You know, I I can't change the fact that they hated my what I can do is convince them that I was motivated to learn from their criticism.[1:10:47] Andrew Huberman: I I love this Concept of the 2nd score. And thank you for sharing that story. I think, you know, very often, we hear about people like you who if people didn't catch The math in there, you were a PhD by age 25. And as far as I know, the the youngest tenured professor at Penn at 28. So these are outrageous, outrageously impressive, metrics of accomplishment.[1:11:11] Andrew Huberman: But for you to share a, a story about, you know, Less than optimal performance and how you adjust it to it and and and the incorporation of the the second score, that you're referring to, I think, is, is really appreciated because I think that, as much as we hear, you know, oh, you know, Jordan, you know, took many more, you know, Free throws and everyone just thinks about all the ones he made. You know? People think about all the ones he made. That's the way the game works. That's the way the mind works, I should say.[1:11:38] Andrew Huberman: So it's, I appreciate that you've flushed it out with a with a personal example. I too would want to turn into a bear and disappear, but I would but I think that, It's really impressive what you did, and and I and it makes me think that the 2nd score of getting a 10 at at bringing the 3a half up, right, as it were, is really about turning a score into a verb process. You know? Over and over again as I do this podcast and I've and as I've taught in the what I keep coming back to is this idea that we should be focusing more on verbs and less on nouns. And we love to name things and categorize them, but but when we start living life through a lot of verb processes.[1:12:17] Andrew Huberman: So instead of getting being fit, we think about that you know, or running as a thing. We really think about, Just running. Right? It becomes less daunting and and we accomplish far more. But the idea that, you know, in this has this there are mathematical models of this, I'm sure, but about, you know, like, an integral, right, as opposed to just some value.[1:12:35] Andrew Huberman: Right? You're talking about the slope of the line. Yeah. Right? So you're a 3a half.[1:12:39] Andrew Huberman: How are you gonna get to a 10? Gosh. That's a huge gap. And you're dealing with back on your heels psychologically from getting all this, you know, battering feedback from these, you know, these, highly accomplished individuals. All these accoutrements and, you know, literally wearing them presumably on their body, so you for you to see, and and it's really about creating it's about taking control of the slope of that line from the 3 onward.[1:13:01] Andrew Huberman: And it's really a forward looking perspective. So I don't think we're being an an unduly, psychological here or analytic. I mean, I think it's really about taking A moment state and a noun and turning it into a verb.[1:13:14] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I think that's right. I I reminded the great philosopher Homer Simpson Who said that verbing weirds language? So it's harder to talk about this stuff in verbs.[1:13:23] Andrew Huberman: I swear I didn't steal it from the Simpsons, but if it came from Homer Simpson, like, I'm all for it.[1:13:27] Dr. Adam Grant: You you have to I mean,[1:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Small brain incredible. Small brain, but, you know, given the size of his brain, and people have seen the image, you know, fairly A fairly robust knowledge.[1:13:36] Dr. Adam Grant: No. I think I I think you're on to something. I think, verbs are active, and we're we're drawn to them. I think Yeah. A lot of times, people review their past work, and they just like, they end up shaming an earlier version of themselves, and they they wallow in rumination.[1:13:50] Dr. Adam Grant: And What what we wanna try to do in that situation, which is easier said than done, is say, alright. Like, the purpose of, you know, of of getting feedback or advice is not to shame my past self. It's to educate my future self, which I think is very connected to a lot of the work on growth mindset that that you've been talking about. And, there's been a firestorm of controversy around, can we teach growth mindset in schools lately? And, I think what what that is underscored for me is, look.[1:14:16] Dr. Adam Grant: You can't you can't expect someone to listen to 1 podcast episode or go through 1 workshop and magically believe that they're capable of learning anything at any moment. This is something we have to actively work on on a daily basis. And part of doing that, exactly as you said, is thinking about this slip and saying, alright. The person that I'm, you know, I'm competing with is my past self, and I wanna get a little bit better today than I was yesterday.[1:14:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think, along the lines of growth mindset, obviously, we both know Carol Dweck and, and respect her tremendously. And I, and I realized there is some controversy you know around how, you know, readily one can teach growth mindset or incorporate growth mindset? My understanding, and, love to know, your thoughts on this, is that When the Dweck work is combined with some of the Ali Krum work that is Growth mindset is combined with, a knowledge, just a basic and true understanding that stress and the Feelings of anxiety and tension that, can actually be performance enhancing. When those 2 things are combined, I think this is the work of David Yeager and colleagues at UT Austin, That, indeed, growth mindset becomes, more visible in our in our, mindsets and performance.[1:15:30] Andrew Huberman: To growth mindset and and other, other mindsets that are now being woven into that framework that that can be helpful Because I know, gosh, if ever there was a great name for a area of psychology growth mindset, it tells you everything you you want, everything you need, and everything You sort of need to know in just the name, but, we all find it difficult to implement. I'm just telling myself I'm not As good as something as I could be yet, it sounds great, but in moments of, you know, receiving feedback, that's harsh, Sometimes it's hard to access.[1:16:05] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. It is. I think so the the latest, there's a McNamara, et al meta analysis. And then, you know, I think So that camp versus the the Carol and David camp, you know, have very different views on how big the effects are. But I think one thing they they seem to agree on is Growth mindset is more important in circumstances, where people are more likely to need it.[1:16:27] Dr. Adam Grant: So if you think about, for example, kids who are impoverished, or marginalized communities. You know, the message that you actually you know, that you you are capable of, you know, of evolving your skills to the point that something you're bad at today, you could be good at next year, is really important when you never heard that before, and when you don't have a single person believing in you, I think where, where we're often missing the boat is we think, alright. I'm just gonna I'm gonna instill this idea in a person's Ted, and my work is done. And we know that the context around you really matters. So, actually, Carol's done some research showing that, growth mindset is more likely to have an impact, when your classroom culture, also and your teacher, right, has the belief that kids are capable of learning and growing, that your, you know, your starting ability is not fixed in any subject.[1:17:19] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think we probably for all of us as individuals, what that means is we need to think about The the microenvironment that we put ourselves in. I think, you know, the I guess one one of the things I've been thinking a lot about lately is scaffolding. And the idea that, you know, when you're when you're trying to improve at something, you don't need a a permanent teacher necessarily. You don't need 1 mentor, you know, guiding you for 9 years. What you need is is somebody who can give you the temporary support that allows you to to scale to a new height just like a a scaffold would on a building.[1:17:50] Dr. Adam Grant: And in learning theory, basically, the idea behind scaffolding is we're gonna initially give you the support you need to solve a problem, and then we're gonna slowly remove the support so that you learn to to do it on your own. And I think that those those kinds of scaffolds are often missing. So we instill the growth mindset. Like, I've got this belief in my head, but I don't know what I need to do, to, you know, to put that belief into action, and that's where, that, I guess, that that to me is we have to go beyond mindset. We have to think about How do we put people in a context that allows them to to put their beliefs into practice?[1:18:21] Dr. Adam Grant: You are asking me what else do we need, like, To support growth mindset and make it effective. Right?[1:18:26] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, we know people learn what growth mindset is. It's the idea that you're not as good at something yet. Okay. Terrific.[1:18:32] Andrew Huberman: But it's very hard to implement in real time. There are, I have to presume, additional tools that one can, bolster the the growth mindset with make it make it more, accessible, and benefit from it.[1:18:44] Dr. Adam Grant: Yes. So, Justin Berg and Amy Resniewski and I, studied this actually. We did, we were looking at growth mindset at work. And, Justin's, well, he's at Stanford. I don't know if you met him yet.[1:18:56] Andrew Huberman: I have not, but big place, but I[1:18:59] Dr. Adam Grant: figured it was[1:18:59] Andrew Huberman: He'll be on the list soon if[1:19:01] Dr. Adam Grant: Yep. Brilliant creativity researcher, and Amy just joined us at at Wharton and, has fundamentally changed the way that I think about, ideas, in the way that she studied how we can shape our context and just done path breaking work there. And we we were interested in growth mindset, and We we designed an intervention where people could learn growth mindset at work. So we taught them to think about how their skills were malleable, how they could stretch their knowledge into new areas, and we found that teaching them at that was not enough to boost their happiness or their performance. What What we needed to also do was, give them a growth mindset not just about themselves, but also about their jobs.[1:19:41] Dr. Adam Grant: In other words, to teach them that your job is a of flexible building blocks that you've got a whole bunch of tasks that make up your job. Some of those are, you know, are things to do. Others are might be interactions that you need to have. And if you break down your your job into all these tests, you might have some tasks that you wanna accentuate and make a bigger part of your job. Others that you wanna try to subtract, others that you might Swap with a colleague.[1:20:04] Dr. Adam Grant: And a lot of people, it turns out, think their jobs are are fixed by their job descriptions, but in fact, you have a ton of opportunity To say, wait a minute. You know, there's something I have a there's a strength I have, but I'm not using it right now. Is there a way we can bring that into my work? And so, in these couple Experiments we did when we randomly assigned people to learn both that their jobs were malleable and that their skills were malleable, they got a sustainable boost to their happiness that would lasted at least 6 months. There was no cost to their performance, meaning you could redesign your own job to be more enjoyable without, without a drop in the effectiveness of your contributions, to your workplace.[1:20:40] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think what I I came away from that research realizing is, like, it's not enough to just say, well well, I can get Better, I can improve because very often, you feel like your your environment is limited. Like, great.[1:20:51] Andrew Huberman: Like, yeah,[1:20:51] Dr. Adam Grant: I can grow, but I'm stuck in a dead end job. And so what we need to do there is, is open up the opportunity for people to, to to innovate on their own job description, and then the growth mindset can begin to to have Impact.[1:21:04] Andrew Huberman: Love it. It sounds a bit like adding a s to growth growth mindset. So it's not growth mindset. It's growth mindsets. Because earlier, you mentioned that in the classroom environment, if the teacher adopts a growth mindset Yes.[1:21:18] Andrew Huberman: As well as the students, well, then you have a culture of growth mindset. So it's the, interconnectedness of of this and the and the context in which the individual's growth mindset exist. Do I have that right?[1:21:28] Dr. Adam Grant: Well put. Yeah. We we ended up calling it dual mindset. But I think making it a plural is good because, you know, it's it's not I I have this image of, you know, you you put a person in a in a cage and then tell them they're capable of growing. They're still stuck in a cage.[1:21:44] Dr. Adam Grant: And so we need to we need to give them a chance to to bust through those walls.[1:21:49] Andrew Huberman: Super important. I hate to take us back to an earlier topic, but there's something that I meant to ask you that I didn't, and I'm absolutely needing to ask you, which is Your recent work or recent work, it was a few years back now, and you're so prolific that I have to call it a few years back. The relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance on other tasks. Oh, yeah. Yeah.[1:22:16] Andrew Huberman: And the reason I asked this is several fold. I did 2 episodes of the podcast on ADHD. And, one of the things that I learned in talking to experts on ADHD, people with ADHD, as well as looking at some of the novel treatments, everything from behavioral to prescription drug to even nutrition based, was that Kids and adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD are actually terrific at paying attention to things that they really Joy or that they're super interested in. So, clearly, they have the capacity. It's just that they have, deficits, if you will, in attending the things that are less exciting to them, less intriguing to them.[1:23:01] Andrew Huberman: So If I recall correctly, you have a publication that explored the relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance in other stuff. Yeah. And One of the major conclusions was that having a deep, deep interest in one thing might not be the best, condition for performing well at other Less interesting task. Could you, could you tell us about that study? What what motivated you to carry out that study and what some of the major takeaways were?[1:23:28] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. Definitely. You you summarized it really well. I think, the the original impetus so this was another project with Ji Hae Shin, and, Ji Hae came to me wanting wanting to study intrinsic motivation. And we were talking about what do we know about intrinsic motivation, and what are the gaps in our knowledge?[1:23:44] Dr. Adam Grant: And one thing that has always bothered me is when psychologists Ecologists study something that sounds positive, and they only study the benefits of it. Like, there's no such thing as an unmitigated good. Right? All All all sort of enjoyable experiences have costs. All unpleasant experiences can have benefits.[1:24:01] Dr. Adam Grant: We need to we need to fill out this 2 by 2 of good thing, bad thing, good outcome, bad outcome. And so I my challenge to her was, Can you show me the dark side of intrinsic motivation? And she came back and she said, what if there's a cost of loving a task leading you to hate a task that you don't like even more than you did before. It's like, oh, that's an interesting idea. It tracks with the basic psychology of contrast effects, where, you know, if you eat something delicious, then your least favorite food tastes a little bit worse afterward.[1:24:35] Dr. Adam Grant: And so I said, let's let's study this. So, she ended up getting data from, from people at work, and then we also designed an experiment. And sure enough, the the more passionate you are in task 1, The more your performance suffers if task 2 is really boring. And I guess what what this did for me is it made me think differently about task sequencing. I used to wake up in the morning and do my most interesting task first, and then the grading was hell.[1:25:01] Dr. Adam Grant: And what I do now is I start with a moderately interesting task. It's a little bit of a warm up for me, and then I have an exciting one to look forward to.[1:25:16] Andrew Huberman: I normally don't ask about morning routines and how one structures their day because it's highly individual. Completely agree. Yeah. And it and it depends Depends on whether or not people have kids and their pets and their, you know, what other but I'll just share with you a brief anecdote. I have a friend who's a very accomplished musician and has been for for several decades now.[1:25:35] Andrew Huberman: And he told me that he has a practice of after he gets off stage, and he's, like, stadium stadium sellout Level, musician, has been for a long time and shows no signs of stopping. Just incredible, but a very down to earth person. And he said one of the first things he does when he gets off stage is to go do some menial task. I thought there's no way that's true. But I've known his wife since college, and she she verified that statement.[1:26:02] Andrew Huberman: I was like, what what sorts of menial task you're talking about? He's like, oh, like, Cleaning up some of the cans and things that are there. Maybe even cleaning a toilet at a venue. And I thought, no chance. What it turns out to be true.[1:26:13] Andrew Huberman: And I said, what what's this about? Is this about humility? He said, well, maybe a little bit. But he said it actually makes it a lot easier for him to return home and deal with the kinda little things that just are out of scale with the experiences that he just had.[1:26:29] Dr. Adam Grant: He's tapering Away. Okay? I think.[1:26:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. I I first of all, I was so struck by the fact that he had, created this process for himself long ago, and he's also somebody who's you know, he's maintained you know, he's, like, been in the same marriage for extremely long time. He's he's extremely happy in that and his family. I mean, it seem one of these people that seems to Thrive in all domains of life.[1:26:49] Andrew Huberman: And I'm certain that he struggles in some domain of life because everybody does. But, it sounds to me like a very unusual practice, it seems to kinda relate to this that, you know, he has this thing that he loves doing, playing music and performing in particular, and he's just, you know, you know, 0.01% at doing that. But then just, like, bring himself back down to earth because so much of life and especially family life Yeah. Is, like, dealing with the the schmutz and the inconvenience of Everyday life.[1:27:17] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. He's it's it actually sounds like what he's doing is he's resetting his frame of reference to say if, you know, if I go right home, then The contrast between, you know, this high octane experience I'm having, and sort of muddling through everyday life, is gonna be extreme. I do something really small, then, family time is gonna seem a lot bigger.[1:27:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So I realized I'm taking a bit of a leap from your study on intrinsic motivation and low performance in in other domains. But, you know, to me, cleaning up, Clean a toilet is, you know, just I don't it's it's, it's boring for all the wrong reasons. Right? As you said You[1:27:56] Dr. Adam Grant: do not want that to be an Exciting No.[1:27:58] Andrew Huberman: And and listen. I mean, if I had to do it for a living, I would. You're right. And I would try and do as well as possible. And, but, right.[1:28:06] Andrew Huberman: So well, I found that site to be particularly interesting because I think that these days, we, we glorify high performance, Even, quote, unquote, peak performance, something we can talk about. And we forget that, yes, oftentimes, people who are ultra high performers Can afford to pay other people to do all the other stuff. But I have to say in knowing some ultra high performers and in knowing some people in the, billionaire bracket. You know, there's a high incidence of of mental health issues, Frankly, and, lack of satisfaction with life that maybe even comes from not, having to do Anything besides the things that you find most intrinsically rewarding. We all think that, oh, if I if I could, I would spend all day doing the things that I find most intrinsically rewarding.[1:28:55] Andrew Huberman: But Maybe there's something about this push pull. We know the brain works in push pull with almost everything that having some experiences each day that are kinda like, this a thing again. Do you think that heightens our level of satisfaction for the things we really enjoy?[1:29:09] Dr. Adam Grant: I would be surprised if it didn't. Mhmm. I think I think contrast effects are very powerful, and we know I mean, the there's half a century of search on happiness suggesting that the comparisons we make are what matter. You know, I think I think Tim Urban probably put it best when he said happiness is reality minus expectations. And if you only have enjoyable experiences, your expectations are Rising into perpetuity.[1:29:40] Dr. Adam Grant: So it doesn't matter how good your reality is. You wanted it to be better and better. I think one of the things that mundane experiences, managed to do for us, or maybe a better way to say it is, I think one of the benefits of mundane experiences is They keep our expectations on the ground, and allow us to be pleasantly surprised by, you know, a task that was more interesting than we expected even though we didn't love it.[1:30:03] Andrew Huberman: What are your thoughts on, what I call momentum, which is when I have, an experience that I particularly like? Like, if we record a podcast and I'm really need to get it out into the world or if I have some experience that I'm left, you know, very excited by at the end, then oftentimes the energy again, I'm obsessed with this concept of neural energy. The the energy that I glean from that experience seems to have carryover into other things. Like, you know, I'm Gonna be much more excited to just go across the street and get a cup of coffee. Feels like a bigger thing than it normally would.[1:30:37] Andrew Huberman: And I would think that one could To ride the wake of a of a prior accomplishment, even a small accomplishment each day, and make the, you know, tidying up we're doing things that one would normally find more boring, less boring. Is that true? The way you're describing contrast effects makes it seem like It's more of a cliff. Like, that thing was great and now this thing. But I also can kinda ride high on, something that happened 2, 3 days ago, maybe even 2, 3 months ago.[1:31:01] Andrew Huberman: If so feeling good equates to feeling good, or feeling good, accentuates the the bad stuff.[1:31:09] Dr. Adam Grant: This is the tension between contrast and spillover, And you can see both under different conditions. I think we're this is I think this is a brand new sort of I don't think anybody's reconciled those 2 perspectives yet, but my hunch from having worked on the contrast part of it is we found that it was only extreme intrinsic motivation that had the performance cost on other tasks. So if you're if you're enjoying something, if you like it, that will give you a lift for other tasks. It's it's where this is the best thing you've ever done, And now other things suck by comparison. That's where we start to see you run into a problem.[1:31:45] Dr. Adam Grant: I also wonder, if there's a domain switching effect tier. I think you're you're alluding to this. I I read some research that just came out this year showing that, one of the benefits one of the surprising benefits of morning workouts is you actually have more confidence in your job, because you get that small win. Like, I accomplished something this morning, and that gives you a sense of efficacy that you can carry over into You're, you know, you're the start of your workday. Not to suggest that everyone should work out in the morning because I'm I'm with you.[1:32:13] Dr. Adam Grant: I think everybody should, you know, both work and work out at a time that works for them. But I think, I think there's something to be said for, something went really well in one realm of my life, And that boosts my belief and my capability to tackle challenges in a different realm.[1:32:30] Andrew Huberman: What about in the opposite direction? You were Competitive diver. I have to presume that there were days when you had lousy dives. It must have been that That one day, Adam[1:32:42] Dr. Adam Grant: Sounds like every day.[1:32:43] Andrew Huberman: And then you you leave you know, you you, you shower up, dry off, head Ted into the rest of your day. And, you know, how do we segment away from the, you know, negative thought spirals of, like, something went really poorly. And now you're off into the domain of life where you can do you know how to do the things that you're required to do, but maybe there's some challenge and some learning involved. How do we cut motes between negative experiences? I think, I mean, the Ted Lasso strategy is ideal.[1:33:11] Andrew Huberman: Become a[1:33:12] Dr. Adam Grant: goldfish, 10 second memory, and then you don't even you don't even recall The practice you had earlier today. I think that I don't know anybody who can do that consistently. And think the more disappointing the experience is, the more you tend to to dwell on it. I think, when when you talk about segmenting negative experiences, I think the probably the research that I've liked best on this and I just wanna I wanna make sure I capture this Clearly. I basically so research on emotion regulation says there there are 2 strategies that tend to Effective.[1:33:49] Dr. Adam Grant: 1 is distraction. The other is reframing. So distraction is, you know, find something else that will consume your attention, that's unrelated to the thing that you just bombed at. And the hope is that, you know, that that fades into the background. Reframing is, a lot of what you were talking about a few minutes ago, which is, okay, let me focus, you know, not on the level of my performance, but the slope.[1:34:11] Dr. Adam Grant: My diving coach, Eric Best, has a really great set of questions that he he asks. And, you know, I I I remember I would yeah. I'd finished practice. This is a terrible day. I just feel like I'm worthless as a diver, and now diving was a big part of my identity.[1:34:26] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm gonna let my team down. Now I'm a bad teammate too. My coach is wasting his time and, like, now, you know, I he could have been, you know, training somebody much better. Like, why am I doing this? And Eric would ask, did you make yourself better today?[1:34:42] Dr. Adam Grant: And even if it was a bad practice, there is something that improved. Yes. Okay? And sometimes the answer feels like no. And then he would ask, did you make someone else better today?[1:34:52] Dr. Adam Grant: Like, yeah. I gave a a little tip to a teammate. You know, I I made a joke that, you know, that made everybody laugh, and he was like, great. Then it wasn't a bad day. And I I think this is this is an example of what good reframing looks like, to say, okay.[1:35:09] Dr. Adam Grant: The goal wasn't to be great. It was to be better. The goal wasn't necessarily just to make myself better. It was also to make other people better. And I think those are the kinds of questions that seem to segment pretty well.[1:35:22] Andrew Huberman: I love that feedback because I think we all get stuck in those thought spirals. And, again, not to demonize smartphones because they are wonderful tools, but I have to remember the time. I'm 48 years old, as of tomorrow, and I have to remember a time in which Negative stuff was probably happening in the background, but I didn't hear about it because no one was texting it to me. So I'd find out at the end of the day when I still had time to do other things in the meantime. Right?[1:35:49] Andrew Huberman: That said, I would also get negative experiences early in the day and then carry them throughout the entire day when nowadays you can get a positive text message that says, okay. It wasn't so or something like that. But, I do think as it's probably becoming apparent about, these channels of communication are or either boons or disruptions to our our positive psychology. It's clear that we're just, like, being bombarded all the time. So, just as a as a practical question, what is your relationship to your phone?[1:36:21] Andrew Huberman: Do you Set boundaries around your phone use or the types of communications and activities that you engage with on your phone.[1:36:28] Dr. Adam Grant: I do. So Everyone I I think everyone I know has a to do list. I also have a to don't list. And on my to don't list includes, I don't scroll on social media, And I don't pick up my phone, past 9 PM. And those those 2 habits are enormously helpful, particularly the not scrolling.[1:36:47] Dr. Adam Grant: I pick up my phone when I have something to post Mhmm. Or when I wanna see what the comments are and then see if there's something interesting to learn or or somebody that respond to, and that that that becomes a really healthy boundary because I don't get stuck in one of these rabbit holes where all of a sudden 2 hours have gone by, and I feel like, I feel like I wasted my time.[1:37:08] Andrew Huberman: Where do you post or keep your to do and your to don't list? Do you keep them on your phone?[1:37:14] Dr. Adam Grant: No. It's a Word document my computer.[1:37:16] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So you're still at the computer screen quite a bit each day? Yeah. Okay. I I[1:37:20] Dr. Adam Grant: feel like that's where most of my good thinking and writing happens. Mhmm.[1:37:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I carry a small notebook around with me now and write things down. I was just curious. So Like,[1:37:29] Dr. Adam Grant: what are these?[1:37:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, like, one of those. Yeah.[1:37:31] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I try not to take notes on my phone ever.[1:37:34] Andrew Huberman: Right. Yeah. It's it can be problematic for me, especially with with voice recognition now because you just it's hard to go back to that in dramatic way for me, but I I'm a big believer in these these things that but for those listening and not watching, I'm holding up a pen. So it's like, punctuals work too.[1:37:49] Dr. Adam Grant: You've And probably read some of the research also that you have a better memory for information when you take notes by hand than by keyboard.[1:37:57] Andrew Huberman: I didn't know that, but I'm very, very gratified to hear that. So the and I suppose if you don't have a pen and you don't have, a pencil handy, then, you know, blood always works. Just kidding. I'm just Don't don't, don't make yourself or anyone else bleed just to get an idea down. But it is amazing how sometimes we will have ideas while running, walking, showering, Out and about and then later try and recall those ideas.[1:38:18] Andrew Huberman: And if you don't write them down, they're gone. The great Joe Strummer from The Clash talked about the critical importance of carrying around a small notebook such as you did. Because he said that the ideas fall down like rain, and you if you catch them, they're there. But if you miss them, they truly won't be there later. And that's there's something kinda eerie about that.[1:38:35] Andrew Huberman: Like, why wouldn't we be able to remember these potential gems of ideas? Alright. The the the guys areing up of the mind. We had a guest on this podcast for a series, doctor Paul Contee, psychiatrist, and he talked extensively about the unconscious mind. I mentioned this a little earlier, but, one of the things that really stuck with me is he said, you know, everyone thinks that the prefrontal cortex and the frontal cortex is the supercomputer of the human brain.[1:39:02] Andrew Huberman: Sets context, planning, strategy switching, etcetera, etcetera. Certainly, it's valuable real estate to our intellect and in all our abilities. But he said, you know, the the real supercomputer is the unconscious mind. However, that unconscious mind that lives below the surface of our awareness It's also what drives a lot of our unconscious defenses. So our so called blind spots.[1:39:25] Andrew Huberman: So projection, projective identification. You know? I mean, these have These can be both good or bad. They can serve us well or or poorly, and so on and so forth. But implied in this notion of The unconscious and blind spots is that we can't become aware of things unless we either do dedicated work to become aware of them, or Even better would be dedicated work where we are asking other people to say, hey.[1:39:50] Andrew Huberman: Listen. You have a blind spot, and it is blank, blank, and blank. So tell us, About the role of blind spots, maybe even some positive aspects of having blind spots, but more importantly, what we can do to Fill in those blind spots and and, perhaps also explain how how they can limit us. And if you have any examples that, from the research where, people overcoming their blind spots has been benefited them. That would be amazing.[1:40:16] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. Wow. There's a lot there. Let me, well, let me start by saying, I think A lot of people think about blind spots in terms of heuristics and biases. So you think about confirmation bias.[1:40:26] Dr. Adam Grant: You think about the the classic Kahneman Tversky work, that ended up winning Danny a Nobel Prize on, you know, the the way in which, you know, we our intuitive judgments, often get anchored in the way we've done things before, or, you know, we focus on the information that's salient and unavailable to us and overlook, you know, less obvious information. I've come to think that the the mother of all biases is, what I what I think of is the I'm not biased bias. It's it's technically called the bias blind spot in Emily and colleagues research, but the idea is that I think I'm more objective than other people. And you may have your you may have flaws in your thinking, Andrew, But me, like, I I see things clearly and rationally. And I think that this is a it's a really dangerous meta bias because the moment you believe you're not biased, You are incapable of seeing any of your biases.[1:41:17] Dr. Adam Grant: So in some of the research on the bias blind spot, you see that, that people who have, who score high in cognitive ability tests. So, you know, high IQ are actually more likely to fall victim to the I'm not biased bias[1:41:39] Andrew Huberman: We don't talk about current events on this podcast much, but this explains some current events. People that were told their entire careers that they are perfect or near perfect. And, yeah, circumstances eventually came to, you know, slam them hard into the concrete on that one.[1:41:53] Dr. Adam Grant: Or or in some cases, It hasn't happened yet, but but we we watch them hurtling toward earth. So I I worry a lot about that. So I think the beginning of, you know, of seeing any blind spot is recognizing that we all have blind spots. It's part of being human. I think that The brighter side of that is that we're not just blind to weaknesses.[1:42:13] Dr. Adam Grant: We're also blind to our strengths. So Jane Dutton and Laura Morgan Roberts and colleagues, did some research on the reflected best self portrait. This is one of my favorite exercises to do in the classroom, but also to do in workplaces. Sometimes even People end up doing it with their kids at home. The idea is that, you know, you do have strengths that you're not that aware of.[1:42:33] Dr. Adam Grant: They may be things that come naturally to you that you don't even realize are hard for other people. They may be things that are struggles for you. And so you you think it's hard to do, and therefore, I'm bad at it. But other people watch you do it and realize you're actually quite good at it. So the you need other people to hold up a mirror to see what these, you know, invisible strengths are.[1:42:52] Dr. Adam Grant: So the way the reflective best self exercise works is you're asked to contact 10 to 20 People who know you well in different walks of life might be a family member, a couple friends, some colleagues, and then you ask them to tell a story about a time when you were at your best. And you collect these stories. It's it's the most exciting week of email you will ever get. Twenty notes. Let me tell you how great you are.[1:43:14] Dr. Adam Grant: But what's key this goes back to our discussion of feedback earlier is they're really specific about a moment when you are at your best. And then your job is to collect all the stories and do the pattern recognition and ask, what are the common themes that I've seen through these stories? And it's a it's a really powerful and vivid way of of getting a sense of what are those strengths. And, you know, it's not surprising that in some of the research when people go through this process, they end up with much more clarity, not only about what they're What they're good at and where their potential lies, but, also, how do I like, what do those situations have in common where I was able to use my strengths, and how do I get myself in those situations more often? Do I create those situations more often?[1:43:53] Dr. Adam Grant: I'll I'll give you a personal example on this. So I I got a bunch of feedback That, I was good at helping other people see their strengths. And I thought, okay. I don't feel like I have enough opportunities to use that in my daily life. So what am I gonna do about this?[1:44:10] Dr. Adam Grant: And I ended up flipping the exercise upside down. And I picked a 100 people who, really mattered to me, And I wrote a story to each of them about a time when they were at their best. And I'm like, there's no there's no reason I can't I can't make this part of my day. It's probably it was it was probably one of the best weeks of my life. It was better than getting the stories was was giving them.[1:44:33] Dr. Adam Grant: And I got these notes back from people saying, you know, I I didn't realize. I don't even remember that thing that happened. But I think for me, it was an example of saying, okay. You know, I've I've always enjoyed, trying to bring out the best in others. I don't feel like at the time, I was a I was a 1st year doctoral student.[1:44:53] Dr. Adam Grant: I didn't feel like I had anything to contribute to others. So, yeah, I'm try I'm trying to Learn how to, you know, understand this field and, you know, do a worthwhile study and write a paper. I'm not teaching yet. I have no value to add. And getting this feedback, like, oh, you're somebody who helps other people see their potential.[1:45:10] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm like, alright. Let me let me take some people that I, you know, I already recognize, really amazing things in, and let me just tell them that. And it took me about a week to write the the 100 emails, and, I can't think of a a week I've spent better. Wow.[1:45:27] Andrew Huberman: It's so interesting that you flipped the process on its head a bit, or a lot, and that Ended up being the reward. Do you think you learned anything about given that it was early in your academic career, do you think you, learned anything about your, Particular talent or desire to to do what you do now. I mean, so much of what you described, it seems to map well to what you do now, I mean, you could be, if you were to choose or have chosen, just not just, but a laboratory scientist doing experiments. You're clearly still doing that at a with a tremendous productivity, but you've also decided to tell the world about the information that you're gathering and the work of a lot of other people as well. I guess I feel a kinship here because we both do this.[1:46:13] Dr. Adam Grant: It's much more much more interesting to cite other people's work than talk about what you already know.[1:46:17] Andrew Huberman: It is indeed. It's fun to be able to to weave one's understanding of the process into, you know, like, what are other people doing and know how hard it is to do a really good Experiments and, be able to spot really good experiments. But you did you learn in that early, stage of your career that, Like, I think I wanna do this later because what you do now is it maps pretty well onto what you just described.[1:46:40] Dr. Adam Grant: I I don't think it was It wasn't crystallized at the time, but it was definitely one of those seeds that was planted that that must have grown. Because I I remember Right after I got tenure, a wonderful colleague of mine asked if I would write a book with him. And I was so flattered, and I went to talk to my undergrad research lab later that day, and I, you know, I mentioned offhand. I was like, hey. And, you know, I got this invite.[1:47:05] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm gonna write this book, and They freaked out. Like, no. You cannot write somebody else's book. You have to write about your ideas first. Like, if you're gonna write a book, write your own book.[1:47:17] Dr. Adam Grant: And I I I was very resistant because I love other people's ideas. I was like, no. I what I like, I feel like what I do best, I think it was, it was Boire who wrote about the scholarship of discovery versus the scholarship of integration. And I never felt like I was a eureka, you know, blindingly, you know, original insight person. I felt like what I was good at was Synthesizing ideas, and, you know, kind of taking a bunch of, you know, pieces of cloth and and sewing them into a quilt and allowing people to see the big picture in a way they hadn't Or and I felt like I could do that with a colleague who was already a successful author.[1:47:53] Dr. Adam Grant: And my students basically held me hostage. And they said, you've been doing this research for, you know, for over a decade now, And you have a responsibility to share that outside your classroom. And it reminded me of of that experience of saying, okay. There's something I see in other people. I wanna share it with them, and maybe I could do that on a broader scale.[1:48:15] Dr. Adam Grant: So, yeah, I think there was there were definitely dots that connected there.[1:48:19] Andrew Huberman: When I was, a master's student at Berkeley, there was a guy who's now moved to Michigan State, Mark Breedlove, who I hope to host on the podcast actually is this really interest does really interesting work on the biology of sexual differentiation. And Mark,[1:48:31] Dr. Adam Grant: I think that's an invite if you're listening.[1:48:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right. And he, It is indeed. And he said to me he said, you know, review articles, provided they are written by people who Our credentialed in a given field are cited at, you know, a 100 x any one particular paper. Now at the time, I wasn't interested in, impact factors.[1:48:56] Andrew Huberman: In fact, I've never paid any attention to impact factors. They've their importance varies in in different Countries and, in the US, they they put play some role, more so in Europe. But I I could care less about impact factor, frankly, because those those metrics aren't what's going to carry you through the difficulty of designing and carrying out a hard experiment. You have to be intrinsically in curious about the answer. Right?[1:49:18] Andrew Huberman: You know this, and I know this. But, but he basically said, what, something that really supports your point, which is that, Ultimately, the ability to synthesize information is can feel, really good. And he would start talking about the the the feeling that he got from doing that. He's also a tremendous bench scientist as well. In any event, I'm so glad that you flipped that exercise on its head because now the world gets to benefit from you doing that us all the time because I I realize now that much of what you do is to help, people identify and erase their blind spots by, and I love your social media channels, and I noted, on Instagram, and I do scroll, but but I scroll through into your your channel 2, you know, you'll put up in short form content that that really highlights the key importance of people embarking on strategies that they wouldn't take.[1:50:11] Andrew Huberman: That that I see that over and over again. It's like, we think that the best leaders do blank, but, actually, the research says they do exactly The opposite. And and you have a a vast kit of those. So along those lines, you know, what are some of the most common blind spots that, you observe, and that people could benefit from understanding and and, doing contrary action, around as it relates to, let's say interpersonal relations in the workplace or at home. And and and maybe we could, seed this with, a finding that you've also written about, which is Oh, you know, people who have and exert a a lot of proficiency and even control in their professional life will sometimes bring that to their relationship life, And that doesn't work.[1:50:55] Andrew Huberman: Right? The idea that, like, being in charge and being confident is a great is a great set of attributes, but it can really fail us in other domains. Can we weave that in with blind spots?[1:51:05] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. We can. So I think that so one of the things I I found over the past few years is that and this is inspired by a a Phil Tetlock framework. A lot of us Spend a lot of our time thinking like preachers, prosecutors, or politicians.[1:51:20] Andrew Huberman: Preachers, prosecutors, politicians.[1:51:22] Dr. Adam Grant: Okay. So you think about these as as 3 mental modes that even if you've never worked in any of these careers, you you will watch your thinking colored by at least one of them more often than you would like. So in preacher mode, you're basically proselytizing your own Views. And you I mean, Andrew, you're a you're in some in some situations, I think of you as a highly Effective professional debunker of preachers of, you know, certain kinds of snake oil when it comes to health, and, you know, and biology. Sometimes you take that too far and people might accuse you of being a prosecutor, where you're attacking other people's views.[1:51:59] Dr. Adam Grant: And then, the 3rd mode, politician mode is is basically, you don't even bother to listen to people unless they already agree with your views. What I what I think is is interesting is these these modes of thinking are adaptive for in in certain roles. So preachers make great salespeople. They're often visionary leaders. Prosecutors are often highly effective scientists.[1:52:19] Dr. Adam Grant: Right? We excel at criticizing other people's work and finding what's wrong with it. Politicians are great at currying favor. They do a lot of lobbying. They win approval.[1:52:28] Dr. Adam Grant: The problem is that all of these modes stop you from questioning your own assumptions and beliefs. So my I'll I'll tell you my biggest vice is prosecutor mode. I've been called a logic bully. My wife had to explain to me that was not a[1:52:44] Andrew Huberman: Oh my goodness.[1:52:46] Dr. Adam Grant: If I if I I mean, I I know I know you've experienced this too. If If I if I if I feel confident that there's strong evidence that somebody is wrong, I believe it's my moral responsibility to correct them, and that never goes well.[1:52:58] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. I won't reflect on my own experience. I'll just say yes and yes. Right. Right.[1:53:06] Andrew Huberman: The the, logic word ninja Mode, is one that I think we're trained in as academics We are. On that and, you know, or if you're a lawyer or, you know, or, many other professions as well. And I think it holds value, and it can be very effective in certain domains, less effective in other domains.[1:53:26] Dr. Adam Grant: Yes. And I think part of the problem is, you know, when I actually, whether you're preaching, prosecuting, or politicking excuse me, or politicking, You look like you're not open, because you've already in all cases, you think you're right and other people are wrong. And so that makes it really hard for other people To to reason with you, to disagree thoughtfully with you. So my favorite alternative, and and this is at the heart of what you do for a living, and for fun, is thinking like a scientist. And when I say thinking like a scientist, I do not mean that you need to buy a microscope or invest in a telescope.[1:53:59] Dr. Adam Grant: What What I mean is as as you model so effectively, a good scientist has the humility to know what they don't know and the curiosity to constantly seek out new knowledge. There have been multiple experiments showing that when people are taught to think like scientists, their judgment improves and so do their decisions. And I think a lot of that stems from, when when you go into scientist mode, you realize that all of your opinions are just hypotheses waiting to be tested. All of your decisions are experiments. And so, you know, like, well, I you know, I'm I'm not trying to prove that I'm right.[1:54:29] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm trying to find out if I might be wrong. And then if I find out I am wrong, it's easier to pivot. And instead of being really invested in being right, I can try to get it right. And I think in some ways, that's the That's the meta message that I'm trying to communicate to people with my work is, assumptions are meant to be pressure tested. They're meant to be questioned and challenged.[1:54:48] Dr. Adam Grant: And if you're not open to rethinking your views, then you basically turned thinking into a religion. And I don't know about you, but I prefer to base my views on on good data, as opposed to blind faith. And I think that's been a huge part of your contribution in the last 3 or so years to public discourses. You've you've helped people think more scientifically and talk more scientifically about their daily habits and behaviors. And, I guess my my big question is, how do we help people do that more often even in domains where they don't have access to scientific knowledge and they don't read journals?[1:55:22] Andrew Huberman: First of all, thanks for the kind words of feedback. I think, you know, my my goal is always to, you know, identify who's coming to podcast for health tools and protocols, and hopefully, teach them some science and scientific thinking. And for those that are coming to the podcast for science and scientific thinking, hopefully, they get some health tools and protocols also. But, because I fell in love Science for the exact reason that you're describing, which is that I, I lived I grew up in a family that was very divided politically, along religious lines, along essentially every line of, like, what Foods to eat, what was healthy, what wasn't. And the only way I could reconcile, these very frankly polarized views was to, You know, embark on the scientific method.[1:56:01] Andrew Huberman: Pose a hypothesis and then try and disprove one's hypothesis. And some things get through the filter, and it's a constant learning. So, I should just ask when you teach people how to be a scientist in order to, try and overcome some of their blind spots and be better thinkers. Better meaning it serves themselves and the people around them better. Is that teaching them what a hypothesis is?[1:56:25] Andrew Huberman: That a path hypothesis is not a question. It's it's sort of a, you're you wager on an idea with the understanding that you very well could be wrong, and then you try and disprove that idea. Is that That's sort of the crux of of what, in these experiments is, you're describing as teaching people how to be scientists. Yeah. Like, if they just do that, then they'll they're going to benefit.[1:56:46] Dr. Adam Grant: I think that's that's at the very heart of the lens is I wanna just double click on the idea of disproving Your hypothesis. Right. Because most people live in a land of confirmation bias where they're they're basically just looking for support for their preexisting beliefs.[1:56:58] Andrew Huberman: That's right. They're click foraging. We all do this, by the way. I'm not criticizing here. We all will have an idea, and then we will click forage online to support the idea that We disagree with them.[1:57:10] Andrew Huberman: They did disagree with us. Here's somebody I did agree with and that agrees with me. I think and do you think this has roots in our, you know, in the neural circuit underpinnings of of Just wanting to have affiliation. That affiliation feels good. Yeah.[1:57:27] Andrew Huberman: You know? Having people that are like us knowing that we're kind of protected in that.[1:57:32] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I think that's a big part of it. I think one of the reasons that we we encased ourselves in echo chambers and, hide and filter bubbles is, there's a there's a strong evolutionary pressure to avoid social exclusion. And so, you know, it's not it's not just the, you know, being drawn to affiliation. It's also, I I really want I'm afraid of being excommunicated from my group.[1:57:54] Dr. Adam Grant: And if I challenge the orthodoxy of the community that I belong to, I might be an outcast. And I don't think I don't think everyday people think through that logic, but I think there's a there's a deep seated, visceral tendency to avoid that. And, Yeah. I think the when we think about teaching people to see their blind spots more clearly, a lot of that is is recognizing it's hard to do that on your own, because by definition, your blind spots are invisible to you, and so this is why other people's input is so important. And I think, You know, I'm I know this makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but I think everybody on social media should follow people that they disagree with, But not just for the sake of it.[1:58:34] Dr. Adam Grant: You want people who reach different conclusions from you, but where you respect the integrity of their thought process. Those are the people who really stretch your thinking, and I think that's what we were trained to do. It's what I was trying to do as a social science. A social scientist is listen to the ideas that made me think hard, not just the ones that made me feel good, and to surround myself with people who challenge my thought process, not just the ones who validated my conclusions. And I think, you know, a lot of people hear that message, and they're like, no.[1:58:59] Dr. Adam Grant: But I don't wanna let that, like, that awful perspective into my world. I'm like, no. You you wanna be more nuanced in saying, Who are the people where before I knew what their answer was? I would be impressed with the depth and the thoroughness of their reflection and their analysis. I should be following those people and learning from them regardless of the The hypotheses that they generate and the results that they share.[1:59:27] Andrew Huberman: I'm so glad that you mentioned The, importance of following people that you disagree with. I think one thing that we have to highlight and I'm hoping will maybe even emerge From this conversation is that follows are not endorsements. Yeah. And and this is actually a real problem. I mean, there are academics who have lost their jobs, Not necessarily for following certain accounts, but for, commenting on certain common threads, maybe even alike is a a slightly different category because it's as the name suggests, it's alike.[1:59:54] Andrew Huberman: It's a it it sounds like, and it's in thought of as a vote of approval of what's there. Yeah. But when one's options are just, you know, a heart, a follow or no heart, no follow. You know, I was a big fan of the thumbs up, thumbs down. I kinda like the thumbs Thumbs down because at least you have the the you have an option to to, to dissent, without getting into Online, comment battles and things of that sort.[2:00:18] Andrew Huberman: But, listen. I've I've had, people ask me, why do you follow so and so? Because followers are seen as a sign of support because you're adding adding followers and presumably, in the algorithm raising prominence to a channel. Yeah. But I'm right there with you.[2:00:33] Andrew Huberman: I follow lots of accounts, of people who I fundamentally disagree with, but I'm trying to learn. And I'm also trying to understand what what their capture points are. Like like, why people find them so intriguing.[2:00:44] Dr. Adam Grant: Yes.[2:00:45] Andrew Huberman: Anyway, I'm I'm a learner. I'm a forager like you. So I I[2:00:48] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm in the same boat. And every once in a while, I think, Like, it it it's stunning to me. I don't know if you've ever looked at your, like, your Instagram statistics. But some somebody, a colleague of mine actually showed me I was like, I didn't I didn't realize you could look at the effect of each post on follows and unfollows.[2:01:06] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I didn't realize that.[2:01:08] Dr. Adam Grant: And, you know, the I think that my typical ratio might be 2 or 3 to 1 for a post. So, you know, I'm gaining 2 or 3 to what 2 or 3 followers to everyone that I lose. The idea that I could post anything that would cause someone to unfollow me. Like, if I said something interesting enough that you thought I was worth following, How could how could one post change your mind about that? I think you're too focused on what I think and maybe not paying attention to how I think, was my my first reaction to that.[2:01:35] Dr. Adam Grant: And then my second my second thought was, well, maybe maybe what's happening here is, Like, people show up, and they don't realize the foundation of evidence behind the total body of work. And so 1 post, you know, strikes them wrong, and they think this person is not credible, or they think that this person has, you know, lost sight of, you know, of what rigorous Science is. I wonder if you've you've had that experience too of I I I think I I make the mistake of taking for granted that Anybody who followed me knows that if I post something, I think it's worth thinking about and, you know, it's it's been carefully studied. And I didn't have a, you know, I didn't have a dog in the fight. I read this research and said, this cleared the bar, not only of an academic journal, but I read the methods, and I found them sound enough that we ought to be discussing this idea.[2:02:28] Dr. Adam Grant: Have you had that experience too?[2:02:30] Andrew Huberman: I certainly have. And I should say that, you know, I was weaned in an academic culture, 3 separate mentors, very different styles, All of whom were excellent mentors, but all of whom Taught me that, you know, there are phenomenal papers where every bit of information in the paper and indeed how it's written from start to finish is just water Tight and incredible. And there are other papers that are less watertight. But, occasionally, there will be papers where 1 data point in a figure is intriguing enough to consider following that scent trail in your own work. Mhmm.[2:03:09] Andrew Huberman: Even if the rest of the paper is kinda I mean, 1 data point. Now that doesn't mean taking 1 data point and casting it out to millions of people on social media as an actionable item is is is valid. That's certainly not what I'm saying. But what I do realize, and and I'm realizing again now after what you just said is that, indeed, people don't know the context In which, like, what, like, what filters are we working with before we bring things forward? And I think that, you know, my belief is that if it's Grounded firmly in the scientific method that, that's the best starting place.[2:03:42] Andrew Huberman: We were talking about that earlier. And I also understand that scientists Differ tremendously in how they look at even the same data in the same paper. So there is no governing body that says, okay. This paper means blank. The authors have their interpretation.[2:03:57] Andrew Huberman: The students have their interpretation. In fact, the course I used to teach, the undergraduates, which grew into a very large course, we would learn to ask 4 questions. What's the question that the authors were asking? Sometimes a sub question. What methods did they use?[2:04:10] Andrew Huberman: What did they find, and then what did they conclude, and does it relate back to the original question? And that simple, breaking out of 4 questions of studies is essentially what I do for all but I have my way of doing it, and it's going to differ from the way that other people do it. Social media, think what's interesting is that I think there's always gonna be a core following of a of a given person, like your your followers that they're going to trust, You know, not necessarily across the board, but there there's a general acceptance of ideas coming through. I think that on social media, it's hard to strike a balance Between setting the whole context and the actionable takeaways, I get criticized a lot for not being concise enough, and I agree. But I I also get You don't wanna push yourself.[2:04:50] Andrew Huberman: Putting things taking things out of context. Yes. So, Such[2:04:53] Dr. Adam Grant: a tight rope walk.[2:04:54] Andrew Huberman: It's a tight rope walk, and it's always gonna tight rope walk, and so I'm gonna just, you know, keep going, and I know you will too. And and listen. I I'm there's there's some kids out there. It's Surely not gonna be or that that are gonna take our jobs eventually, and, and we'll find a way to do it much better, who knows, through AI or[2:05:11] Dr. Adam Grant: something that[2:05:12] Andrew Huberman: might be robots. I feel like this is an appropriate place to ask about something else since we're talking about sort of perception of, of others and and gleaning information overcoming blind spots. It's something that you've written about Some years ago now, I guess it would be almost 8 years ago now, about authenticity. You know, the the word authenticity is is such a Minefield. It's such a minefield.[2:05:35] Andrew Huberman: I was going to say such a has such a gravitate positive gravitational pull. Like, oh, they're really authentic as opposed to what's the opposite of authentic?[2:05:41] Dr. Adam Grant: Fake. Fake.[2:05:42] Andrew Huberman: Right? But, I think we could all learn to draw some lines between authenticity and oversharing. Right? Well, how do we gauge authenticity? And we can refer people to that article you wrote some years ago.[2:05:55] Andrew Huberman: I think, you may have written it Differently were to be written today. But you talked in that article about somebody who essentially decided to tell everyone that he worked with the things that he was interested in, doing with them, relating to them, and it did not serve him well. Okay? So that's authenticity. Right.[2:06:14] Andrew Huberman: And so then there's this, this notion of benevolent deception in order to preserve relationship. And and, Importantly, it it brought about a word that we don't hear about very often, but that I I rather like, which is etiquette. Like, there's so for social media, by the way, I apply classroom rules. I'll tolerate any comment in the comment section, but not the sort of comment that I wouldn't tolerate in a classroom. You start insulting other you can insult me.[2:06:38] Andrew Huberman: But if you wanna insult other people, I'm not gonna tolerate that. So, that's where I draw the line. Classroom rules. There's an etiquette. And I think that, Etiquette is important.[2:06:50] Andrew Huberman: So how do we balance authenticity with etiquette and also with preserving one's, One's public life or private or private life. Yeah. Right? Authenticity at home seems important. You could be your complete Self at home, except when you wanna, you know, physically hit your sister or brother because they ate your ice cream, that's not the right kind of authenticity.[2:07:15] Andrew Huberman: No. No.[2:07:17] Dr. Adam Grant: It isn't. I think well, there I think it's such a rich and and complicated topic. I think First thing is, like, I I don't want people to be disingenuous ever. But I have a real problem with people saying As an excuse for disrespectful behavior, well, I was just being myself. I think David Sedaris said, Yes.[2:07:40] Dr. Adam Grant: But yourself is an asshole.[2:07:42] Andrew Huberman: So good. So good.[2:07:44] Dr. Adam Grant: And I think I think what people forget is that we have we all have multiple selves. Right? You've you've, I mean, you've you've you've known this your whole career. We all have multiple identities. We also could think about yourself as your thoughts, your emotions, your values, your personality.[2:08:01] Dr. Adam Grant: So which facet of yourself are you trying to be true to? I would argue that Authenticity without boundaries is careless. Authenticity without empathy is selfish. And part of being authentic is caring about other people's values. That should be one of your values.[2:08:19] Dr. Adam Grant: So what that means concretely is I don't think we should worry about being authentic to what we're thinking and feeling in any given moment. I think what we wanna ask is what I'm about to do or say consistent with my And sometimes that means you will be false to your personality in order to be true to your values. Sometimes that means you will, you will feel like You're not honoring your thought or your emotion in the moment, but you're doing that with a broader view toward who is the person that I want to be. There was a cultural critic, Lionel Trilling, who wrote about the idea of sincerity as opposed to authenticity. And I really like this distinction.[2:08:54] Dr. Adam Grant: He said when when you when you're trying to about being authentic. You're trying to bring the inside out. And to your point, Andrew, that's not always appropriate or effective. He is a little bit more about bringing the outside in. So pay attention to the person you claim to be and then try to become that person.[2:09:12] Dr. Adam Grant: And that was a little bit of an moment for me. I realized, you know, there are there are all these people who say, well, you should, you know, you should you should walk your talk. And I think that's good advice. I might even go a step further and say, you know, maybe you should only talk it if you're already walking it. Maybe.[2:09:31] Dr. Adam Grant: Maybe that would help us avoid hypocrisy, but I think the the the fundamental message here is that, we we all we we all could be authentic to one part of ourselves and inauthentic to another part. And I think the most important part is to ask, what do I stand for? And if I'm what I'm about to communicate is not consistent with that, then maybe maybe I could self censor.[2:09:55] Andrew Huberman: Such great advice, and, I suppose, one has to wonder about the the role of Emotional states. You know, I think there are career ending mistakes that people make in a moment, especially online nowadays. And by the way, this is not Just for people who are already established in their career. I've heard stories, and there seem to be more and more of these in the news of of, for instance, you know, videos of things that people said some years earlier, getting them ejected from college. A guest on Lex Friedman's podcast who works in the world said that one of the lessons that he teaches his kids is to not film themselves doing bad things, but in and, of course, also not to do bad things, But in general, to just not film themselves doing anything because of his understanding of the risk of of doing that.[2:10:43] Andrew Huberman: And we don't wanna create a paranoia, but, Gosh. I mean, who you are when you're 14 is a very different person than who you are when you're 27 or when you're Fifty. I hope so. I hope so. I might not grow.[2:10:56] Andrew Huberman: You know? And, so, yeah, I think, you know, Balancing authenticity across the lifespan, and we're expecting young minds to do this. And, clearly, older minds can't do it either. I mean, I I this is a pretty well known case of a chair of a Major psych the major psychiatry department. We won't name the university, but, basically, lost his job for tweet.[2:11:18] Andrew Huberman: He just was not being thoughtful. In fact, he was being, really, like, numb to to other people and lost his job, and and I think he I don't know him, and it was obvious why he he lost it. I don't think it was debatable, but, gosh. You think about somebody who's a chair of psychiatry, which means they're a psychiatrist, which means they're trying to think about thinking, and there you go.[2:11:45] Dr. Adam Grant: It's amazing how common this is, and I think one of the things that's fascinating to me is I guess this this goes back to something we were talking about a moment ago. But I I think that when when we communicate, we have access to the sum total of all of our thoughts and everything we've ever ever said that we can remember. And we forget that other people only have a snapshot. And so one of the questions I I like to ask is, If this was the only post that somebody saw of mine, would I be proud of it? Would it communicate who I am and who I aspire to be?[2:12:18] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so good.[2:12:19] Dr. Adam Grant: If the answer is no, maybe I should pause before I put that out there.[2:12:23] Andrew Huberman: That that is excellent advice. If it were the only post, like you're 1 and only representing you oh, fantastic.[2:12:30] Dr. Adam Grant: That now that could be paralyzing. So if you're a perfectionist, you'll never post. But I think for somebody who's posting regularly, it's a good filter to just ask, am I, you know, am I being thoughtful enough?[2:12:43] Andrew Huberman: So good. I won't add anything to that. Just say I'll just say so so good. Let's talk about potential. I was in junior high school, and I remember having a social studies teacher who she just would go on and on about potential.[2:12:57] Andrew Huberman: She has special program After school, you could get involved. Potential. Potential. Potential. And we hear about this.[2:13:04] Andrew Huberman: You know? We Have untapped potential. You hear we're only operating at 40% of our abilities. You know, people will say that. The implication is that we have reservoirs potential that we're just not accessing because we're not doing the right things, thinking the right things.[2:13:21] Andrew Huberman: This topic extensively. You have a new book on this topic. Tell us about potential. Like, Do we all have huge reservoirs of potential that we are not accessing? And, of course, I and everyone else wants to know how can we access those.[2:13:35] Andrew Huberman: But maybe you could also tell us some of the myths around potential and, Yeah. Tell us about tell us about potential. Such a such a, sticky topic for all the right reasons.[2:13:45] Dr. Adam Grant: Thank you. I, you know, it's one of those things where you you've had this experience, I'm sure, many times where you start thinking and talking about a topic, and you realize It's it's been your whole life, but you didn't see it until then. And I feel that way about potential. I think that I've been passionate about helping people achieve their as long as I can remember, I think every every goal I've ever set hasn't been about stretching my potential in one way or another, or at least realizing it. And what I've become so struck by as I've studied this topic is we all have hidden potential, but we don't know how to unlock it.[2:14:20] Dr. Adam Grant: So Why do we often underestimate our own potential? We judge ourselves by us by our starting abilities, and this is more common for people with fixed says, but even people with growth mindsets, you try a new skill, it doesn't go well, and you think this is not for me. I'm not cut out for this. And then It gets worse when other people also you know, you're not just underestimating yourself. You're also being under underestimated by others.[2:14:45] Dr. Adam Grant: Other people watch you And say, yeah. You don't have the you know, you're not a prodigy. You're not a natural. You don't have the talent that it takes. And I think the big myth there is that, raw talent is the most important driver of how high people climb.[2:14:59] Dr. Adam Grant: It's not motivation and opportunity, matter more than raw ability For growth.[2:15:05] Andrew Huberman: Motivation and opportunity.[2:15:06] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. You know, obviously, you know, everybody starts at a different point. But how close you come to your potential is much more about the character skills you cultivate, to To improve and improving over time. And then whether you're in a situation where, you know, you you have access to the knowledge that you need and the tools you need to keep growing. And so, Yeah.[2:15:28] Dr. Adam Grant: A concrete example of this for me is, when I when I started diving, I was way too late. I picked it up as a teenager. A lot of the elite divers in the world start by 5.[2:15:39] Andrew Huberman: Goodness.[2:15:41] Dr. Adam Grant: And, actually, in China, there's they're handpicked by For body type and sent to a version of diving boarding school where they don't even teach kids how to swim. They tie a rope around them so that they can just pull them back after After they they hit the water in the deep end.[2:15:54] Andrew Huberman: What part of their body they tie a rope around?[2:15:56] Dr. Adam Grant: I think it's their waist.[2:15:58] Andrew Huberman: So they're diving with a rope So that when they get in the water, they're not wasting any energy.[2:16:03] Dr. Adam Grant: Exactly. They're[2:16:04] Andrew Huberman: just being dragged through the water and out.[2:16:06] Dr. Adam Grant: That's, it's my understanding of it.[2:16:09] Andrew Huberman: Wow. But Brazil oh, okay. They have to walk. They have to climb. Yeah.[2:16:12] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So there are a bunch of other things they have to do.[2:16:14] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. But the the the swimming apparently is very secondary. Anyway, so I started really late, and I lacked most of the things that you would want as a diver. I, I couldn't touch my toes without bending my knees. My teammates called me Frankenstein because I was so stiff when I walked.[2:16:32] Dr. Adam Grant: So lacking the flexibility. I have no rhythm. My coach brought a metronome to practice one day, and I couldn't even keep the beat. So, you know, you think about diving as a sport of grace. Nope.[2:16:43] Dr. Adam Grant: And then, I also couldn't jump, and I couldn't twist either. And it's like you're missing the explosive power. You don't have the the athleticism. And I think if I had if I had just looked at those abilities, I had no business being a diver, and in fact, no business being an athlete. I'd already been cut from the middle school basketball team three times.[2:17:02] Dr. Adam Grant: Didn't make the high school soccer team. Those were the 2 sports I had poured a decade into. Like, the this is going nowhere. Eric, Just the most incredible coach I could ever imagine. He said to me on the 1st day of practice, he said, You know?[2:17:19] Dr. Adam Grant: Yes. You're missing all these things. But, I believe if you if you pour yourself into the sport That you could be a state finalist by the time you finish high school. And he saw more potential in me than I saw in myself, and that just lit a fire under me. And, you know, what that translated into is a lot of the behaviors that that you and I both studied, you know, setting specific difficult goals For, I wanna learn these dives that seem out of reach.[2:17:47] Dr. Adam Grant: For, you know, I wanna increase my score over the next 3 meets by 10 points. For I wanna learn how to you know, all my limitations notwithstanding, one thing that I can master that I have total control over is how clean I go into the water. I can get a rip entry so that there's no splash, and that's the most important part of a dive. And one of the greatest compliments I ever got as a diver was I came out of a meet in was couple years in. I think I was maybe a junior in high school, and, one of the judges turned to Eric and said, all he can do is rip.[2:18:16] Dr. Adam Grant: And Eric said so?[2:18:18] Andrew Huberman: Yes. It's awesome. It's almost like saying all he can do is win. You know?[2:18:22] Dr. Adam Grant: It yeah. It was it was a great backhanded compliment, but Eric was like, listen. He made the dive. It has a degree of difficulty. Maybe he didn't jump as high as he wanted.[2:18:30] Dr. Adam Grant: Maybe his tight his tuck wasn't as tight as he wanted. But at the end of the day, like, That dive disappeared straight up and down into the water. You cannot give that a 7. And that ended up serving me really well. And so I think the the broader lesson here for me was Eric said to me, actually, last year, I never thought about this.[2:18:48] Dr. Adam Grant: He said, but I never got close to even qualifying for Olympic trials. Like, did not have the talent to to be that good, but I got way better than I ever expected. And, Eric said to me he said, looking back, he said you got further with less talent than every any diver I've ever coached, and that was so meaningful to me. And what it reminded me was, my proudest accomplishments were not in the areas where I started out with the most talent. They were in the areas where I had overcome the most obstacles, And I think that to me is, really what drives people around potential is to say, it's not performance that's motivating.[2:19:24] Dr. Adam Grant: It's a sense of progress.[2:19:27] Andrew Huberman: I love that story, and I and I couldn't agree more. I mean, I think, or knows my favorite topic in science is the course I performed, at least after my freshman year, which was abysmal, least well in the phase when I was doing well.[2:19:41] Dr. Adam Grant: And What class was it?[2:19:42] Andrew Huberman: At neural development. I now teach neural development what? Neural development.[2:19:46] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm bad. Where are you at it at first?[2:19:49] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Well, I have to put it in context. My High school and freshman year of college were were abysmal. Right? I'd basically, no place being there.[2:19:56] Andrew Huberman: I can only thank my high school girlfriend for, being so wonderful that I followed her off to college and ended up there, left after my freshman year, came back. And then at that point, it was like a step function. I worked out of Fear and excitement and love of the material. I I was a straight a student thereafter, but in my senior Senior year, excuse me, I took a course in neural development, which was extremely challenging, and I got a b plus. And that b plus Still gets me.[2:20:24] Andrew Huberman: You know? But it's a topic that I love the most. It's what I did my, graduate thesis on. It's what I teach, at Stanford among other topics. And, and I like to think now I have, I guess, humility.[2:20:33] Andrew Huberman: So I had considerable mastery over over the the material, but it's because I didn't do as well as I would have liked, and I applied saw so much. And I think that it just didn't come naturally to me. And then eventually over time, you you kinda get it or you get, you get it. So it's a it But it's still my favorite topic because it was that friction point. Right?[2:20:52] Andrew Huberman: It's the ratcheting through. And there's something, I don't know, that's just intrinsically satisfying to me. I used to watch my bulldog, Mastiff Costello, like, chewing on a bone or when he was on a brick because, you know, he had a kind of a Homer Simpson brain about his Object choice to chew on, and he but and he just looked like he was in just total bliss. It was like this effort, combined with some intrinsic pleasure of the process. And so I think that when one is ratcheting through something that's hard, it feels so good that it's almost better than the outcome.[2:21:22] Andrew Huberman: Like, it it it is better than the come.[2:21:24] Dr. Adam Grant: I I think it is. And, you know, it's it's fascinating because, this is why I'm always bothered by people saying play to your strengths. Because if you do that, you will gravitate toward the things that come naturally to you, and you're gonna miss out on the very often, the the skill that was hard for you to learn, to your point, is one that you end up with greater mastery over because you had to put in the extra effort, and you end up deriving more more satisfaction out of the fact that, you know, I This was really tough, and I figured it out. You know, implicit in your story, and maybe partially explicit in in some parts. When I was when I was looking at the character skills that help people realize their potential, and really fuel unexpected growth, I I ended up finding 3 that I think are under discussed and, and well supported by science.[2:22:14] Dr. Adam Grant: I think that that, basically, if you wanna reach your potential or, you know, achieve more than you think you're capable of. We're looking at becoming a creature of discomfort, and embracing things that are unpleasant Awkward for you. That'll be the first thing. The second is, is being a sponge and soaking up new information and also filtering filtering out what Might not be useful. And then the 3rd is, is being an imperfectionist, which is knowing when to aim for excellence and when to settle for good.[2:22:42] Dr. Adam Grant: And I I hear all of those themes in your story. I you know, that was obviously uncomfortable. Like, you gotta be plus. You don't wanna do any more neural Like No. Not at all.[2:22:53] Andrew Huberman: It was it was so frustrating and so exciting to me at the same time. And then I went everything I did in the 5 or 7 years Followed was all about learning more about this topic because I and it wasn't about performing well or proving myself. I just I I love the material so much more because of how challenging it was. And I'm grateful to you, Ben Rees, professor at UC Santa Barbara, incredible neuroanatomist and teacher of neurodevelopment and and laboratory scientists because, You know, I think had I gotten an an a, I don't know that I would have fallen in love with it in the same way. Isn't that weird?[2:23:25] Dr. Adam Grant: You wouldn't have had to work at it to discover what was fun about it? I imagine.[2:23:30] Andrew Huberman: No. Absolutely. And it's still one of my favorite topics to teach, and learn about. So You mentioned discomfort, being a sponge slash filter, if I got that right Yep. And an imperfectionist.[2:23:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Tell me more about the imperfectionist Piece. Because I feel like, I've had students in my lab, and I've known people in other domains of life that they're they're absolutely paranoid about shipping something out for the world to see And, of course, like, no one wants to put stuff out into the world that isn't right, and, God forbid, could be wrong, but, or Dream perfectionist. Like, how do they ever do anything? And and now are they happy people?[2:24:16] Andrew Huberman: Because I can't imagine that they are.[2:24:18] Dr. Adam Grant: No. I mean, this is so Thomas Curran, I think, is the world's latest leading psychologist studying perfectionism. And if you look at his meta analyses, perfectionism is a recipe for burnout and depression and anxiety because you're constantly comparing yourself to an ideal that's unachievable. Perfectionists, are not they do get better grades in school slightly, but they don't do any better at work than their peers because I think in school, you have a predictable outcome. You have a general sense of what's gonna be on a test.[2:24:46] Dr. Adam Grant: And if you study hard enough, you can come closer to the a plus. Whereas at work, performance is much more nebulous. And so what happens to perfectionists a lot of times is they end up, optimizing the things that are predictable and controllable And then, you know, sort of missing the forest and the trees. And I think the, you know, the the antidotes, as far as I know, Really have to to do with calibration. So, you know, I I talked earlier about, how I like to ask for a 0 to 10 to find out, you know, am I in the ballpark or not?[2:25:16] Dr. Adam Grant: Well, one of my biggest liabilities as a as a diver was I was never satisfied with my score. And one day, Eric said to me, you know, you you hear Olympic judges talk about or commentators Talk about the perfect ten. That's a misnomer. If you look at the diving rule book, a ten is for excellence, not for perfection. There's no such thing as a flawless dive.[2:25:35] Dr. Adam Grant: I can look at dives that have gotten the straight tens and point out 19 things that were wrong with them, but they were excellent. And so then we had to define the standards of excellence. So what I have as a recovering perfectionist, somebody who, you know, just beat myself up constantly. In fact, I got We did paper plate awards on my swim team. And 1 year, I was given the if only award.[2:25:55] Dr. Adam Grant: And there's a little cartoon in me, And it says, if only I had pointed my left pinky toe, I would've gotten an 8a half instead of an 8. And that was, like, the story of my my diving career, and I did not wanna be that person anymore. And so one of the things I've learned to do is to when I start anything, you know, if I sit down to write a book, I'm aiming for a 9. And the reason for that is I'm gonna pour a couple years of, you know, my work life into this topic. You know, hopefully, a lot of people are gonna read it, And I wanna make sure it's truly the best work I can produce.[2:26:27] Dr. Adam Grant: Social media posts, I'm okay with a 7. Like, if I'm always shooting for a 9, I'm not gonna post very often.[2:26:34] Andrew Huberman: Because you're 9, your ceiling for 9 is or your threshold for 9 is is so exceedingly.[2:26:39] Dr. Adam Grant: It's high. Yeah. And I wanted to keep getting higher over time. So my idea of a 9 today is much more challenging than it was 10 years ago. And I think this is this is what people probably don't do enough, especially if you're an extreme perfectionist is They don't realize, okay.[2:26:54] Dr. Adam Grant: Let me let me figure out how important this task is. And then for this task, a 6 is sufficient, so that then I can pour my energy into, You know, pulling the the 7a half toward a 9 where it really matters. And, inevitably, if you don't do that, what you will do is you will get a bunch of nines and things that are completely trivial.[2:27:13] Andrew Huberman: I went to a high school where we had a couple kids get, perfect on the SAT. They would the big, like, centerfold list of all the early admissions to all the fancy Ivy League schools definitely was not on that list. I don't even know if I yeah. I don't even know was anywhere, near that list. Probably not.[2:27:33] Andrew Huberman: And some of them have gone on to have Terrific lives and seem pretty happy. And I know a number of them and I'm in contact with them. And, I think for some of them that performed exceedingly well on Standardized test early on. I hear a bit more dismay in their in their current life. Not all.[2:27:51] Andrew Huberman: But, is there I have to imagine there are data on the serve early high performance being a seed for challenges later on. Obviously, you don't want the the opposite. But, this sort of what I guess they refer to now is a, you know, complete failure to launch. You know, people not meeting the the milestones towards being, Self sufficient adults. But, yeah, what what are some of the dangers of success when thinking about realizing one's larger potential?[2:28:21] Dr. Adam Grant: Oh, that's everyday life? Such an interesting question. I think, yeah, I think the data on this go both ways. So, you know, some early success is, you know, it's a motivator. It builds the kind of momentum you were talking about earlier.[2:28:34] Dr. Adam Grant: You know, it like, there's a goal setting researchers like Locke and Latham have talked about, the high performance cycle Where you hit a goal, and then that builds your confidence. And then you set a more ambitious goal, and then you reach it, and there's this upward spiral over time. But there's also a mountain of evidence that achieving your goals can make you complacent. And there's a sometimes it's called the fat cat syndrome where you where you end up resting on your laurels. And then there are also competency traps where you get good at something, and then you keep doing it the way you've always done it, and you don't realize the world has changed around you.[2:29:06] Dr. Adam Grant: Like, I'm I'm allergic to the idea of best practices. Like, the moment you call a practice best, you've created an illusion that you're done. And the moment like, think about, pre COVID. Like, a lot of companies had really, you know, what they thought were effective models for collaboration. And all of a sudden, their best practices are not feasible because everybody's working remotely, and they've gotta throw that out the window and look for better practices for an evolved world.[2:29:30] Dr. Adam Grant: So I think, those are the things I worry about most with early success. I think that one of the things I would love to see more people do when it comes to reaching potential is, is to figure out What does my failure budget look like? So, I'll tell you my experience on this. You know, it started I wrote I wrote a first book, gave a TED Talk and pretty soon felt like I was spending 80% of my time saying things I already knew, and I was getting typecast. I'm like, I'm not learning and growing, but I'm also not I don't feel like I'm contributing new knowledge to the world.[2:30:11] Dr. Adam Grant: What am I gonna do about that? And 2018 rolls around, and I'm like, you know what? This I'm gonna start a podcast, and that will be my, you know, my learning mechanism. And I didn't know if it was gonna work. I didn't know how the medium would work for me.[2:30:23] Dr. Adam Grant: I didn't know if people were gonna wanna listen to my voice. I certainly don't. Maybe Morgan Freeman likes the sound of his own voice.[2:30:30] Andrew Huberman: Like to say I like listening to your podcast.[2:30:32] Dr. Adam Grant: Thank you. I also enjoy listening to yours, but you I think everybody hates the sound of their voice. I just I just wasn't sure for a lot of reasons whether it was gonna work. And then I thought about it, and I realized, Well, all of the the pivotal moments in my career have come from taking a risk, and I thought that I needed to build the confidence in order to do it. And as reflecting on goal setting researches as one does, I realized, You know, like, the confidence is gonna come through doing it.[2:31:07] Dr. Adam Grant: And so let me try it. And I I guess what I took away was if I don't If I never fail, it means I'm not challenging myself. I'm not embracing discomfort. I'm not being enough of an imperfectionist. So, I set a I actually set a goal that I would start at least 1 project every year that didn't succeed.[2:31:25] Dr. Adam Grant: And let's be clear. I'm not Aiming for failure. What I'm doing is is creating an acceptable zone of failure to know that that's gonna motivate some risk taking and some experimentation and hopefully some growth. And I know it's hard for a lot of people to do this in their lives, especially if you have a, you know, a super demanding boss. But I think we're we're all better off from a, know, a growth and potential standpoint, if we've got you know, if you if you succeed on 90% of your projects, that should be a hugely successful year.[2:31:51] Dr. Adam Grant: If you succeed on a 100%, think you're aiming too low.[2:31:55] Andrew Huberman: What are some of the projects that, you are currently spinning in the back of your mind that would be fun? But, if you're willing to share, Yeah. That for you, still strike a little bit of a of an anxiety chord. Like, oh, no. Like, are are you, I don't know.[2:32:11] Andrew Huberman: Are you a musician? Do you[2:32:12] Dr. Adam Grant: Not at all. Alright. Are you Thank you very much, Ian.[2:32:14] Andrew Huberman: Again Can't[2:32:15] Dr. Adam Grant: keep a beat.[2:32:16] Andrew Huberman: Are you thinking about, becoming a musician or exploring playing music? I mean, what how the reason I ask it that Way is, how far into your discomfort zone[2:32:26] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah.[2:32:26] Andrew Huberman: Do you reach in order to, in order to challenge yourself? Because because I think that everyone needs to have thresholds. Like, there are a lot of things that yeah. I wish I could play a musical instrument, frankly, but I'm I'm not that motivated to do it. Mostly because I enjoy hearing other people play music so much that I'm perfectly happy.[2:32:42] Andrew Huberman: I'm[2:32:43] Dr. Adam Grant: sated. Yeah. There's also enough good music out there you don't have to create.[2:32:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's definitely a lot of great music. Yeah.[2:32:48] Dr. Adam Grant: So I think there's, like, a there's a micro and a macro version of this. So on the micro side, in the past year, I I did this Worklife podcast for 5 years where I was, you know, taking the core of my organizational psychology work and trying to take on a topic and and make it interesting and useful to people, and then realizing I was feeling constrained just Focus on work. And as a psychologist, there are lots of other things I wanna take on, and so we expanded into, the 2nd show, rethinking. And I have some experiments I'm tempted to try, but I've been really hesitant to do them. So, did you watch wrestling growing up ever?[2:33:20] Andrew Huberman: Professional wrestling? I did watch a little bit of it. And then for whatever reason, in the last year, my good friend, Rick Rubin, who's he's, like, Not obsessed, but he is a real devotee. He's a fan of professional wrestling. He had me watch some, WWE, but at even AEW.[2:33:38] Andrew Huberman: He was explaining that it's Basically, physical drama. He's explaining why it's so intriguing to him and so informative to him. And then, I'm a big fan of of, certain genre of music. And Lars Fredrickson Rancid is a is a huge wrestling fan. So now got multiple people that I've come into contact with who are, like, telling me all this stuff about wrestling.[2:33:56] Andrew Huberman: So wrestling seems to be cropping up more and more.[2:33:59] Dr. Adam Grant: Alright. So I don't know the first thing about wrestling. I think I caught it a few times as a kid.[2:34:03] Andrew Huberman: Likewise. It was a the Hulk Hogan and a few others passed across the screen. Yeah. Yep. Yep.[2:34:08] Dr. Adam Grant: But the the thing that I remember was loving the tag team matches where, you know, somebody would get overpowered and then they pull in somebody to help. I think it'd be so interesting if there was a podcast where you take issues that people fundamentally disagree on and you start a debate, and then somebody can tag in If they wanna challenge an argument. And so instead of constant concentrating on the particular guest, you have you basically have A problem you're trying to, you know, to get to the roots of, and you're gonna have all these people jump in and and hopefully build toward a more insightful perspective on it. No idea if this is gonna work. I'd really love to try it, and this is the 1st time I've spoken out loud about it because I'm like, I I don't know that I wanna, like, that I wanna see that crash and burn.[2:34:50] Dr. Adam Grant: And yet, like, why not? Like, what's the risk?[2:34:52] Andrew Huberman: I think it's so cool. Every time. Right? Yeah. What what topics are Are, are you thinking about covering?[2:34:58] Andrew Huberman: Because I can think of some pretty pretty controversial topics, but I wanna know what the ones you're thinking about.[2:35:03] Dr. Adam Grant: Well You know? I mean, I'd literally just I mean, I'm thinking out loud here, but one one that I think on the controversial front that would be could be really rich is, to think about policies for trans athletes in sports.[2:35:15] Andrew Huberman: That's a controversial topic.[2:35:17] Dr. Adam Grant: Controversial, but also I've I've talked to some experts on this. I've I've talked to some trans athletes, and the people who are deep in this do not know what they think the policy should be. And so I I think actually hearing them Talk and, you know, understanding the complexity of those issues and then, you know, maybe hammering out, like, what what's a policy you would propose schools, what would you want for, you know, for Olympic events? I I just think that would be fascinating, and I'd love to I'd love to moderate that discussion.[2:35:44] Andrew Huberman: Goodness.[2:35:45] Dr. Adam Grant: I Maybe I wouldn't. I wouldn't. Like, I don't wanna wait into that one.[2:35:48] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you would. I wouldn't. That seems like one of the most barbed wire topics one could ever, embark on which is exactly why I'm gonna put in my vote. You absolutely should do this podcast. I think it's an amazing idea.[2:36:00] Andrew Huberman: Actually, folks, put in the comment section on YouTube They're not Adam should do this podcast and and that topic in particular. I think it would be amazing because, one thing that I keep coming back to in my own mind is that a lot of the controversies out there stem from the fact that we very often have individuals pitted against individuals.[2:36:20] Dr. Adam Grant: Yes.[2:36:21] Andrew Huberman: And there's so much lost in that. And I think about science and going back to the scientific method where we have subfields Pitted against subfields when when you talk about a field. Like, there was huge controversy over the structure of DNA, and it wasn't 1 individual against another. What you had are Small groups, different camps, and there was some partial overlap. There's also you know, if you read the double helix, there was also a lot of, Tom Cip behavior.[2:36:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. People People entering romantic relationships just to glean information from the other side. You know? Human beings not at not at their finest. But in any event, Small panels arguing, competing, teams competing, I think is, far more interesting and informative than individuals, You know, butting heads.[2:37:06] Dr. Adam Grant: I think so too. And I think, you know, another another one that I think would be really interesting. I mean, I'm like, people always say great minds think alike. No. Great minds challenge each other to think differently, and we just don't do enough of that.[2:37:19] Dr. Adam Grant: So I I've been thinking a lot politically. Like, what if we brought together a bunch of people, who are not ideologues, but are really interested in pragmatic policy to rewrite the constitution if we were gonna build 1 today.[2:37:34] Andrew Huberman: You'd like to tackle big stuff. I just No. I love it. I love it. It's a compliment.[2:37:39] Andrew Huberman: It's a compliment.[2:37:40] Dr. Adam Grant: I mean, what are the[2:37:41] Andrew Huberman: odds there? Said earlier, no weak sauce. No weak sauce. Like, you just you're you go right for it. I mean, these listen.[2:37:47] Andrew Huberman: These are the issues that People are really activated by because these are really core issues. They they get Down to the autonomic nervous system. They're in the hypothalamus as we say.[2:37:59] Dr. Adam Grant: But I don't think they should be. Like, I look at these topics and think, I just wanna get it right. I don't have a vested interest in what the model should be. I just know that even the wisest people of 250 years ago We're not prepared to anticipate the world we live in today, and we ought to be constantly I I don't know. I don't think you should live in a world where you affirm your beliefs.[2:38:19] Dr. Adam Grant: I think the only way you learn is by continually evolving your beliefs. And so I guess I'm trying to figure out more ways to catalyze that around issues people care about. But I don't care about the issues. I care about the stretching of thinking and the improving the way that the world works.[2:38:33] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'll tell you. If you decide to do this podcast with a tag team format, I love that you gleaned it from watching wrestling a couple of times, Around these, very controversial issues, I promise you that will be one of the most popular and important podcasts It's on the planet Earth. It might be podcasts on other planets. I hear that they're, you know, galaxies far, far away with, they may have podcast too, may have had them for much longer than we have, but, That's, that's a winner. Yeah.[2:39:01] Dr. Adam Grant: Well, maybe maybe I'll try it as a little experiment on the rethinking feed and see if it's an unmitigated disaster.[2:39:08] Andrew Huberman: Well, you know where my vote lies.[2:39:09] Dr. Adam Grant: I I appreciate that. So okay. So to go back to your question for a second, on the macro side, I've always thought it would be fun to try to write a sci fi novel. And the question I'm wrestling with right now is is that a good use of my time? Like, there are great sci fi writers out there.[2:39:23] Dr. Adam Grant: There aren't that many social scientists communicating about the topics that I do, and it feels like it might be I don't know. I'm like, this like, is It might be too much of a diversion.[2:39:36] Andrew Huberman: Then again, according to your words, You had no talent in diving, but you exceeded all all, performance metrics by by a considerable Amount, through motivation and, and opportunity.[2:39:53] Dr. Adam Grant: Did I[2:39:53] Andrew Huberman: get that right? I vote yes. I'm not I haven't read much sci fi. Maybe I need to read read more sci fi. Are you a fan of sci fi?[2:40:00] Dr. Adam Grant: I love sci fi. It's it's one of my favorite ways to imagine a better world and also, You know, prevent a worse one from emerging, but I don't know. There's a there's a part of me that thinks, like, alright. There's a there's Root Bernstein and colleagues, did this do you know this research on, Nobel Prize winning scientists and what differentiates them from their peers?[2:40:21] Andrew Huberman: No. But, Being the son of a physicist and having been surrounded by, just by circumstance, a number of Nobel Prize winners, when I was a kid, Young kid, I'm very curious to know what what the this research says.[2:40:33] Dr. Adam Grant: I mean, there there's there are many themes you could glean from it, but the the thing that Really jumped out at me is, the Nobel Prize winners are more likely to have artistic hobbies.[2:40:43] Andrew Huberman: Feynman certainly did.[2:40:44] Dr. Adam Grant: Yep. I mean, there there's a long list of them, but if you break it down in the data, it was, they're twice as likely as their peers to play a musical instrument. They're 7 times as likely to draw a paint. They're 12 times as likely to do, poetry or fiction, creative writing. And get this, 22 times as likely as their peers, 22 to dance, act, or, yes, perform as magicians.[2:41:09] Andrew Huberman: As a[2:41:09] Dr. Adam Grant: former magician, I was very excited about this right now.[2:41:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, I wasn't going to ask about magic, but let's talk about it. I was on vacation with every year, I take my sister in New York her birthday and my birthday, because our birthdays are close together, and we went and saw a magician mentalist, by the name of Ossie Wind. Ossie, I think, is the correct pronunciation, who just just like the last time I saw him, absolutely blew my mind. I there's no way It's not magic. Of course, I know it's not magic, but it's, the but my understanding is that there are some things that he and other great mentalists and do where they are not absolutely certain of the outcome.[2:41:47] Andrew Huberman: They're they're playing it's probabilistic. And so there's a risk and a thrill for them too, and that they're also creating memories and erasing memories, and, that's something that we I may host Assi on the podcast because That'd[2:41:59] Dr. Adam Grant: be fun.[2:41:59] Andrew Huberman: He's very effective Creating memories and erasing memories. That's a lot of what he does, and he has tactics to do that. In any event, I wasn't going to ask about magic, but, I know that you were a professional magician at at one point in your life, and that you you did this because you enjoy doing it. But getting beyond the the sort of, pull the rabbit out of the hat or pick or identify the card that the person picked out of the the shuffled stack, What is it, and what was it about magic that intrigues you? Does it inform anything about, the work that you do now?[2:42:31] Dr. Adam Grant: It does. Yeah. I, yeah, I think it when I started, I was 12, and I was just it was just fun. And I was looking for a way to entertain other people and entertain myself in the process and then, you know, became a challenge. Can I learn this new skill, and can I can I master this trick?[2:42:46] Dr. Adam Grant: I think, Nerdiest thing I did in college was I started a magic club with, David Wong who is a a stellar magician and, is he calls it. He does, magic crossword puzzles, essentially, that I I can't do it justice. You have to see it. It's Unreal. And I watched him for, you know, our 1st performance together and realized one of us is gonna make it as a magician, and it's not me.[2:43:13] Dr. Adam Grant: He's he's outstanding. Anyway, the way it figures in my work now is I think so much of good science communication is misdirection, And it's the same skill I use as magician. If I told you that the the card you picked was about to disappear from the deck and appear on the window, You would not be nearly as intrigued as if it happened by surprise. And I think the same is true when when we communicate knowledge. I think it's it's actually why so many of my posts you flagged this earlier.[2:43:41] Dr. Adam Grant: So many of my posts start with, you know, like, this thing is not what you think. It's actually this other thing. I think that, you know, challenging conventional wisdom, Questioning assumptions is is what surprises people, and then leads them to think either I have something to learn or, oh, no. I gotta put up a shield because my beliefs are being, challenged or attacked. And I think the the art form of magic was always about creating a surprise that would delight people, as opposed to leading people to feel like they were tricked or duped or manipulated.[2:44:11] Dr. Adam Grant: And so I think the the challenge for me is to say, okay. I wanna figure out what what do we know from Behavioral science, you know, mostly focusing on psychology because that's my core expertise. What do we know that's actually different from Most intuition. And then how do I explain that in a way that surprises people but leads them to say, oh, that's so interesting, as opposed to that's wrong, and then wanna fight about it.[2:44:35] Andrew Huberman: It's almost as if you give them the experience of what you're trying to teach them so that the, oh, that's wrong, can't, be the available response. Yes. Because in magic, you know, it's it's, everyone knows it's magic just like with professional wrestling folks, by the way, it there's there's some prior understanding of of what's gonna happen. Maybe they go off script, I think that's actually, I think, part of the interest in professional wrestling for those that are extreme fans of professional is that they almost want to wonder about whether or not some of it is not in the plan. Like, they it's a suspension of of Reality that they seem to enjoy.[2:45:17] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because if you know something's fake or well, we should we should be I should be more careful about my language. In with magic, like, when I went to see Assi, I mean, I I don't think it's actual magic, but he's able to give the illusion of magic. The real illusion is that it's Magic. Right?[2:45:34] Andrew Huberman: It's not the illusion of making the card hop to somewhere else in the room. And he he is phenomenal, and I highly recommend people go see his show if they if they get the But the I think they're doing a documentary about him now, actually. There'll be some Netflix stuff as[2:45:48] Dr. Adam Grant: well. Wait.[2:45:49] Andrew Huberman: But it's the illusion that magic exists That's so exciting. So with science communication, yeah, I always, aim for 4 things. I don't always achieve them, but And I think you do as well, if I may that, a topic be interesting, clear, ideally actionable, but not always. And the the quad factor is when it's also surprising. So interesting, clear, actionable, and surprising sort of is the the ultimate if there's sort of a Like, oh, I didn't realize that.[2:46:18] Andrew Huberman: But it's it's hard to find data points that satisfy all of our criteria.[2:46:22] Dr. Adam Grant: And the surprising is the least important by far. I I assume table stakes is it's rigorous.[2:46:28] Andrew Huberman: Oh, well, okay. Sitting underneath all 4 of those points are, that it's that it's actual science. Right? Someone didn't just say it. Right?[2:46:37] Andrew Huberman: It's not conjecture or theory. So that means that there's data to support it and that the data were collected with the appropriate amount of rigor. Right? So there's a there's a reservoir stuff that sits underneath as a foundation.[2:46:46] Dr. Adam Grant: So given given the the baseline of rigor, how How do I find what's interesting, clear, actionable, and, hopefully, surprising? Although I would I okay. I would make a case. There's a classic article that Murray Davis wrote, one of my all time favorites. The a sociologist who wrote a paper called That's Interesting, and he opened the paper by saying, ideas live not because they're true, but because they're interesting, which decimated one of my core beliefs.[2:47:12] Dr. Adam Grant: Like, I I thought it was accuracy that drove people's beliefs, and he said no. Ideas led because they're interesting. And then he goes to build an index of the interesting to explain when people are intrigued. And his case is that most of interest is surprise, and he breaks down all the ways that you can turn conventional wisdom upside down. You can say that, something you thought was bad was actually good or vice versa.[2:47:36] Dr. Adam Grant: You can argue that, something you thought was homogeneous is actually heterogeneous. You could argue that something you thought was individual was actually a collective phenomenon or vice versa. And he's he's got this wonderful breakdown of all the ways of being interesting. And he's the one who made the distinction between ideas that, challenge weekly held assumptions intriguing you and strongly held assumptions, you know, sort of offending you. But I think from Davis's view, and I think he's right, a huge amount of interest is surprise.[2:48:03] Dr. Adam Grant: And so but I don't think it's the only driver of interest. So I might I might take your criteria and say, okay. We start with rigor. We wanna go to interest, clarity, and actionability. How do we get to interest?[2:48:13] Dr. Adam Grant: Let's build a submodel of the factors that drive interest, and surprise might be it might have the biggest beta weight in the regression equation. But what else what else drives interest? I have a couple hypotheses. I wanna hear yours. You've been doing this actively, and highly effectively.[2:48:28] Dr. Adam Grant: Beyond surprise, what else interest people in your content?[2:48:32] Andrew Huberman: Anything that draws on self reflection for them.[2:48:36] Dr. Adam Grant: Right.[2:48:36] Andrew Huberman: I think we all have an innate desire to Better understand ourselves why why we work the way we do, why we don't work as well as we would like to in certain domains. Like, some and and cast understanding on on our Experiences of others too. Like, oh, now it makes sense. Like, with I've been going back to the the Conti episodes, but we did several of them. So for, I think it's appropriate, you know, to learn from him that narcissism is envy.[2:49:01] Andrew Huberman: It represents a a extreme deficiency in the pleasure, the peep narcissist can have an extreme pleasure drive, but they they always feel like they have far less than they would like to have and that others have far more of it because they don't have same yearning for it. Right? And so that narcissism at its core is deep envy. That to me was like, wow. You know, and to to realize that and to now understand that all this discussion that you hear out there about narcissists, everyone calling other people narcissists, that, there are genuine narcissists out there, And what they really suffer from is an extreme deficit in pleasure, and they're constantly envious of others.[2:49:39] Andrew Huberman: It reframed everything I thought about narcissists, But about them being overbearing, which they can be and often are, etcetera, etcetera. So I think it's also anything that leads to, Like, oh, I can I can I can navigate narcissists better with that?[2:49:53] Dr. Adam Grant: Well, that I mean, that checks all your boxes. It's very surprising because it's not the way we normally understand But I think you you hit on for me what's the maybe even it's at least as important as surprise, maybe more so, is Self relevance. Mhmm. And it doesn't have to be actionable. Right?[2:50:09] Dr. Adam Grant: It has to, in a lot of cases, just help you understand or make sense of something that's been puzzling or that's, you know, that's, you know, sort of I I think I'm I'm almost always surprised when I say something from, you know, here here's here's a synthesis of research. A meta analysis, and I think it's kind of obvious. And people get excited about it because it gave them language to describe something they had felt, but they didn't know how to Articulate or talk about. And I think that I mean, I think this is why most of the most popular TED Talks, are about human behavior, because people are interested in people. And if you learn something about you or about others, you don't have to immediately do anything with that, to find it Intriguing and even useful, because it enriched your worldview.[2:50:56] Andrew Huberman: A recent guest on this podcast, we haven't aired it yet, but, maybe it'll be out by time this This airs was with, Lisa Feldman Barrett. She's,[2:51:03] Dr. Adam Grant: psychologist turned neuroscientist.[2:51:05] Andrew Huberman: Right. Studies emotion. Emotion.[2:51:06] Dr. Adam Grant: Of course.[2:51:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And she Scribed, in how in certain cultures, there is a language for subcategories of emotion.[2:51:14] Dr. Adam Grant: Emotional granularity.[2:51:15] Andrew Huberman: Right. So, you know, I should that I don't think you or I, are familiar with, but I'm familiar with from my experience of of romantic partners being, like, really unhappy about their haircut. You're like you're like, you're bad, but there but by having a specific word for a specific experience, people feel less alone and the feeling passes more quickly in time. And and then she gave some other examples, from German and from, you know, Scandinavian, languages and so forth. And I find this so interesting.[2:51:51] Andrew Huberman: It's like The moment people hear that they are not alone in an experience, there's nothing actionable about it, but it it creates a cognitive shift Thereafter, in which they suffer less, or may feel more connected to others. I mean, I think it's really a beautiful example of of exactly what you're referring to. Like, when we learn about something and we we we identify with it, it's powerful.[2:52:14] Dr. Adam Grant: It's very powerful, and I think, psychologists often say name it to tame it. Affect labeling is one of the most effective emotion regulation strategies. And we tow when we talked about Distraction and reframing earlier, I should have said there's a third strategy, which is literally just to describe what you're feeling. It It it seems to allow people then to reason with and process whatever they're feeling as opposed to allowing the feeling to control them. And I I probably got the clearest sense of this in, in 2021.[2:52:47] Dr. Adam Grant: I read a a New York Times article on, On languishing, the feeling of meh or blah. And I have never had anything I any article I wrote resonate like this, And it just like, I all the the post the post that tagged me were just like, it me. It me. It us. And there was like there's like 1 and 2 word reactions, and I I don't think it was the content that mattered to people.[2:53:12] Dr. Adam Grant: It was the just having the term. All of a sudden, people realize this is originally Corey Keyes' research that I was referencing. It had been a light bulb for me to say, there's a if you think about the spectrum of well-being, this is related to your mental illness versus mental health distinction. Those are 2 extremes of the continuum. And at one end, we have depression and burnout.[2:53:32] Dr. Adam Grant: On another end, we have, you know, well-being and flourishing. Languishing lives right in the middle. As Corey describes it, it's the absence of well-being. So you're not depressed. You still have hope.[2:53:41] Dr. Adam Grant: You're not burned out. You still have energy, but you're not at peak functioning. You're missing a sense of purpose. You feel like you're stagnating and you're empty. And, you know, there's something about just saying the word languishing That led people to to realize, yeah, that's a thing.[2:53:59] Dr. Adam Grant: And, of course, we're languishing. We're standing still in the middle of a a global experiment that no one opted into, which violates all rules of consent, by by science last time I checked. But I think that that that's something that That probably is underrepresented when we're trained to communicate as scientists. To say one of the most valuable things we do is we give people language to talk about things, and I think that's a massive part of, of your impact is, this is one of the big things I've learned from you, Andrews. I I I used to be a little bit dismissive of, of cognitive neuroscience in particular.[2:54:33] Dr. Adam Grant: I thought understanding the brain has not taught me that much about the mind. Like, being able to, you know, trace, let let's take a simple example. Like, when I read Joe LeDoux's research, being able to trace, You know, certain, amygdala responses, you know, as the root of how people deal with fight or flight and and threat. I'm I'm like, I don't know that that helped me that much. Like, if I could just describe fight or flight, do I need the amygdala?[2:55:01] Dr. Adam Grant: And you've convinced me I was wrong about that Because when people have when they understand the, the neurological substrates of their thoughts, feelings, and actions, they believe them more. They're like, oh, like, there is a mechanism for this. It's being produced inside my head. And even though I can't see it, it's there and it can be studied with the tools of science. I think that's a really big deal, and I I really regret the fact that I didn't spend more time on cognitive neuroscience because I think I'd be a better A better psychologist today.[2:55:28] Andrew Huberman: Oh, well, again, thanks for the kind words. I think that a fortunate evolution in our fields or even field, if I may, over the last 10 years is that whereas neuroscience itself even needs to be subdivided into neuroanatomy and The neurophysiology, it's lumped into all neuroscience, but it now includes psychology, computational neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience. It's all you know, I think what consider us, you know, we have different perspectives and different training, obviously, but doing a lot of the same things, just, using different, different dissection tools and different different language based tools. And, listen, what you've done, I wouldn't even say masterfully. I mean, we're just with, Like, extreme virtuosity is to wrap your hands around such an enormous literature related to psychology.[2:56:16] Andrew Huberman: I mean, the human mind and behavior and thought processes and emotions and Potential and, you know, so many topics and to, and to extract the the most valuable Gems from that literature and communicate them in a way that anyone can understand. And, this is it's an extreme gift, to be able to do that, and it's, and it's clear it's working because, like you mentioned this article on languishing, which we will provide or a link to in our caption because I wanna go read that now. I mean, I'm always struck by this feeling of, like, am I I'm not tired, but, you know, like, I've got tons to do. But, like, why do I just wanna, like, sit here for a and I'm like, maybe I need to sit here. But then you get into all the, like, the, okay.[2:56:59] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, I need it there's a lot to do. There's a lot of get up and go. I don't wanna waste my life. And, yeah, rest is good too. But I think languishing is something that Like like, I definitely can resonate with that.[2:57:09] Andrew Huberman: So when I had a bulldog, it felt a lot easier to do because he was always languishing. But Do you ever just languish, or are you busy enough that you you just feel like you're always a forward center of mass?[2:57:20] Dr. Adam Grant: I think everybody languishes. I think it's part of the human And I think it might even be evolutionarily adaptive because I I remember, another sort of, Mind altering idea. I remember reading Randy Nessie's argument that mild depression could be evolutionarily functional. That, you know, Obviously, clinical depression, is debilitating in a lot of ways, but, you know, low grade sadness, Lincoln's melancholy. We know one of one of the things it can do is broaden your field of vision.[2:57:50] Dr. Adam Grant: And, you know, for for many people, sadness is a signal that Something is not working, and it can motivate problem solving. It can, in some cases, open access to new perspectives. Unfortunately, those potential benefits of of sadness are often overridden by the motivational cost and also the the fact that you now spend this time regulating your sadness and wondering why you're sad. Right? And so it's it's hard to harness.[2:58:14] Dr. Adam Grant: But, I I had a similar thought about languishing from this perspective to say that, You know, maybe moments of languishing open us up to change. When we get stuck, sometimes we realize you have to move backward in order to make progress. Sometimes you have to, like, unlearn things that you thought you knew, in order to to keep growing. And, I, you know, I don't like, a friend of mine said, he read my languishing piece, and he's like, you're not the languishing type. I'm like, okay.[2:58:43] Dr. Adam Grant: Maybe everybody's baseline is different. Like, I I think one of the things I'm I'm really lucky to have is high reserves of energy. Mhmm. But for me, Languishing is, like, I felt like I did nothing today. And, you know, in a typical day, like, if I'm writing a book, I should be able to, like, write a 1,000 words I'm proud of, and I don't like a single word that I produced.[2:59:05] Dr. Adam Grant: Or I sat at my blinking cursor, like, staring at the computer screen. And For that umpteenth time, wondered, like, did they call it a cursor because of all the writers who've cursed it? And then I end up Like, googling, what's the like, what are the Latin roots of the word cursor? Where did this come from? And, like, that is not a good use of time.[2:59:23] Dr. Adam Grant: That's like, that's not forward mass. That's like I'm spinning. So So good. Yeah. I I think everybody languishes, and I aspire to do it Less often, but not never.[2:59:33] Andrew Huberman: Love it. What does cursor what is the root of cursor? People will look it up. Put hey, folks. Put in the put it in the, comments on YouTube.[2:59:41] Dr. Adam Grant: I did I did look it up.[2:59:42] Andrew Huberman: Oh, good. Okay. You'll tell us now.[2:59:44] Dr. Adam Grant: No. I I feel like there's a there's a footnote in hidden potential, and I'm trying to remember. It comes from, Curre Re, I think. And, the cursor, originally came nope. I don't wanna do it.[2:59:56] Dr. Adam Grant: I'm gonna skip I don't remember.[2:59:57] Andrew Huberman: This is, your hippocampus your hippocampus is smart enough to have discarded that information. That's not useful. You have more important things to do. Forgive me for asking the question. Folks, put it in the comments on YouTube.[3:00:08] Andrew Huberman: So good. I have 1 more question about potential. You have children. Correct? 3.[3:00:14] Andrew Huberman: And a lot of our listeners either are children or have children. And even for those that Don't have children. I'm curious. With the vast array of knowledge that you now have about potential and the fact that kids are these incredible Sponges. Right?[3:00:31] Andrew Huberman: They I mean, they they certainly experience discomfort. We know that. They are sponges. We Maybe there are kids that are just perfectionists by default, but I have to imagine that they are because standards come about when we become aware of other people's performance. Right?[3:00:56] Andrew Huberman: What sorts of messages do you recommend parents give their kids? And What sorts of messages are you actually implementing that perhaps are different than you, were prior to researching and writing your book on potential?[3:01:12] Dr. Adam Grant: Oh, interesting. Well, the first thing I should say is, Becky Kennedy, doctor Becky, is my favorite source of insight on parenting, and she's changed the way I think of The the way I think about a lot of what I do with our kids, but my wife, Allison, is She her her instincts about effective parenting are so sophisticated. I feel like every day, I learned something from watching her communicate with our And so I I came in thinking, alright. Like, I'm gonna write this book about potential. I'm not gonna do a parenting chapter because I want everything to be relevant to parents.[3:01:50] Dr. Adam Grant: And, sure enough, there's a chapter that had nothing to do with parenting where I was like, oh, actually, I'm reading this research, and there was a moment where I did something well, and I didn't even mean to do it. And this is something that I think everyone Probably underutilizes it. I don't wanna actually, that's an overstatement. I think a lot of people, don't appreciate the importance of of this approach to parenting, and I am trying to do it more often. So, quick quick story, and then I'll I'll back up into the principles.[3:02:20] Dr. Adam Grant: So I was, I was getting ready to give my 1st TED Talk A number of years ago, extremely nervous. I'm a shy introvert. I was, for a long time, afraid of public speaking. I remember in college literally shaking, to raise my hand, being that nervous. And now I'm supposed to get in the red circle.[3:02:40] Dr. Adam Grant: Not my idea of comfort zone. And Happened to mention to our oldest daughter that I was nervous, and I asked her for advice on what I should do. And she said, I think I think at the time let's see. She must have been she was 7 maybe. I think 7.[3:02:59] Dr. Adam Grant: Maybe 6. Anyway, she said, look for a smiling face in the audience. So It was it was one of those moments where I'm like, oh, that's such a good idea. Why didn't I think of that? Like, yes.[3:03:13] Dr. Adam Grant: I can do that. I know people who are gonna be in the So I asked a couple of friends to sit in the front rows, and I I locked eyes with a couple of them, and my nerves went down a little bit. So a couple weeks later, Joanna's getting ready to be in a school play, and she's also shy and introverted. And she's nervous, and she asks us for advice. And instead of telling her what to do, I said, well, what did you suggest to me a few weeks ago?[3:03:42] Dr. Adam Grant: And she she remembered, and she said, look for a smiling face. And It it was it was one of, like, the it was one of the most moving moments, of my life. Like, Allison and I got to the play, And she looked at us, and she beamed. And I just, I I think what I learned from that experience was, kids need to feel that they matter. And most of us think about mattering as, you know, showing kids that they're unconditionally loved and giving them the support they need.[3:04:18] Dr. Adam Grant: But we forget that part of feeling that you matter is feeling that you make a difference. So as a kid, feeling like you have something to contribute. As a parent asking my daughter for advice, that boosted her confidence. And I think that This is, I've come to call this the coach effect. It's one of my favorite recent findings in psychology that, when when you're struggling with something, Your instinct is to go to somebody else for advice and say, I need guidance.[3:04:45] Dr. Adam Grant: The problem is that keeps you in a passive frame of mind. It makes you feel like you're dependent on others. What you're better off doing is finding somebody else with a similar challenge and giving them advice. And what that does is it it shows you that you have something to give. It boosts your efficacy.[3:05:01] Dr. Adam Grant: The research on this by Lauren Eskris Winkler and colleagues, is fascinating. So people who give advice Instead of receiving it, randomly assigned, end up, more motivated and more confident. And I think this is something every parent could do. Right. Whatever challenge you think your kid is gonna face, find a version of it that you're grappling with and seek their guidance on it.[3:05:22] Dr. Adam Grant: And when they run into that same challenge, They will have confidence that they can begin to figure it out on their own, and you can be a coach in that process as opposed to just telling them what to do, which They may feel like it's not relevant, or they may resist because they don't wanna be told what to do by a parent. So that is my favorite parenting lesson from Hidden Potential.[3:05:41] Andrew Huberman: I love that. And I love your statement that, you know, kids, like adults, want to matter. You know? That being you know, we hear, you know, make them feel important, But so often that's tied to performance metrics, and those performance metrics are the very things that are making them nervous or that are creating anxiety. I love it.[3:06:02] Andrew Huberman: Are you taking additional kids for adoption? Because I'm I'm raising I'm raising I'm raising my hand.[3:06:07] Dr. Adam Grant: I think there'd be a lot more developmental psychologists in the world if, if we chose our careers later.[3:06:14] Andrew Huberman: Super interesting topic. And, by the way, I'm life. I'm very much looking forward to reading your book, Hidden Potential. Clearly, I have a lot to resolve around that issue because, I still hear Miss Rolfe in the in, middle school just telling me how much potential we have and that, and that I wasn't accessing mine. Oh, yeah.[3:06:32] Andrew Huberman: I'd say, like, a voice in the back of my head, all the time. And, even though I feel very happy with, many aspects of my life that there are a lot of things that I want to do that I haven't done. And I think it's Through, you know, limit limited, what do they call it? Limiting self beliefs or things of that sort.[3:06:50] Dr. Adam Grant: Self limiting beliefs.[3:06:51] Andrew Huberman: Self limiting beliefs. There you go. I can't even say say the phrase.[3:06:54] Dr. Adam Grant: Yeah. I do I do think all your fans are like, yeah, that Andrew Huberman really hasn't he hasn't really Tap his potential at all. He's squandering it all.[3:07:03] Andrew Huberman: Well, keep in mind, I've I've lived in a fairly narrow trench of of pursuit. You know? At 19, I got into this, and I've been doing this, Like, researching and teaching and doing research. Like, for it's pretty much all I've done for, like, almost you know, heading to 30 years. So and you too, you've been in this In this game for a long time and it's it's where we like to play.[3:07:20] Andrew Huberman: But, but what I've learned from you today in addition to many other things is that, realizing our potential, has so much to do with, you know, reaching outside. We hear about our comfort zone, but it's also reaching into our, like, deeper Wishes and thoughts and, I I keep coming back to this idea of the tag team podcast and and the origins of that in your mind. It's like, I never would have expected that, But it also reveals something that sounds kinda like intrinsic to you. Like, you maybe you like to see things play out, the way you think they should be played out as opposed to the what's clearly a, intractable battle of loggerheads these days.[3:07:59] Dr. Adam Grant: That is a that's a core value.
