I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Sam Harris. Doctor Sam Harris did his undergraduate training in philosophy at Stanford University and then went on to do his doctorate in neuroscience at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is well known as an author who has written about everything from meditation to consciousness, free will, and he holds many strong political views that he's voiced on social media and in the content of various books as they relate to philosophy and neuroscience.[0:00:42] Andrew Huberman: During today's episode, I mainly talked to doctor Harris about his views and practices related to meditation, consciousness, and free will. In fact, he made several important points about what a proper meditation practice can accomplish. Prior to this episode, I thought that meditation was about deliberately changing one's conscious experience in order to achieve things such as deeper relaxation, a heightened sense of focus or ability to focus generally, elevated Did memory and so on. What Sam taught me and what you'll soon learn as well is that while meditation does indeed hold all of those valuable benefits, the main value of a meditation practice or perhaps the greater value of a meditation practice is that it doesn't just allow one to change their conscious Variance. But it actually can allow a human being to view consciousness itself, that is to understand what the process of consciousness is.[0:01:35] Andrew Huberman: And everyday life. And in and at all times, both in sleep and in waking states. And in that way, making meditation perhaps the most potent and important portal by which one can access novel ways of thinking and being and viewing one's life experience. We also discussed the so called mind body problem and issues of duality and free will, concepts from philosophy and neuroscience that fortunately, thanks to valuable experiments and Deep thinking on the part of people like doctor Sam Harris and others is now leading people to understand really what free will is and isn't, Where the locus of free will likely sits in the brain, if it indeed resides in the brain at all, and what it means to be a conscious being, and how we can modify our conscious states in ways that allow us to be more functional. We also discuss perception, both visual perception, auditory perception, And especially interesting to me, and I think as well, hopefully, to you, time perception, which we know is very elastic in the brain.[0:02:44] Andrew Huberman: The literal frame rate by which we process our conscious experience can expand and contract dramatically depending on our state of mind and how conscious we are about our state of mind. So we went deep into that topic as well. Today's discussion was indeed an intellectual deep dive into all the topics that I mentioned a few moments ago, but it also included many practical tools. In fact, I pushed Sam to share with us what his specific practices are and how we can all arrive at a clear and better understanding of a meditation practice that we can each and all apply so that we can derive these incredible not just the ones related to stress and focus and enhanced memory, but the ones that relate to our consciousness that is to our deeper sense of self and to others. Several times during today's episode, I mentioned the Waking Up app.[0:03:32] Andrew Huberman: The Waking Up app was developed by Sam Harris, but I want to emphasize that my mention of the app is in no way a paid promotional. Rather, the Waking Up app is one that I've used for some period of time now and find very, very useful. I have family members that also use it, other staff members here at the Huberman Lab Podcast use it because we find it to be such a powerful tool. Sam has generously offered Huberman Lab Podcast listeners A 30 day completely free trial of the Waking Up app. If any of you wanna try it, you can simply go to waking up.com/huberman to get that 30 day free trial.[0:04:03] Andrew Huberman: During today's discussion, we didn't just talk about meditation, consciousness, and free will. We also talked about psychedelics, both their therapeutic applications for the treatment Things like depression and PTSD, but also the use of psychedelics, and we discussed Sam's experiences with psychedelics as they relate to expanding one's consciousness. I also asked Sam about his views and practices related to social media prompted in no small part by his recent voluntary decision To close down his Twitter account. So we talked about his rationale for doing that, how he feels about doing that, and I think you'll find that to be very interesting as well. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:04:43] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about Science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feedback using a continuous glucose monitor. Of the most important factors in your immediate and long term health are your blood sugar levels, and not just your overall blood sugar levels, but your blood sugar levels throughout the day in response to different Foods you eat to fasting, if you're into fasting, to exercise, and so forth.[0:05:18] Andrew Huberman: I started using Levels some time ago in order to figure out how different foods impact My blood sugar levels. And indeed, it does that very well. It allowed me to see how certain foods really spike my blood sugar and others keep it more level. And in particular, how foods that I eat after exercise can help raise my blood glucose just enough, but not so much that then I get a crash 2 3 hours later, which was what was happening before I started using Levels, I've made certain adjustments to my diet. I can now eat post exercise and still have Plenty of energy throughout the day without any issue.[0:05:47] Andrew Huberman: It also has helped me understand how different behaviors impact my blood glucose levels. If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous Glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Again, that's levels.link spelled l I n k /huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop. Whoop is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep, but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking to provide real time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules in order to feel and perform better.[0:06:17] Andrew Huberman: 6 months ago, I started working with WHOOP as a member of their scientific advisory council as a way to help WHOOP advance their mission of unlocking human performance. And as a WHOOP user, I've experienced firsthand the health benefits of their technology. It's clear based on quality research that Woot can inform you how well you're sleeping, how to change your sleep habits, how to change your activity habits, even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and lifestyle In order to maximize your mental health, physical health, and performance, so whether or not you're an athlete or you're exercising simply for health, WHOOP can really help you understand how your body functions under different conditions, and how to really program your schedule, nutrition, and exercise, and many other factors of your life in order to really optimize your health and performance, including your cognition. If you're interested in trying WHOOP, you can go to join WHOOP, spelled whoop.com/huberman. That's join whoop.com/ Huberman today and get your 1st month free.[0:07:13] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep Every single night is to optimize the temperature of your sleeping environment. Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep, Your body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.[0:07:40] Andrew Huberman: And waking up, on the other hand, involves a heating of your body by about 1 to 3 degrees. With 8 Sleep, you can tune the temperature of your mattress cover or mattress to be cooler or hotter depending on whether or not you tend to run too hot or too cold, you can even vary it across the night so that you can access the best deep sleep early in the night, the so called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep that's more pronounced in the later half of the night. And doing so, really get your sleep optimized, not just in terms of duration, but in terms of quality and the overall Architecture of your sleep. This has a profound influence on your alertness focus mood and many other important factors throughout the day. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep com/huberman to save up to $150 off their Pod three cover.[0:08:22] Andrew Huberman: Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Select countries in the EU and Australia.

And now for my discussion with doctor Sam Harris, Doctor Sam Harris.[0:08:56] Andrew Huberman: We're just talking about this.[0:08:57] Dr. Sam Harris: You are[0:08:57] Andrew Huberman: you are indeed a doctor.[0:08:59] Dr. Sam Harris: Sorry, Sam. I cannot save your life, but, I am I might I might I might save your nonexistent soul if we talk long enough.[0:09:06] Andrew Huberman: Well, neither of us are clinicians, but we are both, brain explorers from the different perspectives, some overlapping.[0:09:14] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[0:09:15] Andrew Huberman: And I'm really excited to have this conversation. I've been listening to your voice For many years, learning from you for many years, and I'd be remiss if I didn't say that my father, who's also a scientist, He's an enormous fan of your waking up[0:09:30] Dr. Sam Harris: app Nice.[0:09:31] Andrew Huberman: And has spent a lot of time over the last few years. He's in his late seventies. He's almost 80. He's a theoretical physicist walking to the park near his apartment and spending time meditating with the app Or sometimes separate from the app, but using the same sorts of meditations in his head. Yeah.[0:09:48] Andrew Huberman: So he kinda toggles back and forth. And even, I shouldn't say even, but, yes, even in his Late seventies has reported that it has significantly shifted his awareness of self and His conscious experience of things happening in and around him.[0:10:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Mhmm.[0:10:05] Andrew Huberman: And he was somebody who I think already saw himself as, pretty aware person thinking about, you know, quantum mechanics and and and the rest. So a thank you from him indirectly. I thank you from me, now directly, and I really wanna use that as a way to frame up what I think is one of the more interesting questions in, not just science and philosophy and psychology, but all of life, which is what is this thing that we call a self? Yeah. As far as I know, we have not localized the region in the brain that can entirely account for our perception of self.[0:10:43] Andrew Huberman: There are areas, of course, that Regulate proprioception, you know, our awareness of where our limbs are in space, maybe even our awareness of where we are in physical space. There are such circuits as we both know.[0:10:53] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[0:10:54] Andrew Huberman: But When we talk about sense of self, I have to remember this kind of, neuroscience 101, thing that we always say. You know, when you teach memory, you you know, you wake up every morning, and you remember who you are. You know who you are. Most people do. Even if they lack memory systems in the brain for whatever reason, Pretty much everyone seems to know who they are.[0:11:15] Andrew Huberman: What are your thoughts on what that whole thing is about? I mean, do we come into the world feeling that way? I Would appreciate answers from the perspective of any field, including neuroscience, of course.[0:11:27] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Well, big question. I mean, the Problem is we we use the term self in so many different ways. Right? And and there's there's one sense of that term, which, is the target of meditation, and and and it's the target of deconstruction by the practice and by just in any surrounding philosophy.[0:11:45] Dr. Sam Harris: So You'll you'll hear and you'll hear it from me that this self is an illusion. Right? And and that there's a there's a psychological freedom that can be experienced on the other side of discovering it to be an illusion. And some people don't like that framing. Some people would would insist that it's not so much an illusion, but it's a it's a construct, and it's not what it seems.[0:12:07] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? But it's not that every use of the term self is illegitimate, and there are certain types of selves that are not Illusory. I mean, you know, I'm not saying that people are illusions. I'm not saying that you can't, Talk about yourself as distinct yourself as as the whole person and and, you know, with as, you know, psychological continuity with your past experience, as being distinct from the person and psychological continuity of some other person. Right?[0:12:39] Dr. Sam Harris: Obviously, we have to be able to conserve those data. It's not fundamentally mysterious that you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning still being psychologically continuous with your past and not my past. Right? And and, You know, if we swapped lives, you know, that would, you know, demand some explanation. So the illusoriness of the self doesn't Cut against any of those obvious facts.[0:13:02] Dr. Sam Harris: So the the the the sense of self that is illusory. And, again, we might wanna talk about self in other modes because there there's, you know, there's just a lot of interest there psychologically and, you know, ultimately, scientifically. The the thing that doesn't exist, certainly doesn't exist as it seems, and I would I would wanna argue that it actually is just a proper illusion, is this the sense that there is a subject interior to experience in addition to experience. So most people feel like They're having an experience of the world, and they're having their an experience of their bodies in the world. And in addition to that, They feel that they are a subject internal to the body, you know, very likely in in the head.[0:13:49] Dr. Sam Harris: Most people feel like they're behind their face As a kind of locus of awareness and thought and intention and and that every it's it's almost like they're you're a passenger inside your body. Know what? Most people don't feel identical to their bodies, and they can imagine this this is sort of the origin, the psychological origin, you know, the the folk psychological origin of of a sense of that there's there might be a soul that could survive the death of the body. I mean, most people are are what my friend Paul Bloom calls common sense dualists. Right?[0:14:19] Dr. Sam Harris: You you You're just the default expectation seems to be that whatever the relationship between the mind and the body, there's this There's some promise of separability there. Right? That the and whenever you really push hard On the science side and say, well, none of the mind is really just what the brain is doing, that begins to feel more and more counterintuitive to people. And there still seems some Some residual mystery that, you know, at death, maybe something is gonna lift off the brain and go elsewhere. Right?[0:14:53] Dr. Sam Harris: So there's a sense of dualism, that many people have, and, obviously, that's supported by many religious beliefs. But this feeling, It's it's a very peculiar starting point. People feel that in a in a They don't feel identical to their experience. Right? As a matter of experience, they feel like they're on the edge of experience.[0:15:17] Dr. Sam Harris: Somehow appropriating it From the side, you're kind of on the edge of the world, and the world is out there. Your body is is, in some sense, an object in the world, which you, you know, you it's different from the world. You know? The the boundary of your skin is still meaningful. You can sort of loosely control Your body, I mean, you can't control you can control your gross, you know, and and subtle, you know, voluntary motor movements, but, You can't.[0:15:43] Dr. Sam Harris: You're not controlling everything your body is doing. You're not controlling your heartbeat and your, you know, your, hormonal Secretions and all of that. And so there's a lot that's going on that is in the dark for you. And then you you you give someone an instruction To meditate, say and you say, okay. Let's let's examine all of this from the 1st person side.[0:16:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Let's look for this thing you're calling eye. And, Again, eye is not identical to the body. People feel like their hands are out there, and they're when if they're gonna meditate, they're gonna close their eyes very likely, and now they're gonna pay attention to something. They're gonna pay attention to the breath or the sounds. And it's from the point of view of being a locus of attention that is now Aiming attention strategically at an object like the breath, that there's this dualism that is set up.[0:16:32] Dr. Sam Harris: And, Ultimately, the ultimate promise of meditation I mean, there are really 2 levels at which you could be interested in in meditation. One is, you know, very straightforward and remedial and non paradoxical and very well subscribed, and it's it's the usual set of Claims about all the benefits you're gonna get from meditation. Right? So you're gonna lower your stress, and you're gonna increase your focus, and you're gonna, you know, stave off cortical thinning. I know there's all kinds of good things that Science is saying meditation will will give you, and none of that entails Really drilling down on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion or or or anything else of that sort.[0:17:14] Dr. Sam Harris: But from my point of view, The real purpose of meditation and its real promise is not in this long list of of benefits. And, you know, I'm not discounting any of those, Though, you know, the science, for many of them is quite provisional, it's in this deeper claim that if you look For this thing you're calling I, if you look for the sense that that there's a thinker in addition to the the the mirror rising of the next thought, say, You won't find that thing, and and you can what's more, you cannot find it in a way that's conclusive, and that matters. Right? And it and it and it has a, there's a host of benefits that follow from that discovery, which are, Quite a bit deeper and more interesting than engaging meditation on the side of its benefits, you know, destressing, increasing focus, and all the rest.[0:18:07] Andrew Huberman: I have a number of questions related to what you just said. And, first of all, I I agree that the evidence that Meditation can improve focus, reduce stress, etcetera. It's there. It's, not an enormous pile of evidence, but it's growing. And I think that, especially for some of the shorter meditations, which I, these days, view more as perceptual exercises.[0:18:29] Andrew Huberman: You know, talked about this on the podcast before, but for those that haven't heard it before about, you know, perception, you can have exteroception extending to Things beyond the confines of your skin, interoception, which is I think also includes the surfaces of the skin, but everything inward.[0:18:43] Dr. Sam Harris: Mhmm.[0:18:44] Andrew Huberman: And Meditation through eyes closed typically, involving some sort of, attentional spotlighting, something we'll get into, to more interoceptive versus exteroceptive events, etcetera, including thoughts. And, so I think of At a at a basic level, meditation is a somewhat of a perceptual exercise. You can tell me where you disagree there, and I I would Expect and hope that that you would. But I would like to just touch on this idea that you brought up because it's such an interesting one of This idea that our bodies are containers and that we, somehow view ourselves as passengers within those containers, that's certainly been my experience. And the image that I have is of, as you say that, is of myself or of people out there that sit a a a few centimeters below the surface or that sit entirely in their head.[0:19:36] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, the brain and body are connected through the nervous system. I think sometimes a brain, is used to replace nervous system, and that can get us into trouble in terms of coming up with real real directions and definitions. But The point is that there is something special about the real estate in the head. I think for as much as my laboratory and many other scientists are are Really interested in brain body connections through the nervous system and other organ systems of the that the nervous system binds that if you cut off all my limbs, I'm going to be different, but I'm fundamentally still Andrew. Whereas if we were to lesion a, you know, a couple square millimeters out of my parietal cortex, it's an open question as to whether or not I would still seem as much like Andrew, to other people and to myself Yeah.[0:20:22] Andrew Huberman: Even. Yeah. And so there's something fundamentally different about the real estate in the cranial vault. Right? If you even remove both of my eyes, I'd still be Andrew.[0:20:29] Andrew Huberman: And those are 2 pieces of my central nervous system that are fundamental to my daily life, but I'd still be me. Whereas, and this doesn't, I think, just apply to memory systems. I mean, I think there are regions of the frontal cortex that when destroyed have been shown to modify personality and self perception in in dramatic ways. So It's a sort of obvious point once it's made, but I do think it's worth highlighting because there does seem to be something special about being in the head. The other thing is that Sitting a few centimeters below the surface or riding in this container makes sense to me, except I I wonder if you've ever, experienced a shift as I have when something very extreme happens.[0:21:13] Andrew Huberman: Let's use the the negative Example of, you know, all of a sudden, you're in a fear state. All of a sudden, it feels as if your entire body is is you Or as me and as and and now I need to get this thing, the whole container, and me to some place of safety in what whatever form. This is also true, I think, in ecstatic states[0:21:33] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[0:21:33] Andrew Huberman: Where you can feel really when people say embodied, I wonder whether or not we normally below the surface of our body. When I say oscillate, I mean, in neural terms, I mean, maybe our sensory experience is not truly at the bodily surface, but sits below the bodily surface More at the level of organ systems and within our head and then certain things that jolt us, our autonomic nervous system into heightened states, Bring us into states of, you know, bring us closer to the surface, and therefore, include all of us. Again, I don't wanna take us down a a mechanistic description of of something that doesn't exist. But does any of that resonate, in terms of how you are thinking about or describing the self?[0:22:11] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. There's there's a lot there. If first, on the point of the brain being, you know, the the locus of of what we are as minds, yeah. I mean, there there are people who will insist that sort of the whole nervous system has to be thought of as a when you're talking about our emotional life and, you know, you know, the The the, the the insular's connection to, the gut and you just said that the the sense of of self extends beyond the brain, but I I totally take your point that a brain transplant is a coherent idea, And you would expect to go with the brain rather than with the the viscera.[0:22:49] Dr. Sam Harris: And, so in that sense, we really are the the old philosophical thought experiment of Being a brain in a vat. I mean, we essentially are already you know, the the vat is our skull, and we're, you know, virtually in that situation.[0:23:03] Andrew Huberman: Horrible movie. I'm sorry. I can't hope to interrupt. When I was a a teenager, my sister and I used to go to the movies every once in a while, and we'd trade off who could pick the movie.[0:23:11] Dr. Sam Harris: Mhmm.[0:23:11] Andrew Huberman: And, She took me to see once the movie boxing Helena, the David Lynch film[0:23:16] Dr. Sam Harris: I never saw that. Yeah.[0:23:17] Andrew Huberman: Where he amputates the limbs of a woman who he's Obsessed by and keeps her. It's a really horrible Yeah. Film. And about 20 minutes into it, my sister just turned to me and said, I'm so sorry. And the question then was whether or not 2 siblings should actually persist in a movie like that.[0:23:31] Andrew Huberman: Right. We decided to persist in the movie so that we could laugh about it later, but it was rather disturbing. I don't recommend the movie nor do I recommend seeing it with a sibling. But in that movie, the the woman, he He takes her as a container and and restricts her movement. Right?[0:23:45] Andrew Huberman: Quite sadistic and horrible thing, really. David Lynch. Interesting mind, perhaps. But Yeah. The the idea was that, was to question how much of the person persists in the absence of their ability to move, etcetera.[0:24:00] Andrew Huberman: Could there be love? Could there be these other affections? Anyway, a rather extreme example, but, one that I That still haunts me, and I suppose I'm thinking about still now. Yeah.[0:24:09] Dr. Sam Harris: Well so but the just to follow that point, there's a There's a lot about us that we don't have access to unless we enact it physically. Like, you know, if I ask you, You know, do you still know how to ride a bike? Right? There's no place in your memory where you can you can inspect by, you know, just sitting in your chair that you you've retained the knowledge of how to ride a bike. Right?[0:24:35] Dr. Sam Harris: Like I said, procedural memory is different from semantic or episodic memory. If I asked you, you know, do, you know, do you know Your address, yes, you can recall your address just sitting there. But if you if you had had a micro stroke that neatly dissected out your ability to ride a bike, You know? And and left everything else intact. You know?[0:24:53] Dr. Sam Harris: You might think you could ride a bike, but suddenly, you stand up next to 1, and you have no idea what to do with it. And that would be a discovery that would only happen if you were, you know, motorically engaged with that, you know, object. And I'm sure there's you know, we could probably come up with a 100 things about us that really seem poor to us, and we and and are not separable for our you know, from our, you know, personhood, which Seem to only cut you know, only get invoked when we're, you know, out there moving in the world and, you know, we have limbs, etcetera. And, But yeah. No.[0:25:29] Dr. Sam Harris: It's the the seat of of consciousness. I mean, the the the right framework to talk about all of this from my point of view is consciousness and its contents. Right? So we have consciousness. The fact that there's something that is like to be us.[0:25:44] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? The fact that that the the world And our internal experience is is illuminated that it has a qualitative character. And then there's the question of what is that qualitative character? What is, you know, what kinds of information do we have access to? What does it feel like to be us?[0:26:02] Dr. Sam Harris: How do How do different states of arousal change that? So you talked about fear. Yeah. I mean, fear can change a lot of things, but, and, you know, various neurological deficits or, you know, you know, you can add drugs to the mix. You add psychedelics that radically transform the contents of consciousness.[0:26:20] Dr. Sam Harris: From my point of view, consciousness itself is simply the the cognizance, the awareness, this that That is the the floodlights by which any of that stuff appears. Right? So, consciousness doesn't change, but its contents Change. And, to come back to meditation for a second, many people think meditation is about changing the contents of consciousness. You there's some some contents you wanna get rid of like anxiety, other contents you want to to encourage like calm and, you know, unconditional love or, you know, some other, you know, classically Pleasant prosocial emotion, and that's all fine.[0:26:59] Dr. Sam Harris: That's all possible. But the real, you know, wisdom of, you know, the, you know, the 2000 year old wisdom of meditation that really is the, you know, the the chewy center of the the tootsie pop is a recognition of what consciousness itself is always already like regardless of the contents and the changes in contents. And This is why I mean, well, we might talk about this, but this is why they're mutually compatible. Psychedelics and meditation for me are somewhat orthogonal because Psychedelics is all about making wholesale changes to the contents of consciousness. And and there's a you know, some wonderful consequences of doing that.[0:27:38] Dr. Sam Harris: There can be some Heroin and terrifying consequences of doing that. But, generally speaking, I think, you know, you used used wisely, they can be incredibly valuable, and and The therapeutic potential there is enormous, but the crucial disjunction here is that There really is something to recognize about ordinary waking consciousness, the the consciousness that's compatible with my driving a car to get here on time. Right? You know, you don't have to You don't have to have the pyrotechnics of be being on LSD to see the the This the the to transcend the central illusion that I'm I'm saying is is the the thing to be transcended, which is the sense that There is a duality between subject and object in every moment of experience. And to take it back to to something you said about just all of our different modes In ordinary life, the interesting thing is I think people are constantly losing their sense of self, and they're not aware of it.[0:28:36] Dr. Sam Harris: And, I mean, there there's a, Probably an analogy to the visual system here, which is to, visual saccades, which perhaps you've spoken about at some point on your podcast.[0:28:48] Andrew Huberman: Not enough. So please.[0:28:49] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. So so what happens with our you know, every time we move our eyes, this is called saccade, and we do that about, you know, 3 times a second or so, just normally. There is a you know, the the region of motor cortex that That affects that movement sends what's called an an efferent copy of that motor movement, Which is which is used as information that propagates back to visual cortex that suppresses, the data of vision while the eyes are moving. Because, otherwise, if you weren't doing that, every time you moved your eyes, it would seem like the visual scene itself was lurching around.[0:29:27] Dr. Sam Harris: And people can experience this for themselves if they just, you know, touch one of their eyeballs on the side, you know, not all that hard and kind of jiggle it, And then, like, you can roll it around. You can jiggle it from side to side. You can see that a a, a movement of the eyeball that's not governed by your Ocular motor system delivers a jiggling of the world because it's not your brain is not anticipating it in the same way, and it's not you're not producing that that that same, you know, predictive copy of of the movement.[0:29:57] Andrew Huberman: It's a little bit like, some action sports filmers on our staff here. The the gimbal, you know, that holds a a an iPhone that you see the kids with on Yeah. Surfboards or skateboards or something. They're gonna hold a phone moving around are the people who are the vloggers. Does anyone even still use that for his blog?[0:30:14] Andrew Huberman: I guess. Moving around into it's It's image stabilization, essentially, that keeps the the camera steady, and these are more than cameras, of course, the the for those listening they do far more than just what a camera would do. But, yeah, this internal system of of image stabilization. Yeah. I could see, perhaps, where you're going with this, that that it allows us to remain in a self referencing scheme as opposed to, start paying attention to just how confusing it is to to track the visual world at some level.[0:30:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Well, actually, where I'm going is that so people are having this suppression of vision 3 times a second on average, and they're not experiencing it. Right? So, like, you're, like, you're literally, like, You're you're you're effectively going blind, and you're not noticing it. And, It's very fast. Yes.[0:31:07] Dr. Sam Harris: It's very fast. Now There there's an analogous, suppression, I would say, of the sense of self that occurs every time Attention gets absorbed significantly in its object. Right? So, like, we we even have this concept of, you know, losing yourself in your work Or, you know, you're losing your I mean, the classic flow experiences have this this quality where there's the and this this tends to be why they're so rewarding, where there's just if you're in in some, you know, athletic activity or, you know, an an aesthetic one, or you could be having sex or you could be whatever it is, some peak experience, its piqueness usually entails There being some brief period where there was no distance between you and the experience. Right?[0:31:59] Dr. Sam Harris: There for that moment, you were no longer looking over your own shoulder or anticipating the next moment or trying to get somewhere where where you weren't or, you know, micromanaging errors or, you know, like this you know, there's not There's just the flow of unity with whatever the, you know, whatever the experience is. You know? A surfer on on the wave. Right? And we love those experiences.[0:32:24] Dr. Sam Harris: And then we are continually Abstract it away from them by our thinking about them. Like, we would think, oh my god. That that was so good, or how do I get back to that? Or, you know, you're looking at a sunset. It's the most beautiful sunset you've ever seen, And then you're continually interrupting the experience of merely seeing it with a Commentary about how amazing this is, and I wonder, you know, what are real estate prices here?[0:32:50] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, is it possible that we could we could move here? And, like, you your your your mind is just Continually narrating a conversation you're having with yourself, however, paradoxically. I mean, you're telling yourselves thing yourself things that you already know, as though there were 2 of you rather often. Right? Like, you know, you're just you know, I'm looking for, you know, which which is the water, and I said, oh, there it is.[0:33:12] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? But, like, I'm the one seeing it. Who am I saying? Oh, the you know, there it is too. So there's someone else who needs to be informed about The thing I already saw.[0:33:23] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So it's it's, there's something about our internal dialogue that is paradoxical.[0:33:29] Andrew Huberman: Is there any, neurologic condition, cholecylectomy or or anything like that where somehow People feel more unified with the self on a continual basis. The observer and the actor within whether it Stay more more, as a as a complete sentence. Is there any known neurological syndrome? It may sound like a bad thing, but it could be a good thing, whereby people feel that the actor and the observer within them are unified continually.[0:34:01] Dr. Sam Harris: There's not a pathological one. Some of them, The work on the default mode network suggests that that's at least part of the story. Right? So the default mode network, Which has been talked about a lot of late because it's it has come up both in the in the meditation literature and in the psychedelic literature. But its original, discovery was that you know?[0:34:24] Dr. Sam Harris: And the reason why it was called the default mode was is that in virtually every Neuroimaging experiment ever run, they found that between tasks, when the brain was just in its default state, The these these midline structures would would, increase their activity, and then they would then they would reliably diminish whenever The person in the scanner was was on task, and usually that meant some kind of outward looking, You know, visual discrimination task. I mean, but it could be it could be, you know, it could be visual. It could be semantic. It could be but they're it tends to be their eyes are open, and paying attention to something that's being broadcast to them through, you know, monitor, goggles, or, you know, they're looking at a mirror that's showing them a computer monitor. But the so the the general insight was there are these midline structures in the brain that seem to be, increasing their activity when the brain is just kind of idling between tasks waiting for something to happen.[0:35:22] Dr. Sam Harris: And then further experiments found tasks that actually upregulated, activity there, you know, beyond baseline. And those tasks seem to be Self referential so that when you ask people you know, you give them a list of words and you say, would do these any any of these apply to you? Right? You know? And so people or or you ask people to think about, you know, actually, one experiment I did when you you know, when you're challenging people's beliefs, when you're challenging beliefs that that have more of a personal significance like political or religious beliefs, you get an upregulation in these regions as opposed to just Generic beliefs about, you know, you're in Los Angeles.[0:36:04] Dr. Sam Harris: This is a table. You know? There's something to which, you know, people are not, you know, holding fast as a matter of identity. So, anyway, Both meditation and psychedelics seem to suppress activity in these in these regions, which we know are associated with both self talk, mind wandering, and and explicit acts of self representation. Right?[0:36:30] Dr. Sam Harris: So[0:36:31] Andrew Huberman: we say that they are somewhat autobiographical because they access memory systems? And in the way you're describing them and in the way that colleague of mine who's been a guest on this podcast, I don't know if you've interacted with him before, but I think you'd very much enjoy whatever interaction you do would have is, David Spiegel. He's our associate chair of psychiatry.[0:36:48] Dr. Sam Harris: He[0:36:49] Andrew Huberman: and his father actually, his father then, he founded, hypnosis as a valid clinical practice in psychiatry. And Hypnosis, which is obviously a heightened sense of attention with deep relaxation, is known to, dramatically suppress the the default mode network. He talks about this a lot, and I I always wonder as we take down activity within the default mode network, What surfaces it in its place and is what surfaces it in its place, does that somehow reflect that the 2 are normally in a push pull? Because that's not necessarily the case. Right?[0:37:24] Andrew Huberman: When I fall asleep, I can hallucinate, but that doesn't mean that during the day, my, the fact that I'm looking at objects is is what's preventing me from hallucinating. If I close my eyes, I can get imagery. But, you know, there's this kind of a a different illusion, the illusion of antagonistic circuitry sometimes. I don't wanna take us off course, but the default mode network seems to want to be there, quote, unquote. It seems it seems to be fighting for for Our attention, unless we give ourselves a visual target or an auditory target or some salient experience of some kind, it sounds like.[0:37:55] Andrew Huberman: And then if, I'm surprised to hear that meditation reduces activity in the default mode network at some level because meditation to me Oftentimes involves, paying attention to some sort of perceptual target.[0:38:10] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. So[0:38:10] Andrew Huberman: maybe you could, eventually explain as to, How it might do that or why it might Yeah.[0:38:16] Dr. Sam Harris: And and I don't I don't think it's the whole story because, obviously, outward going attention is not, Even if you're having the kind of egoic saccade that I'm talking about where you're like you're actually not Clearly aware of of yourself. You're not clearly defining yourself as separate from experience, for the moment of paying attention. So you are sort of losing yourself Your work, that's not the same thing as having the clear meditative insight of selflessness that I'm that I'm claiming is the goal of meditation. But there is a you know, to to wind back to the original point I was making and the reason why I drew the ref the analogy to visuals saccades. I do think there's a continuous interruption in our sense of self that goes unrecognized.[0:39:03] Dr. Sam Harris: And, But but but the conscious, acquisition of of of the understanding that the the self is an illusion is a different Experience and it's I mean, because it it you're you're then you're then focusing on this absence. Actually, there's another analogy to to, you know, the the visual system that applies here, which is to the the optic blind spot. I mean, it's like so, which is a good analogy for me because it Cuts through a a bunch of false assumption as to what kind of where that you would look for this or how this relates to ordinary experience. So as many people know that we have, you know, in both eyes, we have, what's called the blind spot, which is a consequence of the optic nerve Transiting through the retina. I mean, unlike, cephalopods, I think I mean, I think cephalopods, have their Optic nerve, you know, as, you know, a a a an omniscient being would have engineered it, connecting the retina from the back, And, therefore, there is no blinds area of of blindness associated with this transit back through the retinal.[0:40:10] Dr. Sam Harris: But our[0:40:10] Andrew Huberman: photoreceptors on the outside. Exactly. Yeah. Humans, Whatever reason, put photos well Yes. I always say I wasn't consulted the design phase.[0:40:18] Andrew Huberman: Something, put photoreceptors, combination of things, but photoreceptors in the back. And so you you actually have to send the highway of information Yeah. Through through the pixel center of the of the eye. Yeah. Cephalopods and, Drosophila.[0:40:32] Andrew Huberman: Basically, invertebrates.[0:40:36] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:40:37] Andrew Huberman: The design is more, at its face, logical. Mammals, very illogical design, at least as far as Alright. Judgments. Yeah.[0:40:45] Dr. Sam Harris: But it it gives it gives me a good analogy, so I'll I'll I'll take it.[0:40:48] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens every single day, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs. So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not, I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins, minerals, probiotics, Adaptogens to combat stress and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion.[0:41:26] Andrew Huberman: I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman. And for the month of January, they have a special offer where they'll give you Ten free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin d three k two. Vitamin d three and k two are vital for immune function, metabolic function, hormone health, but also calcium regulation and heart health. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer in the month of January of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:41:57] Dr. Sam Harris: So in any case, we have this blind spot which you can you know, I think Most people learn this in school, although my daughters had not been taught this in school. I just showed them this for the first time, like, a month ago, which and they were Briefly fascinated, and they wanna return to their screen time. But, anyway, you can take a piece of paper and you make, you know, 2 marks on it, And then you cover 1 eye and you fixate on on one mark. I mean, you can look this up online if you need, details about how to do this. And you while staring at 1 fixation point, you move the the paper back and forth, and you can get it to a place where the other mark disappears.[0:42:35] Dr. Sam Harris: And that And if and, you know, you can run this experiment long enough to satisfy yourself that there is in fact a blind spot in your visual field, which you with 1 eye closed, You don't normally notice. The reason why you have to cover cover 1 eye is because each eye compensates for the the blind spot of the other. So, but what which is to say that if you close one eye and and survey the visual scene, something really is missing, whatever you're looking at. If you're looking at a crowd of people, somebody is missing ahead, And you're not noticing it, and it's not it's not easy to notice because, you know, the the brain doesn't tend To vividly represent the absence of information. I mean, it's just like this is part of the game that's not being rendered.[0:43:17] Dr. Sam Harris: It's not it's not showing up as a A break in your in the visual field is just not there, and you're, I mean, the people have argued that there's a A kind of filling in phenomenon that happens, but I I think that can be, you know, misunderstood or or exaggerated.[0:43:33] Andrew Huberman: But the eye movements themselves that you described before, I guess I should say that the the, the saccade analogy of about transiently and repetitively erasing the self works perfectly here because, indeed, Microsaccades, little smaller saccades that occur all the time also prevent our eyes from fixating in one location for long enough to observe our blind spot even if one eye is closed.[0:43:54] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. Right. So if[0:43:55] Andrew Huberman: we, the the experiments done with paralytics to essentially lock eyes at one location, basically, things just start disappearing.[0:44:01] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. It just stays alive.[0:44:03] Andrew Huberman: That we start losing, but, actually, we start Blind.[0:44:05] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:44:06] Andrew Huberman: And those experiments have been done. And on humans, I I hear they're quite terrifying.[0:44:10] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, you can do that for yourself too. It just you know, it begins to just off Melt away.[0:44:16] Dr. Sam Harris: Melt away in in a in a warm glow. No psychedelics required. But the, the interesting point there is that When you ask yourself okay. So this because of the as a consequence of the eye's anatomy, there's this this thing you can see, That that is absent from your experience. But the question is, where is that in relationship To the rest of you, to your mind, or is that deep within, or is that in some sense right on the surface of experience?[0:44:47] Dr. Sam Harris: And there's there's expectation that people have. Again, I think conflating meditation with with a search for changes in the context of consciousness. They're looking for, you know, you know, much more subtle things to to to notice about the mind or much, you know, vaster things to notice. Psychedelics sets up this this expectation that, you know, you you do, you know, a massive dose of mushrooms or LSD, and Everything changes. I mean, you just get the this full, you know, beatific vision, and, you know, you get, Not only visual changes, but, you know, emotional changes, and and you get synesthesia where you're like you're just you have much more mind in in in so many ways.[0:45:33] Dr. Sam Harris: So they begin you you having these experiences or reading the mystical literature, you begin to think, okay. Well, then Freedom is is really elsewhere or is is really it's deep within. It's like it's not it's not coincident with The ordinary awareness that can that can see this coffee cup clearly and that can just transition attention to, you know, reading an email, you know, with with with the sort of full sobriety of just, you know, you know, ordinary waking consciousness. But the truth is this insight into selflessness, This insight into the nonduality of subject and object is as close to ordinary consciousness as This insight into the optic blind spot. Like, what where do you have to go to have this insight into the blind spot?[0:46:20] Dr. Sam Harris: No. You just have to you have to go anywhere. You just have to set up the the the experiment correctly such that, you know, you you can see the data, But the data's right on the surface. It's like it's it's it's almost too close to you to notice. I mean, if it's at all hard to notice, it it's because it's so close Rather than it's, you know, deep within or far away.[0:46:42] Dr. Sam Harris: And there are other analogies like, I don't know. Remember those mind's eye pieces of artwork that those the random dot stereograms where you have an image that pops out. I've always find it very difficult to see those because I have, you know, very dominant eye. You know?[0:46:56] Andrew Huberman: But Some people people can't see those. These are these images that used to be at the kind of, like, touristy shops and blah blah. People say, oh, there it is, the whale. I don't think I don't see it. You know, kids that swim a lot when they're younger and they're, tend to breathe just to one side.[0:47:11] Andrew Huberman: I don't know if this was you. This was definitely me. They tend to, We'll keep 1 eye closed. You set up a pretty strong ocular dominance. Biasing your vision to 1 or the other eye early in life, whether or not you're Learning how to be a bowhunter or you're learning how to throw darts or shoot billiards or anything that involves, selectively Viewing the world through 1 eye for even a couple of hours can set up a permanent asymmetry in the waiting of A visual flow[0:47:38] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:47:38] Andrew Huberman: Of infra flow of visual information from the eye to the brain. It's reversible, but only through the reverse gymnastics covering up the other eye intentionally. So I actually be I had to be reverse patched for a while because I was seeing double because I lost binocular vision. I don't stand a chance In hell of seeing an image pop out of a random Yeah. That stereo group,[0:47:57] Dr. Sam Harris: which is[0:47:58] Andrew Huberman: kind of ironic because I did my PhD on binocular circuitry.[0:48:00] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:48:01] Andrew Huberman: But, and, nonetheless, Yeah. If people can see these, or if they can't, what I think they provide a really Terrific example of what you're talking about as a larger theme, which is that, perceptually, you see a bunch of dots, and then all of a sudden[0:48:16] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:48:17] Andrew Huberman: What You thought wasn't there, suddenly there, but can just disappear again. Or there are certain visual illusions, if we were to include others, that once you see them, you cannot unsee them.[0:48:26] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:48:27] Andrew Huberman: So there's the faces, vases, you know, figure ground type stuff.[0:48:30] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Very, It's a bit bistable percepts. Yeah.[0:48:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Bistable percepts. And then there's sort of, Ocular competition, you show 2 different images to the eyes, each of the 2 eyes. Right. It is near impossible for people to perceive them both simultaneously.[0:48:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So it's a little bit of what you're describing. I mean, these seem to be fundamental features about the way the neural circuits are organized that they don't want to stably They don't wanna stay fixated on any one thing for very long. To do so either takes training, intense interest, intense fear, intense excitement. When I say intense, I guess, come back to this idea that the autonomic nervous system is somehow governing our ability to, spotlight at any one location for very long.[0:49:10] Andrew Huberman: Is that is that a useful framework, or is that gonna take us down a a different path?[0:49:13] Dr. Sam Harris: It's sort of a different path for this. I mean, for the only point I was making is that The seemingly paradoxical claim that something can be right on the surface, and yet hard to see. Right? So, like, there there there are things that are, Because it's and, again, this this this seems to justify the expectation held by, I would think, you know, the vast majority of people who Get interested in these, you know, spiritual things, for lack of a better word, that the truth must somehow be Deep within. Right?[0:49:46] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, the the like, there's really like a there's some distance between where you're between the one who is looking And the thing that has to be found. Right? And that you have to go through this this long evolution of changes. I mean, there are many metaphors that set this up. It's like you're at the base of a mountain, And you have to climb to the top.[0:50:04] Dr. Sam Harris: And so you have to find the path, however secure secure it does to get you there. But there really is a distance between where your between your starting point and the goal. And what I'm arguing, you know, and this is a kind of a nondual, you know, to Use a term of jargon. Is a nondual approach to meditation as opposed to a dualistic one There really is a a the the path and the goal are are are coincident. Right?[0:50:34] Dr. Sam Harris: That there's a there that you have to unravel the logic by which you would Seek something that's outside of, you you the, you know, the the present moment's experience. You know, I e not available really not available to you now. Because so many things worth having, so many so many skills worth acquiring really are not available Do you now? It's like it's like, you know, if you wanna be a a pianist or if you wanna speak Chinese or if you want like like, the you there's something you don't know, then you wanna learn that thing, and there's a whole process. Right?[0:51:06] Dr. Sam Harris: And you might not be capable of doing it. Right? You might and and real mastery is far away. Right. If you if you've never hit a golf ball and you wanna hit a golf ball 300 yards straight, right, you know, I can pretty much guarantee you're not gonna do that initially, and you're not gonna do it, You know, on day 2, and, you're not gonna do it reliably for the longest time, and there's real training, you know, in in front of you to to be able to do that reliably.[0:51:34] Dr. Sam Harris: An insight into and really the core insight. I mean, the the insight that is, you know, the core of, you know, the Buddha's teaching to take one One, historical example of this, really is available now, and It is not I mean, you know, granted, it can be very hard one for people. I mean, I I had probably spent a year on silent retreat in in, you a 1 week to 3 month increments before I sort of got the point I'm making now. Right? So, like, I you know, it's it's quite it's it's, I mean, literally and this is these are, you know, these are retreats where you spend, you know, 12 to 18 hours a day just meditating, trying to to, You know, unpack the kinds of claims I'm I'm, you know, making now.[0:52:23] Dr. Sam Harris: So there it's it's it's possible to Rigorously overlook this. It's possible to stand in front of the mind's eye image and stare in a way that is guaranteed not to give you pop out. Right. And to be to be adept at, you know, staring in that way. So it's possible to be misled.[0:52:41] Dr. Sam Harris: And so what I'm what I'm trying to argue here is that there's There's a fair amount of leverage you can get with with better information, which can kinda cut the time course if you are searching for this thing and and and kinda cancel your false expectations about just where this is in relation to your ordinary waking consciousness. And it's possible to Get that information and to have a bunch of experiences. You know? You go you go and do an Ayahuasca trip, and you have it's incredibly valuable, And it's valuable for all the ways in which it changed the contents of your consciousness in in, you know, startling ways. And you had insights into your past and into your relationships and into why you're Not as loving as you might be, and there's lots to think about.[0:53:21] Dr. Sam Harris: And you're like, yeah. That's all great. That's all something that, you know, you we can talk about, But there is it's it truly is orthogonal. I mean, if it makes a point of contact to what I'm talking about, it's really just at one point. You know?[0:53:34] Dr. Sam Harris: And it's at the point where The sense of of subject object division in consciousness is illusory and vulnerable to investigation. And if you investigate it As sort of the the right plane of focus, you know, you pick the analogy you want from, you know, whether it's, you know, setting up the the, The optic blind spot experiment in just the right way so that you can see that, you know, it's actually not the the data is not there. Or, I mean, the bistable percept is is great because, you know, when you see one of these images, like, the the vase phase diagram or, you know, the Dalmatian, you know, that this looks like just a mess of dots, and then you see the the image of a a Dalmatian dog pop out. Once you see it, You really can't unsee it. I mean, like, once you have the the requisite conceptual, you know, anchor to it, then every time you look, You're gonna find it again and and eventually becomes effortless.[0:54:33] Dr. Sam Harris: And that's what ultimately meditation is. I mean, this kind of meditation, you you ultimately learn To recognize that there's no separation from you between you and your experience. Right? There's not the experience on the one hand and the self on the other. There's just experience.[0:54:52] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? There's just seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, thinking, feeling, you know, proprioception, add add whatever channels of Information you want to that. But there's just the there's just the totality of the energy of consciousness and its contents. And there's no it's not that you're on the riverbank, and this is this is how it can seem in the beginning even when you're practicing meditation fairly diligently. It can seem like you're on the riverbank watching the contents of consciousness flow by.[0:55:23] Dr. Sam Harris: And and and meditation is the act of doing that more and more dispassionately. So you're no longer grabbing at the at the pleasant or pushing the unpleasant away. You're just kind of relaxing and in end in the most Nongjudgmental frame of mind, just witnessing the flow. Right? But if you're doing that dualistically, You feel like the meditator.[0:55:46] Dr. Sam Harris: You feel like the subject aiming attention, and so now you're on the riverbank watching everything go go past. But the truth is You are the river. Right? Experience itself is the there is just experience itself. You're not you're not on the edge of experience.[0:56:02] Dr. Sam Harris: And everything you can notice is part of the of the flow. Right? And there's and there's no point from which To abstract yourself away from the flow, to stand outside it, and to say, okay. This is this is my life. This is my experience.[0:56:17] Dr. Sam Harris: This is my body. Yes. You can do that. I mean, those are all just thoughts, but that's more of the flow. Right?[0:56:22] Dr. Sam Harris: And so there is a there's a process by which you would eventually recognize that There's no distance between you and your experience. And, again, you can you can wait for those moments in life where experience gets so good or so terrifying. You know, it's just so salient. Right? Your amygdala is driving so hard.[0:56:42] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, so you're in in a war, and you can't think about anything because, you know, the enemy is shooting at you, and this is the most thrilling video game you've ever played in your life, and your life is on the line, or you're you're, you know, at the peak of of some, You know, athletic event where there's just you don't know how you're doing the things you're doing, but it's all happening automatically. Right? But, you know, those are those are, you know, 1 1 hundredth of 1% of one's life. You know? And, You know, what I'm calling meditation is a way of simply understanding the mechanics of attention whereby you are denying yourself that unity of experience so much of the time and recognizing that that's, you know, it's it's based on a a misperception of of the way consciousness, always already is.[0:57:32] Andrew Huberman: Well, if there wasn't an incentive to learn how to meditate properly, That was 1. And I've been meditating a fair amount since I was in my teens, but more along the lines of just paying attention to breath and, You know, recognize thought sort of observer open observer type meditation or focused attention. I would suppose more of the focused attention type. We'll get into these a little bit later, but a number of questions related to what you just said.[0:58:00] Dr. Sam Harris: Sure.[0:58:02] Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that this thing that We would all do well to understand to observe consciousness itself as opposed to, try and alter the contents of consciousness, may sit much closer to us than, one might think that it, and that Because it sits so close to us, that that might be one of the reasons why we miss it. I I go right to a visual system example. I mean, if you don't, You're wearing, corrective lenses, and there's a speck on your lens. You know? Typically, you're looking out through the lens, and so you wouldn't observe that speck.[0:58:38] Andrew Huberman: Any number of different analogies could work here. The the fact that there are states, however few, positive and negative ecstasy Extreme ecstasy and extreme fear, being the the 2, I think, most obvious ones that seems like we agree on that allow us to capture the sense of, Completeness of self or the the unity of the the observer and the and the actor. The fact that those are are seldom for the non trained, for the non meditator, suggests to me 2 things. I think one, Perhaps worth exploring more than the other, but one is that, what's really being revealed in the states where we can feel the unity of the observer and the actor Is understanding something fundamental about the algorithm, not the online algorithm, but the algorithm that is our nervous system. Just as, you mentioned cephalopods.[0:59:32] Andrew Huberman: I mean, mantis shrimp see an enormous array of color hues that we don't. Right? Their map their maps and representations of the world are fundamentally pit vipers, see in the infrared.[0:59:42] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[0:59:43] Andrew Huberman: We're restricted to somewhat of a limited range within the color spectrum, but still more vast than that of dogs or cats. Okay. So understanding that for seeing what, a pit viper can see for moments would be informative, perhaps, sensing heat emissions, as a human might be invasive, and maybe that's why we don't do it. So the question is, To just make it straightforward is, why would the system be designed this way? Again, neither of us were consulted the design phase, But that brings me to perhaps the more tractable question was which is, about development.[1:00:21] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I'm a great believer that the neural circuits that, encouraged, healthy parent child relations or unhealthy parent child relations as the case may be in childhood stem from the initial demands of Internal versus external states, which is exactly what we're talking about, which is that a a young child feels anxious because it needs his diaper change. He doesn't really know it needs its diaper change or it's cold or it's uncomfortable or it's hungry or it's overly full. And so it vocalizes, and then some external source comes to us and relieves that, hopefully. Right? And so the fundamental rule that we first learn is not that we have a self or that, things fall down, not up, but is that, when uncomfortable, externalize that discomfort, and Yeah.[1:01:05] Andrew Huberman: It will be relieved by an outside player. And then, of course, there's a Repurposing of that circuitry for adult romantic attachments. I don't think anyone doubts that, and that can explain a lot indeed about attachment and so forth. So something about our developmental wiring and the algorithms that these neural circuits run Tend to bias most people, the nonpractice meditators, to live a somewhat functional life, at least, without this awareness of actor and observer.[1:01:38] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[1:01:38] Andrew Huberman: And so what you're really talking about is a deliberate intervention to understand and resolve that gap in the algorithm. Is that do I have that right?[1:01:49] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah.[1:01:49] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I'm more or less restating what you said in a way I'm I'm hoping will serve as a jumping off point as to, you know, why questions are always very dangerous in biology or any Yeah. You know? Yeah.[1:02:00] Dr. Sam Harris: And Or in relationship. Yeah. What's that? Or in relationship.[1:02:03] Andrew Huberman: Or in relationship. Right. Exactly. Although I think it all does really harken back to this early developmental wiring, which, of course, is modifiable. That's That's the beauty of of the the nervous system is it's the 1 organ that seems to be able to change itself, at least to some degree.[1:02:16] Andrew Huberman: Right. So what are your thoughts about the organization of the circuitry to to essentially, under normal conditions, to not reveal its What seems to be one of its more important and profound and, for, you know, dare I say, enlightening features. Right? It's almost as if we are potentially like mantis shrimp. We can see so many more colors than we actually see, and yet We don't.[1:02:43] Andrew Huberman: We we sort of opt most people opt not to, and I would argue that, one of the great strengths of the Waking Up app, for instance, that it it essentially walks you through the process of being able to arrive at the at these things without having to go to 1 year or 3 year, Long, silent meditation retreats.[1:03:03] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. So if[1:03:03] Andrew Huberman: you could just elaborate for a moment before we move on about you know, what are your thoughts about how the circuitry is arranged by default versus The the and and what that means, for there to be a an an intervention that we have to intervene in the self in order to reveal the self. Well, so[1:03:19] Dr. Sam Harris: the 2 big questions there. 1 about evolution, 1 about development. So, with respect to evolution, I mean, It's important to recognize that evolution doesn't see our deepest concerns about human Flourishing and human well-being. You know? It's all[1:03:36] Andrew Huberman: about the offs.[1:03:37] Dr. Sam Harris: It's just, you know, you you we are set up to spawn And to survive long enough to to help our progeny spawn if we can do that. And that and that that's it. Right? And so anything that was good for that, Including, you know, tribalism and xenophobia and, you know, you know, All kinds of hardware and software flaws that are that are reveal themselves to be flaws in the present time when we're trying to build a viable global civilization. But, you know, they they redounded to the advantage of our ancestors somehow, or they just there's there are things about us that we're simply not selected for.[1:04:17] Dr. Sam Harris: Just kinda came along for the ride. You know, the you know, what Stephen Jay Gould called a spandrel. You know? So, we are not set up by evolution to be as happy as we possibly can be, And certain and and to do almost anything that interests us well. I mean, we're not set up by evolution to be Mathematicians or musicians or to to create democracies that are healthy.[1:04:44] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, evolution can see none of this, and We're doing these things based on cognitive and emotional hardware, that we are leveraging in new directions. Right. I mean, we have we are primates, and we are, you know, we're communicating with, you know, small mouth noises. I mean, we're language using primates, and all of that has clearly evolved. And we're doing these amazing things, including science.[1:05:11] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? However, improbably, we're we're actually able to to, You know, almost entirely with language, understand reality that at a scale that exceeds us in both directions. I mean, the the very the very vast and the very small and and, you know, also temporally, the very old. We have, you know, visions of the far Future, we can figure out, you know, where an, you know, an asteroid is gonna, you know, cross Earth's orbit a 1000 years from now, if we just do the math. And it's amazing that we can do all of those things, but evolution is blind to all of that.[1:05:45] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And so we have In terms of what we care about and certainly in terms of what we what's gonna ensure our survival as a species, we have flown the perch that was created for us by evolution. I mean, we're just not it's not just the primate things. And so so it is with Learning how to regulate our emotions and and, you know, punch through to a self-concept or beyond a self-concept That is more normative psychologically that allows us to, you know, not be terrorized by our genes, as fully as we seem to be even in the presence of more and more destructive technology that I mean, like like, you know, we're We're still practically chimpanzees armed with nuclear weapons. Right?[1:06:31] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean and that is, you know, increasingly dysfunctional. And, very soon, we're gonna be in the presence of Minds or apparent minds that we have built, you know, that are as intelligent as we are or and very quickly, you know, Probably 15 minutes after that, far more intelligent than we are. And so what we do with all of that is, again, something that we have to figure out Based on the minds we have, the minds we can build, the minds we can change. You know? We can we can meddle with our own genomes now, and And that will produce its own consequences, you know, in our in ourselves and, in future generations if we meddle with the germline.[1:07:12] Dr. Sam Harris: And, again, all of that is just, you know, you know, evolution is just sort of the womb we came out of, but it's not it didn't anticipate any of that. Right? So So the you know, mother nature has has simply not had our best interests at heart. Right? And it's we might die off and and From the point of view of mother nature, that's that's fine because 99% of of every species dies off.[1:07:34] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? So there's that. But but when you're talking or when you're talking about the the individual developmentally so, you know, we all come into this world again as a As a, fairly hairless primate, that needs a tremendous amount of care by others, and, the logic of that is that, you know you know, the reason why we're not a a gazelle that gonna, you know, run, you know, 45 minutes later and then basically do all the gazelle things, perfectly, soon thereafter. The reason why we have, you know, we have this this time of of immaturity, and that becomes has become functional for us is that just we we're we're far more flexible, and we can learn based on the needs of of an environment to do, you know, so much more than a gazelle can. And language is part of that.[1:08:32] Dr. Sam Harris: And, you know, in the last 10000 years or so, Culture increasingly has been more and more a part of that, and there's a probably a layer at which we can plausibly talk about cultural evolution, you And and cultural evolution interacting with biological evolution to to change us. But when you're talking about the development of an individual, Each of us comes into this world, I think, not recognizing ourselves in any In any sense that would make sense to to reify. I mean, it's not that there's nothing there. I mean, it could be some kind of proto self Differentiation, but I think it's it takes a it takes a long while, and there is very likely a coincidence between Really recognize recognizing others we recognize others first, and we're certainly in relationship immediately, and we orient to human faces, and and we, you know, even detect, other humans as good and bad moral actors very early. I mean, certainly long before we recognize ourselves in in a mirror.[1:09:39] Dr. Sam Harris: We, the experiments run again, this is Paul Blum and and colleagues' experiments run on Kind of the moral hardware and software of of, developing toddlers. But I think at this point, they push it down all the way to, like, 6 months of of age where you'll get these infants staring at kind of a puppet show, and they'll they'll show a and a a, A greater interest in, you know, in a classically good actors versus bad actors, you know, cooperators versus, you know, defectors In various, you know, puppet show games. So there's it's not that we have no mind and no Proto awareness of others and and of self. But what eventually happens, certainly, as we become at all with with language use is that we become aware that that not only are we in relationship to others, But we are an object in the world for them. Right?[1:10:40] Dr. Sam Harris: So they're like we have enough people pointing at us in our cribs, Right? And impinging upon our experience. Right? You know, that you you're you're being physically moved and prodded and touched and Consoled or not consoled. And just imagine what all of these you're you're on the receiving end of 10,000 interventions.[1:11:00] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. And you're completely helpless for the longest time. And all of that attention, you have all of these people coming up, you know, to the crib and and making faces at you. You know? And yeah.[1:11:11] Dr. Sam Harris: And and it's all pointed at you. Right? So there's a, you know, there's a classic magical narcissism that that gets constructed there. If you if you take the psychological literature, you know, you know, at least a certain strand of it seriously. And I think it's it's largely apt to to think of a child at that age as a kind a kind of, there's a kind of narcissistic structure there where it's it's it's it's all kind of going inward.[1:11:45] Dr. Sam Harris: And at a certain point, you realize, okay. I'm I'm the center of all of this. Right? Like, it's not just it's not just a a a movie That you're that you're you're you know, what you're that you're completely absorbed in and you've lost your sense of self. I mean, this is to to Talk of the yet another example of, of what it's like as a grown up to lose our sense of self.[1:12:07] Dr. Sam Harris: And one of the things I think we find so fascinating By, you know, about television and and and film is that when we get totally absorbed in it, we're in this very unusual circumstance where we're You know, our brain is basically reading it as awareness in the classic social circumstance. We're presented with with, you know, the the The facial displays of other people. In fact, we you know, we can get there's some of the sometimes these people are 10 feet tall. Right? Or their faces are 10 feet tall.[1:12:33] Dr. Sam Harris: You you leave a close-up in a movie theater. So it's like this super stimulus in terms of of evolution, and they could make you they could be making direct eye contact with a camera. Right. So you have this gigantic face staring at you, and yet you're totally unimplicated socially. You can't be seen.[1:12:49] Dr. Sam Harris: And you and something about you you know you can't be seen, And so you're completely you completely lose self consciousness and yet you're you're able to examine with completely free attention, again, because you're totally unimplicated. The the the facial minutiae and the mimetic facial play of people, from at a very close range. I mean, you're seeing people I mean, you you have to be, you know, physically Just you know, about to kiss your your your spouse. Like, that's what a close-up is in a film. Right?[1:13:23] Dr. Sam Harris: Like that, you'll never get that close to people. Right? And yet here you're in a situation where you're unobserved and you know that. And so, I mean, this is a bit of a tangent, but the it's it's the other side of what's happening developmentally For a kid, when you're in a movie theater watching a movie, you are truly invisible, and yet you're right there Seeing, you know, the however harrowing the human drama is, you're seeing it play out and you're seeing it you're you're seeing it up close. And it is a It is in principle a social encounter that your genes are ready for, but they're not ready for you to be invisible.[1:13:59] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And so that's what's so, magical about it. But what happens developmentally for a kid is that you're not invisible. You are an object that is constantly being being, Overrun the boundaries of your, you know, you know, your your sensory engagement with the world are constantly being impinged upon by others. And at a certain point, you recognize, okay, I'm at the center of this.[1:14:22] Dr. Sam Harris: And the and the way this gets enshrined as a self, I think it's probably coincident with our learning the language game. We we learn to play with others. We're talking to others. People are talking to us. And at a certain point, we're talking to ourselves even when the other people leave the room.[1:14:44] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. So and you can hear if you ever have been with a toddler when they're when they're when they're externalizing their self talk, You know, you hear them talking to themselves. They're playing and they're and they're they're having a conversation. They they were talking to you, the parent, but then you left the room and and they're still talking. You come back then they're still they're still talking.[1:15:02] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And what happens to us strangely, And this comes back to the logic of evolution. We never stop because Evolution never thought to build us an off switch for this. Right? I mean, language is so useful, and it gets tuned up so strongly for us.[1:15:24] Dr. Sam Harris: And there was never a reason to shut it off. Right? There was never a reason to give you this ability to say, I I wouldn't it be nice to have 4 hours of quiet now and, like, no self talk? And so for most of us I mean, I think there are people who, for whatever neurological reason or, you know, idiosyncratic reason, undoubtedly, there's there'd be a neurological Reason for it, don't have any self talk. But for the for most of us, we are covertly talking Basically, all the time.[1:15:53] Dr. Sam Harris: And and there's an imagistic component of of this for many people. You're you're visualizing things as well, but There's just a lot a ton of white noise in the mind that feels a certain way. And, you know, what I what you discover in meditation ultimately is that the self is what it feels like to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking. Right? A thought arises uninspected and seems to just become you.[1:16:22] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. So, like, you and I are talking now and you said your you know, people are listening to us. They're they're struggling to follow the train of this conversation because it is competing with Getting with the the conversation is happening in their heads. Right? So I'll be saying something, and a person listening will say, Well, what does that mean?[1:16:40] Dr. Sam Harris: Or like, oh, boy. I mean, he just contradicted himself. Or like, you're and there's a voice in your head that is also vying for your attention much of the time. And, so it's you know, the the first discovery people make in meditation is that it's just so hard to Pay attention to anything, the breath or a mantra or a sound, whatever it is, because you're thinking Every you're thinking about the thing you need to do in an hour. And, oh, it's so good that I I downloaded this app.[1:17:08] Dr. Sam Harris: I'm like, this is really good. This is gonna be good for me. But and you're but you're that that chatter isn't showing up. You you're not far back enough, in the in the kind of the theater of consciousness So as to see it emerge, it's it is just sneaking up behind you, and it feels like me again. Or it feels like when someone is thinking the thought, What the hell does that mean?[1:17:31] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? They're not seeing it as an emerging object in consciousness. It just feels like me. It just feel that that that's it is it The the you know, subjectively, it's like the mind contracts around this appearance in consciousness. And it really is just it is just as you know, it's just a sound with the voice of the mind.[1:17:52] Dr. Sam Harris: If you actually can inspect it, it is It is deeply inscrutable that we ever feel identified with our thoughts. I mean, how is it that we could be a thought? These thoughts the a thought just arises and passes away. And when you inspect when you go to inspect it, it's it, you know, it unravels it's it's just it's It's it's the least substantial possible thing, and it and it could but yet it could be a thought of self hatred. You know, it could be a a thought that that unrecognized totally defines your your mood.[1:18:27] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? It's like I mean, just again, this this this all can seem kind of abstract. But[1:18:34] Andrew Huberman: Well no. But I I but I think it it's extremely concrete from the perspective of the neural circuits that we'll return to in a maybe in a few minutes. I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.[1:19:05] Andrew Huberman: The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based Interventions you might wanna take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/ and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. If you could elaborate a bit on This notion of internal chatter and external stimuli and the bridge between them because that's I think that, for some people, that might be intuitive.[1:19:57] Andrew Huberman: I think for others, It's not so obvious that language is ongoing in the backdrop. Yeah. Because sometimes I I think some people are more tuned into that language. For some people, it's it's louder volume. For some people, It's, more structured.[1:20:19] Andrew Huberman: I have a colleague at at Stanford who's been on this podcast called Dyseroth. He's, like, Like bioengineering. He's also a psychiatrist, and he hasn't met he doesn't call it a meditative practice. He has a practice where each evening after his 5 kids are Put down to sleep. You know?[1:20:34] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're older now, but, and in the quiet of the the late hours of the Night, early morning, he sits and forces himself to think in complete sentences with punctuation for an hour. This is the way that he has Taught himself to structure his thinking[1:20:50] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[1:20:50] Andrew Huberman: Because of the very fact that you're describing, which is that ordinarily, there is an underlying structure to what's internal, But it's disrupted by external events, and it's and these are typically, it's not, coherent enough to really make Meaning from. So it's almost like somebody sitting down to write in complete sentences, but force himself to do it in his head. But for many people, including myself, that's a that's a foreign experience, And we only experience structure through our interactions with the world and other people. That if I were I've taken the time to Try and explore ideas with eyes closed and, you know, and I've been able to do that. Mhmm.[1:21:26] Andrew Huberman: There are certain pharmacologic states that we could talk about that facilitate that, and, no, those are not amphetamines. Those do exactly the opposite, by the way. But, I think People exist in varying degrees of structured and ex and unstructured internal dialogue and, in in varying depths of recognition of that internal dialogue. And so the question I suppose is is just the recognition that there's an a dialogue Ongoing internally, is that itself valuable?[1:21:58] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. And that that also can take some time. So so, I mean, so here here's a claim I would make that Some people might find surprising, but I I think, this is an objectively true claim about the subjectivity of most people, Which is that unless you, you know, have a fair amount of train unless you just happen to be some kind of savant in this area, which, you know, most people by definition aren't, or you have a remarkable amount of training in what's called, you know, concentration practice in in meditation. I I believe this is a a true claim that, you know, if we just you put a, a stopwatch on this table and and, you know, people could just watch it, you know, 30 seconds elapse. And, I set, you know, I set all of our listeners or your viewers the task.[1:22:48] Dr. Sam Harris: For the next 30 seconds, Just pay attention to anything. Your breath, you know, or, you know, the, you know, the sight of your hand or the sight of the clock or, any object Without getting lost in thought, without getting momentarily distracted by this conversation you're having with yourself, This couple things would happen. One is no one would be able to do it. Right. And and and not just this is not just a a superficial inability.[1:23:20] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, if your life's dependent on it, you wouldn't be able to do it. I mean, if if the fate of civilization depended on it, none of none of our listeners would be able to do this. And yet some percentage of them are are so distracted by thought that they would think that they will actually try this experiment and think they succeeded. Right. And for these people, what what happens is you put them on a meditation retreat, and you have them spend 12 hours a day in silence doing nothing but this.[1:23:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So the practice is just Pay attention to the breath when they're sitting, and then eventually, you know, you incorporate everything, sounds and other sensations. And then you interleave that with walking meditation where they're paying attention just to the sensations of Lifting and moving and placing their feet. And then, you know, once the practice is going, you you incorporate sounds and sights and everything. But so you can pay attention to everything, but the goal is For every moment, you are going to you're going to cultivate the what this this faculty of mind, which, you know, increasingly is known as mindfulness.[1:24:19] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So and mindfulness is nothing other than this very careful attention to the contents of consciousness. But the crucial piece is it is not a moment of being lost in thought. Right. You're not you you you're not blocking thoughts.[1:24:35] Dr. Sam Harris: Thoughts themselves can arise, but in those moments of being truly mindful, you're noticing thoughts as thoughts. Whether there whether it's language in the mind or images, you're noticing those 2 as spontaneous appearances in consciousness. So, if if most people you know, certainly anyone who thinks they can pay attention to, you know, They can do the experiments successfully that I just, suggested. Pay attention to something for 30 seconds without being lost in thought. You put those people on a meditation retreat, what they're going to experience is, you know, on the 1st day, they're gonna feel like, oh, yeah.[1:25:12] Dr. Sam Harris: I was, you know, I was with the breath or I was walk, You know, I was with the sensations of walking, and I'd be there for, like, 5 minutes, you know, solid, and then I would get lost in thought, then I come back. And then, you know, 5 more minutes, I'd be lost in thought, then get back. But as the days progressed, you know, even, you know, 10 days into a silent meditation retreat, they're going to experience More and more distraction. They're gonna it's gonna seem like, okay. Wait a minute.[1:25:37] Dr. Sam Harris: Now I can't pay attention to anything for more than 5 seconds. Right. That is progress. Right? Because because what they're discovering is just how distractible they are.[1:25:47] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And, know? So some for some people, that will be immediately obvious. For some people, it'll it'll actually take a a lot of practice to realize just how distracted they are.[1:25:58] Andrew Huberman: What you just said, which was that at some point, we can start noticing our Thoughts.[1:26:06] Dr. Sam Harris: Mhmm.[1:26:06] Andrew Huberman: I can notice my thoughts, but what you're talking about is, as a goal state, is not, is not being distracted by thoughts, but actually seeing the relationship between thoughts, self, and other types of perceptions. And here, I think recognizing and seeing thoughts is a form of perception. It's just an internally directed perception. This raises a a topic that, I'm Also obsessed by, which I think neuroscience can somewhat explain, but still incomplete, incompletely that the Circuits and mechanics, etcetera, are not, yet known, which is about time perception. And, You know, a simple analogy would be that, there are a lot of small objects flying around in the space that we happen to be having this discussion, but they're moving so fast that I can't perceive them.[1:26:58] Andrew Huberman: Or they're entirely stationary, so I can't perceive them because of the reasons we talked about before in the visual system. My eyes are moving in perfect concert with these with these small object movements, and therefore, they're they're I am blind to them. Right. A slight shift in time perception. Think of this, perhaps as a change in the frame rate.[1:27:21] Andrew Huberman: Like, camera frame rates at faster frame rate, you can capture slow motion, slower frame rate. You're gonna get more of a strobe type effect if the frame rate is low enough.[1:27:29] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[1:27:30] Andrew Huberman: Right? Could it be that our time perception is not one thing, but we have one rate of Perceiving time for external objects at a given distance, which we know is true. Another frame rate for objects that are up close, we know this to be true even if those objects are moving at the exact speed. Right? I mean, this would be the sitting on a train that runs on the fence seem to be going by very, very fast, but the ones in the distance seem to be moving slowly.[1:27:56] Dr. Sam Harris: This is[1:27:56] Andrew Huberman: the way the way the the visual system and time perception Interconnect at some level.[1:28:00] Dr. Sam Harris: Mhmm.[1:28:01] Andrew Huberman: You're up on a skyscraper, the little ants of cars and people, down below. You know they're moving much faster than you perceive them to move. Yeah. But it's it's a distance effect.[1:28:10] Dr. Sam Harris: When you see you see a plane, it's gonna be going 300 miles an hour or[1:28:13] Andrew Huberman: something like that. Yeah. And it's not because of the lack of resolution. The lack of resolution is incidental. We know this because in animals such as, hawks that have twice the degree of acuity, as far as we know, they have the same Distance associated shifts in time perception.[1:28:30] Andrew Huberman: So could it be that we are running multiple streams of time perception, multiple cones of attention that include cones of attention to our thoughts. And that somehow through meditation, we start to align the frame rate for these different streams of attention So that they all fall into the say they all fall into the same movie, if you will, although it's not just a movie with visual content. What I'm doing here is, clearly, I'm becoming a lumper rather than a splitter. I I'm sure this violates certain rules of time perception neural circuitry, But I'm not sure that it's entirely untrue either. And does it survive, at all as a possible model for what you're describing?[1:29:09] Andrew Huberman: And if the answer is no, I'm perfectly comfortable with that.[1:29:12] Dr. Sam Harris: Well, it's It's dependent on what you mean by meditation. This this is where you sort of the particularities of of what one is doing with one's attention under the, you know, the The frame of meditation really matter because there there are ways to practice where practice mindfulness in particular where The frame rate really does seem to go way, way up. Right? And there's actually been some research done on this where you take people, you know, before and after a 3 month Silent meditation retreat, and you give them some kind of visual discrimination task where they have to, like, detect I think they used it to to to to to to to kiss to scope. Is that the tool for there's some some for example, it presents, you know, like, very quick pulses of light.[1:30:00] Dr. Sam Harris: And in any case, you can you can discriminate Just in any in any sensory channel, I would imagine, you can make finer grain discriminations if you're practicing mindfulness in a very specific way, which is To be making these fine grained discriminations more and more and do do nothing else for, you know, 3 months, which is which is a way of practicing. So you're so the classic, You know, mindfulness practice in in what's called Vipassana meditation is to pay Scrupulous attention to seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching in a way that breaks Everything down into the this kind of microscopic sensory, moments. So, you know, you're Rather than feel your, you know, your hands pressing together, what you're trying to feel with your attention and you're feeling more and more is All of the micro sensations of pressure and temperature and movement, such that The feeling of hands completely disappears. You realize that a hand is a concept, and all you have is this cloud of of punctate And and, very brief sensations. And so so anything you think you've you you have as a datum of experience As you as you bore into it with your attention, it it resolves into a a This kind of die diaphanous cloud of changing sensation, and and that can be even even something that's as Captivating as like a, you know, a serious pain in your body.[1:31:37] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, you could have like a you know, you could have injured your neck, you know, and so you have some excruciating pain in your neck. If you just are willing to pay attention to it, you know, and just pay a 100% attention to it, your a couple things happen. One is Your resistance to feeling it goes away by definition because your now your goal is to just pay attention to it, and and you recognize that So much of the suffering associated with the pain was born of a of the resistance to feeling it. You're kinda you're bracing against it and all of your thinking about it. You know?[1:32:07] Dr. Sam Harris: You're thinking like, well, you know, why did I do this to myself, or when should I see an orthopedist, or why how long is this gonna last? And and you're, you know, maybe I herniated a disc. Like, all of that self talk is producing anxiety and, you know, I'm not saying there's never anything to think about there, but, you know, Either you can do something about it in the moment or you can't. And, so much of our suffering in in the presence of pain is the result of Resisting it, worrying about it, think it's just all of the everything we're doing with our minds, but just just feeling it. Right?[1:32:40] Dr. Sam Harris: So when you just feel it, again, it'll it it breaks apart into this This ever chain ever shifting collection of of different sensations. And it's not one thing, and it never stays the same, and it's and So 2 things happen there. 1 is there can be a tremendous tremendous amount of relief that happens there where you you you you can achieve a level of equanimity Even in the presence of really unpleasant, you know, physical sensation, and this is true of mental sensation as well. This was true of emotions. You know?[1:33:14] Dr. Sam Harris: Classically negative emotions like anger, depression, or, you know, fear. The moment you become willing to just feel them In all of their, you know, punctate, and changeable qualities, They cease to be what they they were a moment ago. They're just they're and they you know, when you're talking about emotional states, They cease to map back on to you and your self-concept as meaningful in the same way so that suddenly, you know, the anxiety you feel, Let's say before going out on stage to give a talk, you know, a moment ago, if it it was it had psychological meaning. It felt like, oh, you know, okay. I'm anxious.[1:33:53] Dr. Sam Harris: How do I get rid of this? You know? Why am I this sort of person? What you know, should I have taken a beta blocker? You know?[1:33:58] Dr. Sam Harris: This is the the conversation you're you're having with yourself. Moment you just become willing to feel it as the pure energy of, you know, the physiology of of, you know, of cortisol release, It ceases to have any meaning. It just it it it it ceases to be a problem in that moment because it is no more It no more maps onto the kind of person you are than a feeling of indigestion or a pain in your in your knee maps onto the kind of person you are. It's just It it's it's just sensation. Anyway, but back to the main point here, which is that if you train your attention in this way To notice the particularities of of sensory experience and emotional experience, like, you're looking for the atoms of experience.[1:34:41] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? You get better and better at that, and certain things happen. But one thing that, you know, one thing that I I really do do think happens is There's a kind of frame rate change in in the the data stream where you really are just you're just noticing much, much more. All of that is a very interesting way of training. It's not what I tend to recommend now.[1:35:07] Dr. Sam Harris: It's it's a great preliminary practice for what I do recommend because it gives you It it really teaches you the difference between being lost in thought and not. It really teaches you what mindfulness is, but it tends to be done, You know, by, you know, 99.9% of of people in a dualistic way, which you're again, you're you're you're set up to think, Okay. I'm over here as the locus of attention, you know, and and I'm continually getting distracted by thought. And the project is to Not do that anymore and actually pay attention to the breath and sounds and sensations. And and every time I get lost in thought, I'm gonna go back to here.[1:35:47] Dr. Sam Harris: But This whole dance of I'm lost in thought. Now I'm now I'm strategically directing my attention again. All of this seems to ramify this sense of self, the sense of of, there there's one to be doing this. There's there's somebody holding the spotlight of attention And getting better at coming back to the object of meditation. Again, it's inevitable that 99.9% of people are gonna start there and stay there for some considerable period of time.[1:36:17] Dr. Sam Harris: But the thing I like to do when I talk about All of this is undercut the false assumptions that are anchoring all of that as early as possible because where where where I think you wanna be is recognizing that there is no place from which to aim attention. Right? There this whole dualistic setup of subject and object is the thing that is Already not there. And it's not that you it's not that it's there and you meditate it out of existence successfully. It's really not there.[1:36:47] Dr. Sam Harris: And if you if you learn how to look for it, You can see that it's not there and feel that it's not there, and it no longer seems to be there. Right? It's like it's it's not and it becomes like, again, like a bistable percept where You looked at it long enough and you thought, okay. Now I see the vase and the vase, and, I can't unsee it. And every time I look, it's it's there again.[1:37:09] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And, so, yeah, I mean, it's so to come back to the The example you gave with your, your colleague at Stanford, whose book I know I have, I haven't read it. Is it this is the he wrote a book projections. Ken's right, Deseroth yet? Yeah.[1:37:28] Dr. Sam Harris: So it's it's on my stack to read. But It's the opposite. The what I'm recommending, essentially, the opposite end of the continuum of the sort of internal exercise he was he he was doing. So rather than so, you know, he's doing something very deliberate and controlled, and he is, you know, he is Deliberately thinking in complete sentences and kind of commandeering the, you know, the the, the machinery of thought and attention, in a way that I would imagine I mean, I'd be interested to talk to him about it, but I would imagine it he really feels like he's doing that. Right?[1:38:06] Dr. Sam Harris: And there's there's problem.[1:38:07] Andrew Huberman: Engineer. It's a you know, it's a as you describe it in this way, it it reminds me he he's he's a physician, but also an engineer, so it's really about taking the the raw materials of thought and engineering something structured from it.[1:38:20] Dr. Sam Harris: I think, right. You[1:38:21] Andrew Huberman: know, I haven't been in, Carl's mind.[1:38:24] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. But if we got him talking on that, we would get I'm sure we would get a sense[1:38:27] Andrew Huberman: of what it is. We'll do that conversation at some point.[1:38:30] Dr. Sam Harris: But, yeah, but but so[1:38:31] Andrew Huberman: it's the exact opposite of what you're saying.[1:38:33] Dr. Sam Harris: Would be to recognize that The sense of control is a total illusion. Right? There it could because you don't know what you're going to think next. Right. And even he in the most laborious way I mean, he could he could just get as muscular as he wants with it.[1:38:52] Dr. Sam Harris: He still doesn't know what he's going to think next. Right? Thought because thoughts simply arise. Right? Like, you know, I mean, you know, you can run this experiment for yourself, And this connects up to the topic of of free will, which, we might wanna touch.[1:39:06] Dr. Sam Harris: But, I mean, just think of any category of thing. You know? If I asked you to think of, You know, the names of cities or of, you know, friends you have or of famous people you you can, you know, remember exist or, think of nouns or, you know you know, anything, and just watch what comes percolating into consciousness. Right now, There's there are things you can't think of or there are things you don't know the name of. You know?[1:39:35] Dr. Sam Harris: There are languages you don't speak. There's there are famous people you've never seen or never heard of. Right. So, like, the like so you have no control over that part. Like, those those names and and faces are not going to suddenly come streaming into consciousness.[1:39:48] Dr. Sam Harris: But of of the there's there's totality of facts and figures and faces and names that you do know, right, Only some will combine for inclusion. Right? And they're not and there's there's a sort of you know, I'm sure we could may guess that we know something about the neurology of this, but we you know, depending on what channel you're you're, You're waiting for thoughts in. I mean, it's gonna be different if it's visual or semantic or or, episodic memory. I mean, all of these things are different, but, Wherever you kinda point your inner gaze of attention and wait for the next face or name, Certain things are gonna come and certain certain things aren't going to come.[1:40:32] Dr. Sam Harris: And how you land on 1, right, there'll be this process if If you're paying attention to you you might think let's say let's say we go with names of cities. Right? You just you say you'll you'll think of Paris. You'll think of London. You'll think of Rome.[1:40:45] Dr. Sam Harris: You'll think of Sedona, you'll think like, so that these these names will come. And if I ask you to just say 1, right, so just[1:40:54] Andrew Huberman: Minneapolis is what came to mind.[1:40:55] Dr. Sam Harris: For me,[1:40:55] Andrew Huberman: it was very straightforward. It was Minneapolis. The famous person was Joe Strummer, and they just like, I can give you reasons why I think they those came to mind, recent conversations.[1:41:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Okay. So so so whatever so we know we know a fair bit a fair bit about much of this. So, One, we know that your reasons, you know, obviously, could be right or wrong. They're very likely to be wrong because we have this sort of confabulatory Storytelling mechanism even in an intact brain where we just, you know, we we we all seem to never lack for the reasons why something came to mind, and we know we can know we can manipulate people in ways that prove that people are just reliably wrong and confident, you know, confidently so about the reasons why they thought of things or did things. But leaving that aside, even if you're completely accurate, right, there are there are people's names who you know and cities' names that you know That, inexplicably, just didn't come to mind.[1:41:48] Dr. Sam Harris: And if we ran this experiment again and again again, they they wouldn't come to mind if your brain was in precisely the state it was in a moment ago. If we if we if we could return your brain to the state it was in a moment ago, correcting for, you know, all the deterministic changes and all the random changes that would have to, You know, be corrected for it. Just get all the synapses and the synaptic weights and, you know, everything in in the the state it was in to produce Joe Strummer in Minneapolis. Right? You're going to if we rewind that movie, that, you know, that part of the movie of your life, you're going to say Joe Strummer and Minneapolis a trillion times in a row.[1:42:21] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So this is why, In my view, the notion of free will makes absolutely no sense. Right? And you can add as much randomness to that process as you want. It still doesn't get you the freedom people think they have.[1:42:33] Dr. Sam Harris: There's another conversation to have about, you know, why none of that matters and why things only get better once you admit to yourself that free will is an illusion. And, yes, you can get in shape, and you can diet. You can do all the things you wanna do, and you don't have to think about free will. But The from a from a contemplative meditative point of view, the thing to notice is that Everything is just springing into view. Right?[1:42:57] Dr. Sam Harris: You're like, there's no place from which you are authoring your next thought because you would have to think it before you think it. Right? Like like like, there is just there is just this fundamental mystery at our backs that is disgorging everything that we experience. And[1:43:14] Andrew Huberman: What if I'm speaking? So if I'm talking about something and I have some command of that, information, I can Often sense what I'm gonna say next and then find myself saying it. Hopefully, that's where I stand on something else. I certainly said things I didn't Intent to say or never thought I would say in life, but, when engaged in speech or action, it At least gives us the illusion, I think, that we somehow have more command over our thoughts.[1:43:41] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Well, you have a script. I mean, it's like either there are things you know a lot about, And you've talked you've you've talked about them a lot, and you you know you have the things you want to say about those things and the things you you you don't wanna say or you you wouldn't wanna say. And, you know, you can you know, it still is a bit of a high wire act because you can misspeak or you can fail to get to the end of a sentence in a grammatically correct way. And and it's again, all of this, objectively, this whole process is mysterious to you.[1:44:08] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Like, you you don't know How you follow the rules of English grammar. Right? Like, the like, you know, you[1:44:14] Andrew Huberman: just you just[1:44:14] Dr. Sam Harris: your tongue is doing it somehow, and, you know, And when it fails, it fails, and you're just as surprised as the next guy that it failed. And, you know, you mispronounce a word and Okay. I don't know what happened there, but it's if it keeps happening, I'm gonna worry I had a stroke. And, you know, if it stops, I'm I'm I'm gonna be you know, I'm not gonna worry about it. So it's still mysterious even when you're doing it in a very, rote, deliberative and repetitive way.[1:44:46] Dr. Sam Harris: But when when you're talking about something you've talked about a lot And you know you sort of know where you're gonna go. Right? Like and and this is, you know, we we have many conversations like this. It is somewhat analogous to, like, a golf swing where it's like you know how you wanna do it. There's gonna be all kinds of errors that are gonna creep into your of it in in real time, but there's like you you basically have a pattern.[1:45:11] Dr. Sam Harris: And so you you you have certain linguistic patterns which you're following. Again, none of this is a proof of of free will, but I will grant you that, you know, phenomenologically, it it it feels different than just waiting for the next thought to come. But my point is is that even if you're, I mean, you can trim it down to the simplest possible thing. Like, you take 2 things you like to to drink. Right.[1:45:40] Dr. Sam Harris: You may you like you like coffee and you like tea, and you're deciding which to have. Right? Both are on offer. You've got 2 cups in front of you, and And the question is, you know, which you know, or here, I've got water and I've got coffee. Which am I gonna drink next?[1:45:53] Dr. Sam Harris: It's a it's incredibly it's the simplest possible decision. And no matter how long I make this decision process, I could literally sit for an hour trying to figure out which to reach for next. And I could have my reasons why, and I could have my all my self talk. There's there's there's going to be a final Change in me that's gonna be the proximate cause of me deciding 1 over the other. And that no matter how laborious I can make it seem In in terms of my reasoning about it, it is gonna be fundamentally mysterious as to why I went with 1 rather than the other.[1:46:34] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Whatever story I have like, because it's like it's it's it's still gonna be as mysterious as You thinking of Joe Strummer when you absolute like, you know of the existence of Marilyn Monroe Just as much, and yet she simply didn't occur to you. Right? It's like it's it's fundamentally mysterious. Like, there are people who are even more famous Then Joe Strummer to you.[1:46:59] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Who who I mean, I I'm sure you you know, you he may be somebody who you have thought a lot about, but but There are there are people who like, if we could just inventory, you know, your conscious life going back the last 10 years, there are people who you've thought about more than Joe Strummer, Yet they didn't appear. Right? So and and that's that is mysterious. Right?[1:47:18] Dr. Sam Harris: And they could've, but they didn't. And so And what what what I'm saying is that this mystery never gets banished in our experience, whatever stories we have to tell about it. Like because if if the story is, oh, well, I went for the water because, I, you know, I I I I think I've been drinking too much coffee. You know? I I I I listened to Andrew Huberman's podcast, and he was saying talking about caffeine, and I think I probably It's[1:47:44] Andrew Huberman: good for us, but you don't wanna overdo it.[1:47:45] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So let's say that is actually the causal chain.[1:47:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, listened to your podcast. You said something about caffeine. Now I'm now I'm self conscious about my coffee intake. Right? But That's just just adding a couple of links to the chain.[1:47:58] Dr. Sam Harris: There's there's still this fundamental mystery of, well, why did I find that persuasive? And why why did I find it persuasive now and not 5 minutes ago when I was drinking the coffee? Right? Like, why did I just remember it now, or why was it effective now? Like, what, Like, you you only have your experience in every moment is precisely what it is and not one bit more.[1:48:23] Dr. Sam Harris: Like and and and and this subsumes even moments of real resolve and effort And, you know, picking yourself up by your bootstraps and changing everything. It's like you're on a diet and you're tempted to eat chocolate, And you think you're about to reach and say, no. I'm not I'm not breaking this diet. This diet is actually gonna stick. Right?[1:48:42] Dr. Sam Harris: K. Why did that arise In that moment and not at this analogous moment on your last diet. Right? And why did it arise now to precisely the the degree that it did? Why why will it be as effective as it will be and have the half life that it will have and not, You know, 10% more or less.[1:49:03] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, all of those are always mysterious to you.[1:49:06] Andrew Huberman: Well, could we give a, as we did before, an evolutionary and a developmental explanation. An evolutionary explanation might be that, directed attention and action is Metabolically demanding, it would be inefficient or impossible for us to be in constant, you know, deliberate action and with Access to all the relevant information as to why we would do anything. So our ideas literally spring to the surface, at the last possible moment, in order to offset, the the metabolic the great metabolic requirements of having ideas that are are related to goal directed action or that goal directed action is expensive. That's one idea. The other idea would be and we know this as a fact, which is that, Initially, the brain is fairly crudely wired.[1:49:52] Andrew Huberman: That's not true within the neural circuits that control breathing, heart rate, etcetera. But within the neural circuits of, sensory perception, thought, etcetera, they're fairly crudely wired. And then across development, there's a progressive pruning back and, also in parallel to that, a strengthening of the connections that underlie directed action and thought. And here, I don't mean directed as in free will. I mean, just that they can I can decide to imagine an apple and imagine that apple, for instance?[1:50:19] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:50:21] Dr. Sam Harris: But your decision here[1:50:22] Andrew Huberman: to be some maintenance of the The random fine random wiring in systems. I mean, we've seen this even in in worms, in flies, in in, you know, in so called lower, invertebrates and Lower vertebrates, and we see this in humans. And it seems to be, that there's a lot of background spontaneous activity. I mean, I've sunk electrodes into the brains of, humans and macaques, Carnivores and mice. And in every case, most of what you hear is called hash, and it has nothing to do with hashish.[1:50:50] Andrew Huberman: It's just on the audio monitor, which is, hey. You're picking up a bunch of action potentials. Right. As you're listening to a a course of action potentials, but it's rare to find a neuron that faithfully fires to represent Some sensory stimulus in the world, and you can arrange that marriage experimentally so that you can arrive at those strong signal to noise events. But I was always struck by how much noise there is in the system Mhmm.[1:51:15] Andrew Huberman: All around all the time. And people argue, is the noise really noise, etcetera? And is it you know? There's still a lot of debate about that, but I can imagine that some of this, the spontaneous nature of thoughts just relates to the fact that there's a lot of background spontaneous activity in the brain. Now why that is is a whole other discussion, but, but if I were to sort of set up 2 constraints that there's a lot of spontaneous activity, it's gonna generate random thoughts.[1:51:39] Andrew Huberman: Thankfully, not much random action, although there's a little bit of random action in our daily lives. And then against that, say, well, any deliberate thought or motion is going to be expensive. Right? It's a metabolically expensive organ to begin with. And so you just have to evolution has arrived at a place where, Spontaneous geysering up of things, upon which, like, deliberate thoughts and action are superimposed is the best Arrangement overall for this very metabolically demanding organ.[1:52:10] Andrew Huberman: Is that is that a I mean, what I basically gave was just kind of a biological description of of of 1 just 1 narrow aspect of it. But can we get comfortable with that? And the reason I say get comfortable is that, you know, I'm And here, I admittedly, I'm forcing a little bit of a striptease towards what I think I and everyone else wants to know, which is how to meditate and why, in particular, meditation Convinces us that something doesn't necessarily have to be eliminated, but that was actually never there. I feel like we're we're now set up of a sort of, like, almost like a You're not contradicting yourself by any means, but in my mind, there's a contradiction, and here's the contradiction. I love this statement that meditation over time or done properly reveals to us that we're actually not trying to make The gap between actor and observer go away, it was actually never there.[1:52:58] Andrew Huberman: To me, that's one of the more important statements that I perhaps I've ever heard. And it inspires me to go further down this path of meditation because I've never experienced that.[1:53:06] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[1:53:07] Andrew Huberman: Not deliberately and certainly not through meditation. If I ever experienced it, it was transient enough that I you know, I'm intrigued to to experience it more. So on the one hand, you're telling me something was never there, and there's a a profound experience to be had by anyone that's willing to do the work to arrive at that experience of the loss of that illusion. On the other hand, I'm hearing that there's a, a profound gap that really does exist, which is that, Yeah. We we believe that our thoughts are, somehow from us, and, indeed, they're from in In the cranial vault someplace, maybe in the body a bit as well, but that we over, attribute the degree to which we are that and that is us in a way that's Volitional that we control.[1:53:59] Dr. Sam Harris: And[1:53:59] Andrew Huberman: so, once I'm hearing that there's something there's an illusion that we can eliminate, and on the other hand, I'm hearing that there's an illusion that we can't eliminate. And maybe these are unrelated, and I'm bridging them in a in a in a in an unimportant way. That seems only important to me, but somehow, I I can't resolve these 2. And maybe the thing to do then is is can we separate them in terms of a practice to witness them that would allow us to resolve them separately?[1:54:27] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. So, yeah, I think I I'm hearing the problem. There's this, well, let let me, like, kinda bracket the whole free will discussion because it's It's it it really is the flip side of this coin that that I'm you know, the the the obverse of which is the illusion the illusion of the self.[1:54:44] Andrew Huberman: So Okay. So at least I So it might be on the right track, but they they are the opposite sides of of of a coin.[1:54:49] Dr. Sam Harris: Okay. Great. Because To me,[1:54:51] Andrew Huberman: they seem very different in in in essence.[1:54:53] Dr. Sam Harris: No. Because because what I'm calling the sense of self And what people what I think most people feel as their core sense of self is the this feeling of I mean, it's it's the feeling of being the locus of attention, but it's also the feeling of being the locus of agency. Like, I can do the next thing. I I like, Who's doing this? Who's reaching for the cup?[1:55:15] Dr. Sam Harris: I am. Right? I I intended this, and now I'm doing the thing. My and my intent my conscious intention is the proximate cause of my reaching. Right?[1:55:25] Dr. Sam Harris: So I'm the auth and so I'm the author of my thoughts and actions, essentially. And I'm and my and my Specific uses of attention. Right? So I can I can pay attention to the breath? I get lost in thought.[1:55:35] Dr. Sam Harris: I come back to the breath. But, you know, the law the the in on some level, the thoughts themselves are more of my doing something, with with almost a, you know, authorial intent. Right? Like, I'm think like, oh, you know, like, what the hell is this guy talking about? I'm I know I'm you know, I know, I, you know, who's thinking these thoughts?[1:55:57] Dr. Sam Harris: I am. Right? Like, that's that's the person who really doesn't get what I'm saying is thinking something like that. Right? It's like, the fuck is this guy talking about?[1:56:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, I, like, I know I'm here. I'm a self. I'm, you know, I'm I'm I'm a body. I'm a mind. I can reach for things That these are these intentional actions are different from things that happened to me.[1:56:15] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? A voluntary action is different from an involuntary one. You know? So having a tremor is different from consciously deciding to pick up a glass. Right?[1:56:25] Dr. Sam Harris: So, obviously, everything I'm saying about Meditation and the self and free will in order to be a sane picture of a human mind and of reality has to conserve the data of experience such that, Yes. I can acknowledge the difference between a tremor and a a deliberative, you know, voluntary motor action. And, you know, and the things you do volitionally are different, not just psychologically and behaviorally, but they just have different implications for, like, a different in a court of law. You know? You accidentally hit someone with your car or you did it on purpose.[1:57:01] Dr. Sam Harris: That's still a a distinction that matters. Right? It importantly, it tells us a lot about the global properties of your mind such that, you know, we have a sense of what you're likely to do in the future. If you're someone who likes running over people with your car, You know, you're a a psychopath who we need to worry about or someone who did it by accident. Well, then, you know, you may be, culpable for for the the level of negligence that, allow that to happen, but you're you're a very different person, and we we we treat you differently and we we're wise to.[1:57:29] Dr. Sam Harris: So, anyway, we can those are let's bracket all of that. There's this I mean, there's some fundamental there there's there's some false assumptions about the underlying logic of this process, which I think It's worth addressing, and it is actually there's a kind of found object in the news that I I I talk about At one point, I forget where it is in in in the waking up app, but there's a story that I stumbled on on the Internet. I think it's about 12 or 13 years old of a, a tourist bus in, I think it was Norway. It was somewhere in in, Northern Europe, And it had about 30 people on it, and 1 person was a was a described as an Asian woman. And they All they they went they went to a rest stop, and everyone got off the bus.[1:58:20] Dr. Sam Harris: And they, you know, shopped and had lunch. And and the this Asian woman changed her clothing, for whatever reason, and they all got back on the bus. I think the relevance of it being an Asian woman is that, you know, there were language barriers that that that explain what later happened. So everyone gets back on the bus. The Asian woman has changed her her clothing, and the bus is about to leave, but then someone notices, hey.[1:58:42] Dr. Sam Harris: There there's a there was an Asian woman who got off the bus who Isn't it hasn't come back yet, and they tell the driver this. And this poses a problem. So now everyone's waiting for this person to return, but in fact, everyone was on the bus So this woman had just changed her clothing and was not recognized by her fellow travelers. So everyone gets concerned as this this Tourist doesn't, you know, show up, and they start looking for her. Right?[1:59:09] Dr. Sam Harris: And they can't find her. And so a search party is formed, and The Asian woman, because of the whatever language barrier, thought heard that there was a missing tourist, so she joins the search party, which in fact is looking for her. Right? And this goes on into the night, and they're readying helicopters at you know, for a dawn patrol to find the mission missing tourist. Now at some point along the way, I think it was at, like, 3 in the morning, this tourist realizes that she is the object of the search.[1:59:40] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. And, obviously, the whole thing, unravels. She, you know, she confesses that she changed her clothes and, you know, the the problem is solved, But the problem is not solved by the the logic that the seekers expected. Right? So it's like It's not true to say that the missing tourist was found in in the way that was expected.[2:00:02] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Because the missing tourist was never lost. The missing tourist was part of the search party. Right? And so when you think about it from her point of view, like what happened, she's part of the search party.[2:00:12] Dr. Sam Harris: She's looking for the missing tourist, Not knowing that she, in fact, is the missing tourist. So what happens at the moment she realizes That everyone's looking for her. Right? Like, what what is the the search isn't consummated in the way that is implied by the logic of everyone's use of attention. And yet the problem evaporates.[2:00:39] Dr. Sam Harris: And There's something deeply analogous about the structure of that and the the the meditative journey. We in in precisely in, again, Not talking about all the changes in the possible changes in the contents of consciousness that could be good, which, again, cut they they come along for the ride anyway when you when you Do the thing I'm talking about. It's on this point of looking for the self and not finding it. And There is this sense that okay. The self is here, and it's a problem.[2:01:11] Dr. Sam Harris: It is the the string upon which all of my conscious states, mostly The unhappy ones are strong. Right? It's it's the thing that is at the center of my anxiety. It's the it's it's the it's the thing that I don't feel good about. It's the thing that when criticized, I sort of let implode.[2:01:29] Dr. Sam Harris: It's the center of my problem, and now I'm trying to feel better. And meditation has been handed to me as a as a Possible, you know, remedy for my situation, and it and it's billed as a remedy. In fact, it's it's it's I'm I'm hearing from this guy that This is the thing that is gonna cause me to realize that myself isn't where, you know, or as I thought it was. So now I'm gonna look. Right?[2:01:53] Dr. Sam Harris: And so, Again, your your the sense is I start out far away from the goal here. I start out with a problem. I'm now meditating on the evidence of my unenlightenment. Right? I I I can feel my problem.[2:02:07] Dr. Sam Harris: I feel that I'm distracted and distractible, and I feel as this sort of cramp at the center of my life that it's me, and I'm not as happy as I wanna be. I'm not as confident as I wanna be. I'm I'm more distractible than I wanna be, and Now I'm paying attention to the breath. Right? This is what the search party feels like.[2:02:26] Dr. Sam Harris: This is what the The confused tourist feels like in her own search party, and she's she's looking she's looking for the missing person. And So the the so the the angle of of, you know, the inclination of all of this is and the logic of it is all Wrong. You know? Understandably so, given how we we all get into this situation. But, You know, it it's useful to continually try to under undercut it and Recognize that that that the thing that's being looked for is is actually right on the surface, which is, you know, the the there is no one looking.[2:03:07] Dr. Sam Harris: There is no place from which You are pay if you're paying attention to the breath or to sounds or noticing the next thought arise, this sense That you are over here doing that thing is actually what it's like to be thinking and not knowing that you're thinking. You're not there's a there's a thought there's There's an undercurrent of thought that's going uninspected in that moment. And, so there is just a there's a continually looking For the mind, looking for the center of experience, looking for the one who is looking, which, again, which is the kind of the the the orienting practice here. There's a lot more I say about this, obviously, over at waking up, but, it's It's the experiment you have to perform in order to get ready to recognize that this whole this the the search party, you know, was formed in in error, essentially. And the the problem that you're trying to to solve with this practice does evaporate in in a similar way, which is like, You don't actually get there in the way that you're hoping for.[2:04:15] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? It's like like you drop out the bottom of this thing in a in an unexpected way. It's not, there's actually another, kind of a similar, parable or or anecdote that I don't I don't remember Zen or Sufi or I mean, I'm sure it's been reappropriated in many different ways, but or by many different traditions. But there's a there's, you know, the The case of somebody who's lost in a town, and they're they're asking for directions. You know?[2:04:39] Dr. Sam Harris: You could put put this in in in Manhattan. You can let's say you're wandering Manhattan and you're a tourist. You don't know what where anything is, and you you stop and ask someone, you know, where where is Central Park? And the person thinks for a second. They says, oh, yeah.[2:04:52] Dr. Sam Harris: Unfortunately, you can't get to Central Park from here. Right? Now that is a very strange I mean, we we you think about that for a second, you realize, Okay. That's a that's an absurd there is no place that you can't get to from the place you're starting, You know, on Earth. Right?[2:05:08] Dr. Sam Harris: Like[2:05:09] Andrew Huberman: A failure to describe the physical, relationships between anything in the world.[2:05:13] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. That's just not the world we live in. Right? But it's a funny thing. It's but but on some level, that is true of meditation.[2:05:22] Dr. Sam Harris: It's like you can't get there from here. Like, the the sense of you, the sense of you as subject isn't brought along to this thing you're looking for. Right? Like, you're like you're You know, it's almost like it's almost like you're you're you're making a fist and you're trying to get to an open hand. The fist doesn't get to take that journey as a fist.[2:05:47] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Like, you don't the fist doesn't go along for the ride. The fist Comes apart. Right? And and on some level, the our subjectivity is a kind of an an an an attentional fist.[2:06:00] Dr. Sam Harris: You know, it it it is a contraction of energy. Again, it's it's so much bound up in thought for for, most of us most of the time, that is and it get when when properly inspected, there's just this, You know, evaporation of the starting point, but there's not this there's not this fulfillment of, I'm gonna get this fist. It's gonna just gonna if I you know, If life gets good enough, if I get concentrated enough, focused enough, you know, if I asteer enough, if I renounce enough, if I desire less, if I you know You know, enough with enough good in intentions, this fist is gonna move into some sort of sublime condition. Right? That's not the logic of the The process.[2:06:45] Andrew Huberman: I I really appreciate these, models and analogies for conscious experience both as Most people experience them and, harbor them, and it's as a way to frame what's possible through a through a proper meditation practice. I do wanna talk about what a proper meditation practice looks like a bit. But at some point, I do want to raise a a model of maybe even just perceptual awareness to see if it, survives the filters that, you've provided. But first, just even if briefly, and then we could return to it, you know, what does this Meditation practice or set of practices look like. Obviously, the app is a wonderful tool.[2:07:30] Andrew Huberman: I've started using it. As I mentioned in the beginning, my my father's been using it for a while, and many people drive great benefit from it. But if we were to break it down meditation into some basic component parts, As we have broken down, normal perceptual experience and some of its component parts Yep. I can just throw out some things that I associate with meditation, and maybe you can elaborate on on how these may or may not be applied. For instance, there is almost always, a ceasing of motor robust motor movement.[2:08:07] Andrew Huberman: I know there are walking meditations[2:08:08] Dr. Sam Harris: and[2:08:09] Andrew Huberman: so forth, but it seems like sitting or lying down And perhaps not always, but often limiting our visual perception, closing the eyes. Right. Directing a mind's eye someplace. Is there a dedicated effort toward generating imagery? What are the component parts?[2:08:28] Andrew Huberman: And where I'm really going with this is, Why would those component parts eventually allow for this dissolution of the fist or the, the realization that there is no, distinction between, actor and observer and so on.[2:08:41] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Well, so to to answer that second question first, ultimately, meditation is not a practice that you're adding to your life. It's not it's not doing more of anything. It's that you're actually ceasing to do something.[2:08:55] Dr. Sam Harris: It it's ultimately Nondistraction. I mean, it's ultimately, you're recognizing what consciousness is like when you're no longer distracted by the the automatic arising of of thought. It's not that thoughts don't arise. It's not that you can't use them. It's not that you've become irrational or or, you know, unintelligent.[2:09:15] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, like, of that, you you still have all of your tools, but they're every everything is in plain view. I mean, there's an analogy in in Tibetan Buddhism, which I love, which is, You know, kind of in the final stage of meditation, thoughts are like thieves entering an empty house. You know, there's nothing for them to steal. Right. So, you know, in in the usual case, thoughts are there really is something in jeopardy.[2:09:39] Dr. Sam Harris: The every time a thought comes, I'm not meditating anymore. And and not only that, I feel terrible because of what I'm thinking about most of the time. Right? And so It's totally understandable that thoughts seem like a problem in the beginning. And for certain types of meditation, they are explicitly thought of as a problem because you're Trying to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else including thought, and that is a kind what I called concentration practice earlier.[2:10:09] Dr. Sam Harris: And that is a, you know, it's a that's a training that can be good to do. It becomes a tool that you can use for other kinds of of of insight, But it's a very specific and it's kind of brittle skill in the end. I mean, it's it is it's a skill. Just like I'm gonna pay attention to one thing, I'm gonna do that so well that everything else is gonna fade out, and it's somewhat analogous to what you you described in the visual system. If you if you, you know, hit the laser focus to one Fixation point, everything else in your visual field begins to to fade out.[2:10:39] Dr. Sam Harris: But for meditatively, If you have a laser focus on any one thing, what whether it's the breath or or, you know, a a candle flame or whatever it is, Not only does I mean, let's let's use the breath for, you know, for a second, because your eyes are can be closed. I mean, you can lose all sense of everything. I mean, you can lose all sense of hearing, and your your physical body can disappear. I mean, like, literally, it can become incredibly Subtle and vast and drug like, and many people approach meditation thinking Kinda climbing the ladder of those changes into subtlety and vastness, that's the whole that's the whole game. Right?[2:11:23] Dr. Sam Harris: And It can be a deeply rewarding game to play, and it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits. I mean, all the focus and the calm and the and the The kind of smoothness of emotional states, I mean, all that comes with greater concentration, and it it can be quite wonderful. But, again, At best, that's a tool to aim in the direction that I'm talking about now with with respect to meditation, which relates to more What I would call, you know, mindfulness generically, and ultimately kind of nondual mindfulness. So mindfulness generically And for for most people, certainly in the in the beginning, dualistically is just the practice of Paying careful attention to whatever is arising on its own. Right now, in the beginning, it's it's It's natural to take a single object like the breath as a starting point.[2:12:19] Dr. Sam Harris: It's kind of an anchor. You know, over the course of even, you know, your 1st week of doing this, people can you know, teachers and, you know, various sources of information will recommend That, you know, once you get some facility once once you know the difference between being lost in thought and actually paying attention to the breath, well, then you can open it up To everything. You can open up the sounds and other sensations in the body and and, moods and emotions and even ultimately thoughts themselves. And so very quickly, you can recognize that thoughts are not intrinsically the enemy to this practice. They are also just Spontaneous appearances in consciousness that can be observed.[2:13:04] Dr. Sam Harris: But for some considerable period of time, People will feel that there is a place from which that observation is happening. Right? There's just, you know, I'm now the one who's being mindful. And however attenuated that sense of self can be, I mean, again, it can it can get very expansive. I mean, you can, You know, you can lose you know, as you get anything, just a modicum of concentration, you know, it becomes very drug like, and you get you know, your you the The boundaries of your body dissolve and your fee your feeling of having a body can disappear.[2:13:37] Dr. Sam Harris: And, and you you know, if your eyes are closed, You know, your visual field I mean, most people when they close their eyes initially, they just forget about their visual field. But, you know, it's if you close your eyes right now, you notice your visual field is fully present. And, you know, it's we we call it dark, but it's not quite dark. There is this sort of scintillating, some field of of of Color and shadow, that's there be in the darkness of your closed eyes, and that can become a skylight domain of kind of vast, you know, visual expression That opens up as you as you get more concentrated with, you know, with your eyes closed. Right?[2:14:20] Dr. Sam Harris: So you're so you can very much be aware of seeing with your eyes closed in in a meditative Practice. But from the point of view of mindfulness, the logic is not to care about any of the interesting changes and experience that come as a result of practicing in this way because what you're what the the the underlying goal is is to be more and more equanimous with changes. So not to grasp at what's pleasant or interesting and not to push what's unpleasant or or, you know, boring or or or, you know, or otherwise not engaging in a way. What you want is just a kind of a skylike mind that just allows everything to appear, and you're not clinging to anything or or or reacting to anything.[2:15:11] Andrew Huberman: Could I ask you what your thoughts are about the differences between nouns, adjectives, and verbs In the context of what we're talking about and you're describing. And the reason bring this up is that, as you know, and I know everything in biology is a process. You know? We we would never ever say, oh, you know, the perception of that red line on a painting is, is a noun. Right?[2:15:37] Andrew Huberman: I mean, it's it's an event in the visual system. You're you're abstracting some understanding about that thing in the outside world. And I think it's very useful in Thinking about the brain, and people will notice I notice I, excuse me, actively avoid the use of the word mind because I Figure out especially with you sitting across from me that I'll I'll step in it if I if I do. But The brain generates a series of perceptions or or what have you by through processes, not nouns. And so when thinking about biology, I think development is a is a is an arc of processes.[2:16:13] Andrew Huberman: Aging is an arc. Perception is an arc of process. They just exist on different time scales. And so a little bit of what I'm hearing is that inside of an effective meditation practice, there's a little bit of a of a, certainly nonjudgment, but Discarding of the the noun and the adjective, modes of language. Like red apple.[2:16:33] Andrew Huberman: Okay. It's a red apple, but then You sort of need to eliminate some other adjectives about it. It's a rotten apple. It's a, you know, ripe apple. And instead, View the appearance and disappearance of that apple as a it's just a thing, a process, as opposed to an event.[2:16:49] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[2:16:49] Andrew Huberman: And now events could we could really get into the language aspect of it? That just reveals how, diminished language is to describe the workings of the brain at some level. I don't know if any of this resonates, but it but it seems to me the goal or one of the goals is to start to understand the algorithm that is the fleeting nature of But to not focus on any 1 single perception, and then to not even focus on 1 single algorithm, but to at some level, there's a, what is revealed to the meditator over time is some sort of macroscopic principle about, The way perceptions work at a deeper level. Right? That there's that there's sort of a deeper principle there that sits Below our certainly, our normal everyday awareness, but that in paying attention to the mechanics of all this stuff and not judging those mechanics, not naming those mechanics, or just naming them and let them pass by, that there's some action function, some verb is revealed.[2:17:48] Andrew Huberman: And that maybe that verb maybe the word to describe that verb is mindfulness. Maybe mindfulness is is really just a verb to describe that. I don't know. But is there anything here, or am I create am I Yeah. No.[2:18:00] Andrew Huberman: I don't know if I'm creating just, Like useless straw or if there's if there's actually a seed here of something real. But to me, anytime I wanna understand something in biology Or psychology, I try and, broaden the time domain and think in terms of verbs, not nouns or adjectives.[2:18:15] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That that's very useful, and that's somewhat Adjacent to this distinction I'm making between dualistic and nondualistic ways of experiencing the world.[2:18:26] Dr. Sam Harris: So even dualistically, Everything is still a process. Right? And and we're misled by the the reification that noun talk gives us. So And this this applies not just to something like mindfulness, but even to something like the self. Right?[2:18:41] Dr. Sam Harris: So the sense of self is also a process. I mean, it's it's it's a verb. It's not so we're we're more than we ourselves. Right? And, And there you know, I even even appropriate uses of of of the term self That don't go away even when you when you recognize that the this the core subject self is an illusion.[2:19:06] Dr. Sam Harris: There there are states of self, right, where you you can recognize in your life that you inhabit very different modes of of being Depending on the context. So, like, there are moments where you just by walking into a certain building, you suddenly transition into a different state of self. Like like, Suddenly, you pass through a door, and now you're a customer in a store. Right? So we know what that customer feeling is.[2:19:32] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, you're now the person Who's getting the attention? It's a very kind of formalized type of attention from the person who's running the store and you know, or a restaurant. You're a customer in a restaurant. Right. That's a, I just I just remember something that's kinda funny, that, it was born of a mismatch of of this.[2:19:51] Dr. Sam Harris: So I'll come back to that in a second. But, so there are, so we we go through the you you you can be You know, you you can be a student in the presence of a teacher. You can be a parent in the presence of a of a son or a daughter. You can be a spouse in presence in the presence of your spouse. And all of those Shadings of, you know, like the the the the the this this the change in context, really does Sure.[2:20:20] Dr. Sam Harris: And some fundamental psychological changes in just the states of consciousness that are available to you. I mean and and it's And some of this is really I mean, I'm sure we can understand a lot about this, you know, personally and and, you know, generically, but it is Pretty mysterious. I mean, like, I mean, there are people who I know who I you know, I'm with them in a certain way. And, like, based on something I'm getting off of them, like, I can't be that. I I'm I'm I'm effortlessly one way with them, And there's no way I could be that way with somebody else.[2:20:57] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Like, it's just I don't know if it's pheromones or their, you know, their facial it's just the way they are, their facial expression. But, I mean, there there are people with whom I'm really kinda effortlessly funny, and there are people with whom, you know, I couldn't even it would never to me to be funny no matter what happened. You know? It's like and and I have, like, long standing relationships with with these people.[2:21:17] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? So, like, it's it's it's just very You know, all that's very mysterious. But, anyway, the the difference there is in is not in this core sense of subject in relationship to all the objects. It's in kind of the the the states of self, and but and and all of that is just is very verby. Right?[2:21:36] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, all this is a this pattern of changes. It's a pattern of what's available and what's not available, the capacities that are, you know, that are that come online or not, in in in those various contexts. But, no, the the memory I just had, which I hadn't had had a long time, there was one of these these moments where I realized The power of these shifts in context for states of self. So I once I was a, A a young man. I think I was I was, probably 22 or so and single, and, like, you're just, like, trying to figure out how How you how do you meet women, and, like, how does how does one get confident to do this well?[2:22:17] Dr. Sam Harris: And, I, I walked into a restaurant and a, a kind of a woman was walking toward me, you know, Toward the front door of the restaurant, but she's walking toward me in a way where I just, by default, assumed she was the hostess in the restaurant. But she wasn't the the hostess. She was just a a, you know, someone who had just eaten there, I guess. So I walked through, and she comes out. And so there's a fundamental misunderstanding in me that's set up by literally just this change in architecture.[2:22:50] Dr. Sam Harris: And I and so I just said hi to her a way that I would I presumably, I would say hi to any hostess who was coming up to to ask me whether where I wanted to sit. But what had actually happened is I had said hi to a total stranger in a way that I tended, at that point, never to say hi to total strangers because I was shy and, you know, just like it. But, apparently, I gave her, like, a 10,000 watt, you know, high of, like, like, all of the confidence you would have if you if if you were that sort of person. And it just ushered in a complete like, you know, this is so I went to my table, and this woman, like, came back into the restaurant, like, gave me her phone number, Right? Which was something that was just completely foreign experience to me, you know, and it was based completely on my misunderstanding of the situation I was in.[2:23:35] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And and so, anyway, that[2:23:37] Andrew Huberman: Among the understanding, among the misunderstandings that one can have and then, action engage in life, I I would say that that was a somewhat adaptive one.[2:23:46] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. But but but then you realize that okay. But then there are certain people who recognize this machinery to whatever degree or have net kinda natural aptitudes for bringing certain things online or not Such that okay. They can make these state they can consciously make these states of self, you know, this kind this level of gregariousness, Say available to them in different in in the circumstances where it's it's actually useful to them.[2:24:11] Dr. Sam Harris: So if you if you're single and you wanna meet people, it's it's it's actually very helpful to to feel confident enough to just go say hi to strangers and ask them how they're doing and to and to and to be to be, You know, online, you know, in in that way where at that point in my life, in that circumstance, you know, by, you know, By default, I was gonna ignore this stranger who I was passing by in in in the doorway of a restaurant. But thinking she was the hostess, I was engaging her, you know, fully. So, anyway, you can consciously again, this does not invoke free will at all, but, yes, you can consciously decide to play with this with these mechanisms such that you can decide You what state states of self, would be more normative to have, you know, given what you want in life? And and You can become increasingly, you know, attentive to the ways in which you get played by the world. You know?[2:25:03] Dr. Sam Harris: You're a kind of instrument. Your mind is a kind of instrument. Your brain is a kind of instrument that is continually getting played by the situations you're in, and you can become more of an intelligent curator of your Conscious states in your conscious capacities just by noticing the changes in you. Like, I I in graduate school, it's something I talk about. I think at some point in waking up, This became very stark for me because I had, you know, I was a, you know, an old graduate student.[2:25:33] Dr. Sam Harris: I had I had taken 11 years off at Stanford Between my sophomore and junior year. Right? So I like when I went back to school[2:25:39] Andrew Huberman: Talk about a leave of absence.[2:25:41] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. I know. It was yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, so Stanford had this you know, you might know this.[2:25:45] Dr. Sam Harris: They have the stop out policy where you never really drop out. You just stop out. So you're I can always go back. You don't have to write letters saying that you still exist every, you know, 2 years as you do in other schools. So, anyway, I showed up after 11 years and but you know?[2:26:00] Dr. Sam Harris: So I was really on a deadline, and I felt late everything. So I'm kind of, you know, finishing my degree, you know, as quickly as I can, as an undergraduate. And then I jump into graduate school, and I'm an old graduate student. And I'm you know, there's a real sense of kind of urgency. Like, I'm late.[2:26:15] Dr. Sam Harris: I want I should have done this earlier. I wanna get this stuff done. But then 911 happened, and I you asked just as I had finished my coursework, you know, getting my my PhD. I was just getting into my research, But 911 intersected with my life in such a way that I just had to drop everything and write my 1st book. And I did that, and then I just had to drop everything and write my 2nd book of the response to the 1st book.[2:26:39] Dr. Sam Harris: And so, essentially, I had, like, 4 years where I was AWOL do doing my PhD. But I was still had a toe in the lab, and I was still showing up occasionally. But I was becoming this kind of cautionary tale from the point of view of grad school, but I was also becoming kind of a famous, you know, or semi famous writer, because my first book had been a a a New York Times bestseller, and I I just I was you know? So I was getting some notoriety as a A a writer. And so I was doing things like, you know, I was giving a TED talk, but I still hadn't finished graduate school.[2:27:08] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So, like, it was just it was I think that timing is right. Maybe I had just finished graduate school when I I gave the TED talk. But, anyway, so I I I was in rowing in 2 boats, And 1 boat was sinking or, you know, showing every sign of of being damaged. And I was literally, like, you know, you know, getting letters from the head of the department saying, you know, we're concerned about you.[2:27:29] Dr. Sam Harris: But on the other hand, I was, like, becoming as, you know, a a quasi celebrity in that world too, you know, at least in a world that was overlapping. So I was having the experience of, like, going in I mean, the the moment where this crystallized would for me in a in a Fairly peculiar way was I had a meeting at, like, 3 o'clock with my adviser who was just this guy Mark Cohen in in the brain mapping center in UCLA is a fantastic guy. Great adviser. I did I did not extract as much wisdom from him as I I should have. Brilliant scientist, and, you know, he's for him, I'm late.[2:28:09] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? At least in my head, is not that he was riding me so hard, but, like, in my head, I'm very self conscious about how I'm not living up to his expect expectations at this point. So I have a meeting with him at, like, 3 o'clock, and I'm just kind of wilting, you know, under my you know you know, his gaze and my own imagined, you know, Inner gaze of his, you know, but that 2 hours later, I have a meeting with his boss, You know, a dinner meeting with his boss who wants to meet with me to get advice on launching his book. We have the same publisher, but I'm like the much bigger author At, you know, at Norton, you know, and he and he's he's coming to me for advice. And so I'm ricocheting between two Dimetrically opposite self states that are it again, this comes down to architecture.[2:28:58] Dr. Sam Harris: It's literally like the state I was in walking into 1 building and then leaving and walking into another building on the same campus, and they work Completely opposite self concepts. Like, in one in in one context, I'm a fuck up. In another context, I'm a celebrity who's[2:29:19] Andrew Huberman: And you have mastery and virtuosity, and Yeah. And and we're developing it very quickly.[2:29:24] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. And and but so, Again, this is a kind of a stark version of that, but everyone has some version of this just in balancing between Talking to their mom and then talking to their best friend and then talking to a stranger and then and talking to someone who's who's very successful, talking to someone who's not very sick. Like, all you notice your vulnerability to all of this stuff. And, ultimately, what you want is A level of psychological integrity that that is truly divorceable from that. Now that you I I'm not I'm not saying you're ever gonna get it perfect.[2:30:00] Dr. Sam Harris: You know, there's there's always gonna be some I mean, yeah, I I can't I can't talk about the ultimate fulfillment of this Process. Like, I'm not I'm not, you know, I'm not a Buddha. I'm not saying I'm I've I've finished the project, but, I think there's More and more, you you know, as you become become sensitive to these changes and you become sensitive to what it's like to actually not be Psychologically reactive and and not be definable by your own self-concept, your own you're not identifying with anything. You're not your hat on anything. You're not thinking about yourself in terms in in in in the in the kind of terms that you would export to others and then care about what they think about you.[2:30:46] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Like, you're there's a kind of invulnerability, that that arises that's not born of being well defended. It's born of of of being evaporated. Right. So you're no longer keeping score in those ways.[2:31:03] Andrew Huberman: Once again, we're we're at the I really appreciate that description because I these days, I'm I'm really intrigued by, Something we've known for a long time that I'm you're certainly familiar with is prefrontal cortex's ability to establish Context dependent rule sets. You know? Stroop task will be, you know, basic example of, you know, reading numbers or letters on on cards and then switching to Having to report the colors of the letters and numbers are written in, it's a basic task, but prefrontal cortex obviously important for setting context dependent thought and behavior and directed And but within the context of all these different variations of the self, depending on Graduate school or, you know, relationship or sitting alone in one's room. Yeah. Their different rule sets arise, but and somehow, We we are able to have a sense a coherent sense of self that encompasses all of those.[2:31:53] Andrew Huberman: Functional people can toggle between them as needed and not overlap them inappropriately, at least not to the extent that it's career failing or life failing. Although, There are sad examples of that, many of which exist in, the Twitter space. I I know several colleagues, not directly of mine, but people who, through mistakes made with their thumbs where they forgot context[2:32:19] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[2:32:19] Andrew Huberman: Or forgot to realize that the context on social media is near infinite. But the context that it existed in their head might not be clear in the way that they communicated something, and they lost their jobs Right. By saying What were perceived as insensitive things, in some cases, were in fact offensive and sensitive things. In some cases, it's debatable. Right?[2:32:40] Andrew Huberman: In any case, I think that the the the image that now comes to mind or relates to something you said several times that, it's not about eliminating something. It's about revealing that something was never actually there. And then in terms of sensory experience and these these different aspects of the self, I had this image in my mind of of, I'm not an experienced scuba diver, but I've done enough of it. You know, worn a wetsuit.[2:33:02] Dr. Sam Harris: You[2:33:02] Andrew Huberman: wear a complete wetsuit with the hood. And this idea, you know, if you were born into that Wet suit. You might think that, yeah, you you know, nudge up or lean up against the wall and you experience it one way. Right? And, but were you to shed that wet suit, you go, wow.[2:33:19] Andrew Huberman: There's this incredible landscape of somatosensory experience that I had no idea. No. That goes way beyond Levels of sensitivity. Right? Now you're talking about fine two point discrimination and light strokes, and this could be positive or negative pain in other ways too.[2:33:33] Andrew Huberman: But what you're describing is essentially that the wet suit was never really there. Mhmm. It but was created through a series of in of action steps. And what I think what we're, migrating towards here is a out of, foremost, nonintuitive, or nonreflexive action steps that reveal to us that, in fact, we're not wearing the sweatsuit. Now you raised one, Topic, which I I think is analogous to this wetsuit, which is this notion of distraction.[2:34:03] Andrew Huberman: Then normally, distraction is masking what would otherwise be a a better experience of life. I can think of distraction as falling into 2 different bins. 1 would be the kind of distraction that is Internally generated, like the fact that thoughts arise and pull me down different alleyways and avenues of my of my brain and my thoughts and my experience. And then the other would be, and and that that would compete with my ability to really focus on something. And then another form of distraction which captures my ability to focus intensely, but has me focusing on the wrong things.[2:34:43] Andrew Huberman: And here, I think the judgment of wrong is is reasonable to include if, for instance, I'm being impulsively Yanked to something on social media. I'm being impulsively yanked to someone else's pain and experience and somehow confusing that with my own experience. This isn't empathy, but just getting yanked around, my attention as a spotlight is kinda like over here, over there. I'm not feeling as if I'm the one standing behind that spotlight controlling it, or I'm not the spotlight. Right.[2:35:10] Andrew Huberman: Just to keep with the what we've been building up here. So could you tell us a little bit about distraction and tell me whether or not These 2 forms are in any way accurate or inaccurate. I'd be happy for them to to be inaccurate. And whether or not there are other forms of distraction that we need to be on the lookout for. And, again, I think what most people are seeking is what is the way to not just enhance our ability to focus, but to shed this wet suit like cloak That limits our experience that I'm calling and that you've called distraction.[2:35:43] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. I get well, this I I mean, distraction is is one component of it. The the other aspect of it is identification with thought and identify the the the feeling of self is Bound up in the sense that that I'm the I'm the thinker. I'm the one attending. I'm the 1 vulnerable.[2:36:00] Dr. Sam Harris: I'm the inner kind of the inner homunculus that's vulnerable to experience, And, like, it can be gratified by it or not, and it's constantly trying to improve it or and mitigate negative aspects of it. It's the it's the sense that there's kind of a a rider on the horse of consciousness as opposed to just consciousness and its contents. So it's it's again, it it it rise atop this illusion of control, etcetera. So To to go all the way back to the to the question you asked about, just what is in a you know, what do I recommend as a starting point for for meditation? Some of your assumptions are in fact true.[2:36:40] Dr. Sam Harris: Yes. I mean, it's it's it's, you know, I often recommend in the beginning, people close their eyes and you you you do a sitting practice, And and that's different from a walk in practice. I mean, you can do both, but people tend to start, you know, sitting with their eyes closed. But, again, Ultimately, where this is going is it's not an art meditation properly recognizes not an artifice that you add into your life. It's not it's not even a practice.[2:37:05] Dr. Sam Harris: It is it is less rather than more. You know? It and and therefore, it is also Coincident with, you know, potentially every waking moment. There's nothing there's nothing that you can do With your attention, once you know how to meditate, that in principle excludes meditation because meditation is just A a recognition of an an intrinsic character of consciousness in each moment, and all you have in each moment is consciousness and its contents, whatever you're doing. So, so in the beginning, you you know, you'll you'll be very deliberate and precious about Deciding to practice meditation, you'll set aside 10 minutes in the morning, and you'll do that.[2:37:46] Dr. Sam Harris: And then and it'll seem very different from the next 10 minutes when you're, You know, spilling out onto your to to do list, and you're you're trying to figure out, you know, what the day looks like. Right? But, ultimately, You want to erase this boundary between formal practice and the rest of life such that there's it's just not remotely findable. And and And that that's that's achievable. And and I think even from the very beginning, you can relax this conceptual distinction between meditation and its antithesis because It's it's not it's not at the level of anything you're doing.[2:38:21] Dr. Sam Harris: It's the level it's at the level of What's happening in your relationship to thought? You know? Like, what what can you notice when when you know like, it's the transition from, You know, the bias the bistable percept. You know? You're looking at the at the the image and you see nothing.[2:38:41] Dr. Sam Harris: Let's say this, you know, the Dalmatian, you know, it's just the spots on the paper, and you just you don't see you don't see anything. And then all of a sudden, the Dalmatian or the face of Jesus or whatever the the images Pops out and then you see it. It's the transition from nothing to something. Right? That you the practice becomes the transition from being lost in thought And then waking up and break you know, it's very much like breaking the spell of thought.[2:39:08] Dr. Sam Harris: Identification with thought is very much like Waking up from a dream and having so, like, that that transition, the the whole like, you're having a dream, And there's couple things are true there. I mean, it it really is a kind of it's it's a it's a psychosis That is just not we don't problematize because you're safely in bed and you're not moving or unless you've got some kind of, you know, sleep disorder. You're not walking around harming yourself or anybody else. So but to be in bed and to not know it And to think you're, you know, running along a beach or, you know, you're in, you know, getting tried for murder in a court of law or whatever the thing is that you're completely delusional about. Right?[2:39:52] Dr. Sam Harris: That is psychosis. Right? And and so, like, you're fundamentally unaware of your circumstance. And then you there are 2 things can happen there. You can either Become lucid within the dream, right, which is interesting, and that's a whole there's a whole phenomenology of that, which, can be practiced.[2:40:07] Dr. Sam Harris: But more commonly, you can just wake up from the dream, and all of a sudden the problem you thought you had is no longer there, and And you have a completely different context for your conscious life. Like, now you know you're in bed you're safely in bed all all the while. There really is something analogous when you break this identification with thought. Right? You're just you're having a thought that seems to be some kind of, you You know, moral or psychological emergency, and and yet You can you can the moment you see daylight around it, the moment you see that that the mind is larger than than the this mere appearance, Right?[2:40:53] Dr. Sam Harris: Then you have it suddenly you have a degree of freedom that that a moment ago was just unthinkable. Right? And you're also You recognize you sort of come to in a way. You recognize your circumstance in a way that you weren't a moment ago when you were just talking to yourself, when you were just Identical to that conversation. So this is all all to say that that ultimately meditation I mean, so, again, there's another apparent paradox here.[2:41:20] Dr. Sam Harris: Many people don't know much about meditation. We'll say things like, You know what? You know, for me, running is by meditation or skiing or rock climbing or playing the guitar. Something they like to do that gives them an experience of flow, that's what that's what they go to, to feel better, and that's that's the opposite of all the, You know, the chaos of their lives or the there's, you know, their time on Twitter or whatever it is. In virtually every case, it's it's not true to say that that is effectively meditation.[2:41:51] Dr. Sam Harris: You're not gonna by learning to play the guitar, you're not gonna learn what I'm calling meditation, And you're not gonna learn it by, you know, cycling or get and getting no matter how good you get at any of those things, you're not gonna learn it by doing those things. But paradoxically, Not really, but it can seem like a paradox. Once you know how to meditate, then you can meditate doing all of those things. Right. Meditation is totally compatible with playing the guitar or skiing or, you know, do doing any ordinary thing you like to do.[2:42:20] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So Once you know how to meditate and, again, it's totally natural in the beginning to formalize it and to set aside time each day to do it because it is a It is a training. I mean, it is something that in the beginning you have to get used to. But once you have once you're getting used to it, then there is no good reason not to be experiencing this thing I'm calling meditation, this this insight into the the the centerlessness of Consciousness, the the the non selfhood of consciousness, you should experience it when you're Playing your favorite sport or when you're having a conversation with somebody. And the then the reason then to come back to your Initial assumption about eyes closed.[2:43:04] Dr. Sam Harris: A lot of practice, even formal practice can be done eyes open, and it's important to do it eyes open because So much of our anchoring of our sense of self is is based on visual cues. I mean, we're like we just we we know that you can if you give people the right visual cues, You can translocate their sense of self. You can give them an out of body experience, you know, with a with a video display where you you can literally make them feel like There's a body swapping illusion. You can make them you you can make them feel that they're in another person's body looking back at their body if you if you, you know, run the cameras the right way.[2:43:38] Andrew Huberman: I've done this in VR seeing an image of of you they created an avatar for you, and then your bodily movements generate the movements of the avatar. And, you start gaining presence as they call it in the VR lingo very quickly, and then pretty soon, You lose sense of your own bodily representation and[2:43:56] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[2:43:57] Andrew Huberman: And, it's a little eerie. What's eeriest to me is going back into, You know, of course, never left, but, back into your actual body when the VR goggles pop off, the world seems almost overwhelming the number of sensory stimuli that are in a, like, a laboratory room, which is actually quite sparse. Right. So exactly what you described, this translocation of of notions of self Through visual experience.[2:44:22] Dr. Sam Harris: And But but conversely, when you lose the sense of self, the the sense of self I'm talking about, It can be especially vivid and and salient with eyes open because it because so much so many of your reference points to selfhood are Delivered visually, right, especially in in a social situation. It's like, you know, I'm talking to you. You're looking back at me. Right? So you're the implication of your gaze is that I'm over here behind my face implicated by your gaze.[2:44:49] Dr. Sam Harris: Like so the sense that you're looking at something is the sense of self in that social context. Right? And so and if your if your facial expression changes, like so I'm saying something and if you kinda furrow your brow, Like, what the hell is here? You know? And I can read into that facial change some interstate of yours that is, you know, sailing into me.[2:45:08] Dr. Sam Harris: All of a sudden, we've got this sort of dance of, like, I'm Noticing you reacting to me, and I'm feel that's that's changing the way I'm feeling about what I'm that that that's the that's the, you know, the the purview of, you know, every neurosis, Everyone didn't want. Right?[2:45:22] Andrew Huberman: And every relationship. I had a girlfriend when I was a postdoc who's a who was very, very, she was brilliant, really, still is. She always said that every relationship they're referring is is there are 4 arrows. She's she's an neuroscientist, still is, and said, you know, there's the arrow of, you know, She was talking to me, so she said, you know, me to you and kinda what you perceive coming from me, and then there's you to me, and then there's an arrow from the middle going right back at each one of us Right. Is our own perception of what the other person is thinking about us, and it's feeding back on the other arrow.[2:45:53] Andrew Huberman: And she came with this very, clear, but, model of basically relationships. The relationship failed, but it was good while it lasted, I should say. It's good. And, but the 4 arrow model of relationships actually shows up in Every type of, 1 on 1 on 1 relationship and it's probably an under description of of the total number of arrows. But it's I think it's exactly what you're describing is Perception of self through the eyes of other whether or not we're empathic or not strongly shapes the way that we access different context dependent rule sets about what we're gonna say.[2:46:25] Andrew Huberman: I'm not gonna say it's very dynamic. Right?[2:46:27] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. So but the the freedom that I think we want and and people can sometimes Experience this just haphazardly, but the the thing that the center of the bull's eye from the meditative point of view is to get off that ride entirely And to so so that losing the sense of self in this context of of a a social encounter is to is to Give up your face, essentially. Like, your like, so and and what what that entails is Or what that gives you is the free attention to actually just pay attention to the other person. Right? And the other person is now no longer Quite an object in the world for you.[2:47:09] Dr. Sam Harris: There's really just a kind of a totality of which that person is a part. And and and, actually, you know, Martin Buber, the the, kind of mystical, Jewish philosopher, talked about the kind of the I thou relationship. And and this, I think, is you know, it's been a long time since I've read Buber, but, and I don't know if he goes, you know, Far enough to be truly nondualistic, but this distinction between I I and now, because the the thou part of it is is, I think, Potentially, this or again, it's been several decades since I read read him. But There's a there's a there's a way of beholding another person where you have the free attention to simply behold them. Right.[2:47:56] Dr. Sam Harris: You're like, you're no longer you're you're no you no longer care what they think about you. You don't feel neuronically implicated by their gaze. You don't feel You you're you're simply the space in which they're appearing. Right? And so you're free.[2:48:10] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? Like like, there's just there's no and and people can feel and so so you're you're By definition, you are no longer self conscious. Right? And when and this phrase self consciousness really does get at This what I'm calling the self, the the the illusory self as a kind of contraction, and and you can you can notice this for yourself. Just imagine what it's like To go from not being self conscious to suddenly being self conscious.[2:48:39] Dr. Sam Harris: And the the the the approximate cause of this, you know, Almost invariably is suddenly recognizing that somebody's looking at you. Right? So, like, you're in a Starbucks And you're, you know, you're alone and you're reading the newspaper, whatever it is, and this is now sounds highly anachronistic. It's been 3 years since I've held a physical newspaper, I think, in a Starbucks. But, you know, you're you're you're just minding your own business, and you look up and you're you're seeing, you know, a room full of strangers, But then you notice that someone is just looking at you.[2:49:12] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? And so, like, that moment of eye contact, right, Suddenly, that throws you back on yourself as a kind of suddenly, you're the object in in the world for that other person. That recognition is a the tightening there, the kind of contraction there is a is a A a further ramification of this this feeling most of us have most of the time of being the center of experience. Like, the tie the the the place you feel like like, it's it's like, you know, we're all walking around with a fist. And in moments of self consciousness, the fist gets really tight.[2:49:53] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? And that's and that's, that's the thing that gets fully relaxed When you discover this this what what I'm you know, in in various points call the nature of mind or the the the nondual nature of consciousness just that there is no center to this experience. And when you recognize no center, then even when your gaze is aimed at another person's gaze, There is no implication going back to the center because there is no center. Right? And and rather than that being an experience of Weird detachment or confusion or or it's it's actually an experience of greater relationship because you're no longer You no longer defend it.[2:50:34] Dr. Sam Harris: You're not it's not you're not defending anything over here. Like, you're not you're not braced against anything. You're just the space in which that person is showing up. And so it's a it's a it's a an experience of being much more comfortable in in the presence of another person, what you know, whatever your relationship Because you're not contracting. Right?[2:50:54] Dr. Sam Harris: And then when you do when you have the again, and this is meditation. Right? This is a meditation that is totally compatible with having a conversation with somebody. And then when you notice yourself contracting, like, when you notice you're not doing you're not meditating anymore, you're just you're actually reacting. Like, they just said something or looked a certain way and now you're cast back upon yourself in relationship to them, That becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm.[2:51:20] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Then you know that that it it becomes like the the the unsatisfactoriness of that Psychologically, it becomes more and more salient. Right? And it's, because that's not, One, that's not the way you wanna be. I mean, it's like it's the antithesis of being as as comfortable as you were a moment ago.[2:51:40] Dr. Sam Harris: But 2, It's it's something you're doing unnecessarily. Right? Like, it's like you're you're you're you're like again, you're making a fist when you don't have to make a fist. Right? And and it's, Again, you can leave aside all those circumstances where it's appropriate to react to someone, and, you know, I'm I'm Sure.[2:51:58] Dr. Sam Harris: You know, I'm into martial arts and self defense, and, yes, you're not supposed to be just this puddle of goo out in the world who can be just mistreated by people and and, you know, never put up, you know, Resistance, but it's, psychologically you know, even if even if a state like anger or contraction is sometimes normative and appropriate. The question is, how long is it normative and appropriate for? Like, how how long do you wanna stay angry for? In my experience, these, you know, kinda classically negative emotions like anger and fear are appropriate as salient cues. You know, they they orient you to, you know, an emergency or a potential emergency.[2:52:42] Dr. Sam Harris: But then in dealing with the emergency, they're almost never the state you wanna be in. You know? It's like you you don't you know, you you like, it's It's better to actually be calm in an emergency. You know? So[2:52:55] Andrew Huberman: Oh, absolutely. I think that, and, again, the language is is insufficient to describe what, what you're telling us, but I think what comes to mind for me is this distinction between situational awareness and self awareness, and we need both. But under conditions of, emergency, true emergency, or motivated desire, We need to dial down the amount of self awareness in order to be more effective within the situational awareness. But you said something very important, and my lab has been working on, fear like states for a long time. So I'm gonna I I confess I'm gonna, Rob this from you, but I'll credit you every time I describe is that that the that the the fear of the threat detection state or set of events, acts as a as a flag, but is not meant to persist in the way that, the flag went up[2:53:51] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[2:53:52] Andrew Huberman: If one is to be in their most adaptive state actually, Jocko Willink and I were talking about this. He has he talks a lot about detachment and open gaze, things that my lab interested in visual system and autonomic interaction. So white broadening the gaze literally broadens the time domain of thinking. You've come up with new, solutions to complex problems in real time and so on, and, and you're describing everyday set of interactions where that could be very useful. And yet there seems to be something that about the way you describe meditation and what you've managed to arrive at and, what practitioners of meditation can arrive at, which is something more than that.[2:54:30] Andrew Huberman: Like, it it's not just about being effective or optimizing all the language we see Run around a lot in the space that I I live in these days, but, but something fundamentally more important about how to experience Life and the self, this this realization that what you thought was there was never really there. There but that there are constraints that limit that, and so to try and fracture those just constraints 1 by 1. Would you say that meditation as a practice done for a few minutes each day or with the app That it's a, kind of a step function is a very nonlinear in terms of people's progress. Yeah. You know, I'm certainly gonna go, start doing more meditation based on this discussion truly, because anytime someone describes, that there's Kind of a myth that we've been living in.[2:55:22] Andrew Huberman: I I become obsessed with the idea of dissolving that myth.[2:55:26] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[2:55:27] Andrew Huberman: That's a very seductive way, so thank you for using that one. There is no better marketing tool, which is I realize what you're not trying to do here, but that's for me to capture my my, efforts, You tell me that there's a myth that I'm living in[2:55:39] Dr. Sam Harris: Mhmm.[2:55:39] Andrew Huberman: And that it can be dissolved, and that opens up a better landscape. Yeah. What is the the Process like this. Do some people make progress very quickly? Do some people, experience kind of step functions towards progress?[2:55:54] Andrew Huberman: What does the Meditation practice look like over time. Mhmm. Do you still meditate, or do you have you just threaded it through your jujitsu, your writing, your daily life, your coffee, your time with your wife, etcetera.[2:56:06] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Also, just to come back to just to to talk about the myth for a second. So they they're really what you just enunciated was a kind of a second doorway into this whole Projects. So, like, the the usual door is through the door of suffering, for lack of a better word. I mean, people feel Unhappy in a variety of ways, and they get more sensitized to the mechanics of their own unhappiness.[2:56:30] Dr. Sam Harris: And meditation is one of the things on the menu that see that is is explicitly built as a remedy for for unhappiness, and, and it is. And that's you know, I think I think that's Probably the most common path to this, but another path is just intellectual interest. I mean, just wanting to know what's real about the mind subjectively In a in a first person way. And and there's there's no contradiction between those 2 things. I'm I'm motivated by both of them, but, you know, it's a totally valid doorway into this.[2:57:02] Dr. Sam Harris: There are definitely step functions. I mean, I would say there There are at least 2. I mean, the the and it they really articulated along the lines of of, The framework I've been describing of of dualistic and nondualistic mindfulness. Right? So in the beginning, you're gonna start out you know, 99.9% of people start out dualistically paying attention and and noticing the difference between being distracted by thought And then being on the object of attention, whether it's the breath or sounds or whatever.[2:57:35] Dr. Sam Harris: And eventually, that, you know, that opens up to all Possible objects of attention, including thoughts, and the and the there's still this fluctuation between being distracted and then being mindful of whatever. And the fact that it's open to all possible objects differentiates this type of practice from anything that is narrowly focused on 1 object like A mantra or a visualization or you know, those are other paths of practice that are more concentration based, and interesting. But The the benefit of mindfulness is that very quickly you realize it's by definition compatible with all possible experience because you're not Artificially contracting your attention down to something, you're you're just being aware of the next thing, a sight, a sound, a taste, a thought. So the 1st step function is to very clearly experience the difference Between being lost in thought and being clearly aware of any part of experience, including thought, and to notice The freedom the comparative psychological freedom that gives you. Right?[2:58:42] Dr. Sam Harris: So you can like, you're something's made you angry, and now you're thinking about all the reasons why you Should be angry and have every right to be angry and what you're gonna tell that person when you see them, and and then you notice your thinking. Right? And you notice the connection between The thought and the anger. Right? You're like like, the the the minute spent lost in thought about what's making you angry is the thing that dragged through the physiology of anger.[2:59:08] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And the moment you notice That once you're mindful, once you can be mindful, you can notice thought as thought and how quickly that dissipates. It's just the language and the imagery. Just you you couldn't hold on to it if you wanted to. And then you notice the physiology of the anger is just this Kinda meaningless, you know, kinda inner incandescence that has its own half life and degrades very, very Quickly, when you're no longer thinking about the reasons why you should be angry, you can't hold on to the anger.[2:59:38] Dr. Sam Harris: The anger itself dissipates. Right? And from some from the point of view of the one who's being mindful, This is tremendous relief. I mean and at minimum, it's a degree of freedom. You can, at that point, decide, well, how long do I wanna be angry for?[2:59:52] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. Is it useful to stay angry? Do you wanna be angry for 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes? Or because but and before you have that capacity to be mindful, You're gonna helplessly be as angry as you're gonna be for as long as you're gonna be that way just based on the kind of the time course of your thinking about it, brooding about it, Telling your wife about it. You know?[3:00:13] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, it just the the you know, it's just gonna be this conversation based misadventure in, You know, negative, states of mind, and you are you are going to be the hostage of that for as long as you'll be the hostage of that. You'll have nothing you can do Apart from just deciding to, you know, check out and watch Game of Thrones again for the 3rd time. Right? Like like, it's just you can divert your attention to something else, Which is, you know, sometimes a good thing to do, but mindfulness even dualistic mindfulness gives you this capacity to just observe The mechanics of this and then get off the ride when you when you whenever you want. So that really is a step function.[3:00:53] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, 1st, there was a time when there's a time before you could do that, and then there's a time after which you can do that. The other step function is Noticing that there is no one who is doing that. I mean, this is the nonduality, the the selflessness, the The centrallessness of awareness. Right? The fact that there's no place from which the mindfulness is being aimed, but the fact that there's just This open condition in which everything is appearing, you know, thoughts included, to to have you as at that point, Your mindfulness no longer becomes it's no longer this this dualistic effort to Strategically pay attention to anything as opposed to being lost in thought.[3:01:40] Dr. Sam Harris: It's just what's left when thoughts when when when the Present recognized thought unravels. Even before it unravels, what's recognized is You are simply identical to the condition in which everything is appearing. Now, again, this is not a I'm not making a a A Deepak Chopra like metaphysical claim about the mind. You know, this is not I'm not saying the mind isn't what the brain is doing. I'm not saying that You're recognizing the consciousness that gave birth to the universe, and I'm not not making any broad claims about metaphysics.[3:02:14] Dr. Sam Harris: I'm just talking about as a matter of experience. There is just this condition in which everything is appearing. Right? And what you're calling your body, again, as a matter of experience, I'm not saying that we can't have 3rd person conversations about, you know, physical bodies in the physical world. But as a matter of experience, the only body you're ever going to Directly encounter as your own is an appearance in consciousness.[3:02:40] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So consciousness is not in your body. What you're calling your body is in consciousness. You know, visually, proprioceptively, it's like everything is just appearing in this condition. And, Again, you're not aiming that you're not this is not a spotlight that you're aiming at the body or at you know?[3:02:59] Dr. Sam Harris: There's just This condition in which everything, including anything you could call yourself, is appearing. And, So yeah. So that's the 2nd step function is to recognize that this is all this is already true. Consciousness is already without this thing you've been calling your ego hoping and, you know, hoping to to unravel it through meditation. Consciousness is not gonna get any more selfless, any more centerless, any freer than it all always already is Recognized as such.[3:03:34] Dr. Sam Harris: And and so that's that's the the the the step function at that point is Your mindfulness at that point, the thing you come back to when you're no longer distracted is that that recognition again and again, and then it becomes, Yeah. It becomes compatible with anything you would do. And so to answer your question, yes, I I still practice, you know, formally, You know, sometimes, you know, for you know, frequently, but not you know, I I definitely miss days, and I don't do it for I mean, I, you know, I I don't rule out the The possibility that I will go back on retreat at various times just to, you know, check-in with that and see if if that makes a difference. But, You know, I, you know, I tend to sit for, I mean, I tend to I've I've designed my life So that I can spend a lot of time meditating without having to be formally meditating. Like, so, you know, You know, I'll go for a hike for 2 hours.[3:04:29] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And what I'm doing when I'm hiking is identical to what I'm doing when I'm, quote, meditating, you know, sitting in a chair, you know, doing nothing but meditate. So it's yeah. I mean, I just again, the I'm very, I'm very interested in erasing the boundary between what people are calling meditation and and the rest of life. And that and so that's in in in teaching these things, I tend to emphasize that from the beginning because I I think it's it's very easy to set up To to to get to get gold by a bunch of assumptions that that cause you to be very Split in your sense of what your life is about.[3:05:13] Dr. Sam Harris: And, like, I'm I'm sort of banking my meditation over here because I'm I'm meditating 2 hours a day diligently, and, know, this is gonna be really good for me. And then over here is the rest of my life, which is not nearly as wise or as useful or is, like, this is the stuff that is still the area of my problems. And I think it's useful to recognize you've got one You've got 1 life, you know, and you've got this this this single condition of consciousness and its contents in every mode of life, and There's something to recognize about it, and you're always free to recognize that. And, you know, you truly even in your dreams. Right?[3:05:52] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, it's just not this it never stops. So That's that's what I tend to emphasize.[3:05:58] Andrew Huberman: So earlier, you told us that meditation is not about changing the content of conscious experience. And in a different podcast that you were on, I heard you say something to the effect of that normally we are in our daily And unless we are trained in meditation, unless we dissolve this illusion of the Gap between, actor and self and observer that we require certain sensory events to create collisions within us and with the natural world that sort of, you know, blast us into a different mode of being. I wanna use that as a way to frame up this idea that some things, such as psychedelics, but also A very long hike, a very long fast, you know, who knows, a a banquet. You know, different types of life experiences Do exactly the opposite of what you're describing meditation does, which is that they actively change the content of our conscious experience. So much so that we often remember those for the rest of our lives.[3:07:06] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[3:07:08] Andrew Huberman: Could you tell us why psychedelics Can be useful. And here, I'll give the caveats that maybe you'll feel, obligated to give as well, but this we're talking about use safely and responsibly, Age appropriate, context appropriate, ideally, with some clinical or other type of guidance, legality issues obeyed, etcetera. All that stated, you know, psychedelics to me are an experience of, altered perception, internal and external perception, Altered space time relationship, somewhat dreamlike. I think it was Alan Hobson at Harvard for a long time talking about the relationship between psychedelic like states and dreamlike states, because of this distortion of space time dimensionality. And I haven't Experimented with them much.[3:07:57] Andrew Huberman: I've been part of a clinical trial, 3 doses of MDMA, which certainly altered my the the quality of my conscious experience in ways that led to a lot of lasting and, at least for me, valuable learning.[3:08:08] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah.[3:08:09] Andrew Huberman: So what are your what are your thoughts about psychedelics in terms how they intersect with the discussion that we've been having, and, what utility do they play in recognition of the self or in other sorts brain changes.[3:08:23] Dr. Sam Harris: Well so, yeah. K. Let's just price in all those caveats that people can anticipate. These drugs are not without their risks, and it's it's one problem is that we have this single term drugs or psychedelics, which names many different types of substances, and they're not all the same, and they're not so, like, MDMA is not even technically a psychedelic. I think it has an immense Therapeutic value, and it actually was my gateway drug to the this this whole area of concern.[3:08:55] Andrew Huberman: Amphetamine pathogen. Right? It's a sort of an Methamine and a pathogen[3:08:59] Dr. Sam Harris: at the same time. Yeah. I mean, it's often called Empathogens. Yeah. An empathogen.[3:09:03] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[3:09:03] Andrew Huberman: Not pathogen. Yeah. No. Pathogen. Yeah.[3:09:05] Dr. Sam Harris: Empathogen or an entactogen, it's it's been called, but it doesn't tend to change perception in the way that classic psychedelics do. And it's it's it's also serotonergic, but it's it's not, it has to be in in some part differently so than me. Even LSD and and psilocybin, which are much more similar in in classic psychedelics, both are also serotonergic, but they're not merely so and they're they're also different. And the and the higher dose you take of these drugs, the more you at at lower doses, everything can kinda seem the same. At higher doses, they, you know, they they They begin to diverge.[3:09:45] Dr. Sam Harris: And we can talk about the the, pharmacology if you wanted to. But The, I would just say that for many of us, I mean, certainly for me, psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning In proving to me that this was, the the the the first person interrogation of the mind was worth doing. Know? Because, you know, I was somebody who, you know, age 17 or 18 before I had any real experience with, With MDMA or LSD or psilocybin, if you had taught me how to meditate at that point, I think I would have just bounced off the whole project. I think my mind was I I was just I was so, Cerebral in my just my engagement with anything.[3:10:39] Dr. Sam Harris: I was so skeptical of Any of the the spiritual the religious and spiritual traditions that that have given us most of our meditation talk, you know, That I think I just would have, and I know many of these people. Like, I you know, I have I have tried to teach, you know, Richard Dawkins to meditate and Daniel Dennett to meditate. I've ambushed them with meditation and, you know, both both in a group setting and and 1 on 1. Not not not Dan, but, but Richard. I I I ambushed on my own podcast with a guided meditation.[3:11:12] Dr. Sam Harris: And He just you know, from his he, you know, he closes his eyes, he looks inside, and There's nothing of interest to see. Right? Like, it's just it's like it's not he doesn't have the the, The conceptual interest in him that would that would cause him to to persist long enough to find out that there's a there there. Right? Now This is not a problem with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.[3:11:42] Dr. Sam Harris: And I know that if I gave him a 100 micrograms of LSD or Five grams of of mushrooms or, you know, 20, you know, 25 milligrams of psilocybin. That's probably not the analogous dosage to the 5 grams of mushrooms. Five grams of mushrooms would be more than that. I forget what it is of, of MDMA. Maybe a 120 milligrams of I[3:12:06] Andrew Huberman: think the MAPS doses, which is the one that's under clinical is a 125 milligrams with a option of a 75 milligram booster.[3:12:13] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. Right.[3:12:14] Andrew Huberman: Funny. I will remember that.[3:12:15] Dr. Sam Harris: Yes. It was strange. The facts that come to to hand.[3:12:18] Andrew Huberman: Exactly.[3:12:20] Dr. Sam Harris: But, there's not there's just no possibility that nothing's gonna happen right now. Something with with a psychedelic with with MDMA, Most people tend to have, certainly under any kind of guidance, tend to have a very, positive, you know, prosocial experience. But, You know, with a psychedelic, you might have a a a, a somewhat, you know, Terrifying experience if you have, well, quote, a bad trip. You know? If you and I've certainly had those experiences on on LSD and and to some degree on psilocybin.[3:12:55] Dr. Sam Harris: But, The prospect that nothing is gonna happen is just in, you know, a 1000000 you know, nearly a 1000000 cases out of a 1000000, just not in the cards. I mean, Just neurophysiologically, something's gonna happen with the requisite dose of of, of one of these drugs. And if if that thing that happens is is psychologically at all normative and, you know, pleasant and interesting and valuable, which it is so much of the time and certainly under the appropriate, You know, set and setting and and guidance, it can be, you know, a lot of the time for, you know, virtually everybody. Again, there are caveats. If you're if you're prone, if you think you have, you know, proclivity for schizophrenia or, you know, bipolar disorder, this is Almost certainly not for you, you know, and anyone doing a with the the the studies at, like, Johns Hopkins for for, the therapeutic effects of Of any of these drugs, they're they're ruling out people with, you know, first degree relatives with with any of these clinical conditions.[3:14:04] Dr. Sam Harris: But so for somebody like me at 18 who didn't know that this was an area of of not only interest, but would it be the, you know, the the center of gravity for the rest of his life if only he could pay attention Clearly enough to see that it could be. Right? I was someone who very likely again, I don't know. I don't have the counterfactual in hand. I don't know what would happened if if someone had, you know, forced me to meditate for an hour at that point.[3:14:35] Dr. Sam Harris: But I know I wasn't interested in it Until I took MDMA, I know I wasn't having these kinds of experiences spontaneously That get that showed me that there was an inner landscape that was worth exploring. I was a very hardheaded skeptic who was very interested in lots of things, but there was no alternative to me just thinking more about those things. Right. I mean, the idea that there's some other way of grasping cognitively at the interesting parts of the world Beyond thinking about the world. Right?[3:15:13] Dr. Sam Harris: I just that that just wouldn't have computed for me at all. Right? And if you had So I just I and I literally had I had no one ever gave me a book to read or and never had I I don't if you the noun meditation Very likely meant absolutely nothing to me before before I, took my 1st dose of, in that in this case, it was MDMA. So what the drug experience did for me is it just proved I I mean, so the the the limb one of the limitations of a drug is that, you know, obviously, no matter how good the experience, the drug wears off, and then you're back To you know, more in more or less your usual form, and now you have a memory of the experience. And it can be a fairly dim memory.[3:15:58] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, some of these Experiences are so discontinuous with normal waking consciousness that it can be like trying to remember a dream, you know, that just Disappear it degrades, you know, over the course of seconds, and then it could have been the most intense dream you've ever had. And for whatever reason, you can barely get a purchase on, You know, what it was about. And, you know, there's some psychedelic experiences that are analogous to that. But For most people, most of the time, there's a residue of this experience. And with something like MDMA, they can be quite, quite vivid, Where you recognize okay.[3:16:34] Dr. Sam Harris: There there was a way of being that is quite different than what I'm tending to access by default, And it is different in in ways that are just, You know, obviously better and and and psychologically more healthy. I mean, it's it's possible to be healthy psychologically in a way that I I never imagined. Right? And then then when you then when you link it up to the Traditional literature around any of this stuff, again, so much of it is shot through with with superstition and other worldliness of of religion. And, you know, as as you No.[3:17:16] Dr. Sam Harris: And I think your listen listeners probably know I've spent a lot of time criticizing all that, but there is a baby in the bathwater to all of that. Right? So I guess it's not that somebody like Jesus or the Buddha or any of the matriarchs and patriarchs of world's religions, it's not that they are were all conscious frauds or, you know, temporal lobe epileptics Or, like, there's there's a there's a pathological lens that you can put on on top of all that. But once you have one of these experiences On psychedelics or on a drug like MDMA, you know that there's a there there. You know that unconditional love is is a possibility.[3:17:56] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? You know that that, Feeling truly one with nature. Right? I mean, just so one with nature that you're you could spend 10 hours in front of a tree and find that to be the most rewarding experience of your of your life. Right?[3:18:13] Dr. Sam Harris: That's a possible state of consciousness. Now it may it may not be the state of consciousness Since you want all the time, you know, you don't wanna be the crazy guy by the tree, you know, who can't have a conversation about anything else. But, once you have one of these experiences, you recognize, okay, there's there's some reason why I'm not having the beatific vision right now and I can't even figure out how to aim my attention so as to have anything like it. And that's a problem. Right?[3:18:42] Dr. Sam Harris: Because it's It's available. Right? And it's it's the best you know, it it is among the best things that has ever happened to me. Right? And now I'm can only dimly remember what that was like.[3:18:54] Dr. Sam Harris: So how do I get back there on some level? And that's so that invites, again, a logic of changes, A logic of seeking changes in the contents of consciousness, which sets someone up for this this Protracted or seemingly protracted and and, you know, fairly frustrating search to, you know, game their nervous system So as to have those kinds of experiences more and more. And, again, it's not that that's in principle fruitless, But it is from the point of view of the kind of the core insight of, you know, the the core wisdom of, you know, what I would take from A tradition like Buddhism, which is not you know, it's not the only tradition that has given voice to this, but it's I I would argue it's given it voice to it the most in the most articulate way. Again, leaving aside any of the superstition and and otherworldliness and miracles that, you you know, we don't have to talk about at the moment. And you certainly don't need to endorse in order to be interested in this stuff.[3:20:00] Dr. Sam Harris: And so that's The the the bifurcation between the all of the utility of psychedelics and what I'm talking about Under the rubric of meditation is at this point of, okay, once you realize there's a there there, what do you do, and what's the logic by which you're Led to do it. And it's possible like, if if your only framework is the good experiences, the good feels you had on on Whatever drug it was and a a further discussion of of, like, what that path of changes, You know, can look like and that can become in a religious context. It can come in just a purely psychedelic context or or, you know, some combination of the 2. I think you can be misled to, you can just be you can be misled to just seek Lots of peak experiences. You're just trying to string together a lot of peak experiences hoping they're gonna change you, every one of which by by definition is going to be impermanent.[3:21:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. I mean, it's it's it's first, it wasn't there, then it's there, and then it's no longer there. And then you've got a memory of it. Right? The what I think it's what everyone really wants whether they know it or not and their right to want is A type of freedom that is compatible with even ordinary states of consciousness, which which can ride along with them into extraordinary states consciousness.[3:21:28] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, so what I I hadn't done psychedelics for 25 years because I met again, they were super useful for me in the beginning, Then I discovered meditation on the basis of of those experiences, got really into meditation and realized, okay, this is a much more, This really is the you know, conceptually, this makes much more sense to me. This is delivering the goods, you know, in terms of my experience. There's no need to keep having these you know, seeking these peak experiences with with with drugs, but it had been, you know, 25 years Since I had done that and and there was this resurgence in research on psychedelics, and I was being asked about psychedelics, and I was talking about their utility for me, but, again, these were distant memories. And so And there was also one type of psychedelic experience I was I was aware that I had never had. I had never done a high dose of mushrooms, blindfolded.[3:22:22] Dr. Sam Harris: You know? Like, every every mushroom trip I'd ever had, I'd been out in nature and interacting with you know you know, it's it's just been a very Transformed sensory experience of the world and of other people, but I'd never done it alone, blindfolded, just Purely, you know, inwardly directed and at a a high dosage. I'd done high doses of LSD, but, but not, mushrooms. So I did that, you know, and it was very useful. And I I I spoke about it on my podcast.[3:22:52] Dr. Sam Harris: There's I I think if you search, Sam Harris mushroom trip on YouTube, you get the the the 19 minute version of that, you know, of my describing that trip. It was incredibly useful and but what was what was doubly useful was my mindfulness training in the context of that Explosion of synesthesia. I mean, it was it was it was such an overwhelmingly strong experience, And there were so many moments where it could have gone one way or the other based on my Sense of just okay. I'm gonna try to resist this. You know?[3:23:29] Dr. Sam Harris: It was like it was it was it was, in truth, irresistible because it was just so much. But, There were moments where I was aware of, okay, this is, like, letting go of self, you know, in this context is is the thing that is going to, you know, make the difference between heaven and hell here. You know? And because there's there are experiences that are so extreme that you can't even tell if it's agony or ecstasy. It's just it's just it's Everything has turned up to 11.[3:24:01] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And it and the difference between the 2 is like, you know, the tipping point is just it's not it really is kind of High Wire Act in some sense. You know? You could just fall to one side or the other. And, yeah.[3:24:14] Dr. Sam Harris: So what I think people want is, they certainly wanna be able to extract from the psychedelic experience Wisdom that is applicable to ordinary states of consciousness. It's like, what is the thing you can realize in a moment of having a conversation with your child That isn't distracting you from that relationship. It's not a memory of when the world dissolved or, you know, when you were indistinguishable from the sky, But it's just a way of pay a way of be having free attention and unconditional love in this, you know, Totally ordinary and potentially chaotic human experience, you know, which can be psychologically fraught, and You can meet, you know, iterations of yourself that you don't like that are that are not equipping you to be the best possible person in that relationship. And What we wanna do is cut through all of that and actually, you know, be in love with our lives and with the people in our lives More and more of the time. Yeah.[3:25:22] Dr. Sam Harris: And, that's pie there's I'm not saying that's the psych you know, that Repeated psychedelic journeys aren't can't be integral to that project, but but you know that it can't that the project can't be Being high all the time. Right? So whatever is extractable from that the the the occasional, you know, psychedelic trip has got to be mappable into ordinary waking consciousness. And the point of con the real point of contact does kinda run through this, know, what I've been calling the illusion of the self. And, again, it is that part is discoverable without any changes in contents.[3:26:02] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? So you don't have to suddenly feel the energy of your body be rushed out and be continuous with the, You know, the ocean of energy that is not your body. Right? Like, that's an experience that's there to be had. Right?[3:26:14] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, there's there's no doubt. But this, The truth is, I mean, just looking at this cup is just as formless and as mysterious as that, Right? When it's seen in the right way, and that's and that's that's what, you know, meditation encourages to, you know, one to recognize.[3:26:36] Andrew Huberman: I share the experience that MDMA, significantly altered my perception of What's possible in terms of an emotional stance towards self and others[3:26:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[3:26:48] Andrew Huberman: Including animals. Right? Something that runs very deep for me and that I'd kind of actively suppressing in anticipation of having me put my dog down, but also, you know, I'm not, I don't know how to frame it except to say, you know, my lab animal research for years, and I was always very conflicted about it. Yeah. Because I love animals, and yet I wanted to understand the brain, and we need to Work on animal brains and[3:27:10] Dr. Sam Harris: What were rodents or or what?[3:27:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'll be very direct about this. My lab I've worked on many species. I've worked on, mice and rats, I've worked on admittedly, I've worked on I'd done some cat experiments. I've worked on, large nonhuman primates, including macaques.[3:27:28] Andrew Huberman: I no longer work on any of those species. I've worked on cuttlefish cephalopods. Yeah. Yeah. A discussion for another time.[3:27:36] Andrew Huberman: Brilliant little Amazing. Creatures maybe maybe as smart as us or who knows? Maybe smarter. And now I work on humans Because I couldn't reconcile the challenge inside me, which was my love of animals and working on them. I just couldn't do it any longer.[3:27:53] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[3:27:53] Andrew Huberman: I'm sorry. And and MDMA didn't Set that transition. That transition actually had been set a lot earlier. You know, it's something I really grappled with. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was always in the back of my mind.[3:28:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[3:28:05] Andrew Huberman: In any event, I hope what we discovered was, was worthwhile, but this is a that's a bigger debate.[3:28:10] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. Yeah. And I[3:28:11] Andrew Huberman: have strong feelings about this, and maybe it's a topic for an Another podcast. But I'm very happy that now I work on humans, and they can tell me if they wanna be part of the experiment or not. And I and I Trust them, and I trust their answers. I think that MDMA, in its role as an empathogen, I think really did set they don't I felt that they didn't hit me square in the face. I just could The feeling behind the conflict made itself evident, and what to do about it made itself evident.[3:28:45] Andrew Huberman: So I suppose MDMA did, It did assist the transition to purely human research as opposed to, animal research. The other thing that I noticed it did is it, it made it not Scary to confront things that were scary to confront in my conscious life. And I could think about things in my conscious life, but it made you know, it brought them close in a way that I could get closer and closer to the flame and then gain some understanding. I've I've still Amazed at how answers arrive both during the session and then the weeks months that follow. If one puts the attention to it, I think that's why it's important to have a guide of some sort or to have some some pseudo structure because, otherwise, you can one can get attached to the sounds in the room and just And there's probably meaning there, but I wanted to do some deeper work.[3:29:33] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[3:29:33] Andrew Huberman: I have not had experience with psilocybin, at least not since my youth, and I don't recommend young people I regret doing LSD and psilocybin as a young person. I don't say that for politically correct reasons or liability reasons. I just think my mind was not developed. And, But I'm intrigued by something. So here's the question.[3:29:51] Andrew Huberman: How is it that psilocybin in particular and high dose psilocybin And the ego dissolution that people talk about on psilocybin, how do you think that, lines up with some of the experiences that, you've been describing for a adequate meditation practice. Yeah. Because that's something that I did not experience on MDMA. In fact, if anything, I experienced for the first time what, really feeling like a a isolated container, was and the difference And how empathy and being bounded, having in other words, good boundaries and empathy could be symbiotic. I experienced that for the first time there.[3:30:26] Andrew Huberman: And I I do think that there is learning inside of these states that translates into everyday life when one is not on these states. And the last thing I'll say is, no. I don't feel the, The impulse to go and do 20 more MDMA sessions. I think that the 3 as part of this study, were, very effective for me. And, you know, as they say, if you hear the calling again, you you might do it.[3:30:47] Andrew Huberman: But I'm very curious about psilocybin in particular And this notion of ego dissolution because we've been talking about the self.[3:30:54] Dr. Sam Harris: Well, so so there are different ways in which The sense of self can be eroded or expanded or I mean, there's lots of experiences that can still have a kind of center to them, but be, you know, very novel and and transformational. And one can reify those as a kind of goal state. Right? And it's sort of the there's a a concept in in Buddhism that I think is useful. It doesn't translate well To English or it can it can set up kind of, false associations in English that that are unfortunate.[3:31:32] Dr. Sam Harris: But there's a concept of emptiness in Buddhism, which, sounds, again, kind of gray and dispiriting in English, but It's, what it the the what it's it's because the cognate terms are are things like unconditioned, unconstrained, open, centerless. Right? So it's it's, There's a, and and that is so when I'm talking about nonduality, when I'm talking about the the loss of a sense of subject and then what's left, In Buddhism, they they would often describe what's left as emptiness, but it emptiness is not a something. It's not a it it's and it's, Importantly, it's not the same thing as unity. Right?[3:32:19] Dr. Sam Harris: So it's not it's not a oneness. Right? Because it's it's What's what's when the when the center drops out of experience, it's not like you are suddenly merged with the cup. Right. It's but now granted, you know, this is where psilocybin or other psychedelics Can give a false impression of of, I think, what the goal is.[3:32:44] Dr. Sam Harris: You can have kind seeming merging you can have unity experiences on psychedelics, Which can be quite powerful, especially with nature with other people and with nature where you can just feel like, you know, the the the energy of your body becomes, incredibly vivid and powerful. It's just like like you're just you know, everything is just, you know, buzzing with, you know, life energy. And then when you, you know, touch another person's hand or you touch a tree, There can be this sort of continuity of energy, which can be this overwhelming experience of, and, again, this is a a a Just a 20 megaton change in the contents of consciousness. Right? This is like this is a nonordinary state of consciousness, but, like, this is this is a Give some indication of what of how this happens.[3:33:38] Dr. Sam Harris: When I back in the day when I was, in my Twenties and I was experimenting with with, this was LSD, but, some friends and I decided we had this brilliant idea. We would we would camp above Muir Woods And then take some some LSD at dawn and then walk down, you know, like a mile, I think, from the campsite into the into the actual proper Grove of trees and and, you know, commune with the giant redwoods, the tallest trees on earth. And so we drop the acid at dawn and we start walking, but the Acid came on, you know, almost immediately, and we didn't get I mean, we got nowhere near the woods, and we got stopped by a tree that was just like an ordinary, you know, 20 foot oak tree, Like, the most boring tree in the world, and that tree absorbed, like, the nest next 6 hours of our of our conscious attention because it was just, you know, it was the tree of life. I it was just like, could you there could be no better tree. So these we're talking about nonordinary states of consciousness wherein A a merging with life and with with the world is possible.[3:34:39] Dr. Sam Harris: And that is a so I'm not I'm not saying that kind of experience isn't Possible, but there's a sort of, expanded self reification. It it is a it is a kind of ego dissolution, But there's a there's a kind of egoity that sort of goes along for the ride as well or can go along for the ride. And The real insight into emptiness, the real sort of centerless, you know, center of the bull's eye is a recognition that that In some ways, equalizes all experiences. I mean, again, it's it's it's just as available now in the this ordinary, You know, podcasting experience as it is when you're merging hands on with a an oak tree And, you know, on, you know, 400 micrograms of acid, and this is, you know, the this is the whole universe. And so it's it's it's the it's the equality of those 2 experiences that that that this concept of emptiness captures, which a con concept of oneness doesn't quite capture because oneness is really this this peak experience of being dragged out of your, You know, your somethingness into a much bigger somethingness.[3:35:55] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Emptiness is just no center. Right? And then everything is in its own place. Right?[3:36:01] Dr. Sam Harris: There's still sights and sounds and sensations and thoughts and feelings, but there's just there's no there's no center and there's no Clinging to anything. There's no clinging to identity. There's no clinging to the good stuff. There's no There's no resistance to the bad stuff. There's no this is so pleasant and unpleasant, gets sort of strangely equalized, and There's this very it's it's it's very expansive, and it and most importantly, it doesn't block anything.[3:36:29] Dr. Sam Harris: So, yeah, if if for whatever reason, if your nervous system is set up To have the, oh my god. I'm now merging with the tree experience. That's a that's possible from the state of no center. Right. And then and and on my, you know, that my recent I mean, now not so recent.[3:36:46] Dr. Sam Harris: 3 years ago, it was right before COVID. But my last, you know, Big psychedelic experience. You know, there was I was very much experiencing that, whereas, you know, insofar as I you know, You know, at the peak, there was no me to remember any of any of this stuff. But, you know, insofar as I could experiment with, Is this really different from anything else? You know, there is a kind of equalizing to the the emptiness recognition even in the in the presence of A completely transformed neurophysiology.[3:37:22] Dr. Sam Harris: And and so that's, again, there's there's a point of contact. I mean, the The real point of contact between psychedelics and meditation for me is but for my experiences on psychedelics, there's I don't think there's just no way I would have had the free attention to be interested in in the in the project at all. And there are other aspects to the project. It's not just Having this insight into selflessness, it's it's all of the ethical ramifications of that. It's just like, what kind of person do you want to be?[3:37:52] Dr. Sam Harris: What are your values? What's What what is a good life altogether when you are talking about relationships and, You know, political engagement and the changes you can make in the world or not make or I mean, it's it's just you know, what kind of person do you wanna be? There's there's There's a much larger consideration. And, I mean, as you discovered, you know, an experience on MDMA can, really, you both both expand your model of what is possible and what is desirable, what is normative. I mean, just kind of, you know, what kind of self do you wanna be in the world?[3:38:28] Dr. Sam Harris: And, it can also help you cut through things that are inhibiting. You you're actualizing any of those possibilities in ordinary waking consciousness.[3:38:40] Andrew Huberman: I've certainly found that to be the case. I mean, You raise a really important point, which is that, once these learnings take place, these understandings take place inside of psychedelic journeys, and, I do believe they translate to neuroplasticity. I do wanna Yeah. Highlight the point for people. Oftentimes, people say, oh, you know, This, mushroom or this, psychedelic, it opens plasticity, but, of course, plasticity has to be directed someplace.[3:39:08] Andrew Huberman: Plasticity is just a process Like like walking or anything else, underlying neural process. And I I think, it's impossible for me to understand what compartments of my life have been impacted by, these 3 MDMA sessions, but I, in some ways, I wonder whether or not not just the transition away from animal research, but also a, A deeper realization of the love for learning and sharing information. You know, I won't go so far as to say this podcast is happening because of that particular session. But these things, they splay out into multiple domains of the self. And I do think that, the Key features that feel most important to me to mention are that, it really identified, True loves, things that I truly love and made me less less cautious about feeling How intense those loves really are, and then also, lower the inhibition point of exploring, like, well, what that what would that mean?[3:40:08] Andrew Huberman: Right? You know, and the one of the reasons I bring this up and why I think it's so important that you mentioned, you know, some issues around politics and ethics and many things have splayed out from your Exploration of psychedelics meditation, neuroscience, philosophy, you know, all the things that are you and, of course, that's only a subset, is that So much of what I hear and see so much of what I hear and see in the kind of self help space Contradicts itself and leads back to the the origin without a lot of, progress. And and for instance, we hear, you know, absence makes the heart Fonder, but then out of sight, out of mind. You hear about radical acceptance, but then what if it's radical acceptance of nonexemptance? Right?[3:40:52] Andrew Huberman: I mean, there are some experiences in people for which I radically accept the fact that I want nothing to do with them. Yeah. And does that some am I supposed to transcend that? So these are the questions I think that Keep a lot of people from exploring things like meditation because they feel like, well, is the idea to just be okay with everything? Is radical acceptance just like Right.[3:41:12] Andrew Huberman: Will just, you know, bulldoze me with with with things even if they're you know, and my goal is to somehow, surpassed the idea that they're harmful. And I don't think that's actually the way any of this stuff is supposed to work, although I don't claim to be the authority on it either. I, you know, I think notions of radical acceptance and, radical honesty and and any number of different sayings that one can find out there are Really, the the most salient beacons and guides that most people have in order to try and navigate tough areas in their life, including the relationship to self, but others and Political orientations. And so I feel like almost all those things can be used to anchor down in a stance that may or may not be informed or To open up to ideas. And so I think that none of this can really be solved in a single practice, it sounds like.[3:42:02] Andrew Huberman: But it does seem to me, Based on what you've told us today is that only through a, a deep understanding of the self as it really is as opposed to this illusion that you framed up. Could we actually arrive at some answers about, like, what's actually right for each and every one of us?[3:42:21] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. I mean, there's 1 generic Answer that I think can be extracted both from the psychedelics and from meditation And just from just thinking more clearly about the nature of of our lives, and it's it's to become more Process oriented and to and to be more and more sensitive to the the the the Mirage like character of of achieving our goals. Right now, I'm not I'm not against achieving goals. I have a lot of goals. I've you know, I'm I'm, you know, I'm very busy.[3:42:54] Dr. Sam Harris: There are lots of things I wanna get done, and and I, you know, I I'm I'm as satisfied as anyone to finish a project and but If you look at the time course of all of that, you know, fulfillment and you you you you just you there are few lessons that everyone, I think, has to draw. One is Most of your life is spent in the process. Right? Like, the goal like, the moment at which the goal is, you know, fully conquered, That is just I mean, that has a, you know, it's a tiny duration, and it it has a very short half life. And your it it the moment you you arrive at it, it begins to recede seed because in the meantime, you have all these other goals that are have appeared on the horizon.[3:43:39] Dr. Sam Harris: You've got people asking what you're gonna do next. And you you in some sense, if you're if you're focused on goals, you really you can never arrive. Right? And I think what we're what we're looking we're we're all looking for in life, you know, whether we're ever thinking about taking psychedelics or or practicing something like meditation, we're looking for good enough reasons to let our attention Fully rest in the present. Right?[3:44:12] Dr. Sam Harris: Now, like so I mean, that that is the logic of success. Like, the the scent the scent like, I've got all these things I wanna do. If I could just get rich enough or fit enough or, you know, dial in my sleep well enough or, you know, improve my life in all these ways, get the right relationship, it be great to be married? Or may you know, I I wanna start a family. I want all of these these things.[3:44:33] Dr. Sam Harris: Why do I want these things? Right. I want these things because I'm telling my this isn't it's not that all of those things are wonderful. Right? So I'm not I'm not discounting those relative forms of happiness or sources of happiness because it's all completely valid to it's it's completely valid to want those things.[3:44:49] Dr. Sam Harris: But in the press it's for one thing is Absolutely clear. It's possible to be miserable in the presence of all of those things. Right? It's and you can add you can add great wealth and fame and everything on top of it's impossible it's possible to be absolutely miserable having everything any anyone could seemingly want. Right?[3:45:09] Dr. Sam Harris: You just have to open a newspaper just to see people living out that predicament. Right? You know, spectacularly wealthy, famous, healthy, Successful people who could do anything they want in their in life apparently, and yet they're doing this thing that is completely dysfunctional and making them needlessly miserable. I won't name names.[3:45:27] Andrew Huberman: There's enough of them now.[3:45:28] Dr. Sam Harris: Some people come to mind at the moment. So So there is a there is a a a clear dissociation between having everything and happiness. That's possible. It's also possible to have very little, you know, and almost nothing and to be quite happy. I mean, you might not have met these people, but, you know, I have met people who have Spent, you know, 10 years alone in a cave.[3:45:54] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? You know? And they come out of that cave not floridly neurotic or Psychotic. They come out of that cave beaming with compassion and joy. And, I mean, that's like they've been taking MDMA for 10 years, essentially, and they come out of the cave.[3:46:06] Dr. Sam Harris: And Now now they're gonna talk about it. Right? So and I'm not necessarily recommending that project to anyone, but I'm just saying that is that is a psychological possibility. So you have a double dissociation here whether you can have everything and be miserable. You can have nothing and be beaming with with happiness.[3:46:23] Dr. Sam Harris: So what is it that we actually want in all of our seeking to arrange the props in our lives and our and our And the story to have a a a convincing enough story to tell about ourselves that we're doing the right thing. What are what is all of that Effort predicated on is predicated on this desire, and this expectation that if we could get all of this Stuff in the right place and not have anything terrifying to worry about. Right? Everyone we love is healthy for the moment. Right?[3:46:56] Dr. Sam Harris: And we're healthy. And that's you we've got something to look forward to on the weekend, and there's not some there's not a a, you know, plumbing leak in the house that we have to immediately respond to. And We like our house, and, you know, our career is going fine. And there's something good to watch on Netflix, and we have all of it. Right?[3:47:14] Dr. Sam Harris: Now can we just actually give up the war? Right? Can we can we can we fully locate our our sense of well-being in the present moment? Is it can we relax the impulse to brood about the past or think anxiously about the future for long enough to discover that all of this here is enough. Right?[3:47:37] Dr. Sam Harris: Because our life our our life is We have this finite resource of I mean, we we absolutely have the finite resource of time. But within this the the finite resource the continuum of time, We have the even more precious resource of free attention that is that that can find Our our our our fulfillment in the present. Right? And because even if we're even if we're guarding our time to do the things that are most important to us, We can spend all of that time were regretting the past, or, you know, anxiously expecting the future And telling it to just balancing between past and future in our thinking about ourselves and our lives and basically just Dancing over the present and never making contact with it. Right?[3:48:29] Dr. Sam Harris: So what we I I think what we want is A a circumstance where attention can be located in the present in a way that's truly fulfilling. And Unless you have had some kind of radical insight that allows you to do that on demand, you are, in some sense, hostage To the circumstances of your life to do that do that for you. You're you're you're constantly trying to to engineer a state of the world that will propagate back on a state of self that will make the the present moment good enough. And what meditation does, And psychedelics to some degree does this, but meditation very directly does this. It reverses the causality and and and lets you Actually changed changed state such that you can be fulfilled before anything happens.[3:49:22] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Nothing your your happiness is no longer predicated on the next good thing happening. You can be in the presence of the next good or bad thing already being fulfilled and Already been at peace. You know? I mean, there's a there's a and I think there are misleading nouns.[3:49:40] Dr. Sam Harris: We can we can throw it at what is left there, but it is, You know, you know, tranquility, peace, freedom, lack of contraction, lack of conflict. I mean, like, all of that is a a can be more and more of a default. And all of that is also compatible with deciding, you know, yeah. Why not Get in shape. Why not engage this project?[3:50:02] Dr. Sam Harris: Why not, you know, change your career? I mean, it's not it's not that you need to be somebody who who accept I mean, to to your point, you can notice all of these nonoptimal things because no matter how much you meditate, You know, you're you're very, like, very likely going to spend a lot of your time still lost in thought, still identified with it and still wanting still caring about the difference between dysfunction and and normativity in your life. Right. And it's the question is, what can you what can you locate when The question is really it's like, how much can you puncture that seeking happiness project With the recognition that you're already free. Right?[3:50:50] Dr. Sam Harris: That that mean that that is that's what that's what meditation makes possible. You can keep just A 1000 times a day, letting some daylight into this search space. And so it it but it is still compatible. Like, you can I mean, working out is a great frame in which to look at this because, I mean, in in working out, when you when you when you really work out, you know, I'm thinking, you know, mostly I mean, it's really it's anything, but it's, you know, resistance training or Cardio or something like jujitsu, you you're you're you're intentionally putting yourself in classically unpleasant Circumstances physiologically? I mean, so if you if you were you know, if you imagine what it's like to do anything to failure.[3:51:34] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Well, if you just check-in on what the on what that is like at at the level of sensation, I mean, that is is is basically a medic it feels like a medical emergency. I'm like, that if you were having that experience for some other reason, like, if you woke up in the middle of the night and felt what it feels like to be dead lifting, you know, on your 10th Rep on a set where you're gonna you know, you're you would fail at 11. Right? Like, that is just you know, that's an emergency.[3:52:02] Dr. Sam Harris: But because you understand what you're doing in the gym and you've sought it out and, like, it's actually it's actually something you like doing. Right? And you can you can get a a real Dopamine, you know, hit from from doing it. That What what you're doing when you're doing that is you're you're owning a kind of a like, you're you're actually Transforming a a classically negative experience into something that's almost intrinsically positive. Right.[3:52:34] Dr. Sam Harris: Certainly, the net on it is positive. You can do that and and and being able to do that is more and more The experience of being actually at peace even while exerting really intense effort in in one direction. So you can be straining and I'm sure physiologically showing a lot of stress. I mean, I'm sure that, you know, Cortisol is up and, like, you know, you know, blood pressure's up. Heart rate is certainly up.[3:53:05] Dr. Sam Harris: So it's like it's it's As far as the body is concerned, it's stress as far as the eye can see, but you really can be deeply equanimous and at peace Because, again, because of the frame around it, because of the concepts attached to it, because you know what you're doing, you know why it's happening, and you want it, You said that that that's an attitude you can bring into other stressful things that take effort to accomplish. And so it's not it's not that you just need to be a pushover When you learn how to meditate or when you take MDMA or you do any you you work on yourself in any of these ways. But, What I think you I think you want to find is you want to find your point of rest in the midst of of any struggle.[3:53:49] Andrew Huberman: I would say that the certainly MDMA, but and, again, I have less experience with meditation, and, but They really, I think, put us ultimately in positions of what can only refer to as real strength. He's gonna make what before seemed like impossible decisions or even, concepts or emotional states to even think about for any period of time without deliberately distracting or avoiding in some other way and be able to lean into those with with open eyes. And I think that's, to me, that's my definition of strength. I don't know what other people consider, but[3:54:22] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[3:54:23] Andrew Huberman: There's there's definitely something real there in each case. This may seem like a divergence, but I and many other people are very curious about a recent decision that you made, which was to close your account on Twitter. You still have an Instagram account, I noticed. Yeah. But Although[3:54:47] Dr. Sam Harris: I never I mean, my team manages that. I've never[3:54:50] Andrew Huberman: It's a lot friendlier over at Instagram. I've been there a lot longer.[3:54:52] Dr. Sam Harris: Even see it seen it. So[3:54:54] Andrew Huberman: Oh, it's pretty good, actually, considering imagine what would happen if you did, do Paycheck. They do they're doing a good job with it. But your decision to close your account on Twitter, I think grabbed a lot of eyes and ears, and, there's a lot of questions about why it was a very large account. You know? It correlated with a number of things that for the outsider, people might be wondering about, you know, New leadership, new, you know, people who had been booted off, brought back on, or at least invited back on[3:55:24] Dr. Sam Harris: Right.[3:55:24] Andrew Huberman: And so on. You are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior to me, or anybody else, for that matter. But I'm curious If you might share with us, what the motivation was, for taking the account down and and, how you feel in the absence of of, I mean, mean, your thumbs presumably are are freed up to do other things.[3:55:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. I I was getting, like, an arthritic right thumb, I think, and then and I think it[3:55:52] Andrew Huberman: If if you don't mind sharing, I think there's a there's a lot of curiosity about you and your your routines. You've been very generous in sharing that, your knowledge, and but also kinda like what what makes what makes you tick, what motivates, pretty big decisions like that. It wasn't a major platform form for you.[3:56:10] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. Yeah. So It was the it was the only social media platform I've ever engaged. I mean, like you said, we I have an Instagram. I have a Facebook account, but I I never never used those as platforms.[3:56:21] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? I'm not never on them. I never I never followed people, and I've never and all the posting has just come from just marketing, you know, from my team. But Twitter was me. I mean, I you know, for better or worse, and, I began to feel more and more for worse, and it was, it was interesting because it was very You know, I I've I've, you know, I've talked about it a lot on my podcast about just my my love hate relationship with Twitter over the years.[3:56:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Many good things came to me From Twitter. And I and I was, you know, I was following a lot of smart people, and it it had become my news feed and my first point of contact with with information each day, and I was really attached to it just for that reason, just as a consumer of of content. And then it was also a place where I was I I genuinely wanted to communicate with people and react to things and And and, you know, you know, I would see some article that I thought was great, and I would signal boost it, you know, to to my, the people following me on Twitter. And That was rewarding, and I was I I could literally help people on Twitter. Like, I mean, there was a there were you know, there are people who I've raised lots of money for on Twitter just by, you know, Signal boosting their GoFundMe's, and and, so I was engaged in a way that seemed productive, But I was always worried that it was producing needless conflict for me and was was giving me a signal in my life that I was being lured into responding to and taken seriously That was out of proportion to its its representation of any opinion or set of opinions that I I should be taking seriously.[3:58:05] Dr. Sam Harris: I was noticing that that, and, again, this evolved over years. I mean, this this long before long, long Predated, recent changes to to Twitter. But I was noticing that many of the worst Things that had happened for me professionally were first born on Twitter. I mean, just like, you know, some some conflict I got into with somebody or something that I felt like I needed to podcast about in response to on Twitter. It's just so much of it.[3:58:36] Dr. Sam Harris: It was it's either it's Genesis was Twitter Or it's the the, the further spin of it that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional happened on Twitter. Like, it was just Twitter was part of the story when it was got really bad. And I've I've had, you know, vacations that have gone sideways just because I got on Twitter and said something, and then I had to produce a controversy that I had to respond to. And then I had to do a podcast about that and and just and it was just, okay. This is a mess.[3:59:04] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? And so at that point, you know, I I, you know, have friends who, you know, also had big Twitter platforms who would who would say, You know, why are you, you know, why are you responding to anything on Twitter? Just tweet and ghost, you know, just due to having and this like, Joe Rogan Sat me down and tried to get get you know, give me a talking to, as did Bill Maher. And both of them engaged Twitter in that way. I mean, they I think they We never look at their ad mentions.[3:59:31] Dr. Sam Harris: They never see what's coming back at them. They just you know, they use it effectively the way I use or don't even use Instagram or Facebook. I mean, I don't even see what's going out there in in my name. And so I I could essentially do that for myself on Twitter presumably. And I did that for some periods of time, but then I would continually decide, okay.[3:59:51] Dr. Sam Harris: Now it's all balanced again. Maybe I can just communicate here because it was very Tempting for me to communicate with people because I would see somebody, you know, clearly misunderstanding something I had said on my podcast. And I think, oh, it's like, why not clarify this misunderstanding? Right? And in and my efforts to do that almost invariably produced A, this I mean, sometimes it was a kind of a meandering, Process of of discovery, but often it was just kind of a stark confrontation with what appeared to me to be just Lunacy and malevolence on a scale that I never encounter elsewhere in my life.[4:00:33] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, I never meet these people in life. Right? And yet I was meeting these people by the tens of 1,000 on Twitter. And so it what the the thing that began to worry me about it And, again, this I understand that people have the opposite experience on Twitter. I mean, depending on what you're putting out and what you're you know, the kinds of topics you're touching, You could have just nothing but love coming back at you on Twitter.[4:00:58] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? But because I'm very, Essentially, in the center politically, and because I'm I'm you know, I'm this is now on my podcast. This is not in the waking up app. I'm often criticizing the far left and criticizing the far right. I'm basically pissing off everyone some of the time.[4:01:17] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? It's very different. If you're only criticizing the left, you hate no doubt you get hate from the left, but you have all the people on the right who just reflexively and tribally are are expressing their solidarity for you. Right? And who are who are dunking on your enemies for you and, you know, when when your enemies come out of the woodwork.[4:01:40] Dr. Sam Harris: And if you're only criticizing the right, I'm sure you get a lot of pain from the right, but you've got the people on the left who are tribally identified with the left, who are who are just going to reflexively defend you. If you're in the center Criticizing the left as hard as anyone on the right ever criticize the left criticizes the left, and you're also criticizing the right As hard as anyone on the left criticizes the right, you're getting hate from both sides all the time, and no one is reflect reflexively and triply defending you because you pissed them off last time. You know, like, you might be getting hate from the left now, and the people on the right agree with you, But they can't forget the thing you said about Trump on that podcast, you know, you know, 2 podcasts ago. So they're not gonna defend you. And so what I what I basically created hell for myself on Twitter because it was, I just you know, it was just a theater of it was just Pure cacophony most of the time.[4:02:37] Dr. Sam Harris: And what I was seeing was I mean, like, there's no way there's this many psychopaths in the world, But I was seeing psychopaths everywhere. I was seeing, like, the most malicious dishonesty and, you know, Just goalpost moving and hypocrisy and and I mean, it was just I mean, some of it's trolling and some of it's real confusion and some of it is psychopathy, but it's like, It was so dark that, I worried that it was actually giving me a A very negative and sticky, view of humanity that was I mean, 1, it was you know, I I think it is inaccurate. But, 2, I I I I it was it was something I was returning to so much because, again, I was checking Twitter, you know, at least a dozen times a day, and I'm sure there were some days where I checked it a 100 times a day. I mean, it was it was, again, it was my main source of information. Was constantly reading articles and and then putting my own stuff out, that it became this kind of fun house mirror in which I was looking at the the most grotesque side of of humanity and feeling, you know, implicated in in in ways that were Important because it was just it was reputationally important or seemed to be important.[4:04:00] Dr. Sam Harris: I know a lot of these people. It's not these weren't just faceless Trolls, these are these are people with whom I have had relationships, and in some cases, friendships, who because of what, You know, largely, Trump and COVID did to our political landscape in the last, you know, half a dozen years. We're beginning to act in ways that's that that seemed, you know, starkly dishonest and and, you know, crazy making to me. So I was just noticing that I was forming a a view of people who I actually have had dinner with that was way more negative Based on their Twitter behavior, then I think would ever be justified by any way they would behave in life with me. You know?[4:04:42] Dr. Sam Harris: I mean, it's like it's never I was never gonna have a face to face encounter with any of these people that was this malicious and dishonest and Gaslighting and weird, right, as as was what was happening hourly on Twitter. Right? And so I just began to become more sensitive to what this was you know, Just the residue of all of this in my life and how and just how often the worst thing that the worst thing about me in my relationship with the people in my life, you know, they're just Talking to my wife or my kids was just the fact that I had been on Twitter at some point in the you know, previously in the in the previous hour, And there was some residue of that, you know, if you know, in my interaction with them. You know? It's like, what, you know, what are you stressed out about?[4:05:31] Dr. Sam Harris: What are you annoyed about? What are you Pissed off about, you know, what can't you get out of your head? What is the thing that you now feel like you need to spend the next week of your life focused on Because it went so sideways for you, all of that was Twitter. You know? A a little I mean, literally a 100% of that was Twitter.[4:05:50] Dr. Sam Harris: And and so, I just at one point, I it was actually on Thanksgiving Day. I just looked at this, and I just just I mean, there was very little thought went into it. I mean, literally, I mean, I you know, There was more thought in involved than you you you know, whether I wanted coffee when you asked me when I showed up here. I mean, it was just like, at a certain point, I just I just saw it, and I just I just ripped the Band Aid off and and yeah. So, and to answer your other question, it's been almost wholly positive as you might expect given The the litany of of, pain and discomfort, I just ran through.[4:06:22] Dr. Sam Harris: But, I mean, it's also it's it's it's Surprising to recognize how much of a presence it was in my life given the sense of what is now missing. I mean, it's like there there's it was There's no question there was a there's no kind of an addictive component to it. And when you see I mean, like, when I look at what Elon's doing on Twitter, forget about his ownership of it. And I mean, you know, I'm not, You know, I have got a lot to say about, you know, the choices he's making, for the platform, but just his personal use of it It's just so obviously an expression of I mean, I don't know if addiction is the, you know, clinically appropriate, term, but, you know, his dysfunctional attachment to tweet to using the platform. Forget it again.[4:07:11] Dr. Sam Harris: Forget forget about changing it and owning it. But just the just the degree to which it is pointlessly disrupting the life of one of the most productive people in any generation, I that was also instructive to me because I because I know Elon, and I I I I just you know, he's From my you know, of kind of a friend's eye view of the situation, it's so obviously not good for him that he's spending this much time on Twitter, That, I I I just brought that back to me. It's like, well, if it's not if if if this is what it's doing to Elon, and he's got all these other things he could be doing with his attention, How much of my use of Twitter is actually, you know, a good idea and, you know, optimized to my well-being and the well-being of the people around me? So, anyway, it was there was an addictive component to it, I think. And so when that got stripped off, I, you know, I I do notice that there's I mean, there's some there are times I pick up my phone, and I realize that this is like the old me picking up my phone for a for a reason that no longer exists.[4:08:19] Dr. Sam Harris: There's not that much, you know, I, you know, I have a Slack channel with my team, and I've got email, obviously, but it's like that is Not much of what I was doing with my phone really in the end. And so, like, it's just my phone is much less of a presence in my life. And and so it's It's almost wholly good, but, yeah, it's you know, there's I think there is some danger in, or some some possible danger in losing touch with certain aspects of culture, which, again, I'm not even sure. I mean, there's this Question of, you know, how much is Twitter real life and how much is it just a mass delusion? I don't know.[4:08:56] Dr. Sam Harris: But insofar as it actually matters what happens on Twitter, or insofar as I was actually getting a news diet, which I'm not gonna be able to recapitulate for myself, Or I'm just not, in fact, want to rich recapitulate for myself even if I could. If any of that matters, I haven't discovered that yet, but it's yeah. I mean, there's It was taking up an immense amount of bandwidth, and it's it's impressive. I mean, I I I think I said I I you know, it's like I amputated a A phantom limb. Right?[4:09:27] Dr. Sam Harris: Like, it was not a real limb, but it was it was a this continuous presence in my life that That, it is it's weird. It it actually relates to the concept of self in in surprising ways because I've I felt There was a part of myself that existed on Twitter, and I, you know, I I just performed a a suicide of that that self rather like that's So this is ending right now, and, you know, there's no residue. There's nothing to go back and check. There's just it's gone. I and I didn't even I didn't go back and look at my like, what's interesting to consider is that, you know, I'd been on Twitter for 12 years.[4:10:03] Dr. Sam Harris: I don't keep a journal. I mean, Twitter, What in my timeline would have been a kind of journal. I could have gone back to a specific hour and a specific day and looked at what I was paying attention to. I mean, that could have been an interesting record of just who I've been for a decade, And I and probably a pretty humbling record of who I've been for a decade, in terms of the kinds of things that captivated my attention, but I didn't even, you know, I didn't even think to go in the state you know, nostalgically just look at any of that or see if any of it was worth saving or archiving or thinking I I just just Delete. You know?[4:10:36] Dr. Sam Harris: And it was, and so my my actual sense of who I am and my engagement with With my audience, my you know, the the world of people who could potentially know me, like, what does it mean to be to have a platform? You know, where do I exist digitally? My sense of of all of that got truncated in a in a way that is much less noisy. I mean, it's amazing how much Can't get fucked up now in my life. Like, it's like with Twitter, almost anything could happen.[4:11:17] Dr. Sam Harris: Right? Like like, the next tweet was always an opportunity to massively complicate my life. There is no analogous space for me now. And, you know, so what I'm gonna say on your podcast, what I'm gonna say on my own podcast, what I'm gonna write next, that's much more, You know, deliberative and, the opportunities to take my foot out of my mouth or to reconsider All you know, whether anything any of this is worth it. Is it worth is this the hill I really wanna die on now?[4:11:49] Dr. Sam Harris: It's it's much more, can be much more considered. And, I mean, I think all of that's to the good, but even more important than that is there's not I'm not getting this continuous signal That is always inviting a response whether on Twitter or on my own podcast or, you know, anywhere else. And It's just much less noisy. I mean, life is much less noisy and and cluttered, and that's you know, that that is it definitely feels better. Yeah.[4:12:22] Dr. Sam Harris: Just, it's a 100% better.[4:12:24] Andrew Huberman: I'm happy to hear that. I know a number of people miss you there, but, You sound happy. I sense the genuine happiness in it. Several things come to mind. First of all, thank you for sharing your Your rationale there and how it went.[4:12:39] Andrew Huberman: I think for a lot of people, I think, oh, you must have, like, walked around in circles for hours talking about them. No. It was Delete as many good decisions are executed.[4:12:48] Dr. Sam Harris: Right. Yeah. You[4:12:50] Andrew Huberman: know, I'm a big fan of Cal Newport's work, deep work. In many ways, Cal's, I've never met him, but, we know each other through the the Internet space. He, is really ahead of his time with this notion of deep work and Limiting distractions. I think he's even got a book about, a world without email or something, but really extreme.[4:13:08] Dr. Sam Harris: So he had I mean, he deserves some credit because he had been Somewhat approximate cause to this. He had been on my podcast, and he had encouraged me to delete Twitter because I had been I had been sort of in the in Reaching some kind of, you know, crisis point with it, prior to that podcast. And so we've talked about it. And I had I had recorded that podcast, but hadn't released. I actually recorded the podcast the day before I wound up deleting Twitter, but hadn't yet released it.[4:13:35] Dr. Sam Harris: So in, you know, my podcast with him, you know, in the intro to it, I I then give a postmortem on my deleting it. But he was, yeah, he was one of the last people who was in my head around These issues and I I you know, it was that was not by accident. I had invited him on the podcast because I increasingly wanted to think about, you know, whether this was totally dysfunctional.[4:13:55] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm a big fan of Cal Newport. So and I I am on social media. I'm on Twitter. I had some, you know, high friction interactions there, and, I have a process for dealing with those. I tend to avoid high friction confrontations online, but, Instagram is a much friendlier place.[4:14:12] Andrew Huberman: By the way, if if you want to come over to where, like, the nice kids, like, the the cool kids actually hang out[4:14:17] Dr. Sam Harris: Strangely, strangely, I'm Looking for a substitute.[4:14:19] Andrew Huberman: Good. Okay. Well, you know. That's a I didn't I don't let me entice you over there. You do.[4:14:24] Andrew Huberman: But I think that this notion of of, really being Able to access what Cal calls deep work, what, Rick Rubin talks about, you know, being able to touch the source Of great creativity and focus and on a regular basis does require that one have certain types of, and in some cases, 0 interaction with certain platforms, that merely being on a platform and blocking people that would just won't provide, I think a lot of energy opens up. And I'm fascinated by this[4:14:57] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah.[4:14:57] Andrew Huberman: And in many ways, what you described, there's really, I think, striking parallels to what I've been talking about all along these last hours, which is that sometimes the thing that feels so, So powerful that has such a gravitational pull and that we think this is experience. This is life. This is just the way it is. Actually, it's an illusion. And when you step away from it, You realize that there's this whole other dimension of interactions that Yeah.[4:15:21] Andrew Huberman: That was available all along, but that we, for whatever reason, we're intervening in by way of our reflexive distracted behavior. So I think there's a there's a there's a poetry there.[4:15:32] Dr. Sam Harris: That was a hard case, but, Yeah. I I got religion on this point. It's, it's a good change.[4:15:39] Andrew Huberman: Well, Sam, I want to say a couple of things. First of all, Every time you talk, I learn so much, and that's, you know, in the dimensions of neuroscience, even hardcore neural circuitry type which I'm, you know, sort of my home. When you talk about philosophy or, or meditation or psychedelics And even politics, some a topic that I'm, you know, woefully undereducated in. But You have this amazing ability to to blend and and synergize across things. And I think today, what what occurs to me is that, not only is that no accident because of your training and your The rigor and the depth at which you've explored these different topics, but also your openness to it.[4:16:26] Andrew Huberman: But I think, at least for me, above all, is because I think You are able to encapsulate this idea of the self and and the different ways in which we each and all can potentially interact with the environment and and our inner landscape. Your description of meditation, I have to say, is Now has forever changed the way I think about meditation. I would no longer just think of it as a perceptual exercise. I on the podcast, I've been talking about it as something to to do for these various benefits, The benefit set of more focus at they're stressed at seller of which certainly exists. But what you described today has a, Has such an allure and a and a, hold such a promise that, as I mentioned, I'm certainly going to change my behavior.[4:17:13] Andrew Huberman: And and I know I'm Speaking on behalf of many, many people, I just wanna extend my thanks for your coming here today to teach us Even more because, of course, you have your podcast and the the app and the Waking Up app. And The fact that regardless of the political landscapes, regardless of the what neuroscience feels about psychedelics or the Where things are at any point in time, you strike me as somebody who is very committed to sharing knowledge and Thoughtful deep discourse so that people can benefit, and there are very few people like you. In fact, there's probably only just 1. And so I feel very grateful to be sitting across, the table from him for these last hours.[4:17:57] Dr. Sam Harris: Oh, nice. Nice. Well, I I really enjoyed this, and, I wanna congratulate you on what you've built here because your podcast is is everywhere. I I just I'm con you know, I'm a a fan. And, even more than that, I'm continually seeing the evidence of You reaching people and and benefiting people, and it's just it's really I mean, like, this is the one of the best examples of, You know, new media just carving out a space that that people didn't really know existed.[4:18:26] Dr. Sam Harris: Yeah. You know, because, like, this is not television. It's not radio. It's not and and all of a sudden, people have time to hear a conversation of great length that goes into, You know, nitty gritty scientific detail on, you know, hormones. I mean, like, who would have thought that was even possible?[4:18:42] Dr. Sam Harris: And So, yeah, I would just congratulations. It's fantastic to see, and I'm just very happy for the opportunity to talk to you and and your people.[4:18:51] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. It's very gratifying to hear, and, I feel very blessed, in no small part because of our conversation today.
