I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Sachin Panda. Doctor Satchin Panda is a professor and director of the regulatory biology laboratory at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies. His laboratory has made numerous important contributions that impact mental health, physical health, and human performance.[0:00:31] Andrew Huberman: For instance, his laboratory discovered The neurons in the eye and neurons within the brain that regulate our so called circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are 24 hour rhythms in everything from gene expression to the overall functioning of tissues, our levels of mood and alertness, our ability to sleep, appetite, and much, much more. In addition, over the last decade, doctor Panda's laboratory has made critical discoveries in terms of how our patterns of eating over time impact our biology and our health. In particular, his laboratory pioneer discoveries related to so called intermittent fasting, also sometimes referred to as time restricted feeding. Today, doctor Panda and I discuss how our circadian behaviors, everything from when we wake up to when we view light, to when we Avoid viewing light to when we eat and what we eat, and when we socialize and how we socialize impacts our biology and our psychology, and how all of that has a strong impact on our health.[0:01:29] Andrew Huberman: During today's discussion, you will learn how restricting your feeding To specific periods within each 24 hour cycle or perhaps even exploring longer patterns of fasting and eating cycles can impact everything from the health of your liver, to your gut, to your brain, and how all of that impacts things like mood and Your ability to perform cognitive work. Indeed, today's discussion goes deep into all aspects of intermittent fasting, aka time restricted feeding. We talk about the basic science as well as the recent clinical trials that have explored time restricted feeding in a diverse range of people, including men, women, children, people with diabetes, people who are otherwise healthy, and much, much more. I'm quite aware that intermittent fasting It is a topic of much debate these days. We go deep into that debate.[0:02:18] Andrew Huberman: And by the end of today's discussion, you can be certain that you will have learned all the latest And all the details all made very clear to you thanks to the incredible expertise, discovery, and clear communication of doctor Panda. As some of you may already know, doctor Panda has authored several important books on the topic of intermittent fasting and how it can benefit various aspects of health. Those books include The Circadian Code and a more recent book, The Circadian Diabetes Code, both of which we've provided links to in the show note captions. In addition, if any of you are interested in learning more about doctor Panda's work, including seeing his publications and reading those publications or supporting his laboratory, you can do that by going to his laboratory website, which we have also linked in the show note captions. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:03:07] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is HVMN Ketone IQ. HVMN Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones. I want to be clear that I am not following a ketogenic diet.[0:03:29] Andrew Huberman: Most people fall into this category. They are not a ketogenic diet. They are omnivores, and they do eat carbohydrates. So their standard fuel source for the brain and body is not ketones. However, I found that by taking Ketone IQ, which we know increases blood ketones, I can achieve much better focus for Longer periods of time for any kind of cognitive work and much greater energy levels for exercise, especially if I'm going into that exercise fasted and find myself a little bit hungry when I start that exercise.[0:03:58] Andrew Huberman: And this is no surprise. We know that ketones are the brains and body's preferred fuel source even if you're not following a ketogenic diet. So in other words, I and many other people are now starting to leverage endogenous ketones as a fuel source for the brain and body, and yet we are not following a ketogenic diet. And, of course, if you are following a ketogenic diet, Ketone IQ will further allow you to increase your blood ketones as a source of brain and body fuel. If you'd like to try Ketone IQ, you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off your order.[0:04:30] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. As I've talked about before on the Huberman Lab Podcast, there is a critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep and Stay deeply asleep, your body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.[0:04:53] Andrew Huberman: And in order to wake up in the morning and feel alert, your body temperature needs to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. The problem with most people's sleeping environment is that even if you make the room cool, the actual environment that Sleep on, that is your mattress and underneath your covers, is hard to regulate in terms of temperature. With 8 Sleep, regulating the temperature of that sleeping environment becomes incredibly easy. In fact, you can change the temperature of that environment across the night, making it a little bit cool at the beginning of the night, Even cooler still, a few hours into your sleep, which really helps getting into very deep sleep, and then warming it as you approach morning so you wake up feeling most alert. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for over a year now, and it has completely transformed my sleep.[0:05:36] Andrew Huberman: You'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman to save up to $150 off their Pod three cover. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's 8 sleep.com/ Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics.[0:05:56] Andrew Huberman: Now I am not a fan of the word nootropics because it translates to smart drugs. And as a neuroscientist, what I can tell you is that you have circuits in your brain that allow you to focus. You have circuits in your brain that allow you to be creative. You have circuits in your brain that allow you to task Switch and on and on. In other words, there is no specific brain circuit or even circuits for being, quote, unquote, smart.[0:06:17] Andrew Huberman: Thesis understands this and has developed nootropics that are customized to different types of mental operations. What do I mean by that? Well, They have formulas that can put your brain into a state of increased clarity or focus or creativity or that can give you more overall energy for things like Physical exercise. I often take the Thesis Clarity Formula prior to long bouts of cognitive work, and I'll use their energy formula prior to doing any kind of really intense physical exercise. If you'd like to try your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to take thesis.com/huberman.[0:06:53] Andrew Huberman: You'll take a brief 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month.

Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with doctor Sachin Panda. Sachin, doctor Panda, so good to see you again.[0:07:28] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Good to see you.[0:07:29] Andrew Huberman: We are colleagues still, but we used to be right across the street from one another[0:07:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: in CPA. Remember those days. Yeah.[0:07:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So I'm delighted that you're here. I think we're going to talk about a number of things, mainly intermittent fasting time restricted feeding and health, but also the Many other things that you're doing. Just before we started recording, we were discussing your recent paper in Nature, It involved recordings from postmortem human retina. So maybe if there's time at the end, we can get back to, your lab has shown that It can, essentially maintain or resurrect neurons from dead people in order to potentially and eventually Provide transplants to rescue vision and the blind, so that's extremely exciting.[0:08:13] Andrew Huberman: But, of course, not the main focus of today's discussion, so we'll have to, split it up. The first question I have is how am I supposed to define fasting and time restricted feeding? In meaning, when I go to sleep every night, I'm not eating. So in some sense, everybody is doing time restricted feeding to some degree or another.[0:08:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:08:34] Andrew Huberman: At what point can we start thinking about A pattern of eating is time restricted feeding, so called intermittent fasting. Does it have to do with how regular one is about the start and stop times? How do you think about defining intermittent fasting, time restricted feeding? And maybe just to simplify the conversation, is one Term more correct than the other in terms of describing this incredible pattern of feeding?[0:09:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: Well, you know that intermittent fasting covers many Types of fasting. Actually, it started long time ago, and it's embedded into the history of caloric restriction. Almost 100 years ago, people showed that if you reduce calorie intake in a rat, then that rat can leave for a long time. And in those experiments, the calories were reduced every single day. And that led to the idea that if we cut down our calories by 20% say, then we can potentially live longer by doing 2 things.[0:09:37] Dr. Satchin Panda: 1 is preventing disease or even if we fall as fall sick, maybe we can accelerate cure and keep the repair mechanism going so that we can live longer. But it was very difficult to Count calories every day and reduce maintain that. I must say that it's not that calorie restriction is impossible or we are not doing it. In fact, Lot of us, we do, count calories in our subconscious mind. And so every time You took out a you took out we take out a soda bottle or something.[0:10:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: I'm looking at it. Okay. 160 kilocalorie or 30 kilocalorie, 0 kilocalorie. We are doing that. So the point is it's it's we are doing subconsciously some kind of calorie, counting, but reducing calorie by 20, 30% every single day is not possible for many people.[0:10:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: So then the idea came in mouse and rat experiment whether they can eat every other day. And in fact, this every other day feeding, also led to very similar, almost equivalent health improvement as, continuous calorie restriction. So then the idea was, well, Every other day is a little bit hard for humans, but just imagine I'll just get to eat, only one day and then another day. Then the idea came, well, for humans, can they eat less for 1 or 2 days in the week? So that led to this 5 two diet where people can eat for 5 days, and then 2 days, they have to reduce calories.[0:11:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's also In term internally, people are fasting. Then as you know, Walter Longo also came with this idea that periodic fasting, maybe 4 or 5 days in every month or 2 months, 3 months, you can fast or reduce calorie, and he also found many benefits of calorie restriction was there.[0:11:40] Andrew Huberman: Were those studies on humans?[0:11:42] Dr. Satchin Panda: Many of the studies started it in mice, but, alternate day fasting, 52, and, Walter's period past fasting, all of them have now been done in humans. Not for longevity, of course, because cannot do those for a long time. But for weight maintenance, for reducing some signs of aging or reversing, those things have been done. So all of them, have been done in humans, mostly healthy humans, and in some cases, people with, prediabetes or Some aspects of metabolic disease. So that led to the idea that that all these forms of fasting in which The total calorie intake on any given day is reduced for 1 or more days in a week, a month, that became that umbrella term became intermittent fasting.[0:12:35] Dr. Satchin Panda: So if you Look up the scientific literature. Most intermittent fasting involves intentionally reducing calories for at least 1 or 2 days in a week or, few days in a month. So when we, published Time restricted feeding, the initial mouse experiments and even now most of the mouse experiments, We want to test what is the impact of time restriction versus calorie restriction. So in these experiments, we don't reduce calorie on any Day of mouse life. So the mice ate the same number of calories as the ad libitum paired mice, but still they see health benefit.[0:13:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: That's why we call it time restricted feeding. But since it involves living without food for several hours, for some people, which is, it can be very difficult. The initial experiments was done. They were done for 8 hours of feeding and 16 hours of fasting. That kind of became popular and, so that that's why people use the same term as intermittent fasting.[0:13:45] Dr. Satchin Panda: And now if you, say intermittent fasting in popular literature or popular media, then people usually refer to time restricted eating. Got it. So now coming back to How do you define time restricted feeding? So the way, we have been trying to define Experimentally and also in literature is, trying to confine all your energy intake From solid and liquid food combined within a consistent window of 8 to 12 hours Because that's something that doable. Of course, people have done time distributing with 4 hours, 6 hours, and some people even try to eat everything within 2 hours, 1 meal a day.[0:14:31] Dr. Satchin Panda: The point is those are not feasible to maintain for very long time for a lot of people.[0:14:39] Andrew Huberman: One question about the 6 hour versus 8 hour versus 12 hour feeding window. Is it important that the feeding window begin and end at the same time Yeah. More or less?[0:14:51] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. More or less.[0:14:52] Andrew Huberman: And if so, how much flexibility is there? So for instance, I'm somebody that I am not terribly hungry in the morning. I like to drink water[0:15:01] Dr. Satchin Panda: Mhmm.[0:15:01] Andrew Huberman: Usually some caffeine and electrolytes Yeah. In the period before my 1st meal. Yeah. And my 1st meal always lands sometime between 11 and 11 AM and 12 noon. Yeah.[0:15:12] Andrew Huberman: There are exceptions Yeah. Occasionally, I'll have a breakfast, a proper breakfast as it's called. I guess it would be improper if you're intermittent fasting for me. But, typically, 11 AM or noon is when I first eat, and my last bite of food is typically around, I don't know, 8 Yeah. 30, 9 PM.[0:15:29] Andrew Huberman: That's what works for me.[0:15:30] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:15:32] Andrew Huberman: Is that consistency affording me any benefit? Sep and let's just leave aside total caloric number, macronutrients, plant based meat, etcetera. But Is there any benefit to shortening that feeding window that we are aware of or extending that feeding window or being even more rigid about the start and end of that feeding window.[0:15:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So the start of the feeding window, That's interesting because it, the concept of time restricted feeding, when I describe animal studies, it's feeding. For humans, it's eating. So the concept actually came from the science of circadian rhythm. So that means, Our body has an internal timetable, that's present in every cell, in every organ, that preprograms, many molecular aspects of the cells that leads to physiology and all that stuff.[0:16:30] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that essentially, there is a predetermined timetable for every cell, every organ to do certain things at certain time. And, The circadian clocks, as you and I know, are more sensitive to light. Light is the most dominant, time giver. So for example, when daylight saving time changes or when we travel from one time zone to another time zone, We feel kind of crappy because our daily activities are out of sync from our internal clock. So that was known for very long time, but then around the year 20,021,002, there's a famous experiment by Uli Sibler from, Switzerland.[0:17:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: What, he did, he just fed the mice at the wrong time. Mice are knocked on all their Night feeders. And when he fed, mice during daytime, the liver clock, instead of Following its own routine, liver clog actually started following food. So that means by changing our feeding time, we can change We can tune our liver clot. And subsequently, the same experiment has been repeated many times, and even we repeated that in 2009.[0:17:52] Dr. Satchin Panda: And we figured out, yes. Actually, outside this brain center called suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN, which is considered the master circadian clock. Almost the rest of the brain even follows when we eat. And that came out from Pierre Sam Woon's lab in Europe, where they systematically looked at even, Places that are very close to the SCN. For those who are who know, there's some medial hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, all of this.[0:18:29] Dr. Satchin Panda: Within couple of, 4, 5 millimeters of the SCN, but they were following.[0:18:35] Andrew Huberman: Amazing.[0:18:36] Dr. Satchin Panda: So then And now if we think about it so for example, when the daylight seven time changes, just 1 hour change, 1 hour change in alignment between our internal time and external time leads to kind of feeling groggy and feeling Not at a peak for 4 months for 1 or 2 days. So the rule of thumb is when the time giver changes by 1 hour, then our internal clock takes at least a day to catch up. So that means if you're flying from LA to New York, you are moving through 3 time zones. Then on an hour is it will take 3 3 days To catch up with the New York Times. For some people, it can be even slower.[0:19:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: And for some people, it can be 2 days. But the bottom line is, Yes. There is a a desynchrony. So then what does it mean for the body? So the one of the function of clock is to anticipate When you are going to wake up, for example, so the blood pressure slightly goes up, or heart rate goes up, or breathing goes up.[0:19:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: Similarly, for food, almost every organ that is involved in feeding or eating digestion, all of them have clocks. So even from saliva production, that's the first phase of Digestion to secretion of all the digestive juice in the stomach and then absorption of nutrient, then liver, metabolism, Everything the whole village expects when you're supposed to eat, and they're getting ready for you to eat their 1st meal after Fasting for a long time, so that's why it's breaking the fast of breakfast. And when that time changes, when you change it by 2 or 3 hours From one day to another, then, sometimes they're like, oh, food didn't come. Maybe, we'll come at a wrong time. We were at the wrong time, and then they'll track the new eating times.[0:20:42] Dr. Satchin Panda: So suppose, say, one day, you have been eating every day at 8 AM. I I eat at 8 AM.[0:20:48] Andrew Huberman: So Is that when you start Yeah. Your feeding window? When do you when does your feeding window shut?[0:20:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: 6 PM. So I eat for around 10 hours.[0:20:56] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:20:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. And then one day, if I switch to 10 AM, then what happens is a clock is thinking, well, the food didn't arrive at 8, But it arrived at 10. Maybe tomorrow, the photo will arrive somewhere between 8 and 10, so we'll be ready around 9. I see. Then they And next day, if I come back and eat at 8 o'clock, then I may eat, but my clock is not ready to digest that food.[0:21:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's why This idea is you have to be consistent, to take advantage of this anticipatory activity of our clock in different systems to get the best out of it.[0:21:34] Andrew Huberman: Is there evidence that those anticipatory systems in, as they relate to digestion help us better assimilate our food? I would imagine so. I mean, if you have the gastric juices that are gonna help digest the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, and, already Deployed at the time when you eat, I could imagine that food will be better utilized than if you don't. So in other words, What is the advantage of having these anticipatory signals, in terms of potential health benefits?[0:22:01] Dr. Satchin Panda: The anticipatory signal is really important from even Even from waking up, the reason why many people feel not ready completely when they wake up to an alarm clock Because the alarm clock wakes you up, but your body is not prepared. So that sleepiness after waking up to an alarm clock is our body is not prepared for that. And then the best example is when the, when, the daylight saving time changes, particularly when we have to wake up 1 hour early. What happens, People who have underlying heart condition, when they are waking up, when the body is not ready or heart is not ready and all of a sudden their heart has to start pumping little bit harder, then there is chance of heart attack. And in fact, people have looked at hospital records, and they find that on those days, there's a sharp rise in heart attacks.[0:23:02] Andrew Huberman: And car accidents.[0:23:03] Dr. Satchin Panda: Right? And car accidents too because your brain is not coordinated, so you cannot, make those fine decisions. So that's a great example of anticipatory activity. But coming back to digestion, one thing is And this is something that many people might have experienced. There are many rhythms in our digestive system, and one of the rhythms is our Look.[0:23:28] Dr. Satchin Panda: Our intestine has this peristaltic function, so it kind of contracts and expands, and that moves for Food doesn't move due to gravity, so it goes back and forth. And that peristaltic action actually slows down at night, few hours after our last meal. And, so that's why when people eat late at night, for example, then that food doesn't get digested because there is not enough digestive juice, first thing. And second, even if it gets digested in the stomach, it doesn't move properly. So then the next morning, people get up and think, of course, people consume some alcohol very often, and then they Think that this is hangover, but those who don't, consume alcohol, then they have the food hangover because it doesn't digest.[0:24:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's one extreme example where food at the wrong time can, so healthy food at the wrong time can be crap Or junk.[0:24:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I've, experienced that where if I've worked late or I couldn't eat dinner or something and then I get home, I always debate whether or not to Try and sleep. Yeah. But if I'm too hungry, oftentimes, it's challenging. And so for me, sometimes consuming something that At least seems easily digestible like yogurt or something in a liquid form, is better for me than If I eat a meal, I've made a mistake of going to the refrigerator, being super hungry, and eating a bunch of food at 10 or 11 PM and then falling asleep.[0:24:58] Andrew Huberman: And, indeed, the sleep, If I'm tired enough, can be quite deep, but the next morning, I feel just completely physically and and cognitively weighed down. So I think that what you just described Makes a lot of sense. So Yeah. Is it so if someone were to select a a feeding window[0:25:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: Mhmm.[0:25:13] Andrew Huberman: Regardless of whether or not it falls into classic intermittent fasting time restricted feeding, Sounds like eating your 1st bite of food and eating your last bite of food at more or less the same time each day Yeah. Has benefits. I have this question. You mentioned feeding versus eating, and I think it's actually not just a, grammatical, semantic issue. And here's why.[0:25:40] Andrew Huberman: We tend to think about when you take your 1st bite of food and then when you take your last bite of food, but, course, foods digest at different rates. Yeah. More fat in there is gonna digest make carbohydrates digest slower, etcetera. I mean, there's all these adjustments to the glycemic index and so forth With foods in combination, is it better to think about not eating, but your fed state and blood sugar? So for instance, I often get asked on social media, does blank break a fast?[0:26:09] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. So, And so I like to think about it scientifically like, okay. Is does plain water break a fast? No. Does air break a fast?[0:26:17] Andrew Huberman: No. Does 1 grain of sugar Of sucrose break a fast? Well, probably not, but does 1 teaspoon of sugar break a fast? Well, you could say yes, but transiently. Like so, I mean, when we're talking about breaking a fast, are we talking about a rise in blood glucose, or are there Molecular signals downstream of of a rise in blood glucose that, cannot be reversed.[0:26:41] Andrew Huberman: In other words, if I'm gonna eat my 1st meal every day at noon, and I'm Eat my last, bite of food at 8 PM, and at 9 AM, for whatever reason, I have coffee with 1 teaspoon of sugar in it. I suppose in the strictest sense, I've broken my fast. Mhmm. But maybe by if I went for a hard run that morning, maybe by 9:30 AM, I'm back in a quote, unquote fasted State. So what is the fasted state, really?[0:27:06] Andrew Huberman: Because when I'm eating at 8 PM, just to give another example, I'm start fasting at 801 Mhmm. Perhaps. Yeah. But I have my blood glucose is elevated, so I'm not really fasted. I I'm fed.[0:27:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's just that I'm not eating the verb. Right? Okay. So, so, Again, I I don't wanna get overly detailed just for sake of getting detail, but I think a lot of the confusion out there about what breaks a fast Yeah.[0:27:30] Andrew Huberman: Is related specifically to this issue Yeah. Which is if I eat a whole pizza after sitting around all day, it's very different than if I eat a whole pizza after having run a 26 mile Marathon that way. Very different Yeah. Metabolically speaking. So how should people think about fasted versus fed?[0:27:48] Andrew Huberman: Can we be mildly fasted versus severe fasted? Can we be, fed ish versus very fed? Anyway, I'll I'll Stop, asking questions now, but because they all relate to the same theme.[0:28:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. No. These are very interesting question. And then, unfortunately, as you can As you have you might have seen in life, the most obvious questions are often unanswered because it's so hard to do these damn experiments. Because if you really want to address this in humans, you have to bring humans, put them in isolation.[0:28:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: Just like you said, I can now imagine planning 5 or 6 different experiments. Each experiment should involve 8 or 10 volunteers. It's gender, sex, And then do it. So it's difficult. So now let's go back to see how do we let's dissect it, in terms of, say, Indirect calorimetry.[0:28:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: So for example, indirect calorimetry is based on this principle that whatever oxygen we breathe in and carbon dioxide we, breathe out. If you can measure these 2, then we can figure out whether our body in total we we are not saying whether it's the liver, gut, fat, or muscle. In total, whether it's, consuming glucose or fat as energy source. The idea is when we've when we are without food for several hours, Then, ideally, our body will tap on to glycogen first and then to a little bit of fat. And then when the body is Mostly running on fat, then that ratio of c o two to oxygen will come to 0.7.[0:29:32] Dr. Satchin Panda: But what is interesting, we can do these experiments in mice. So we can go to mice and ask, okay. So what happens in mice? So And mice mice are little bit very different because mice are not simply little people. They're their metabolism is different.[0:29:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: They Store relatively less glycogen than humans do in terms of, total metabolism. So they Overnight, within 12 to 14 hours, the RER, respiratory exchange ratio, this ratio will go from 1 When the consuming mostly glucose or carbohydrate as energy source, it will slow down slowly go to 0.7, 0.75. So after 12 to 14 hours, they're kind of mostly running on fat. So now as we give them food, Within 10 or 15 minutes, they're not actually consuming couple of grams of food. They might have consumed, say, 100 or 200 milligram of that Chow, so which is less than, say, 5% of the food.[0:30:35] Dr. Satchin Panda: But then the will immediately begin to rise as if That small amount of food stopped that fat burning process and crank up the Carbohydrate burning process.[0:30:48] Andrew Huberman: When you say fat burning process, you mean body fat stores being burned, right, not dietary fat. Correct?[0:30:54] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So it's all body fat. Means that that's why I said, we don't know where that fat is being burned because we are just measuring how how much mice is breathing in and out. So for example, it can be from the skin. So subcutaneous fat or belly fat.[0:31:10] Andrew Huberman: But not dietary fat?[0:31:12] Dr. Satchin Panda: No. By that time, the dietary fat is already absorbed and digested, and hopefully, it's sitting in the liver or adipose tissue somewhere, but it's the Fat versus body fat. Yes. Thank you, Paul.[0:31:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. The reason I ask is that nowadays, I think more than half of the battles about nutrition that I see online Yep. Relate to this issue where, I won't name names, but someone will come along and say, low carbohydrate diet allows you to burn more fat. And The more nuanced, people out there will say, well, that's true, but you're also talking about dietary fat.[0:31:43] Andrew Huberman: You know, the word fat can confuse people.[0:31:45] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:31:45] Andrew Huberman: I realize you're not doing that. You're you are certainly not one of the people guilty of doing this, but indeed, you eat more fat, you'll burn more fat, but that doesn't mean you'll burn more body fat. In fact, I think the data say that under conditions of caloric restriction, you'll actually burn less. I hope I don't I'll probably get I'll probably get, Pitchforks, sent through the mail toward me on on that one, but but I think that's true. Whereas, you know, people who consume carbohydrate can still burn body fat even though majority of the fuel they're burning is from carbohydrates.[0:32:12] Andrew Huberman: So Yeah.[0:32:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: So here, in this case, for example, for mice, we know that as soon as they start eating, the RER goes up. Coming back to your question, what would be ideal for us to do? The experiment would be okay. So we'll go back to that And then give the mouse maybe 100 milligram of food, and mouse runs around in the kids. And then we'll continue to measure to see how long it takes for the mouse to come back and then so that's one aspect.[0:32:39] Dr. Satchin Panda: So now let's see. Let's stay on this, And then I'll come back and talk about non caloric food and how whether that is considered.[0:32:49] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:33:17] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological Systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to Try Athletic Greens. You can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, and they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:34:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: So there's a famous experiment that was published last year by Jhorta Kahazi's lab, and it came out in science. And that relates to calorie restriction. And We kind of started with this I d we'd start a discussion that the diet experiments were done with calorie restriction, and researchers get Reduced calorie consumption by 20% or 30% and get that food, the rats, and then subsequently, mice, and they all live longer. What is interesting is, in all those experiments, the researchers came and get this bolus of food At one time, whereas the ad libitum fed mice or rats, they had access to food all the time. So they're eating all the time, And then these rats, were given 20% less.[0:34:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: And what happens is these mice or rats, they're not going to take that less Food, which is restaurant now, and just eat a little bit of, lunch and then snack after 3 hours or snack after 3 hours, they'd gobble up all that food. Within 2 to 3 hours, maximum 4 hours, food is gone.[0:35:15] Andrew Huberman: So they're sort of on the OMAD diet, the 1 meal a day.[0:35:18] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. They're almost like in 1 meal a day, 3 to 4 hours, food is gone. Or you can sit there on 4 hours eating or feeding and 20 hours fasting. So then the question became, well, The benefit of calorie restriction as we know, is it due to reduced calorie or Time restricted feeding or timing. There is a timing component to it that they are eating all of that within 3 to 4 hours, and then there is a long fasting.[0:35:49] Dr. Satchin Panda: And this is a difficult question to answer because now you have to ask these poor grad students or technicians to come and Split that food into 8 or 10 or 15 different small persons and then give them to mice in every 2 hours. So Joe Takahashi, who actually published the 1st paper in 2017 showing that most calorie restriction I mean, he used the protocol that was used by calorie restriction field. It actually creates a condition of time restriction. So he saw that, and then he went back and worked with the engineers to come up with a smart case where, he could actually tell he could program how much food is given to mice at what time of the day or night. Completely programmed.[0:36:40] Dr. Satchin Panda: So then he took this, for example, suppose, say, the ad libitum fed mice eat, say, 5 grams of chow in a day. And if you want to reduce calories by, 20%, then the CR mouse would get 4 grams of food. And it divided this into 9 or 10 meals and then give them in every 90 minutes. So In this case, they're eating small meals throughout day night, so there is no fasting. So you can say that, well, this mouse actually is not getting into fasting because in every few hours, he's, getting some food.[0:37:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then he measured how long the mouse is going to live, and he used, a count means, This is a very standard protocol. People count how many mice have dying on which day and then examine them to see whether they Died because they there was an accident or they actually there was a natural cause. And then they calculate at the end what is the, Half, life. So 50% survival because that's on an average, that's a good indicator because there is an outlier that will live for a long time, then that can skew. So what was interesting was the ad libitum fed mice, of course, they live certain number of days and then these calorie restricted mice that never got into superfasting, but kind of eating, Snacking throughout day night, it also lived 10% extra, 10% longer.[0:38:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that means caloric restriction extended lifespan by 10%.[0:38:18] Andrew Huberman: I've wondered about this because recently, you know, there's been there were a bunch of news headlines about intermittent fasting, and I and, frankly, I was frustrated. If you looked at 1 major news outlet, they would say time restricted feeding affords no additional benefit beyond caloric restriction for weight loss. Yeah. Then an another popular press venue, let's call it that, same study described as Time restricted feeding doesn't work.[0:38:50] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Right.[0:38:50] Andrew Huberman: And then another one may be someplace, even more extreme.[0:38:54] Dr. Satchin Panda: You[0:38:54] Andrew Huberman: know? Time restricted feeding, only beneficial because of caloric restriction or something like that. So what you've essentially got are 3 different interpretations of the same data, All of which are well, 2 of which are true, one of which is false in my opinion, but what I think people take away from that is, oh, time restricted feeding isn't valuable, which It's not the case. It I think for many people, it's a convenient way to eat because at least for people like me, it's simpler to designate between Portions of my day when I'm eating and portions of day my day when I'm not eating as opposed to eat portion control.[0:39:28] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:39:28] Andrew Huberman: For other people, portion control can work, but all of that is related to Either maintenance or loss of weight Mhmm. None of it deals with the potential health benefits independent of weight loss. Yeah. Right? So And so I I think that, if we can segment those out, obviously, in humans, it's hard to know if a given Treatment or experiment is extending life because you don't really know how long people would live anyway.[0:39:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right? Whereas with mice, you have some sense of when the mortality was likely to occur. So What what can we say about time restricted feeding and longevity in terms of biomarkers or in terms of any other indication that people who Start and stop their feeding window at a consistent time somewhere between 8 and 12 hours per 24 hour cycle are Tilting the scales towards living longer as opposed to living shorter.[0:40:21] Dr. Satchin Panda: This example of this news article that you mentioned is really interesting because that relates to Joe's, Joe Takazi's study because I described that if you split calories and eat throughout the day throughout day and night, then the mice lived 10% extra. But if you now give mouse the same calorie restricted diet and feed them during daytime, Whether within 12 hours or 2 hours, then they might live 10% extra.[0:40:49] Andrew Huberman: Beyond that. Yeah. So 20% more. Okay, so let me make sure I understand so that, so that I make sure I understand. If you take a certain number of calories and you distribute them throughout the 24 hour cycle, Yeah.[0:41:03] Andrew Huberman: It's caloric restriction. The mice will live 10% longer.[0:41:06] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:41:07] Andrew Huberman: If you, however, restrict that to the active cycle[0:41:10] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Of[0:41:10] Andrew Huberman: the so for humans, the daytime, then 20% then they live 20% longer.[0:41:17] Dr. Satchin Panda: 20% longer.[0:41:18] Andrew Huberman: So it's not just total caloric intake.[0:41:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:41:21] Andrew Huberman: Meaning, it's not just important to be submaintenance in calories for sake of longevity. It also It's important as to when in the 24 hour cycle Yeah. You eat those calories. Do I have that right?[0:41:31] Dr. Satchin Panda: So now that's Still, the story is not over because these mice were fed during daytime, and they're not supposed to eat.[0:41:39] Andrew Huberman: That's right. So for us, it would be the equivalent of being on the night shift and only eating at night, but a sub caloric. Sub maintenance calorie diet, I guess, is the right way[0:41:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: to say it. But when he fed mice during nighttime when they're supposed to eat, And they're seeing this getting the same number of calories within 12 hours or 2 hours, then the mice live 35% longer than the Control.[0:42:01] Andrew Huberman: 35% longer. So scale to human lifespan, which I you know? We don't know. But but a 35% longer would mean that, and, again, No one knows, but, humans now what is the average mortality in the United States? Somewhere around 80?[0:42:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: Life ex yeah. So it's around 80. It used to be 80 now. Slow reduced a little bit because of COVID, but let's take 80.[0:42:22] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So people are then now living somewhere between 25 35 years longer. Yes. Put I'm putting some error bars[0:42:28] Dr. Satchin Panda: on there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing.[0:42:30] Dr. Satchin Panda: Was, really profound. But now you pointed out, biomarker and other stuff. So now if you look at any given time within that experiment, And, actually, Joe went back and, had a separate cohort of mice very similar and so that he could take tissue samples. And, of course, in This case, you have to sacrifice the mouse. And he looked for, he did lot of molecular analysis with known markers.[0:43:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: For example, hemoglobin a one c, equivalent or glucose control, cholesterol, all this stuff. It could not find anything that predicted the benefit of calorie restriction. So that means in this experiment, whatever we know so far, the predictor of longevity, none of them could predict whether this, CR only mouse, which ate throughout day night, that mouse is going to live less than the night fed mouse that was going to live 35 25% extra.[0:43:34] Andrew Huberman: Does that mean that there are biomarkers related to longevity that we just haven't discovered yet?[0:43:38] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So that's exactly so that means Whatever we know so far about biomarkers, those he could not use to predict. Maybe there was a lot of noise. Maybe he wanted he had to use more number of mice to get that because, you know, biomarkers I'm not gonna predict in every instance that there is some error. What is also very interesting is if you look at the body weight and body composition of all these mice, there is no difference in body weight and body composition.[0:44:10] Andrew Huberman: Across all these different groups?[0:44:11] Dr. Satchin Panda: All these groups.[0:44:12] Andrew Huberman: So it doesn't matter when they ate[0:44:14] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:44:14] Andrew Huberman: Provided they were sub[0:44:17] Dr. Satchin Panda: sub[0:44:17] Andrew Huberman: maintenance calorie intake. So less Fewer calories than is required to maintain their weight. Didn't matter what pattern of eating. They were the same weight.[0:44:25] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[0:44:25] Andrew Huberman: So that in many ways seems to mimic human studies where they say, look. It doesn't really matter whether or not you use caloric restriction or or you start your feeding window in the morning or start your feeding window in the evening or you, or you portion control for sake of weight weight loss?[0:44:40] Dr. Satchin Panda: Because they're taking a snapshot of that. And then another thing with the human study that, Now we are referring to here, that in that human study, people are actually already eating within 10 hours window, Habitually, when they selected these people to have them enroll in the study. So they were already eating for 10 hours and fasting for, 14 hours. All participants had to reduce their caloric intake, And they reduced by almost 25%. The CR group continued with 10 hour sitting window, And the CR plus time restricted group had to eat the same number of calories within 8 hours.[0:45:21] Andrew Huberman: So it's just a 2 hour difference.[0:45:23] Dr. Satchin Panda: It's just a 2 hours difference.[0:45:24] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So that people I just wanna make sure people can understand. So in in this human study, which is the one that I felt that the popular press venues all except 1 venue, got Either semi wrong or badly wrong in terms of their conclusion. That was my interpretation anyway, was that either people came into the study eating Basically, in a 10 hour feeding window, which goes back to my first question, which is that most people are not eating in the middle of the night.[0:45:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah.[0:45:48] Andrew Huberman: Or if they're on shift work, and they are, then they're sleeping during the day anyway. So they're eating in a 10 to 12 hour feeding window anyway. So you're saying they either did caloric restriction portion control within the 10 hour window Or another group within the study ate sub maintenance calories, so caloric restriction, CR as we're calling it, the acronym CR, But restricted that to an 8 hour feeding window, and they didn't see any difference in terms of weight loss. Yeah. But weight loss also all that surprising.[0:46:14] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, if it's just a 2 hour difference.[0:46:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Exactly. So we have done that experiment in mice, and we don't see, difference in not only weight loss, many other markers. And I was telling you about this, Jyotakhasi's paper where I told you that he allowed these mice to eat within 2 hours or 12 hours, Subcaloric diet.[0:46:36] Andrew Huberman: 2 or 12?[0:46:37] Dr. Satchin Panda: 2 or 12.[0:46:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's dramatic.[0:46:39] Dr. Satchin Panda: But still, he did not see change in longevity even Within those 2. So that means, when you do caloric restriction and then at least per month, And you are within 12 hours window. That's that is giving the mice the best benefit, the optimum benefit. And, 2, 3, or 5, or 12 per mouse doesn't matter, at least for longevity.[0:47:05] Andrew Huberman: Can we conclude for humans that Whether or not a feeding window is 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, or 12, doesn't matter provided the calories are are Similar or same?[0:47:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: Well, I won't go to that extent because we don't know many of these. Particularly, we don't know how this sort of eating window will affect both success because, you know, we always think many of these mouse experiments even that I Told you about those are done only in male mice.[0:47:33] Andrew Huberman: But that should be changing. Right? Because the NIH I know this because I'm on study section, which is just a bunch of people who who review grants is that every grant now has to include sex as a biological variable. It's hard to get away with, or rather I should say it the way it should be said, which is People are required and should want to look at these phenomena in male and female mice Yes. Especially if there are differences.[0:48:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: So in this case, there are many I mean, there is also another paper, in time restricted feeding, that also came out a big paper showing that the, thermogenesis was accounting for loss in fat mass in Time distributed fed mice, that was also done only in male mice. So this is, we are paying attention to it. So we are now doing all of our Studies in male and female, and we do see big differences between male and female. Coming back to humans, what typically happens is when you're trying to do 4 hours or 6 Sours of time restating. People will inadvertently reduce their calorie intake.[0:48:39] Andrew Huberman: It's just because of gut volume. I tried 1 meal per day, and and I felt like I was Eating so much at that one sitting Yeah. That it led to a lot of gastric distress, and I get tired after the meal. And part of the reason I like To do time restricted feeding is I have more energy. Yeah.[0:48:54] Andrew Huberman: And certainly in the fasted state, I feel more energized, especially if I'm ingesting a little caffeine or something like that.[0:49:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: So people will reduce energy intake, and then some people who are more active, they can actually Unconsciously, they may be spending more energy in their physical activity and basal metabolic rate, all of this combined than how much they're eating. And that can have a very adverse effect in long term because we know that this energy deficit and in fact, there is a, Scientific term for that is called read as relative energy deficit in sports.[0:49:34] Andrew Huberman: Relative energy deficit in sports. Okay.[0:49:36] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. It's because nearly 40% of athletes, not the NFL Guys, but, you know, there are a lot of people who do track and field, and nearly 40% of athletes actually experience this red Red s without knowing.[0:49:52] Andrew Huberman: Can male and female athletes both experience reds? So it's reds, r e d s r e d s. Energy Relative energy deficit In sports. Interesting. It's the 1st I've heard this acronym.[0:50:04] Andrew Huberman: We have a new acronym, folks. This is good to add to it. A list of other acronyms, but I so males and females can experience it. So in females, I've heard that, reds, can lead to, Amenorrhea, so loss of of men's of the menstrual cycle.[0:50:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So that's, so common that, so prevalent that In fact, many women many female athletes, they take it for granted that, yes, if they are more active, then they will lose their menstrual cycle, which is, which may be common, but it's not normal or optimum for health.[0:50:40] Andrew Huberman: And Even if they don't want to get pregnant?[0:50:42] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[0:50:43] Andrew Huberman: We had an expert on female hormones come on and say the very same thing that regular cycling is a[0:50:48] Dr. Satchin Panda: Is very important.[0:50:49] Andrew Huberman: Of, ovulatory menstrual cycle is is important to try and, maintain.[0:50:55] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. And then So that's 1. But then what is really concerning is, It does affect bone health. And, in this state, people actually over a long period of time, they lose bone mass, And the bone also becomes more prone to injury. Microfracture and fractures.[0:51:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: So, Again, it's a risk. Means if some people are trying to eat within very short time and they're physically active, that happens. And it also has impact on, means the reason why these women are losing menstrual cycle is the HPG axis is disrupted. Hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal axis. And it starts it may start even upstream at hypothalamus or pituitary.[0:51:44] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that means that HPA axis, hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal axis may also get disrupted. One of the symptoms of reds is also depression, anxiety, bipolar like symptoms, and we know that many, Many athletes experience that. We think that, well, this this may be just peer pressure that always trying to compete, and We know that, unfortunately, there are few athletes who just can't cope it, and many attempted suicide or suicide. So This is a serious issue, and there's also another new topic in the lab to come up with a mouse model of reds and then study it. But this is one risk why we should not reduce our eating interval to 2 to 1 meal or very short time, Because it can have adverse side effect that we don't know now.[0:52:36] Dr. Satchin Panda: And maybe in future, we'll figure out When we systematically study them. There are studies that are published showing 4 hours 6 hours time restricted eating has benefits on weight loss, But those are on healthy individuals, and they were in the studies. So they, you know, the study team took, we're already monitoring. They made sure that there is no sudden weight loss or weight loss below, some safety level. So those are very different from regular people who are who may be even normal weight or even with, within the healthy range.[0:53:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: If they do, then they can potentially. So that's why what we think is 8 to 10 hours may be the ideal spot to begin with. And, once you are physically active and you are also spending a lot of energy in Physical activity or sports, you can even go up to 12 hours because in mice, we have done that experiment. Up to 12 hours, they do get lot of benefits. Not all, but[0:53:39] Andrew Huberman: So this is 12 hours of[0:53:40] Dr. Satchin Panda: 12 hours of feeding, 12 hours of fasting. Yeah. In humans, again, nobody has done systematically 12 hours, But there was 1 study in Europe, from Tinhai Colette Lab. And Tinhai and I, we collaborate, so they used our MyCircadianClock app. This is a research app we developed just to this is mostly used in time restricted eating studies.[0:54:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, he had Nearly I think he started with 200 Swiss, participants, but then at the end, he selected and took very small number of group. People who are very, meticulous about recording all their food and divided them into usual feeding whatever they wanted to eat, whenever they wanted to eat. And they were given the, advice of Swiss nutrition advice that's given to improve health and reduce blood glucose, almost like diabetes prevention program in the US. And then the other group was given advice to eat within 12 hours. This is very early on in time restricted eating, and we thought that the mice were getting some benefit.[0:54:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: Let's try whether 12 hours has any benefit. The bottom line is at the end of, 3 months 6 months, what, he reported is both groups lost same amount of Body weight. And then there's not too much significant difference between groups, but both groups actually improve their health. So the bottom line is the Swiss nutritional advice that he was giving, which is the standard of care there, It achieved the same amount of weight loss as just giving people this advice that eat within 12 hours. So one way to look at it look at the result is like this.[0:55:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, then he went to more extent and actually looked at Every single meal these people consume. So there are close to, I think, close to 60 or 70000 meal records And pictures he went through and then classified them to say whether these are, good quality food. So they call it NOVA classification, 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 is the food that you can almost eat raw fruits, vegetables, yogurt, Dairy products that you can almost without any preparation. And then 2nd, nova two is kind of home home cooked Food that most people will prepare in few minutes, and then 3.[0:56:08] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then 4th 1 is the food that you can never prepare at home. So for example, biscuit or cookies that we usually purchase and few other things. And usually, the NOVA for unhealthy ultra processed food, so which we should not be eating, so the advice is to reduce NOVAV four. And what I found was, people who got all these advice, to improve their nutrition quality. They actually improved their nutrition quality.[0:56:36] Dr. Satchin Panda: They reduced their NOVAP for food. And people who are in time restricted eating, they ate within 12 hours. They did not change their nutrition quality. But what is interesting is they both got the same Modest weight loss. So that begs the question that in the maybe Tinhay will do this experiment again to combine Nutrition advice with time restriction and maybe reduce the time to 10 hours, and that might help.[0:57:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: So 12 hours is something that I say anyone from 5 year old to 100 year old can do. And, If you are trying to maintain weight, that might be a good way, and combine that with exercise, it'll be great.[0:57:20] Andrew Huberman: And you and people can more easily avoid reds. Yeah. In that way, women and for nonathletes or recreational exercises, it sounds like women, if they distribute their calories across 12 hours, are less likely to lose their Menstrual cycle.[0:57:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So, again, this is something that we have to look carefully. They have to be because we do have the MyCircadianClock that many people download and self monitor, and they share the data for researchers. And[0:57:44] Andrew Huberman: We won't provide a link to that, by the way. It's a great it's a great tool.[0:57:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. But But once in a while, we do get this input from some women saying, oh, I started doing your time machine eating, and I I'm seeing all these problems. And then I asked them, okay. So what else are you doing? They typically improve their nutrition quality, so they're eating only salad and few and they're trying to increase the fiber intake.[0:58:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: And it's really hard to eat so much of uncooked food because cooking helps to absorb more nutrient, and then at the same time, they're running 5 miles every day. And, of course, all of this combinedly can lead to reds like symptom. So that's why 12, I think, is a Good point if you're combining, physical exercise and better nutrition quality. Because in mice also, we have seen that if mice are eating healthy food And they're eating within 10 to 12 hours, then they also live longer than mice that are eating healthy food but distributing that calorie over a long period of time. And this is, Rafa Jacobo's finding from NIH.[0:58:50] Dr. Satchin Panda: He has systematically done this study with 2 different types of diet and in mice, and he finds the same thing that even mice that are eating within 12 hours, They do live longer than mice that eat randomly, even healthy food.[0:59:05] Andrew Huberman: I I recall a recent Study, I think it was either published in Cell Reports or Cell Reports Medicine. Forgive me for not remembering which, but both, of course, cell press journals, excellent journals, which explored time restricted feeding in the context of low carbohydrate or non low carbohydrate diet. So it's low carbohydrate versus Low carbohydrate end time restricted. Yeah. So these all caloric matched Yeah.[0:59:27] Andrew Huberman: Right, between groups. And then non Low carbohydrate diet. So it's a more standard, I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% of calories from complex carbohydrates. And and as I recall, the, the greatest weight loss, remember, same calories across groups, folks, was achieved with Low carbohydrate plus caloric restriction. Yeah.[0:59:49] Andrew Huberman: And I wondered why all the popular news venues didn't cover that Study, but that's why I'm bringing it up now. I thought this is really interesting, and, and I'm somebody who's, cycled low carbohydrate diet Yeah. Before. I find it hard to sleep after about 3 or 4 days of being on a low starch Yeah. Diet.[1:00:07] Andrew Huberman: Just personally, I so I like to some starches Yeah. Especially if exercising intensely or working intensely. That's just[1:00:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:00:13] Andrew Huberman: A little editorial there that, but, Look. I know many people who do just feel better on a low carbohydrate diet. But Yeah. What do you think of those data? Because it speaks to the idea that, okay, it's not just the total number of calories.[1:00:25] Andrew Huberman: It's not just the quality of those calories. It's the timing of those calories and maybe carbohydrate restriction in conjunction with Time restricted feeding might be the best path for people who are looking to lose weight.[1:00:40] Dr. Satchin Panda: No. I I totally agree that when it comes to nutrition, Quality, quantity, and timing, all these 3 matter. Nearly 40% of people who maintain healthy body weight Because 60% are overweight and obese, 40% are maintaining healthy body weight. And out of those 40%, I would say nearly majority of them are very aware about how much they're eating and what quality of food they're eating.[1:01:04] Andrew Huberman: So you're really an optimist. You're looking at the 40% of the glass that's, Or should we say not full? The yeah. That was a pun intended. But the, no.[1:01:13] Andrew Huberman: That's a very interesting way of looking at. Rather than saying, you know, why are 60% of Americans obese? Saying, why are 40% not obese? That's a very interesting way to look at it.[1:01:23] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. I mean, subconsciously, we're always making that decision. Means I know Means I'm sure that you are not going and eating, cheeseburger every day because, you want to improve.[1:01:34] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right. No. Yeah. Exactly.[1:01:35] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't feel good. Yeah. Enjoy a cheeseburger now and again, but I, Yeah. No. Not certainly not at this stage or any stage of my life.[1:01:42] Andrew Huberman: I think that, I think people, Actually, you think the pandemic had a lot to do with this. I think that people started to take a look at what they were doing to[1:01:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: Mhmm.[1:01:54] Andrew Huberman: Support or not support their health generally. Yeah. I know people gained a lot of weight during the pandemic. Other people got really into fitness. I've seen some colleagues, so you've always maintained, you've always been in good shape.[1:02:05] Andrew Huberman: Actually, it's the 1st time I've seen you in a while, and you seem to have aged backwards. So you are a a poster, For your own, ideas and hypotheses about time restricted feeding, but but I, I noticed that during the pandemic, a number of people emerged from the pandemic in better shape. Other people in much worse shape. It seemed like it was a it was a, like, a bimodal distribution there. Yeah.[1:02:26] Andrew Huberman: So, yeah, I get the sense that Starting and stopping eating at more or less the same time each day, even if caloric restriction is not The main focus Yeah. Has additional benefits.[1:02:41] Dr. Satchin Panda: Can[1:02:41] Andrew Huberman: we talk about some of those benefits as they relate to the other things that impact health? So for instance, if you're starting and stopping eating at more or less the same times each day Mhmm. Are you sleeping better? Are you getting more predictable, shifts in alertness and sleepiness. Like, can you predict when you'll feel good enough to exercise?[1:03:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Maybe we could talk about that because you, of course, Are well known for time restricted feeding and the science around that, but also other things as well, not the least of which is circadian biology generally. So I always think of the main Timekeepers for our system being feeding, light, activity Yep. And social connection. Did I miss and maybe temp and temperature.[1:03:21] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:03:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So how do these combine with one another? And using timing that we begin and stop feeding is kind of an Can we explore that a little bit?[1:03:29] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So, you know, we got into this beginning and end, and then we You asked for the calorie. How much calorie will break the fast? One thing that I want, the listeners and viewers to Bring back to this timing of when we're when we are breaking the fast because we equate health with weight body weight. And, that's when we are talking about nutrition quality and quantity because both of them have impact.[1:04:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: So now let's think about mental health because a lot of people do struggle with mental health. They have anxiety or depression And also, so gut health because there are a lot of people who also have acid reflux or heartburn. And we know that acid reflux or heartburn can be exacerbated by caffeine intake in empty stomach. Those who have acid reflux of heartburn, they're prone to that than having black coffee in the morning before any food, can offset their stomach. So that's why in those cases, it's very clearly that Caffeine for them becomes the trigger.[1:04:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: There's something the food is supposed to come, and then the stomach is not seeing the food. So it's Overreacting, producing excess acid, and that comes up to the asiophagus, and that's what they're experiencing. So if people have that kind of condition, then maybe they should consider when they drink their 1st coffee is breaking their Overall fast or kind of putting them putting their health at risk for acid reflux. The other thing is people who have anxiety, panic attack, we know that caffeine can judge you off.[1:05:21] Andrew Huberman: Especially on an empty stomach.[1:05:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: Especially on an empty stomach. So for them, again, caffeine can be a trigger. So that's why, I want to kind of differentiate that there is this mental health and other aspects of health, and these are two clear examples where anxiety, panic attack related to brain health, acid reflux related to our gut health. In those cases, When we consume that caffeine in the morning can affect. So[1:05:53] Andrew Huberman: Do you avoid caffeine in the morning?[1:05:55] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, actually, here is the interesting, history about caffeine, and this is something I did not know. And, I was once invited to this history of Nighttime activity. And maybe we can take a little bit of detour and talk about, nighttime activity because that me as a circadian biologist, because over the last 200000 years means we assume that humans, Homo sapiens, evolved 200,000 years ago. So we have been as a species, we have been living on this planet for 200,000 years. And only in the last, You can say couple of 1000 or 5000 years when we came to control fire, or maybe you can even go back to 100000 years.[1:06:40] Dr. Satchin Panda: There is some debate. So then the question is, well, when we control fire and we light it up the fire And we could light up whenever we wanted. We can add fuel, and we can stop the fire when we don't want it. That's the key ability in humans that differentiates them from all the other species. No other species.[1:07:09] Dr. Satchin Panda: We can always say, yes. There are signs of this intelligent, decision making. For example, we know Many crows can make decision. Many many animals, they kind of figure out, strategize how to get food, but controlled use of fire is something very specific to human. And when we started, controlling fire, fire did not Essentially extend the day because fire created a evening that is very different from what people did during the day And what people used to do during day, they worked a lot.[1:07:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: Means gathering food was almost everything that we did. And so in the evening, after the after the after we brought, food, mostly tubers or maybe lentils to cook or once in a while, animals so that we can we could barbecue. All of these things happened around fire. And fire was so expensive that it was mostly communal fire. So if you go back to, for example, Maasai And, all these and such sorry.[1:08:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: Populations that have no access to electricity and are still living Kind of that, historical life. Fire is a communal event, and they sat around. They cooked food. And then what happened? They did not talk about work.[1:08:34] Dr. Satchin Panda: They talked about, culture. They talk they sang. They danced. They strategize. That's how politics started.[1:08:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: Philosophy started. Science started. All of these things that are very unique to Human civilization started around fireside chat. So, in that way, if we think about it, we are still doing fireside the only thing is we have the microwave and the television, social media.[1:09:01] Andrew Huberman: And now we chat with[1:09:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: our thumbs. Right? So it's still so we are hooked to that evening activity because that's when we are completely free from the pressure of the work, and we want to ourselves. That's our independent time. So that's why most people find it very difficult to do time ratio eating and Stop eating at 6 o'clock because it's ingrained in our in our even DNA that we want to eat and socialize in the evening.[1:09:31] Dr. Satchin Panda: So now, let's fast forward and see what is the role of coffee in this. If you look at Coffee consumption, particularly cafe, where people can come and have little bit of coffee and socialize. It also started as a evening activity. And, this is in now we can go back to Istanbul because that's one place where coffee cafes Started in mid 16th century. So we are talking about 15/40 to 15/70, and that's when, I'm sorry.[1:10:09] Dr. Satchin Panda: I'm forgetting the name of historians who who actually invited me and okay. His name is Jamal Kefardar. And, I must be butchering the name, but I'll try it more.[1:10:21] Andrew Huberman: The spelling. And the wonderful thing about Social media, somebody will tell us on YouTube the proper pronunciation. So it's a great opportunity. If you know the proper pronunciation, please put it in the comments on YouTube.[1:10:32] Dr. Satchin Panda: I'm, actually, I'm even checking right now in my, EndNote library. It's not picking up that.[1:10:37] Andrew Huberman: That's right. We'll we'll provide a link.[1:10:39] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. We'll provide a link. So What happened was, so coffee was introduced, and, people came and drank coffee and talked about politics.[1:10:48] Andrew Huberman: At night.[1:10:49] Dr. Satchin Panda: At night. At evening. And it actually started with, with Sufi branch of Islam because they are the ones who, consumed coffee in the evening, and this is the branch of Islam where they actually sing and dance and all that happened in the evening. So singing, dancing, by the Sufis. And then here in Istanbul, people started Congregating and having, talk about politics.[1:11:18] Dr. Satchin Panda: But then around the same time, some you know, In Turkey, there was a good sizable number of, Muslims who have to do 5 prayers a day, number of prayers at set time. The 1st prayer is very early in the morning, and then they figured out that if they wake up and immediately have coffee, then they can stay awake for the 1st prayer. And in that way, they felt pretty good. They woke up. So that's how it started as a morning drink to stay awake and kind of get get on with the day.[1:11:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: But what happened was I don't know whether you have ever tried Turkish coffee. It's very thick.[1:11:58] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Yeah. A few years ago, right before the pandemic, 2019, I traveled to Turkey as first of all, the food is amazing. The coffee is indeed very, very thick. Yeah.[1:12:09] Andrew Huberman: And I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance[1:12:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:12:13] Andrew Huberman: From drinking so much coffee and Yerba Mate over the years I still do. I really enjoy it, but, yeah, it's it's very intense. And so what you're saying is that, Coffee intake started as a way to extend into the night. The ability to extend into the night at all was because of the ability to harness fire, And then coffee's stimulatory properties were leveraged toward morning, which is essentially, like, The way I think about it, we did an episode on caffeine and some, someone else, Michael Paul and Nadai, described it this way that you're sort of Taking a loan out on your energy bank account with coffee. You're suppressing the adenosine system.[1:12:52] Andrew Huberman: Adenosine makes you sleepy, but that adenosine system will kick in later. So you're you're it's a credit card of sorts with an interest. Yeah.[1:12:58] Dr. Satchin Panda: Right? Yeah.[1:12:59] Andrew Huberman: Right? And the interest being, an energetic lag that you're going to, experience in the afternoon. Yeah.[1:13:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: But what happened was with the strong coffee, that gave heartburn and acid reflux to lot of people. So then they started eating something with coffee, and that's how the culture of breakfast started in Turkey.[1:13:21] Andrew Huberman: So coffee actually led to the development of breakfast, not the other way around.[1:13:26] Dr. Satchin Panda: And that, yeah. So it[1:13:27] Andrew Huberman: That's very heartening. No again, no pun intended, for the, the caffeine, lovers among us, which I count myself one of those.[1:13:37] Dr. Satchin Panda: So, essentially, the food before coffee became breakfast. So you kind of give something to your, to your stomach it's busy digesting that, and then when the coffee comes in, it's not reacting to coffee and creating, acid reflux.[1:13:53] Andrew Huberman: So it wasn't it's fascinating. So it wasn't that breakfast is necessary on its own. It was essentially a buffer against the gastric Distress caused by caffeine and drink.[1:14:04] Dr. Satchin Panda: In that culture means in that context. We cannot say that whether the same thing happened in all over the world where coffee is not consumed, but Still, people eat something in the morning.[1:14:15] Andrew Huberman: You said you start your, 1st meal, of the day at around 8. What time do you wake up?[1:14:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: You wake up around 6. I started to 6.[1:14:22] Andrew Huberman: What time do you have your 1st caffeine?[1:14:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: No. Actually, I have so that's why I brought up this story because I have coffee after my breakfast.[1:14:30] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. I'm a big proponent of delaying caffeine intake for a few hours after waking for other reasons that my listeners have heard me talk about endlessly, so I won't bother with that now. But I think, allowing, just suffice to say that allowing some of the natural waking up signals to occur Yeah. And using light to Kind of clear away in adenosine to further extend an activity that is better than using a stimulant, but until a few hours later. This is fascinating because I've never thought about the link between extension into the night, socialization or socializing rather, feeding and caffeine.[1:15:07] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand What sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based interventions you might wanna take on in order To adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health, to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.[1:16:00] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, go to insidetracker.com/huberman. They have a special promotion right now through Pie Day, March 14th, where you can get 31% off their ultimate plan. This is their biggest promotion of the year. Again, if you go to insidetracker.com/huberman, you can get 31% off their ultimate plan.[1:16:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: Now, actually, I'm kind of, Speaking what many other researchers have found, and this this particularly this fireside chat, I'm forgetting again the name of the scientist. I think she's from University of Washington, Seattle. She went to Africa and kind of recorded What people are talking, of course, you could not understand what they were talking.[1:16:42] Andrew Huberman: Twitter and whether or not Tesla's stock is going up. Of course. No. No. Just Just kidding, folks.[1:16:48] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then came back and tried to translate and then figured out that Exactly. What they're talking during daytime and in the evening were very different. So, so so,[1:16:58] Andrew Huberman: what are they talking about at night? Do you[1:17:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: So exactly. So this is like, they're talking about, Matchmaking and talking about politics and strategizing to gather food or or, Even singing and dancing. So this is, if you think if we think about it, how we manage sunset to our bedtime. What we do between sunset and bedtime affects most of our health.[1:17:30] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna think about that for a moment. I totally agree. And by the way, I'm a huge believer, and And I'm in living in great hope for the idea that right now, I do think that scientists understand a lot more about the different stages of sleep, Slow wave sleep, REM sleep, etcetera. Then we do active waking states. Mhmm.[1:17:50] Andrew Huberman: Like, we talk about being focused or being alert, but that's not those aren't scientific terms as we know. But I do believe and I've noticed a distinct difference between the 1st 8 hours of the day in terms of cognition, and we know that the Cholamines are at much higher levels plus cortisol, so dopamine, cortisol, epinephrine, all of that is really at much higher levels than in the later evening. And so the this evening time, it certainly in the context of mental health, we know that morning and evening, we are basically different creatures.[1:18:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:18:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Completely.[1:18:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So that's why I I think in the evening, if you think about it, again, this is, again, another set of research from, my Good friend Horacio, who[1:18:34] Andrew Huberman: Di Iglesias?[1:18:35] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.[1:18:36] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big fan of Horacio. Another he's a fellow Argentine. So, occasionally, we riff about things related to that, but he's a wonderful biologist. Are you guys collaborating?[1:18:45] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. He's he's kind of, I say he's very humble and keeps a low profile, but he does Amazing, amazing research. Totally agree. He does research that, we want to know, but nobody is ready to do it because field research It's very difficult to go to the wilderness or go to the places where there is no electricity and then record, when these people are eating, sleeping, or in this case, activity, exposure to light, that's what Horacio has done. And, he puts this active watch, which is kind of a modern, activity tracker, but it's a little bit more refined because it also collects Light information.[1:19:29] Dr. Satchin Panda: What he found was most of these Argentinian tovas who have no access to electricity, they consistently go to bed somewhere between 3 to 3 and a half hours after sunset. So this is very important because we always think that, our ancestors, when they didn't have electricity, as soon as the sun went down, they just went to sleep. No. The fire extended their evening. So they were staying awake for 3 to 4 hours kind of, you know, decompressing themselves that We said and then doing all these, activities, cooking, sharing meals, and then they would go to sleep.[1:20:07] Dr. Satchin Panda: And if you look at the sleep onset Variability, it was very small. Like, they're going to bed almost within 15 to 30 minutes standard deviation.[1:20:16] Andrew Huberman: So no night owls versus morning people this[1:20:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: So we'll get to that.[1:20:20] Andrew Huberman: None of this this, the I get attacked by, For many reasons, it just goes with the the business I'm in of being public facing these days. But every time I talk about viewing sunrise or low angle Like, you know, getting some sunlight early, and someone says, well, I'm a night owl, and they just it's almost like a a protest of trying to protect identity. It's become this ideological, I I I identity related thing. I'm a night owl. I'm a morning person, and I'm not.[1:20:48] Andrew Huberman: But you're telling me that In these cultures where there isn't electricity, but there is fire, people are going to sleep within all of them within about 15 minutes of one another. Yeah. So there is no such thing as a night owl or a morning person in the[1:21:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: context of Actually, I asked him pointedly because, and then he said, no. He he has not seen. Means he has tracked hundreds of people. And if we ask, there are many many sleep researchers of, at least the public facing CLIP, physicians or experts, they will say, yeah. We can say 1 third of people are night owl, 1 third are morning, and then 1 third are between, but Yeah.[1:21:25] Andrew Huberman: They call them, like, bears, wolves, and you know? And I'm not being disparaging of that idea. I think people really do feel as, as if they Orient towards one pattern or another.[1:21:34] Dr. Satchin Panda: When I was an undergrad student, I never went to bed before midnight. And, actually, midnight was my Going to bedtime. Exactly. Like, 11:45, I'll try to get ready to hit bed. And then by 12, I'm in bed, and I used to get up at 6, 6:15.[1:21:49] Andrew Huberman: That's still a That's a pretty short sleep.[1:21:51] Dr. Satchin Panda: With an alarm, of course. And but then daytime, I used to take 45 minutes to 1 hour nap, and that was regular. Like, even if, whenever I got time of course, in college, you know, you don't have the whole depth. Unlike in high school, you don't have Opportunity to nap, but in college, you can.[1:22:10] Andrew Huberman: I might have[1:22:10] Dr. Satchin Panda: been one of[1:22:11] Andrew Huberman: those kids with his hoodie on napping on the desk, but they come around and they wake you up.[1:22:14] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. But in and this guy has just come back to the dorm, and, after lunch, usually I used to take nap. So, then in grad school, I remember I did I rarely went to bed before 2 AM, and I could have clearly said that I'm a night owl, and, actually, I was at night owl. I was very comfortable staying up so late. I was very productive doing experiments, writing all these, manuscripts mostly.[1:22:42] Dr. Satchin Panda: And But then afterwards, when I look back, in postdoc, when I had, when we had our daughter, then things started changing because you have to put the baby to sleep. And then after the baby slits, it's almost when you have a baby, your life revolves around the baby. So Then we had to dim down the light. There is no caffeine and alcohol drinking or any other things after the baby sleeps because we cannot do too much noise and all this. Then I realized that, no, I'm actually not a night owl.[1:23:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: And I became kind of more normal because I could go to sleep between 10 and 11. And, that's how I thought, well, maybe this is very unique to me. But what is interesting is, I have another, colleague, good friend, Ken Wright junior.[1:23:43] Andrew Huberman: At Colorado.[1:23:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: At Colorado. Yeah. And he also had grad students and, and postdocs like me who strongly believed that they were night owls, just like everybody else. And he took Ken took the whole lab for camping. And when they were camping, of course, there is less light And lot of physical activity hiking during the day, and they all went to bed, between 9 and 10:30 PM.[1:24:10] Andrew Huberman: I love that study. Yeah. What Sachin just described was a study. I think there were 2 studies.[1:24:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: Oh, there are 2. Yeah.[1:24:15] Andrew Huberman: And, what's interesting as I recall is that After going camping for a weekend where people, wake with this more or less with the sunrise[1:24:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:24:24] Andrew Huberman: And go to sleep a few hours after sunset Yeah. Their melatonin rhythms and cortisol rhythms and sleep wake rhythms persisted on that schedule For several weeks, despite returning to environments where there was a lot of artificial lighting, which I find amazing that Yeah. Just a weekend of consistent Rising and, going to bed with the sunrise and sunset Yeah. More or less allowed a reset that was very long lasting.[1:24:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So, actually, even in Horacio's study, he found that almost all the, they wake up around, sunrise time. And it's amazing when I look at the standard deviation. It's, like, so tight.[1:25:08] Andrew Huberman: So take that night owl so called night owls. Also in graduate school, I would work until 2 AM. I loved it. I have blast music in the lab. Everyone was at home pretty much, not everyone, but There were the the night crew, and then I'd get in sometime around get up for sometime around 9:30, 10, and then get in around 11, and it was no problem because I was going to stay so very late.[1:25:29] Andrew Huberman: And then over time, I noticed I become more locked to a standard schedule. So I think what we're saying is that the clock can our internal clocks can shift. Yeah. But this idea that we are genetically biased towards one schedule or another may need revisiting. That's what that's the conclusion I'm taking from this.[1:25:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: A couple of aspects. One is, you know, some people are genetically so reprogrammed because the other flip side is, what is called technically familial advanced sleep phase syndrome. So these people, You can give them caffeine or whatever, but they will fall asleep, say, at 8 o'clock. They cannot stay awake till 9 or 10. And since it's a very strong phenotype in sleep and circadian rhythm field, they are very well studied.[1:26:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: So in fact, Louis Ptacek and Ingvie Fu, they were the first one to track 1 family like this, and then they figured out there was a mutation in one of the clogged genes Period 2, that clogged in, and that mutation allowed the clock to run-in a way that These people went to bed very early.[1:26:36] Andrew Huberman: I guess, historically, given these fireside chats, Those people were probably not contributing much to the political discussion. Whatever there was decided after they went to sleep is what they woke up into. That reminds me because as you were describing the difference between nighttime discussions versus morning discussions, is there any theme to what is discussed in the morning versus in the nighttime? Are people Sipping their eating and sipping their caffeine and just waking up. But but is is there are there any ideas about what really consistent.[1:27:06] Dr. Satchin Panda: Morning discussions or daytime discussions are mostly about, work and like hunting, gathering, or farming, all that stuff. And even these days, that's what we do. We, you know, you go to, I go to work, and it's mostly one Meeting up another, and, we're talking about how means different committees and you're solving problems or your students come with questions. You have your TA Oh, the office hours, all these things work related. We're not talking, I mean, serious philosophy of Unless you are in a philosophy department and you are talking about political science.[1:27:45] Dr. Satchin Panda: And also we are not singing and dancing. So that's why The evening activity even these days are very different. And, typically, the evening activities are where we express ourselves. We express who we are. We feel like we are free.[1:28:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, you know, you and I, we have this Academic intellectual freedom. We can talk about our work just like we are talking now. There are a lot of people who work for even in Tech industry, they may be working for Google and all these big tech companies. They cannot talk about their work to anybody else.[1:28:21] Andrew Huberman: It's all secret.[1:28:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: It's all secret. So just imagine, they're staying up so they're spending more than half of their wake up time at work Thinking and doing work, but they cannot talk about that work even sometimes to their own family members. So then what happens for them, A lot of people also do the same thing, like, the person who is going and baking in a restaurant or cooking or the person who is, Taking trust and driving.[1:28:52] Andrew Huberman: Or nurses and doctors can't talk about their patients. There's no confidentiality.[1:28:56] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah. And some people just don't want to talk about it. It's stressful. They don't want to bring that stress home.[1:29:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's why I always say that from sunset until we go to bed, During that time, we try to find time for ourselves. People say this is me time. The me time is essentially We want to truly express who we are, or we want to entertain ourselves. Because On the fireside chat, it's not that everybody was a performer. There are also some audience.[1:29:28] Dr. Satchin Panda: So we always switch Our role, sometimes we are performing, and sometimes we are observing. So that's what happens with me time. I love[1:29:36] Andrew Huberman: it. So, Maybe social media time should be restricted to just maybe a small portion of that evening time, because I would hope that people would also interact socially[1:29:44] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:29:44] Andrew Huberman: Within in the real estate.[1:29:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: Constructive way, or maybe you use that for connect with your family members, whom you'll Love or you can have some productive discussion or something. So it's, it's kind of interesting.[1:29:56] Andrew Huberman: I think it's extremely interesting because I think, again, this this conversation about Time restricted feeding is really a conversation about[1:30:03] Dr. Satchin Panda: Circadian rhythms.[1:30:04] Andrew Huberman: And sleep wake activity and human evolution. Right?[1:30:08] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's why let's go back to this, night owl because, we we kind of made a comment that maybe it's not genetic, but, this is where I'm still wrapping my head around Because, you know, these days, there's some, GWAS studies, where they're trying to look at night owls to see whether there are some Genetic, Lincolns. And, you know, sometimes we always think, yeah, if you take half a 1000000 people, of course, you'll find some low side. But going back to this idea that are some people more sensitive to light so that it's likely that the same Level applied even in the same household may make some people stay awake late into the night, whereas other people are more resistant to light so that they can go to bed early. And since light has become so prevalent these days and this Toba story that we are talking about people going on camping, there is we have removed that light. So there is some, evidence that people's light sensitivity, particularly the iPRGC of this intrinsically photosensitive The retinal ganglion cell or the simple speakers, the blue light sensors in our eyes, there seems to be even 1 log unit change in Sensitivity as measured by pupil constriction.[1:31:33] Andrew Huberman: So for some people, a small amount of artificial light at night could really shift their circadian clock. Yeah. Wake them up essentially.[1:31:41] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then for some, it may not.[1:31:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm very sensitive to light at night. Yeah. Exquisitely sensitive to it.[1:31:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: Oh, so then you are like a teenager?[1:31:49] Andrew Huberman: Yes. In many ways. I've been told this. Thank you. Yeah.[1:31:54] Andrew Huberman: I think. I have actually switched to using a red night light, but I should be clear, not a fancy high cost red light for sake of any kind of infrared simulation, but a red party light type light, and I find that that was based on reading 1 study that we covered in an episode on jet lag and shift work, which was that it seems to reduce the cortisol releasing properties of light at night to use red shifted light.[1:32:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:32:20] Andrew Huberman: So I just Use a red light bulb. I actually travel with 1. If I go to an Airbnb or hotel and I switch to red light, and I find that I fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night Yeah. Much more consistently. Yeah.[1:32:30] Andrew Huberman: Especially in when I'm in new environments where it always makes it disruptive Yeah. To sleep. It's made an enormous difference in the depth and duration of my sleep, And, because oftentimes, hotel lights, you know, in the bathroom, you'll turn them on. You just you're just getting being and you're right. Some people don't seem to To be bothered by that.[1:32:48] Andrew Huberman: I I I really struggle with that.[1:32:51] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah. And in fact, in teen as right after puberty, there seems to be I think that's when, the teenagers become more sensitive sensitive to light, and it's very It's well known that the teenage boys and girls, they tend to stay awake late into the night, and they can stay up to 12 mid past midnight. Although they can stay of that late, that doesn't mean that their sleep schedule is reduced. Their body still needs The same amount of sleep as other teenagers, so that's why they are more likely not to wake up at 6:30 or 7 when we Expect them to wake up and go to school.[1:33:30] Dr. Satchin Panda: Mhmm. I have[1:33:32] Andrew Huberman: a question, and I ask every circadian related biologists I can come into contact with this, and no one has been able to give me an answer one way or the other, but I grew up hearing that every hour of sleep before midnight was of more value or potency than the hours after midnight. And indeed, I find that if I go to sleep at 9:30 or 10 PM, I can wake up at 3 or 4. I am feeling pretty fantastic and ready to lean into the day, but if I get the equivalent number of hours of sleep starting at midnight, I feel like complete garbage when I wake up after 5, 6 hours. So, is there any truth to the idea that going to sleep within 3 hours of sunset is somehow better for our circadian timing mechanisms?[1:34:18] Dr. Satchin Panda: Well, there are a few things. 1, you said that you are very sensitive to light, I assume that you also avoid bright light in the evening. Mhmm.[1:34:26] Andrew Huberman: As best I can. Yeah.[1:34:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: As best as you could can. And then what is happening is with At sense of that bright light, your melatonin levels begin to rise. You are prepared for sleep. Of course, this is something that we cannot measure because Measuring melatonin in every 1 hour or 30 minutes, is very difficult, and there is no consumer facing product yet. So it's likely that your your body is preparing very well under this dim light to fall asleep.[1:34:56] Dr. Satchin Panda: And when you are trying to stay awake and go Sleep at midnight, then maybe from midnight for the 1st 3 or 4 hours, you are sleeping well. But then after that, Melatonin level might be beginning to fall, and it's not only melatonin in your core body temperature and then your heart rate and everything is changing to make awake, but the sleep debt that you have accumulated is pushing you to be in bed. So there is this Tension between the circadian aspect and your sleep date, and, unfortunately, you cannot Have good night of restorative sleep for the second half of the sleep because of the tension.[1:35:36] Andrew Huberman: That makes good sense.[1:35:37] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So that's why, you know, you are not the only one means, there are many people who who experience that. And in fact, a lot of people think that, well, This may be the way I sleep. Maybe I am not, I am not designed to sleep restoratively until, You know, I sleep one day just like the camping trip.[1:35:59] Andrew Huberman: And then they realize what what it feels like to[1:36:01] Dr. Satchin Panda: be What do you what you're missing?[1:36:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Absolutely. I I wanna make sure that we talk about the other aspect of fire, which is, you had a paper that came out recently, very interesting paper, Studying firefighters and time restricted feeding in firefighters. Would you share with us the the general contour, maybe even some of the specifics of of that study? Because I think it's Very interesting for for sake of shift workers, but for everybody, really, to understand these results.[1:36:26] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So let's go back to shift workers Because, this also relates to all of us, because I always say that each of us is a shift worker or has lived the life of a shift worker, And we have experienced how terrible difficult it is. And now let's start with what is the definition of a shift worker, shift work like lifestyle. There is no universal definition, unfortunately, but there are many European countries. And particularly, if you go to international labor organization, then you'll find some references.[1:37:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: Different European countries have slightly different definition, which essentially points to if you stay awake for 2 or more hours During your habitual sleep time. And when they say habitual sleep time, they assume that we are Just like you said, we are kind of programmed to sleep somewhere between, say, 10 PM and then stay in bed and kind of wake up after 5 AM. So the idea is if you stay if you're staying awake for 2 or more hours between 10 PM and 5 AM, And you are engaged in some activity, whether it's physical activity or intellectual activity. You are not lying in bed and wondering worrying about something, but actually working. So that defines that's defined as shift work, and you don't have to do it every single day.[1:37:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: Even if you do it once a week for 50 weeks, then that itself is enough to disrupt your physiology and metabolism behavior, brain function like a shift worker. The reason is, as you discussed, When you change our external timing queue, so in this case, when you travel jet lag or or traveling across 3 days, 3 hours of jet lag will take, 3 days to, reset. Similarly, if you're staying awake for 2 hours extra or if you're waking up 2 hours before your habitual wake up time, then We just don't get wake up and then be engaged in some activity in the dark. Most of us are men's, unless you are wearing infrared goggles. We turn on light, and light resets our clock.[1:38:47] Dr. Satchin Panda: So in that way, every time We stay up for 2 or more hours even for 1 night. Then for the next 2 nights, our clock is kind of trying to catch up. So in that way, for 3 days, the day of the disruption and then 2 days following the disruption, a clock is trying to catch up with the outside time. So clock our body is not on time with our clock. So that means almost for half of the week or half of the year, our clock is trying to catch up.[1:39:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's the definition of shift work. So now let's come back to, department of level statistics, US government. They have not been tracking what percentage of people are doing shift work, accurately because there are many difficulties in tracking too. But it's generally accepted that 1 in 5 working adults is a card carrying shift worker. Hard carrying shift workers means they are nurses, doctors, firefighters, and bakers, truck drivers, than many in the service industry.[1:40:03] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's 1 in 5. So 20% of working adults. Then if we think about All the college students, just like I was doing and you must have done,[1:40:15] Andrew Huberman: they're also deadlines.[1:40:17] Dr. Satchin Panda: Grant their lines. Then we are also experiencing experiencing the lifestyle of a shift worker because we're delaying Sleep, even if you're delaying sleep by 2 hours for most of the cholestrans for 5 days and then the weekend, you are trying to catch up. That's kind of a circadian disruption going on. Then you take 1.5 or 1,600,000 new moms, in the US every year. So when the child is born, then that mother is a shift worker.[1:40:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, actually, that mother is worse than a shift worker because, you know, you don't know what time of the night the baby will wake up and how many times, and there is no weekend In motherhood. So they're also living the life of a shipworker. We don't count many food delivery and, Uber driver, Lyft drivers, and ship workers, but there many of them we know that they live. So in that way, we think the actual number of people who are experiencing the life of a shift worker is, somewhere around 50% of the adult population at any given time. So that's why it's also another point that you might have heard from people.[1:41:31] Dr. Satchin Panda: They'll say, oh, I cannot do time Because my schedule is messed up, or I work in a different way. And, that comes into play. So that's why we thought, okay. So we should try something on shift worker. Another point is although 1 in 5 people are shift workers, They carry disproportionately heavier burden of disease because almost all age related disease that we can think of, whether it's High blood pressure.[1:42:03] Dr. Satchin Panda: Usually, high blood pressure starts in forties or fifties. High cholesterol, Gastrointestinal problem in digestion, chronic, inflammation of the colon and then even, colon cancer in many cases, And then, of course, diabetes, all of these are disproportionately more prevalent among shift workers. But then when you think about clinical trials, whether it's a drug or a lifestyle, often One of the top 10 exclusion factor criteria is shift work. So people who are doing shift work, We exclude them from many of these, trials. One thing is most physicians and most Scientists, even people who do shift work, they know that their their body and mind is so messed up that oftentimes, even medications may not help them.[1:43:01] Dr. Satchin Panda: And so that's why we don't try a new medication. Why to take the risk? And we know it may not help them. And then when it comes to lifestyle intervention, whether it's, sleep extension, for example, we cannot do because they are supposed to stay awake and do their job. We cannot ask them to stay Sleep at night.[1:43:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then physical activity and exercise, some people can do, but some people are so tired after all night That they don't have the energy to do physical activity. And then nutrition, again, most nutrition studies involve, the participants to come to the clinic and get 1 on 1 or 1 or attend group sessions, And they cannot come, and they cannot even sometimes come to the clinic visit, when people have to take draw blood. And in fact, there is another caveat that just if suppose I'm healthy, I have perfectly normal blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol. Everything is normal, and I live the life of a shift worker Just for 5 nights. That means I'm sleeping less, maybe 4, 5 hours.[1:44:17] Dr. Satchin Panda: And even if I don't eat At nighttime, of course, many shift workers also feel hungry and just for, to keep their work, they eat. Just after 5 days, my blood glucose level will read almost like I'm prediabetic. Wow.[1:44:34] Andrew Huberman: I actually saw a study in, publishing proceeds of the National Academy that showed that even a 100 lux dim light present in the room while people are sleeping with eyes closed can lead to disruptions in morning, blood glucose levels in directions that are not good. Yeah. 1 night. So the the faint clock in the corner or even a, a night light that's too bright[1:44:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:44:57] Andrew Huberman: Could be problematic. By the way, folks, these effects are reversible. So I whenever I say these things, I we get a lot of comments about, oh my goodness. What have I been doing for years? But, you know, kids with night lights, this is an issue.[1:45:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But what I'm hearing is that 1 in 5 people are truly shift workers in the classic sense. Their jobs require they work at night or into the night and sleep into the day, But far more people are shift workers by virtue of the fact that they're tweeting or working or watching movies at night. Even though it's not work and that they're not being paid for that time. They are essentially operating like shift workers.[1:45:36] Andrew Huberman: If we add those 2 groups together, would we say it's what, a third of Americans[1:45:41] Dr. Satchin Panda: I would say half of Americans.[1:45:42] Andrew Huberman: Half of Americans.[1:45:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. If you if you take teenagers, because, you know, High school students and college students. Because, again, going back to Horacio's, study, because Horacio also collected Activity data from high school students and college students, and we have replicated that with, high school students and college students in San Diego. So that's Seattle and San Diego. And this study now there are many sleep researchers.[1:46:06] Dr. Satchin Panda: They have been collecting this data. And what we find is, typically, the high students, they are going to bed, say, around midnight, and college students, at least the UCSD students, We found maybe 1 out of 100 who went to bed before midnight.[1:46:23] Andrew Huberman: That reminds me that Horacio Iglesias just published this really nice paper, showing that counter to what we believe, students now this is the University of Washington in Seattle, I should mention, where it's very dark in the winter. Young people, see these are people in their twenties, are staying up later in the winter months compared to the summer months[1:46:44] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:46:44] Andrew Huberman: Which is, you know, totally counterintuitive. You think everyone stays up late in the summer and goes to bed early in the winter, but because of artificial lighting, it's the exact opposite.[1:46:52] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So and another, means, I don't know whether Horacio monitored it, but my other suspicion I'm not saying whether it's true. In winter, we are more likely to consume more coffee, hot chocolate in the evening, and that might also be delaying, sleep onset.[1:47:10] Andrew Huberman: That makes sense.[1:47:11] Dr. Satchin Panda: So in that way again, here is another thing which can be related to policy or practice at educational institute. So what happened during, COVID was everybody went to remote learning. The assignments became digital and assignment submission became digital. And there are many systems online systems that came into play. And by default, the assignment submission deadline became midnight.[1:47:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: So then now what is happening is I don't know about Stanford. Maybe you are when you are giving assignment, when is the deadline?[1:47:50] Andrew Huberman: Midnight, typically.[1:47:51] Dr. Satchin Panda: Midnight. Yeah. So then most of us most students, they will try to Cram as much as possible, try to solve as much as possible and submit at midnight. And it'll be really cool to go back to your system administrator to see, Is there a so many frequency plot of frequency distribution of what time people are submitting the, assignment? Because we know, means when we submit our grant, I[1:48:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So, I mean, you know, you hear about the obesity crisis, the crisis of Metabolic disorders, not just in the US, but everywhere in the world. I mean, it's really striking. I remember going to a keystone meeting scientific meeting In, the early 2000, and there was a map of the United States, and it showed where the obesity rates were over 30% in adults. And the entire country basically was lighting up crazy.[1:48:37] Andrew Huberman: Now it would be the entire country, but there were these kind of zones in the middle, that were almost devoid of of, obesity. Colorado Yeah. Namely, Idaho at that time. Those are now also fallen under the umbrella of of rampant obesity. Yeah.[1:48:54] Andrew Huberman: And you and everyone is speculating. Okay. Is it, you know, is it seed oils? Is it, Is it this? Is it that?[1:49:01] Andrew Huberman: Is it highly processed foods? I'm I'm guessing it's all of those things, including lack of activity, but one has to wonder given everything we're talking about in terms of metabolic dysfunction, Late shifted eating, all these issues with late shifted eating and staying up late with artificial lighting, whether or not that could be one of the major factors in the so called obesity[1:49:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: It's likely. You know, we always say freshman 15.[1:49:22] Andrew Huberman: That's right.[1:49:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: This this case are gaining £15 in their freshman year in college. And, this is where I think as educator or professors, it'll be interesting to go back and see, what can we do? Because another thing that's also becoming more and more common for example, I I give a circadian rhythm class, means I just Give 2 lectures. And I remember when I started, 15, 17 years ago, that lecture used to be Around 1:30 PM or 2 PM in the afternoon, and it's a 2 and a half hour lecture, so it's done by 5. And for the last, before the pandemic, I realized that they changed the timing.[1:50:06] Dr. Satchin Panda: Now the lecture was starting at 7 PM. Mhmm. So I was finishing by 9, 9:30 PM, and these kids, they had to go and eat after 9:30. Study socialize. Socialize.[1:50:19] Andrew Huberman: Fireside chat.[1:50:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: Fireside chat and then to express themselves, like to feel free from assignments. When are they going to do that? After they submit the assignment, Then they're going to do that. So that's why we had to go back and revisit this issue, say, okay. So for adults, For most of us who are working a day job, our deadline is 5 PM in most cases.[1:50:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: Right? Means At least in university system, the person who is submitting the grant of who is doing, taking care of my IRB or IIIC, they're All living at 5 o'clock. So for me, everything has to end by 5.[1:50:56] Andrew Huberman: I think for most people out there so this raises a a kind of macroscopic Question, which is maybe it's not so much about restricting the feeding window, but maybe it's about feeding mostly and and being active mostly in the early part of the day. I mean, You know, I could imagine a time 3, 4 years from now when it's about when waking up early and going to bed within 3 hours of sunset is the protocol which harnesses all other protocols. Right? You're gonna exercise. You're gonna do it in that time.[1:51:27] Andrew Huberman: You're gonna eat. You're gonna do it in that time. You're gonna socialize. You're gonna do it Time. And in doing so, you're also avoiding a lot of the issues related to disrupted sleep.[1:51:34] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's why all these things, as you said, time restricted eating is just one aspect of the circadian health, and these are all interconnected. And going back to the comment about, within 3 hours of sunset, yes, That's good. But then what happens in, say, Toronto or Vancouver in wintertime?[1:51:55] Andrew Huberman: I guess they're going to bed very, very early, but also waking up very, very early. Yeah. You know, one of the things that I hear all the time because I'm always beating on the drum of getting morning sunlight even if through cloud cover is people say, there's no sun here This time of year, and I I forgive me, but there is sun. Unless you live in a cave, their sun is just coming through cloud cover. And no matter where you live in the world, their sun.[1:52:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[1:52:15] Andrew Huberman: Unless you live in a cave, of course. So, I wanna make sure that, we didn't overlook. What was the major conclusion to the firefighter study?[1:52:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: Go back to the Firefighter study. So the reason why we did this study was, as I said, there are a lot of us who are living the lifestyle of firefighters or, shift workers, And shift workers are excluded from studies. So that means whatever we are learning about lifestyle or even medications That may be beneficial for people who actually have a normal schedule, but not for people who have a disrupted schedule. And if you look up, clinical trial .gov, there are more than 400,000 studies listed. And if you search how many studies are on shift workers.[1:52:58] Dr. Satchin Panda: It's less than a1000. And then if you ask, most of them are to see what is wrong with shift workers. It's like that's how we know that shift work increases our risk for metabolic disease, cancer, and even some aspects of dementia. But if you ask how many studies are done to improve the health of shift work alone, that's less than 50. Means I means I have to go back and check the actual number, but it's less than 50.[1:53:26] Andrew Huberman: Wow.[1:53:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's why, we got super excited. We thought, from circadian rhythm perspective, that's something to address. So this study, Again, this kind of study is only possible because I'm at Salk, and we are affiliated with UCSD, and, I can work with UCSD physicians to do this study, so I collaborate with, doctor Pam Taub, who is the director of cardiac Rehab center in UCSD, and Pam has many firefighters as her presence. And We both know that the number one cause for death and disability on work for firefighters is not fighting fire, but just getting heart attack and, stroke. So they have a very high incidence of heart attack and stroke, and they're also highly prone to different kinds of cancer.[1:54:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: And it may be difficult to ascribe cancer to disruption, circadian disruption because they're also exposed to a lot of toxins. Anytime fire burns, That smell of fire is essentially smell of carcinogens. And their breathing, even if they have the, hood on and respirator, they still get. So the idea was very simple. We know that firefighters, nearly 70% of firefighters in the US, full time firefighters because there are volunteer firefighters and then full time firefighters.[1:54:54] Dr. Satchin Panda: The full time firefighters, 70% of them work 24 hours shift. So for example, in San I go they come in at their shift is from 8 AM to 8 AM the next day. And they do at least in San Diego, they do one day on, one day off, On, off, 4 cycles, and then 4 days off. And, but in some fire departments, they actually do 48 hour shift. So they come for 2 days, 2 days off, 2 days, 2 days off, and then 4 or 5 days[1:55:25] Andrew Huberman: off. Brutal. Thank you, firefighters.[1:55:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so then the idea was, okay, so we'll screen firefighters and then find firefighters who are, Metabolically unhealthy, and then we'll see whether they can actually follow 10 hours time restricted eating. Because The point is if firefighters can follow it, then everybody else will be because with all that stress, if they can. And this is, again, where I should Also acknowledge the San Diego Fire and Rescue Department because without their help, we could not have even submitted the grant.[1:56:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: And at that time, David Picone, who is, the health and wellness battalion chief, he's the one who actually approached us, because he's very careful. He knew that the job that they do makes them Weaker in long term and can kill them in long term. So he was always looking for new solutions. So he approached us, and then we said, this is the idea. He said, well, I love this idea because we are not asking them to sleep more, or we are not going to cut down their Over time or shift or change the work schedule, the only thing we'll be doing is ask them to eat within 10 hours.[1:56:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, hopefully, we can do this. So[1:56:45] Andrew Huberman: Consistently between the days that they're working and not working? Yes. So that means if they're from 8 AM to 8 AM working, then the next then they go home, then they're gonna eat on the same schedule they did when they were at the fire firehouse Yeah. But while at home. So they're not allowing themselves to to deviate from that.[1:57:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So, we we thought whether they can do it or not because the Number 1 goal or the primary outcome in this clinical trial was feasibility. Can they do it? And then 2nd was if they do it, then what happens to their blood sugar and weight and all this other stuff? And then we started the study, and we hit the next, Huddl, and that is, you know, firefighters are very, very tight knit community, And they want to make sure that you understand their culture.[1:57:32] Dr. Satchin Panda: And the best way to understand their culture is to live the life of a firefighter. So Emilie Manugian, who is the first author, see, and then, we had Adena Jaduriyan, who is now in med school. She was a This was coordinator at that time. They volunteered. They said, okay.[1:57:48] Dr. Satchin Panda: We'll go to the busiest fire station in San Diego, And we'll live the life of a firefighter. And the San Diego fire and rescue and the city, they all, agreed. They reported for duty at 7:30 in the morning. They were assigned a bed in the station because all fire stations do have some Beds for fire firefighters to rest, and they have assigned beds, so they were assigned a bed. Yeah.[1:58:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: So every time a 911 call came, And if that fire station in that fire station, that fire engine was called, then just like other firefighters, they had to run, get into the gears, just the shoes and, a jacket and a helmet and get in the seat and attend the call. Of course, they won't go to the side. They just get out of the truck, wait there, and come back. So in that 24 hours, Emily got 10 calls at night that She had to run to but there are more than 10 times the, they got the 91 every time the 911 call came, then there is a beep that goes out. All firefighters were sleeping or resting.[1:58:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: They'll get up. If they're doing something, they'll look up to see which engine is called.[1:59:02] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. So it's not just the ones that go out. It's everyone gets woken up.[1:59:06] Dr. Satchin Panda: Everyone gets woken up. So that means in a night, typical night, they're waking up, 10, 15, 20 times sometimes. So they're almost like, you know, new moms are like, firefighters because they don't have any idea What time the baby will cry and for what reason, also, they don't know. So similarly, it's 5 so and that's what Emily did. And then next Morning.[1:59:29] Dr. Satchin Panda: Once he came back, she was like, no.[1:59:31] Andrew Huberman: It's grad school seem easy.[1:59:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So so So then we did the study. Mhmm. And, we essentially assigned, all the firefighters we recruited, 150 firefighters, we assigned half of them to diet because you cannot do any harm. You have to give them something good.[1:59:49] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's another thing. They said, no. We want something that we know works for firefighters, and there was a Mediterranean diet study. So, So everybody was supposed to follow Mediterranean diet, and then half nearly 75 of them were supposed to eat within 10 hours. We did not fix the 10 hours because we said, you pick your own 10 hours that you can stick to.[2:00:12] Andrew Huberman: It has to be consistent from day to day. So if you start eating at 9 AM, you finish it not at, you know, at 7 PM. PM.[2:00:18] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then try to be.[2:00:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Okay.[2:00:20] Dr. Satchin Panda: Try to try try to be consistent because we said, yes, we understand that there will be some things, and you can take maybe half an hour here and there. And we'll see how many times you can do it. And, what is interesting is that they are all doing 24 hour shift. They more or less chose to begin eating somewhere between 8 AM and 11 AM. Mhmm.[2:00:42] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, they Did not skip any meal. They had their 1st meal or what we call breakfast, but it was several hours after waking up because they are waking up at 5 or 6. And they're driving to come to work at 7:30 or 8, and they're eating the 1st meal, say, between 8 and 11, And then the finished meal, 10 hours later. And what we found is more or less, most of them could stick to doing this at least 5 days out of 7 days. And then at the end of the study when we look at, their health parameters, one thing, as I said, we recruited everybody who can.[2:01:25] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that means a lot nearly 1 in 3 firefighters were completely healthy. They had no sign of any, any illness. No high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, depression, or anything. So since we have 1 third of the population who are already healthy, And then everybody has slightly different conditions. Some have high blood pressure, but they don't have high blood glucose.[2:01:50] Dr. Satchin Panda: Somebody has high blood glucose, but not high blood pressure. So it is kind of heterogeneous. So we did not see big difference in weight loss or any weight change between these two groups. Another thing is Firefighters actually run almost 8 to 9 miles when they're at the job because that's part of their Mhmm. Exercise routine.[2:02:14] Dr. Satchin Panda: But then one thing that changed significantly in the time restating group was, what we call B LDL Particle size and particle number because this is something that we know is very low density lipoprotein. These are atherogenic. And if we can manage them much better, then we reduce the risk for atherosclerosis. So that's one parameter that changed in the time distributing group Even when you combine all healthy, unhealthy, everybody. Now if we take firefighters who are Beginning with high blood pressure, then we saw significant reduction in the systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure.[2:02:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: And the change in blood pressure, of course, we don't claim that in the manuscript. But when we talk about it, some physician would get up and say, Wow. That looks like almost there on a blood pressure lowering drug. So the extent of blood pressure lowering is equivalent to somebody taking a antihypertensive drug. Amazing.[2:03:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. And then those who started with high blood sugar, of course, we didn't have too many type 2 diabetic, but there are few few prediabetic. And they could better manage their blood glucose. And this is interesting because once shift workers Become prediabetic or diabetic, they have more difficulty managing their blood sugar than nonship workers Because the work schedule itself will mess them up too much. Even if they're on many medication, they have difficulty.[2:03:46] Andrew Huberman: That's fascinating, and I I'm really glad that you explained the study in such detail because I would have thought, you know, from reading the abstract, I did look at the data, but if someone were to look at the object, they'd say, oh, firefighters, so they're waking up in the middle of the night, and they're, you know, throwing on their gear and going out to calls and do it. But If I understand correctly, all firefighters are being woken up by the signal, which makes the firefighter population A bit more similar to the more standard population is waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, getting on social media for a couple of minutes, or flipping on the lights. I mean, it's it's Maybe not as severe as what firefighters are doing, but we know there are blood sugar regulation issues related to those multiple middle of the night wakings, especially if are then staring at screens.[2:04:31] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:04:32] Andrew Huberman: So I think it's really important that, people were able to hear about the the deeper contours of the study. I mean, this result of Regulating blood sugar better is really powerful. I get asked all the time, you know, I've got a new kid or, I'm a shift worker. How can I do this morning sunlight viewing? What I'm hearing is that keeping a regular meal schedule every day[2:04:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: is 5 5 out of 7 minutes.[2:04:55] Andrew Huberman: 7 or as close to everyday.[2:04:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: As far[2:04:57] Andrew Huberman: as like sleep, I always say, try and get a really great night sleep 80% or more of the nights of your life.[2:05:01] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:05:01] Andrew Huberman: And on the other 20%, hopefully, it's for fun reasons, A great party or something like that or a celebration of some sort. That seems to me A great anchor point when one can't reliably control their sleep wake cycle. Does that mean that if somebody is coming off of shift work, and they're very, very tired that they would be better off staying awake and eating than sleeping.[2:05:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: Well, it's, yeah. So, this is where we get into the nuances. So here, the firefighters are 24 hour shift workers. So that means, And they have been working this shift for very long time, so they have figured out. And one thing is, yes, firefighters are different from nurses and health care workers who have to work throughout the night, and they're staying awake throughout the night.[2:05:48] Dr. Satchin Panda: For us, firefighters, they get opportunity to sleep. Even with their pen calls, they actually have opportunity to come back and go to sleep. And in fact, When Emily and Adena, they were in the past, and what they observed was firefighters after they after, attending a call, they're coming back and playing cards or trying to watch the news or get the score. They know. They will just go back and and lie in the bed and switch up the So whenever they got any opportunity to sleep, they'll try to sleep.[2:06:22] Dr. Satchin Panda: So in that way, their Sleep, death, and sleep pressure during daytime is not as strong as a night shift nurse or a truck driver who is driving all night because they have they are staying awake throughout the night. So When people say, yes. You found this, and can you extend it to other shift workers? My answer is no. We have to go back and figure out.[2:06:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: That's why we went to the station and figured out what would work for them. If I have to go and do this for some nurses, maybe even I will go or our staff will go and figure out what is their work schedule. What happens? Do they have opportunity to eat? Do they have opportunity to even take 5 minutes break?[2:07:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: What do they do during break? And all of these things come into play. But here, another thing is, I always said that In other time restricted feeding paper, we see change in nutrition quality and quantity, but here, we also saw that somehow both groups Inadvertently, they, improve the nutrition quality because everybody was told to eat Mediterranean diet, they increase their fruits and vegetables and olive oil and text, slightly. And when they had to stop Eating early, they also reduce the alcohol intake. And this is very significant because Many shift workers just to cope with the shift work, they tend to depend on alcohol at night and caffeine in the morning.[2:07:55] Dr. Satchin Panda: So they begin their day with caffeine and end with alcohol. And now we can relate that many normal people who We're not doing shipwreck. We also more or less begin our day with caffeine, and many of us end with alcohol. And then when they reduce that eating to 10 hours, And then we saw a significant reduction in alcohol intake in the, time restricted eating group, but not in the standard of care or a Mediterranean diet group.[2:08:24] Andrew Huberman: I certainly support that. We did an episode on alcohol, and I was shocked when I researched that to learn that 0 to 2 drinks per week is essentially the threshold beyond which Yeah. You start seeing health deficits, in particular cancers and metabolic disruption, sleep disruption, and increased anxiety when people aren't under the influence of alcohol. I mean, it's pretty incredible how alcohol has kind of escaped as the The opposite of caffeine and therefore, not a health hazard. It's and and here, I'm I'm somebody.[2:08:56] Andrew Huberman: I have a drink every once in a while. No big deal for me. I can have it or not have it, but it's just striking how, alcohol, despite extensive data that it can really disrupt health even at 3 drinks per week Yeah. Is, is just avidly consumed as if it was kind of like food or caffeine. It's really incredible.[2:09:14] Andrew Huberman: I I wanna make that I circle back to something you mentioned earlier because I know there are going to be a number of people that asked this. If I recall, you said that provided that the feeding window is not shorter than 8 hours that men, women, and children can use time restricted feeding.[2:09:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: Well, when I say yeah. So what I what I say is 12 hours.[2:09:38] Andrew Huberman: 12 excuse me. 12 hours. Thank you for[2:09:41] Dr. Satchin Panda: Because we did a study that was published in 2015. And, again, behind many of our studies, there is a story. So we are publishing all these mouse stories, and then I would go to conferences. And then, of course, they some some People would give me a look saying, well, you must be doing something wrong. We this just breaks the x law of thermodynamics because how come they're eating the same number of calories and not getting weight?[2:10:09] Dr. Satchin Panda: Of course, by that time, we figured out that, at least in mouse, Timeless repeating also changes the gut microbiome in a way that the mice may be pooping out little bit more fat and sugar than absorbing them. So one thing that happens in time restricted eating, at least in mice, is the liver Cholesterol metabolism to bile acid, and bile acid excretion in the gut changes because the Gut microbiome changes. So this is, very nice study, when Amir Jarenpar was, in the lab. Now he has his own lab in UCSD, And he meticulously did that, and we we even did bomb calorimetry from the poop and metabolomics from the poop. And then we figured out that that excrete some some calories, and then their brown fat activity goes up.[2:11:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: So They may be burning some of these extra calories.[2:11:09] Andrew Huberman: So they're more thermogenic?[2:11:10] Dr. Satchin Panda: More thermogenic. Mhmm. But anyway so, you know, one nice thing, Awesome thing about Salk is if they see that your science is going well, then they will find ways to help you. And this is Terrific. Yeah.[2:11:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, this is when Bill Brody was our president. He was the president of, Hopkins for 12 years, and then he was president. And, that time he had started this innovation grant program, which was funded by Arun Jacob. Arun is the founder of Qualcomm and is also a faculty at UCSD. So he understand there are very few Tech leaders who actually spend some time in academia.[2:11:52] Dr. Satchin Panda: So he understood the pain of getting grant money when you have some Interesting idea. I'll test some ideas. So[2:12:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. No knock on the NIH, but I'll do it anyway. And because I sit on study section for the NIH. Mean, with NIH wants to see proposals for things that are so certain to work Yeah. That they're mostly done.[2:12:11] Andrew Huberman: And so, really, groundbreaking work can happen and does happen with NIH funding, but more often than not is it is the generosity of philanthropists like Erwin Jacobs and other people that Allow the really pioneering, the new stuff, the cool stuff[2:12:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:12:27] Andrew Huberman: The the groundbreaking stuff, the stuff that really no. I'm not gonna say really matters. It all matters. It's all important.[2:12:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: It matters, but, you know, it's high risk. And, NIH means NIH is not just government. It's not making money from thin air. It means it's Taxpayers' money. So there is a little bit responsibility or conservative that, okay, so we should not waste taxpayers' money on pie in the kind of project too much.[2:12:50] Andrew Huberman: Clear we're not talking about politically conservative. We're talking about, scientifically conservative. They'd be so careful with language nowadays. Pretty soon, we're just gonna sit and stare at one another at the microphones to stay safe. So so that's interesting.[2:13:03] Andrew Huberman: So the[2:13:03] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that way, we Started this, and then, what we did was we, I had a awesome grad student, and we got this funding from Erwin. And, also, there are some Any philanthropy matters. So, actually, the way we say is, yes, if you give me $50, then that $50 towards goes towards buying the gloves and a pint of tubes for 1 postdoc for maybe 7 days.[2:13:27] Andrew Huberman: So so true. I think a lot of people don't realize that 99% of laboratory scientists just they they don't make any money off their discoveries. And even if there is a patentable discovery, Typically, the the divide between the institution and the company that will eventually put that to market is so slim in favor of the the others involved that, Yeah. Scientists really do this as a as a work of passion, labor labor love. So[2:13:51] Dr. Satchin Panda: So we we, came up with this, app, MyCircadianClock at that time, And we took some, you know, lessons from tech leaders, particularly from Amazon, one click checkout, because we thought most nutrition apps actually ask people to detail describe what they ate, go to their Food library and then person size. You said, okay. So we'll just shortcut all of that. We just ask people to take a picture of the food, open the app, one click, Take a picture, 2nd click, and press save, 3rd click. And when they save, the picture actually came to our server, did not stay on their phone.[2:14:30] Dr. Satchin Panda: And we asked, 156 people who are not shift workers, just regular worker or homemakers to be part of the study. No student was allowed to be part of the study because we know that there's lifestyle dyslexia for this. And we monitor for 3 weeks. And So here is some nuances, and I want people to understand. So suppose, say, when somebody is Starting to eat, let's say, 7 AM.[2:15:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: And since they're recording everything, we we caught Every single thing. Even if they ate half a cookie, they had to take a picture, and they actually took picture because it's not it becomes second nature after 3 or 4 days that every time they add something, Even if, there is a glass of water, they actually take a picture because we asked them, take picture of everything. We'll figure out what it is. What is surprising was we found the median, so the median number of times people eat within A day, 24 hours a day is actually 7. So it's not it's not that we are eating 3 times a day.[2:15:38] Dr. Satchin Panda: We actually Snack, little bit, and then[2:15:40] Andrew Huberman: Seven times per day.[2:15:41] Dr. Satchin Panda: Seven times. And there are 10% of people, the top decile was eating 12 times a day. Wow. And it makes sense in retrospect sometimes. Maybe I'll fall into that 7 or 8 before, I did this study because, you know, getting up, having coffee with cream and sugar is 1, and then I ate my breakfast.[2:16:04] Dr. Satchin Panda: That's 2, then I came to the lab, and I found that cookie. That's 3. I went to a meeting, and there was some cookie and, something else. There's another one, then lunch. And then afternoon, somebody asked me to go out and have a meeting.[2:16:18] Dr. Satchin Panda: And so if you think about it, it's very normal that we can go 7 to 8 times, 10 times. But then if we look at what time, say, I start breakfast, and As I said, we see that in many people. They'll start at 7 o'clock in Monday, then 7:30 another day, then 8:15 another day. They go back to 6 AM because they had to get up early and go to work. So we took all these food data from 3 weeks and then ask, What is the time when your body system is expecting it to eat?[2:16:50] Dr. Satchin Panda: Because it's kind of average as Saudis. Kind of thinking, okay. Maybe for you, if you're eating breakfast at, say, somewhere between 6 AM, 7:30, 7:45, 8, 8, Maybe you are expecting food around 7 o'clock. Let's forget about 6:15. That's an outlier.[2:17:06] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then similarly, at the end of the day, If somebody is eating finishing the last bite or the nightcap, whatever you call it, say 1 at 9 PM, 9:30 PM, 10, 11, 12:30, or 1. Let's ignore that 1 and 12:30. But still, we got somewhere between 7 to 11:30 for that person over 3 weeks' time. So this is how we kind of figure out what is the likelihood that your body will encounter food. So when we do that, what we found was nearly 50% of adults in our study ate for hours, 45 minutes, that window when your body is expecting food.[2:17:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: So it's easy to say that 50% of adults Eating within 15 hours or longer.[2:17:54] Andrew Huberman: Wow. And and quite frequently throughout the[2:17:57] Dr. Satchin Panda: day. Too. And then if we ask, What fraction of our dogs were actually eating the conventional within 12 hours, 3 meals a day or something like that? That's 10%. So[2:18:10] Andrew Huberman: The snacking has gone up dramatically. However you wanna define snacking. The frequency of of food intake throughout the day.[2:18:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: And outside this Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, there are all these small snacks here and there. And, also, for a lot of people, the dinner is delayed. And We went back and looked at, okay, so what kind of food people are eating late at night and all that stuff. And what came out interesting, which is Very counterintuitive is people who prepare their own dinner. They're more likely to eat later at night Because they're coming home, and then they're taking some time to prepare dinner.[2:18:44] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then they're sitting down and eating or maybe they're eating next to the computer, whatever it is. So it's kind of interesting that came out. But coming back to your point, that's why I say that nearly 90% of adults are eating for more than 12 hours. So that means a lot of people can There is scope. There is enough headspace to reduce and eat within so as I said, All of this are interrelated.[2:19:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: So when you think about children, most sleep researchers agree that children and teenagers Should sleep somewhere between 9 to 10 or 11 hours because young children, even 5 to 10 year old, they should sleep 9 to 10 hours.[2:19:30] Andrew Huberman: They're just pumping out growth hormone and growing, growing, growing.[2:19:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then the teenagers, actually, the, recommendation is and they should be sleeping 9 hours because If you take teenagers, take out all the stimulatory inputs to them and then remove homework assignment and everything and then let them kind of to their homeostasis, what they're likely how many hours they're likely to sleep, that turns out to be somewhere between 8 and a half to 9 and a half hours, Which also means that going back to sleep, nearly 90% of High school students in this country are chronically sleep deprived because most high school students don't get 9 hours of sleep on a regular basis, maybe in the weekend.[2:20:18] Andrew Huberman: Probably because of devices. Yeah. They're on Ipads.[2:20:21] Dr. Satchin Panda: As I said, this new, idea that midnight is your, assignment, some missing time. I'll come back to that again and again.[2:20:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm hearing that again and again. So teachers take note. I it's an inter it's a very interesting idea as a way to kinda anchor behavior earlier in the day. Yeah.[2:20:36] Andrew Huberman: Learning to I mean, public health, is complicated because people are incentivized by fear, but they, know, you get more bees with honey as they say. Right? You know, there's a incentivizing people to wake earlier, not necessarily with the sunrise, but Wake earlier and go to sleep earlier and eat within an 8 to 12 hour window. 12 if it's Yeah.[2:21:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's why I think children. Yeah.[2:21:02] Andrew Huberman: It sounds to me like, you know, that all these health benefits are what I think are going to incentivize people more than, For instance, this idea that, well, if you don't do this, you're gonna get dementia or something of that sort. Right?[2:21:13] Dr. Satchin Panda: Like everyday, people will feel more healthy and more productive. And so that's why I said that even if children are supposed to sleep for 9 hours, of course, they're not eating during those 9 hours, And we are not, feeding children and putting them down to sleep because, you know, their core body temperature would be high. They cannot fall asleep. So at least they should Have the last meal 1 or 2 hours before going to bed because typically, parents feed them and maybe Give them a shower or a bath, and then they read the bedtime stories, or it's 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, they're finishing food. Similarly, on the Other hand, after they wake up, it's not that we are waking them up and then feeding them.[2:21:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: So, hopefully, we're not doing that. So that's at 12 hours. Seems to be optimum. And it's not only I'm saying that if we put all the health recommendations together from pediatrics, and then It makes[2:22:07] Andrew Huberman: sense. Fascinating. I have a question about structuring meal intake or food intake, during the eating window. I have a good friend. Actually, he's, he's the neurosurgeon at Neuralink now, but he came up through Stanford, and, And he has a habit of eating of skipping 1 meal per day Mhmm.[2:22:28] Andrew Huberman: Within a feeding window. So it might be breakfast, lunch, skip dinner one day, then it might be breakfast, Dinner the next day, lunch and dinner the next one. So it's not in keeping with the same start time always, but The end time is either gonna be earlier or the there's a gate. It's never later.[2:22:45] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:22:45] Andrew Huberman: It's never later. Do you think about that as a strategy? You know, in many ways, it feels like that fits with the way that a lot of people's lives run. So sometimes, instance, if I'm in a podcast, I don't tend to eat much during the middle of the day because it makes me a little bit groggy, the post perennial dip in energy.[2:23:03] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:23:03] Andrew Huberman: So I'll do breakfast. Well but, again, at 11, that's a first that's when I break my fast, and then dinner. Maybe a snack in the middle of the day. But other days, it's 3 meals of the so does it matter, overall as long as, one isn't allowing the start time and the ending time to drift out? Is it okay if you go from 12 hours to 10 to 8, 8, 10, 4, 12?[2:23:28] Andrew Huberman: As long as you don't exceed that the the brackets, Are you okay?[2:23:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: So this is where the circadian aspect come in. Because if you're going, if you are moving that breakfast time or dinner time, 3, 4 hours, we are essentially causing maybe a metabolic jet lag. Mhmm. You know, in short term, in weeks, months, or maybe Even few years, you may not see any change, but at the same time, we don't know what are the long term consequences. One thing is we always think I'll come back to this point again and again.[2:24:02] Dr. Satchin Panda: We think that our body weight is a marker of health. Our body composition is a marker of health. It's not always true because, as I said, acid reflux, feeling, you know, Having some pang of depression or anxiety.[2:24:17] Andrew Huberman: Or LDL. Like, high LDL.[2:24:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: High LDL.[2:24:20] Andrew Huberman: A lot of thin people have or or low body fat people have very high LDL.[2:24:23] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So those are the things that, we don't connect with our habit. And since circadian rhythm and meal timing, meal structure Sure. Now it's a very new, field. I think good studies will come out only in a few years.[2:24:39] Dr. Satchin Panda: Because right now, people are just going back and We're actively looking at some diet record one day of diet record and trying to glean too much out of out of it. But I think hopefully, things will improve where people become it it will become standard to at least look for 1 week of diet record. Meal time and what they're eating, all that stuff because, there are now mouse studies also showing whether front loading carbohydrate or front loading fat or protein has benefit over. So I think these studies are starting, so I should not comment whether that's good or bad.[2:25:16] Andrew Huberman: No. I think it's great to hold off until well, then we have you back on to discuss. I have a question about, fasting on the longer term, and there it's a near infinite space we could explore of 2 days of fasting, one day. I know people that every once in a while, they just decide, I'm fasting. They've either been eating too much at parties, or they're not feeling well, or whatever.[2:25:39] Andrew Huberman: They just I'm fasting for 24 hours, and, they'll still consume water and caffeine, but they'll just fast. Is there any health benefit or detriment? You mentioned the circadian clock shifting effects, but if somebody wakes up on Sunday and they, you know, they ate too much or they feel they too much or they don't like the food they ate on Saturday. They're not really feeling it, and then they're just gonna fast into Monday. Is there any known benefit or, health detriment to doing that kind of thing.[2:26:07] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. There's a actually, a rich literature on, this complete fast, and in fact, in many religion, people practice complete fast as a way to cleanse their body, and, people have seen that there are benefits to that. So in fact, the every other day eating, in mouse model or even in humans that are Also, initially, some studies were done. There are many health benefits. And right now, there are even fasting clinics in Germany where people check-in, and they're under strict supervision, and then they do complete fast or maybe A small bowl of soup, which has 100, 200 kilocal, and that's all they get to eat.[2:26:53] Dr. Satchin Panda: Sometimes, 2, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, even they have gone up to 3 or 4 weeks.[2:26:59] Andrew Huberman: For sake of weight loss? Is that why[2:27:01] Dr. Satchin Panda: For many different things, and, They come out pretty well healthy. Of course, they're under supervision. Make sure that they are getting micro micronutrient sorry. The micronutrients, vitamins, and, and electrolytes. So those studies are pretty solid.[2:27:18] Dr. Satchin Panda: People have, observed that. And then, in fact, there are even idea that fasting this kind of fasting can have huge impact on brain, and people may come out of treatment resistant depression or something. But, You know? So those studies are very difficult to do. They're only case of 1 here and there that we hear once in a while.[2:27:40] Dr. Satchin Panda: But hopefully, in future, we'll see, whether the depression, anxiety, the mental health aspect will benefit from fasting. Because now as there is more and more evidence that as this gut brain axis and whether the presence So food or the microbiome changes in the gut, if they can affect brain, then maybe long term fasting, periodic fasting, a Few days of low calorie diet back to back, will be interesting to see how it impacts brain health.[2:28:12] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. What are your thoughts on fat fasting where people, try and limit their blood glucose by, only eating mainly fats, Mainly healthy. Typically, they'll eat healthier fats, so avocados, olive oils, and nuts and[2:28:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah.[2:28:28] Andrew Huberman: You know, and some animal fats perhaps. But, As a way to keep blood glucose low and also time restrict. This goes back to the kind of low carbohydrate Yeah. Thing. What what are your thoughts on that as As a general strategy for health, I mean, it combines sort of 2 general themes that are out there.[2:28:45] Andrew Huberman: I think both of which are, you know, data are still incoming That, restricting the feeding times, it can be beneficial as well as keeping overall blood glucose lower can be beneficial.[2:28:56] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. I think, there is too much, emphasis now on blood sugar spiking, or, we don't know This kind of eating pattern, for example, means we are essentially telling pancreas that, okay, is are the islet cells that produce, insulin. It's okay. You can take, take a break, go on vacation for a for a month or 2 or 3 months. My question is, it will be interesting to see what happens to those islets.[2:29:29] Dr. Satchin Panda: Because, for example, we know that if we misuse or unused our muscles, there's muscle atrophy. Muscles will be become weaker. We don't know whether long term consequences of this very low carbohydrate diet where you're not Essentially, engaging the islet cells, periodically, what is its impact. So if there is no impact, maybe it's okay. Maybe the because, As you know, many people who actually work on ketogenic diet, the researchers themselves, they find it very difficult to stay in True ketogenic diet.[2:30:08] Dr. Satchin Panda: Because the true ketogenic diet is consuming less than 10% of calories from carbohydrate.[2:30:14] Andrew Huberman: And not very many from protein. A lot of people think Ketogenic diet allows them to eat massive amounts of meat, and that's not clearly the case. Just one clarification for people. Sachin was referring to islet cells of the pancreas, which are the ones that, manufacture insulin. So the question is whether or not taking in low levels of blood glucose by way of a low carbohydrate diet, Those islet cells are going to shut off their production.[2:30:37] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. I mean, the liver is a very plastic tissue. I mean, it tends to, react very dramatically to to lifestyle Changes.[2:30:44] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So that's why it would be interesting to see what happens. Means we know that even muscle disease, for example, people who become bedridden, They lose some muscle mass, but when they come back and exercise, they gain it back. Mhmm. So it'll be interesting to see, what happens And these people who are going through long term ketogenic diet and, of course, once in a while, because of, social pressure or something else, if they don't have access to food or it happens, they may consume some sugar, some blood glucose will spike.[2:31:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: But it's not that this spike is bad. I mean Mhmm. The reason why we have insulin is for good reason.[2:31:22] Andrew Huberman: To buffer that spike.[2:31:23] Dr. Satchin Panda: To buffer that spike and also you know, people always say that, well, if you have insulin produced or insulin like growth factor, those are really bad, and you should avoid that. And I think that's a little bit, extreme. And[2:31:35] Andrew Huberman: mean, that's a the insulin growth factors involved in muscle protein synthesis, tissue repair Yeah. Maybe even cognition. So Yeah. Yeah.[2:31:42] Dr. Satchin Panda: And, it also goes back to, I'll say mTOR activation and all that stuff, people get really excited about or how to reduce mTOR activation, rapamycin, and all that stuff. So this is where, again, from circadian point of view, I ask people to think. Okay. So 2 very popular drug like molecules or drugs that people think will increase longevity are metformin Mhmm. Which Many people agree.[2:32:14] Dr. Satchin Panda: Not all will come to a consensus that it activates AMP kinase. The sensor and the cells that sense that your cells are fasting. Mhmm. Okay. So Metformin kind of activates it so that it kind of you can say, although it may not be scientifically accurate, the, you know, fasting in a pill.[2:32:35] Andrew Huberman: So it sort of mimics fasting.[2:32:36] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:32:37] Andrew Huberman: And I and the and the thing I'd lump in there with Formin is that Berberine is kind of the poor man's metformin. It's a Yeah. Tree bark extract that also dramatically lowers blood glucose.[2:32:46] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah. It mimics kind of that, fasting. And then rapamycin, also kind of reduces mTOR activation. And, people have shown that Harafromycin and metformin can extend mouse lifespan and in improve health.[2:33:08] Dr. Satchin Panda: Okay. So now let's go back to the calorie restriction study that I mentioned. In calorie restriction, people are giving food as a lump sum, and they were essentially doing time restriction. The mice were doing time restriction. If we think about it, during daytime, when experimenters are coming to the bivarium, The mice should be sleeping and fasting.[2:33:33] Dr. Satchin Panda: And they should naturally have high level of AMP Kinase If they're truly fasting, and they should also have low level of mTOR activity because mTOR response to insulin, and that should go off at night. So my suspicion is, In many of these experiments where the mice were allowed to eat ad libitum, even normal standard, Now we are we know that as mice get older, they actually consume little bit more food during daytime.[2:34:07] Andrew Huberman: Which is the equivalent of human nighttime.[2:34:09] Dr. Satchin Panda: Night time eating.[2:34:10] Andrew Huberman: It's like nighttime eating, we know as an issue. I didn't realize that was more of an issue as people age. But[2:34:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So we don't know. But at least in mice, because, you know, we can put the mice in calorimetry, look at every single bite they're eating, how much they're eating. So I guess it was natural to see that researchers found that there is some mTOR activity during daytime when the mice were not supposed to have m two activity because they should be fasting. And since they ate little bit, they were snacking during daytime, his activity was not at its peak.[2:34:43] Dr. Satchin Panda: So giving metformin kind of Mimic their fasting state and reducing mTOR activity by drug like rapamycin also kind of mimic some aspect of the fasting state. So my suspicion is, since these studies were done always in mice, who are supposed to be in the fasting state and both enter sorry. Rapamycin and AMP Kinase activator, Metformin kind of are mimicking that fasting state. That's why we have seen those benefits, and it'll be interesting to see if that experiment could be done in Humans in long term because many people are very excited about you know, there is mTOR long term metformin, study, and then Lot of people are actually consuming good amount of rapamycin off level. They can get their own.[2:35:37] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's my, Curiosity. I'm not saying whether it's good or bad or whether there is science or not. That's something that'll be interesting to control for and see. Because recently, I've I saw one of my, again, close friend and colleague at Scripps, Katya Lamia, she did a very simple, elegant study. People should have done in the performing field.[2:35:59] Dr. Satchin Panda: So took mice and then Measure their blood glucose at different time of the day. And in fact, just like human blood glucose, our blood glucose fluctuates slit a little bit. She saw that rhythm. And then in every 2 hours or 3 hours on different days, of course, So get the same dose of metformin to mice. And what she found was at different time of the day, metformin had very dramatic Change in glucose reducing ability, so which means that even if you take metformin and give at different time of the They for the mouse or even for humans, in very long term, of course, in these mice and these mice were not diabetic or anything of a healthy mice to begin with.[2:36:44] Dr. Satchin Panda: So in long term, we might see, benefits, that are very different. So this brings to this idea that, Well, maybe metformin, say, at the end of the day, evening metformin may trigger that fasting state much earlier than End of digestion, whereas metformin in the beginning of the day may not, at least from longevity perspective. I'm not talking about Diabetes type 2 diabetes. Yeah. So the same thing with mTOR.[2:37:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: Is mTOR going to have much better impact if taken during Evening, morning, before meal. So, these are my thoughts that go along with all this fat story that we talked about.[2:37:31] Andrew Huberman: Do you take, Metformin or Burberry?[2:37:34] Dr. Satchin Panda: No. I haven't taken. Although, you know, I have close Friend and colleague, Ruben Shaw, who is now the director of cancer center at Salk, he extensively works AMP kinase and its mechanisms, and, so it's always fun to talk to him to see[2:37:52] Andrew Huberman: He's a fan. Yeah. I've taken Berberine before, and I've had, 2 different very distinct experiences with them. First of all, Berberine when ingested with Carbohydrates, in particular, carbohydrates that have a lot of simple sugars Mhmm. Definitely I know this because I measured my blood glucose.[2:38:08] Andrew Huberman: I did the experiment. Allows you to, flatten out your blood glucose response. So, you know, in some sense, if you're you know, know, there is this idea if you're gonna eat a particularly big meal or sugary meal and you don't wanna get a massive blood glucose rise, you take Berberine or Metformin. Metformin is[2:38:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:38:25] Andrew Huberman: Prescription, that's why I went with Berberine because it's as far as I know, it works as well. Yeah.[2:38:30] Dr. Satchin Panda: At least for healthy people.[2:38:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. For healthy people. That's right. When I took Berberine and did not ingest large amounts of simple sugars or carbohydrates along with it, I experienced profound hypoglycemia. I felt like complete garbage for about 8 hours, and I had one of the worst headaches of my life.[2:38:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Because which makes sense. You just got a blood sugar crash. So if you lower blood your blood sugar when you already have fairly low blood sugar and you're not ingesting carbohydrates, you can really bottom out your[2:39:00] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah.[2:39:00] Andrew Huberman: Your, blood glucose. So just say it's I say that as a, for two reasons. 1 is kind of a cautionary note, and the other one that, when you think about the biology of these compounds, it makes perfect sense, and I think that, and I did not pay attention to circadian effects.[2:39:12] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a you know, when I joined Salk, around that, We know Ron Evans, who is the kind of the, big leader in sick in metabolism, and he works on nuclear hormone receptors. These are the master regulator of metabolism in normal cells, cancer cells, and many other.[2:39:31] Dr. Satchin Panda: And what is interesting was in the 1st few years, Ron did a very simple experiment. He just looked at what time of the day this nuclear hormone receptors are Turn on a gene expression level and some at protein level. And he found that almost all of them, have a circadian pattern at least in some tissue. So, he went to that length to say even that circadian is metabolism, and metabolism is circadian. The reason why we have a circadian rhythm is to have a daily rhythms and food seeking behavior and eating And also go through a period of time when we should be fasting.[2:40:15] Dr. Satchin Panda: And then on the other hand, All the metabolic regulators also have to follow that rule, and almost all metabolic regulators, everything that we can think of connected to Metabolizing macronutrient, protein, carb, and fat, they should also have a circadian rhythm or diurnal cycle Align or misalign. So for example, fat oxidation should be in opposite phase with feeding. And, You know, in retrospect, at that time, it was kind of amazing to see Ron could foresee. Of course, he's smart enough foresee and predict that this is going to happen to circadian pill. Because at that time, we are thinking all the suprachiasmatic nuclear sleep wake cycle, and are not thinking too much about, metabolism.[2:41:04] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's the awesome thing about Salk, being at Salk because we have 50 PIs Really crammed into 2 awesome buildings and with open lab structures, so you bump onto each other and talk to.[2:41:18] Andrew Huberman: So and with an ocean view.[2:41:19] Dr. Satchin Panda: Oh, it's an ocean view.[2:41:20] Andrew Huberman: Yes. It it's an amazing place. I was lucky enough to have an adjunct position there when I when my lab was at UCSD, and, it is an amazing place doing incredible groundbreaking work, which, of course, includes yours. Listen, Sachin, I I'm clear now that, we have to have you back on for another, series of discussion, seriously speaking, if if you'd be so so, kind and willing to do that. I wanna thank you, for several things.[2:41:48] Andrew Huberman: First of all, for your taking the time today to sit down and discuss these, incredibly interesting ideas In detail, you know, much of what we talk about on the podcast is, obviously grounded in science and and often, but not always is actionable. And much of what we talked about today is actionable in the sense that many people are already doing certain dimensions of these things. Some are not. Some are Hearing about it and considering it, you've given us dozens I've I've listed some out dozens of tools and considerations Based on whether or not people are engaging in shift work or not, I think a lot of people are gonna realize that they are shift workers Yeah. Even though they didn't think they were, because of the nature of their habits now to light and to activity and so forth.[2:42:33] Andrew Huberman: I absolutely love the firefighter study because of its relevance to the general population. Also a nod another nod to fighter fighters and shift workers everywhere. Thank you. And, you know, I I think among the colleagues I've known for several decades now, You really are one of a very small few who've managed to do both animal studies and human studies, but Also animal studies with a very clear eye and a pointer toward, human health, and, that's such a vital and rare thing, especially in this day of, extremely competitive funding. So I wanna thank you for your time today, for the knowledge you shared, the actionable aspects to that knowledge, The science that you're doing in your laboratory, we will provide links for people to learn more about you and, of course, to go to the app Yeah.[2:43:20] Andrew Huberman: So people can, engage in some of the science directly. And, of course, you have several wonderful books now that we will also link to, both of which I've read and are are wonderful, in particular, the book, the 1st book, but also a book, related to diabetes and, so for diabetics and people interested in metabolic and and, blood sugar regulation, there so, Yeah. On behalf of myself and my team here at the Huberman Lab Podcast and all the listeners, I just wanna say thank you so much. Your time is valuable, And, the fact that you share it with us and educate so many people is really a gift.[2:43:52] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. Thank you. And, actually, likewise, there are very few scientists who have taken this leadership role that you have taken to, come and communicate science to the public. It's not easy, Because sometimes you have to distill it down to a simple sound bite to the point where the scientist and they'll say, oh, that may not be right. But we always have to keep in mind that we are always living in the dark is of science because the reason why I say that this is not my quote.[2:44:24] Dr. Satchin Panda: Actually, this is from One of my scientific here, Paul Shimmel from, Scripps, he always says, think about it. 10 years ago, what it what you thought was Right and the best has already changed. But one thing is, the circadian rhythm and aligning it to, our internal clock to our habit is very important. And as you mentioned, we have our, myCircadian clock app, which is research facing. But we have also distilled all of this down to 5 or 6 timing component, and we have a new app called on time health, Or get on time health.[2:45:02] Andrew Huberman: Can people access that through the standard app stores?[2:45:05] Dr. Satchin Panda: Yeah. So now it's available in, in App Store, goo sorry. Apple App Store. And we want to see, how because people always think about fasting. But as we discussed today, Feeding, fasting, or eating, fasting, and activity and sleep are kind of interlinked, and we have to kind of balance both of these.[2:45:27] Dr. Satchin Panda: So that's that was the idea behind this on time health program. And, thank you, Andy, because what you're doing is immensely necessary, particularly these days when science is moving at a very fast pace. There are a lot of results coming out. Sometimes, something can be very confusing, and you spending your time to communicate science is exceptional. So thank you, Andrew.[2:45:55] Andrew Huberman: You're you're most welcome. It's, days like today where I get to sit down and and talk to brilliant colleagues like you who are doing The important work that that really matters so much. And so as you, mentioned a moment ago that there's a lot of darkness and confusion out there, but Thank you for being, one of those who's shining light.[2:46:16] Dr. Satchin Panda: Thank you.[2:46:17] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me for today's discussion with doctor Satchin Panda, All about circadian biology and time restricted feeding.
