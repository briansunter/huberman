I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing doctor Samir Khattar as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Doctor Hattar is the chief of the section on light and circadian rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Doctor Hattar has many important discoveries to his name.[0:00:33] Andrew Huberman: He was one of a handful of groups that discovered the light sensing neurons in the eye that Set the circadian clock. This is a fundamental discovery made in the early 2000 that has led to an enormous number of additional discoveries on how light regulates our sleep, our immune system, our mood, mental health, Metabolism, feeding, and many other important processes. If ever there was somebody who understands how All of these processes interact and can inform best practices for our daily behaviors. It's doctor Hattar. During our discussion today, doctor Hattar answers questions that are absolutely essential for us to know about our health and well-being.[0:01:16] Andrew Huberman: For instance, How to align our sleep schedule with our activity schedule such as exercise, and how to align light Activity and exercise with our feeding rhythms. He presents a new model of how light activity and feeding rhythms converge To support optimal health, and when those are not aligned correctly, how our mental and physical health can suffer. It's a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism, made clearly, of course, so everybody can understand, as well as specific protocols to deal with Shifts in day length, shifts in activity, and in order to optimize sleep, metabolism, and well-being of various kinds. I learned so much from Samer as I always do. He is an absolute wealth of knowledge on all things related to light and circadian rhythms, physiology, and neuroscience.[0:02:09] Andrew Huberman: I don't think you'll find anyone else as knowledgeable about these topics as Samer, and so I'm delighted that he joined us here on the podcast to share this information. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA.[0:02:35] Andrew Huberman: ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent my career working on the signs of the visual system, and I can tell you that one of the things our visual system has to contend with is adjusting so that when we go from a very bright area to a dim or shadowed area, we can still see things clearly. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with the science of the visual system in mind, and so they make those transitions seamless. You always see things with crystal clarity. Another great thing about these glasses is that they're very lightweight, so you don't even really remember that they're on your face, and they won't slip off if you get sweaty.[0:03:09] Andrew Huberman: The glasses were designed initially for running and for cycling and for activewear, but they work great for that, and they work great, they also happen to look great for work, if you go out to dinner, for social settings, so they can really be worn in essentially any circumstances. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off your first order. That's ROKA .com. Enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.[0:03:39] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting blood work done For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health can only be detected in a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is you get numbers back, but you don't know what to do about those numbers specifically. Roca solved that problem at a number of levels. First of all, they make getting the blood test very easy.[0:04:10] Andrew Huberman: They'll come to your house if you like. You can go to a local clinic. Second of all, once you get your numbers Back, there's a very easy to use dashboard where you can identify, obviously, what the numbers are, but also the various things that you can do to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want through either behavioral practices like exercise, through nutritional practices or supplementation, etcetera. So they made the whole thing very easy start to finish in a way that allows you to direct your health goals.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon. Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain free, keto friendly cereal. I am not Ketogenic, meaning I don't follow a purely ketogenic diet. I tend to fast in the early part of the day.[0:05:00] Andrew Huberman: I tend to eat kind of low carbish through the middle of the day, and then in the evening, I eat carbohydrates. That's what works best for me and allows me to feel alert all day long and to sleep really well at night. Magic spoon is a terrific snack for me because it tastes terrific. It's got some sweetness, but it doesn't take me out of that state that I wanna be in during the day where I'm sort of Keto ish, I would say. I'm not actually in ketosis, but I'm following more or less a low carb diet during the day, which keeps me alert.[0:05:27] Andrew Huberman: So either fasting or low carb, and Magic Spoon is consistent with that. And then as I mentioned before in the evening, I do eat carbohydrates. Magic Spoon has 0 grams of sugar, 13 to 14 grams of protein, and only four Net grams of carbohydrates in each serving, so I think it qualifies as low carb ish or low carb. In addition, it only has a 140 calories per serving. It's also just Delicious.[0:05:49] Andrew Huberman: They have flavors like cocoa, fruity, pea peanut butter, frosted. I particularly like the frosted one because it tastes like donuts, and I particularly Doughnuts, although I try not to eat them too often, if ever. If you wanna try Magic Spoon, you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman to grab a variety pack. You can use the Promo code Huberman at checkout, and you'll get $5 off your order.

Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.[0:06:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: My pleasure.[0:06:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We go way back. So you are best known in scientific circles for your work on how light impacts mood, learning, Feeding, hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics. So just to kick the ball out onto the field, so to speak, How does light impact the way we feel? So when I get up in the morning, I have the opportunity to interact with light in certain ways or to avoid light in certain ways.[0:06:52] Andrew Huberman: I have the opportunity to interact with sunlight or with artificial light. Maybe you could just weighed us into what the relationship is between light and these things like mood and hunger, etcetera.[0:07:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: Sure. So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect of light for vision. So when you wake up in a beautiful Area, beautiful ocean. Light is essential. The sunrise, the sunset, blue sky, beautiful mountains.[0:07:20] Dr. Samer Hattar: So that's your conscious perception of light. But light has a completely different aspect that is independent of conscious vision or image forming functions. And that's how it regulates many important functions in your body. I think the best that is well studied and well known is your circadian clock. And the word circadian comes from the word circa, which is approximate and DN is day, so it's an approximate day.[0:07:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: Why is it an approximate day? Because if I put you or any other human being who have a normal circadian clock in a constant conditions with no information about feeding time, about Sleep time about what time it is outside, you still have a daily rhythm, but it's not exactly 24 hours. So it will Shift out of the solar day because it's not exactly 24 hours and hence the name.[0:08:11] Andrew Huberman: So just to ask a quick question about that. When you say you have this about 24 hour rhythm. How does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our body? Great. So great question.[0:08:22] Andrew Huberman: So It shows up at every level that we know we studied. It shows up at the level of the cell. It shows up[0:08:29] Dr. Samer Hattar: at the level of the tissue, and it shows up at your behavior. The most obvious for you is your sleep wake cycle. You sleep and you're awake and sleep at the 24 hour rhythms. And if you measure the sleep wake cycle of a humans who are maintained in constant conditions, you will see that the period length of the sleep rhythm on average is more than 24 hours. In humans, it's 24.2 hours.[0:08:51] Dr. Samer Hattar: So you'll be drifting 0.2 hours every day out of the solar day if you don't get the sunlight. So the the sunlight adjust that approximate data, an exact day. So now your behavior is adjusted to to the light dark environment or the solar thing.[0:09:07] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So if I understand correctly, if I were to go into a cave Yeah. Or I were to be in constant light. Yeah. And I didn't close my eyes Yeah.[0:09:15] Andrew Huberman: In constant light, that I would still sleep in 1 coherent bout.[0:09:21] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yes.[0:09:21] Andrew Huberman: And I would still be awake for more or less 1 coherent bout, maybe a nap. But the total duration of my day, So to speak, would be a little bit longer than 24 hours.[0:09:34] Dr. Samer Hattar: Perfect.[0:09:34] Andrew Huberman: But if I'm in in a condition like most people are where the sun goes up and the sun goes down, and I have some understanding of that sunrise and sunset.[0:09:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: You then have to have the understanding. You don't have to have conscious understanding. You have the detection. Right. So circadian photoentrainment is the word we use in training the circadian clock to the photic environment is completely subconscious.[0:09:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: You're not aware of it. It's not like vision where or image forming where you actually know what you're looking at. So it's all hypothalamic. It's part of the brain that is not consciously driven, so you actually do not know when it happens or when it doesn't happen. And that what We'll get into when I tell you why light affects your mood and why sometimes people don't know how to deal with light to improve their mood, for example.[0:10:20] Andrew Huberman: K. So this is a subconscious vision. Yes. Okay. Before you tell us about how light impacts mood, I I'm curious.[0:10:27] Andrew Huberman: What is the relevance of Adjusting this clock from a little bit longer than 24 hours to 24 hours. I mean, it seems like a small difference. 24 Hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours. Like, what Yeah. What what's what's the relevance?[0:10:42] Andrew Huberman: I mean, why should we care about that short difference?[0:10:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: So let's do the math. If you shift 0.2 hours a day. In 5 days, you're shifting out 1 hour. So you're literally 1 hour off in your social behavior in 5 days. In 10 days, you're 2 hours off.[0:10:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: And if you're an organism that is living in the wild, shifting out of the right phase of the cycle, you could either miss food or you could become food. So it's really essential for survival. I think it's one of the strongest aspect of survival for animals to have The anticipation and the adjustment to the solar cycle.[0:11:16] Andrew Huberman: And for humans as well. When you say animals, I'm assuming that applies to us.[0:11:20] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah.[0:11:21] Andrew Huberman: I see. So even though it's just a short, bit longer than 24, if you if that accumulates over days, then you could find yourself very much out of phase with the rest of your your species, essentially.[0:11:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: So let's say it's 0.2 hours. So in 5 days, it's 1 hour. In 25 days could be 5 or 6 hours. It you could be in New York and you're feeling as if you traveled from New York to London. So you will be having jet lag In New York, even though you didn't do a jet lag travel.[0:11:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: So it's very important for the adjustment. And if we have Dan, maybe we could talk about why this is important for seasonality because also it allows animals to anticipate the change in season. And the more you're high in in the north or the south, the more that these these weather changes occur very harshly, and you have to be ready for them. And that happens in in in us as well.[0:12:14] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Well, we we will definitely get into seasonality. Okay. So we've got this subconscious vision That aligns us with the turn of the earth. How does that work?[0:12:25] Andrew Huberman: What's the what is the the machinery that allows that to happen. And how does that machinery work?[0:12:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. So we know we knew that in mammals, including us, we are mammals, humans, That the eyes are required for this function. So if humans are born without eyes or the optic nerves are damaged, humans are not able to adjust to the Solar cycles. So we know that the eyes are required. And since we thought we knew about the eyes a lot before 2000,[0:12:55] Andrew Huberman: We thought When you say before the year 2000?[0:12:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: Before the years 2000. Yes. We thought it's these photoreceptors in your retina that allow you to see. So in in in the human retinas, there are 2 types of photoreceptors. They are called rods and cones because of their shapes.[0:13:11] Dr. Samer Hattar: And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy, which light is made of, and they change it in a way to an electrical signal that allow us to build The image of the environment in our cortices, subconsciously. Consciously in this situation because it's vision. Right? It's image forming vision. It's a It's a visual cortex and association associative cortices which allow you to build conscious perception of the environment.[0:13:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: However, People have found, including me with the work of David Berson and Ignacio Provencio that there is a subset of ganglion cells. The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina, their axon leave the retina, and project to the brain. So these words of stood to only Relay rod and con information from the light environment to the brain. We found that a small subset of these ganglion cells are themselves photoreceptors that were completely missed in the retina. And these are the photoreceptors that relay light environment subconsciously To the areas in the brain that have and house the circadian clock or the circadian pacemaker, which Adjust all the clocks in our bodies to the central brain clock that allows them to entrain to the 24 hour light dark cycle.[0:14:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: Incredible. So in the[0:14:28] Andrew Huberman: year as I recall, because I was a graduate student at the time, in the year 2000, there was this landmark discovery made by you, Egi Prevencio, David Berson, and others, That these cells exist that can communicate day and night information to the brain Yeah. In this very small subset of cells. Since then, I've heard, but maybe you can confirm or refute, that this system that connects the eyes to the rest of the brain is actually the most ancient form of vision, that this is probably the form of vision that some early version of human beings had before they had pattern vision, before they could see colors and shapes and motion and and all that. And that the the that the same cells that perform this role are actually similar to Insect eyes. I think I heard David Berson say once that we actually have a little bit of the fly eye in our eye.[0:15:19] Andrew Huberman: What's he talking about?[0:15:20] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. So it's it's really interesting actually because these same IPRGCs we discovered, they contribute a little bit to image formation. And Now work from Tiffany Schmidt specifically have proven that they do contribute to image forming functions. But they contribute to very Limited aspect of image formation. So it fits your hypothesis that these are an ancient photoreceptors.[0:15:45] Dr. Samer Hattar: The other thing that adds to that hypothesis is that they are expressed in cells that don't have any modification that make them look like photoreceptors. So our the photoreceptors that I told you about that are important For vision, image formation, they have very specialized structures that allow them to pack these structures With photo pigments, these are the photo detecting proteins so they could detect a high sensitivity of photons that pass through them. These IPRGCs don't these new photoreceptors don't have these specialized structures. So they just really need a lot of light. At the time, we thought they need a lot of light to be activated.[0:16:28] Dr. Samer Hattar: So that's why we think they are ancient, and that's why I think they Adjust to ancient functions that are as important as regulating your body circadian clock to the solar environment to solar day Or do the light dark cycle.[0:16:42] Andrew Huberman: So you you mentioned iPRGCs, intrinsically photosensitive. So these are cells that connect the eye of the brain that behave like photoreceptors, essentially. And then you mentioned, melanopsin, which is the actual pigment that converts the light into the electrical signal, more or less. And my understanding is that melanopsin was identified first in frog melanophores. Yes.[0:17:04] Andrew Huberman: So does that mean that we have, like, little pieces of frog Skin in our eyes.[0:17:08] Dr. Samer Hattar: So, honestly, David Berson say you have a fly in your eye because it sounds better. The more accurate I think is that you have a frog skin in your eye. It's not as Catchy. But really, melanopsin really, the name melanopsin is from melanocytopsin. So it's melanopsin because it was found in the frog melanocytes.[0:17:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: Know the frogs can change their color depending on light? And melanopsin drives this response. So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered these Absence in frogs, luckily, he was smart enough to see if they are expressing the frog eye. They were expressing the frog eye, and it what Appears to be retinal ganglion cells, which I told you, the one that connect the eye to the brain. He had the insight to go and see if they are expressed in the monkey eye, And he found that they are also expressing what appears to be retinal ganglion cells.[0:17:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: And really that what opened the field wide open. Then David Berson did the seminal experiment where he went to the brain where the central oscillator, the The oscillator that drives circadian rhythm in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus that has been known for many years to receive retinal input. And he labeled the cells that project there, and then he found that even if you destroy rods and cones, you could get light responses from these cells. So you could imagine, he nearly fainted when he saw that these cells can respond independent, completely in the absence of rodent cone input.[0:18:32] Andrew Huberman: I'll never forget reading those papers in 20,021,001. I was at the meeting in DC when Iggy show Ignacio Iggy, we call him Iggy, Showed this image of this basically, what is frog melanophores in the human eye, and everyone was, like, oh my goodness. This is the thing. And I wanna get into how light actually can control circadian rhythms in the moment,[0:18:55] Dr. Samer Hattar: but[0:18:55] Andrew Huberman: I think, it's worth mentioning now that, people who are pattern vision blind, so people who cannot see and no conscious vision, but have eyes. Many of them still have these cells, These melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells and can, essentially match or entrain, as we say, onto the, light dark cycle.[0:19:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: In fact, they possibly have no problems in circadian photo entrainment. They'll have enormous sleep wake cycle, but they're totally blind. But they are totally image blind. And what's really interesting is that and this story I heard from Chuck Zeissler, so I'll give him credit, that some of these people who are image blind, usually they get Dry eyes and they give them a lot of pain, and doctors used to think, oh, then since they are image blind and they're getting dry eye, why don't you just remove eyes, they're not using them anymore. And the minute they would remove their eyes, they start having cyclical sleep problems indicating that now they are not in training to the light dark cycle and are having cyclical jet lags when their clock shifts through the light dark cycle.[0:19:57] Andrew Huberman: That's really interesting. And, I hear from a number of blind people, you know, in my various, aspects of my job, and they a lot of them have issues with With sleep, I think, in part because they don't realize that they too need to see light at particular times of day or night in order to Absolutely. Their schedule. Absolutely. Well, I think that's a perfect, segue for us to talk about how light and viewing light can impact our sleep wake rhythms.[0:20:24] Andrew Huberman: And then we will move into some of the other ways in which light can impact other forms of bodily function.[0:20:30] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. So I I love the way you set it up because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect of trying to educate people about light effect On subconscious vision is that it's subconscious. So we're all aware of what we think is intensity because we see the room. But, You know, if you talk to people who know how to take photographs and stuff like that, they know that the intensities varies greatly. But our System because we have to see the same way in very bright conditions and very dim conditions.[0:21:02] Dr. Samer Hattar: We're not very good at estimating ins intensity consciously. So when you try to tell people about intensity, you really struggle because they think they know intensities, but they really don't. You mean light intensity? Light intensity. So so that the cones themselves have an incredible ability to adapt to different light conditions.[0:21:21] Dr. Samer Hattar: So you can see at all different conditions. Otherwise, it'd be a disaster. You know? If you don't change the the setting on your camera and you go from inside the room to the outside, side, it becomes completely white. You don't see anything.[0:21:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: So if your cones don't adapt to the environment, then you're not gonna be able to see in this room and In on the beach. Right? But the problem is your your IPRGC is the cells that we talked about. They measure intensity pretty well. They really know what intensity is.[0:21:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: They have a very good linear measurement of intensity. They don't adapt as well. They don't adapt actually that much, to be honest. So that tells you that subconsciously, the system is used to measuring light intensity in a natural environment. Because when you are now in a natural environment, you don't have, you know, industrialized lighting, Then you, you know, your system is functioning very well.[0:22:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: But now when we change these environments, we could really mess up ourselves. So you have to teach people How to understand intensity? And that's something that you have to explain to people. And I think I love to do it myself. I do it in what is called The lowest amount of light required to allow you to see comfortably.[0:22:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: So you have to do this as an fun experiment.[0:22:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So explain to me how this goes, or And maybe we could break it up in the day into, 3 or 4 parts. So let's say Right. Assuming that most people wake up in the morning Mhmm. Mhmm.[0:22:46] Andrew Huberman: As opposed to night shift workers, etcetera, we could talk about Right. Later. But you wake up in the morning, so let's divide the day into quarters. What is what is the proper way to interact with light in the 1st[0:22:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: part of the day. So I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up. Get as much light as you can[0:23:05] Andrew Huberman: Into your eyes.[0:23:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. It's really nice. Your system is primed. If you're entrained, it's primed to get light. The sun should be out.[0:23:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: Most animals in the wild, they actually seem to track the the sun. The sun has a huge influence on life on Earth. It's actually life on Earth is because of sun. So that's easy. In the morning, when you wake up, you need light.[0:23:25] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So what what is the behavioral practice that that you recommend? Does it let's say somebody is in a condition where there's a lot of cloud cover.[0:23:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah.[0:23:33] Andrew Huberman: Is it important to get outside?[0:23:35] Dr. Samer Hattar: So I have to tell you, the cloudiest day is gonna be much More brighter than your room. You could ask any photographer. A cloudy day unless it's really dark, dark clouds. Usually cloudy days have much more bright Outside than inside the room. Even when you have good lighting inside the room.[0:23:52] Dr. Samer Hattar: So I think in the outside is usually Even when it's cloudy, you're gonna get enough intensity to help you adjust your cycle to the day night cycle. So how how long do you These are general rules of thumb, but[0:24:05] Andrew Huberman: how long do you recommend people go out[0:24:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: So if you do it daily, you possibly need very if if you do it daily because remember, this thing is gonna happen on a daily matter.[0:24:13] Andrew Huberman: So it's like so the clock is tracking it on a regular basis?[0:24:16] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely. It's it's photon counting. It's tracking. I would say 15 minutes. If you don't do it daily, you may wanna increase it.[0:24:23] Dr. Samer Hattar: And we talk about when you travel, what you could do. But but, yeah, 15 minutes should be fun. You do it more. It doesn't hurt. And through a[0:24:30] Andrew Huberman: window, I was my understanding is that through a window, It dramatically decreases the amount of light energy coming.[0:24:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: It depends of how, you know, how thick the windows are and how dark they are. So it's but it's also nice to go outside And to to feel the season.[0:24:44] Andrew Huberman: Sunglasses off. I don't use sunglasses.[0:24:47] Dr. Samer Hattar: I[0:24:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But you have the you're Jordanian for pigment, know? So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[0:24:52] Andrew Huberman: Whereas my eyes are very sensitive.[0:24:53] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? No. So I but I personally you know, if I'm in the shade or if not incredibly bright. I tried to especially in the morning, but I'm also an early person. So we have to differentiate between[0:25:04] Andrew Huberman: early time do you wake up?[0:25:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: I wake up at 4:30 in the morning.[0:25:07] Andrew Huberman: But the sun isn't[0:25:08] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's not out yet. So it's[0:25:10] Andrew Huberman: So what do you do? You turn on artificial lights?[0:25:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: I usually don't turn on artificial light because I know the sun is gonna come up eventually, but that's why I don't like the change in the timing that they do. Do do Wait. What do[0:25:21] Andrew Huberman: you do between 4:30 AM and 7 AM? I mean, I just[0:25:24] Dr. Samer Hattar: got my computer[0:25:25] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I see. Phone.[0:25:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: So possibly, I get enough light. But But in reality, I mean, as long as you let your body get the morning sunlight, which I think is really To me, and I there is no evidence of this. But to me, this is if you look at all animals, plants, this morning sunlight seems to be very important. And I I you know, we don't have experiments to show it, but I have a gut feeling that it has a huge impact on humans.[0:25:51] Andrew Huberman: Well, Jamie Zietser's lab at the Stanford Sleep lab has shown that these early morning light flashes Mhmm. Can adjust the total amount of sleep that one will get. Makes it easier to get into sleep.[0:26:02] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely. Okay. So And and and, Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments that[0:26:08] Andrew Huberman: showed Right. Maybe you should could describe those because those are beautiful experiments. They[0:26:11] Dr. Samer Hattar: are beautiful experience. He he he took these, you know, college students that had a late onset of sleep and late waking time. And then he said, let's go camping and just don't use any artificial light, and you could go to sleep as as as late or as early as you want and wake up as late as early. And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern just by exposing them to[0:26:34] Andrew Huberman: the light dark cycle. I mean, so And it lasted And it lasted. Even after they came back. Exactly. 2 days of camping reset the circadian[0:26:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: 7 days, but it it lasted. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Yeah. It's really incredible.[0:26:46] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So get bright light of some sort early in the day, ideally sunlight. Even on a cloudy day, it's going to be brighter than indoor lights. Okay. That's easy.[0:26:56] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So then And[0:26:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: and the other thing that I would like to mention to people. If it if you think it's very dim outside, let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer. So remember, intensity is only 1 component. Duration is also important because remember that the circadian system is not like the image system. In the image system, you have to change every second because you're looking at different objects.[0:27:17] Dr. Samer Hattar: You have to change your perception. But for the circadian system, it's trying to figure out where am I in the day night cycle. So the more you give them the information, the better you are. So if it's very bright, you don't need a lot because it's clearly gonna make you fire like crazy. But if it's not bright, stay longer.[0:27:35] Dr. Samer Hattar: Stay for 1 hour. You know, have your coffee outside or something like that. It's just gonna help. Think you[0:27:41] Andrew Huberman: said something extremely important which is that this circadian system is trying to figure out when you are in time. Exactly. Not where you are in[0:27:49] Dr. Samer Hattar: space. I said where you are in time. I meant when you are.[0:27:52] Andrew Huberman: Oh, no. No. I wasn't correcting you. I just meant that it I think, fundamentally, that's the the the The incredible thing about this system Absolutely. That you have this clock, this 24 hour clock in your brain, but it it needs to be synchronized to the outside.[0:28:05] Andrew Huberman: So Could we go a little deeper into this, circadian setting behavior and come up with some general rules of thumb? So let's say it's a very bright day, Extremely bright.[0:28:16] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mhmm.[0:28:16] Andrew Huberman: Yep. No clouds. The sun's out. You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.[0:28:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: And I'll tell you, if you're sensitive, don't you don't even have to go in the sun. You could be in the shade. There's gonna be so many photons out there in the shade. It's gonna be perfect. You don't even have to see the sun.[0:28:34] Dr. Samer Hattar: You don't have to have the sun. You know, it's great for vitamin d. That's a different story. You could do this For your skin and and, you know, protect your skin, that's not my area of expertise. But for for that effect on the circadian system, As long as you're outside in the shade and a sunny day, 10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.[0:28:53] Andrew Huberman: Okay? And then let's Let's say it's kind of overcast. You know, it's not particularly bright or there's, you know, solid cloud cover, but, you know, obviously, the the sun is out, but You're it's not as bright. How long do you think it would take to set the clock?[0:29:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: 10 to 15 should be sufficient. Stay for half an hour. Stay for 45 minutes. If it's very dark cloud,[0:29:21] Andrew Huberman: cloud cover, how long and at what point should somebody consider using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight? Yeah. Honestly, this is where we don't have[0:29:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: a lot of information still because this is where we're gonna discuss this maybe in more detail that If you put humans in artificial conditions, the circadian system is very sensitive to light. But in reality, In the real environment, light also is affecting other aspects that are independent of the setting of the circadian pacemaker.[0:29:55] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:29:55] Dr. Samer Hattar: And these which we call the direct effect of light on mood, for example. So that is very hard to figure out what intensity you need to use. And we haven't done enough experience because the system has been discovered just recently. Mhmm. But I would say if you use bright light in the morning, and I I mean, it's It's hard for me to give numbers.[0:30:14] Dr. Samer Hattar: It can get complicated. If you're that far north and you're in the winter and you wanna get make sure you don't use these light boxes. I I would suggest that[0:30:27] Andrew Huberman: personally, but that's it. I use, it's actually not designed for circadian setting, but I have a a 930 lux light pad[0:30:34] Dr. Samer Hattar: There you go.[0:30:35] Andrew Huberman: That I bought, and I bought it. It's they're very affordable compared to the, dawn simulating lights Yeah. You don't which are which are quite expensive, frankly. And I I put it there, and so I Just basically, when I wake up in the morning, I use that until the sun comes out, and then I make sure once the sun is out, I go outside. But I keep that thing on all day.[0:30:53] Andrew Huberman: And I don't know if that's good or bad. Is it good or bad?[0:30:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: I honestly I don't think being exposed to bright light in the day is gonna ever be bad because, really, if you're outside in the day, In unless, you know, the worst gonna happen is the temperature is very high, your body's gonna say don't dehydrate and go to sleep. So you you could tell actually sometimes When it's very hot, the more you get exposed to bright light, the sleepier you feel in the afternoon, which is counterintuitive.[0:31:20] Andrew Huberman: So But that's to protect us, do you think, against dehydration?[0:31:23] Dr. Samer Hattar: I think if you think about the human evolution from near the Quater in the between noon and a certain time in the afternoon, it would have been very hard for you to maintain Physiological homeostatic function being active at this very high temperature time. So I think napping was a way. That's why I think it has a major function, which is still napping was a way to somehow take you away from that dangerous zone. And maybe that's why people In the north, they say in the winter, we can't wake up in the morning because they don't have this long light, so they sleep it more at night. But in the summer, they say we feel like We can't go to sleep.[0:32:00] Dr. Samer Hattar: We have to put all these dark curtains. So I think, you know, venturing that up that much north up north Has been came up with problem because evolution was used to a certain light environment that was completely Changed with a human, with other animals, I think, that lived there longer. They have come up with very interesting adaptation of Actually measuring even very small changes in the light in the light intensities that still occur. So in even if you're Near the the the poles, even though it it's always light, but there is a change in the light intensity across the day night cycle. So your system, if it's linear and remember, I told you that IPRGCs are incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, this is lower light than higher light if if if the organism has the ability to do that.[0:32:49] Andrew Huberman: I see. You know, it's it's interesting. I've I've spent so much time, learning from you, fortunately about these cells, And, yeah, I never really appreciated until now how, on the one hand, they are tracking the amount of light to understand And when we are in time relative to the 24 hour cycle, but also that you keep mentioning this this linear measurement of intensity that they really are trying to figure out when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light. And, of course, the sun is the most intense source of light available to us. So okay.[0:33:22] Andrew Huberman: So I think we've, have nailed down that 1st part of the day. Exactly. Basically, it's get 10 to 30 minutes depending on how bright it is, and try and do that as as often as possible to give the system a regulation.[0:33:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: Is the best. This system is really about and and you'll see that even for the effect on depression. It's about multiple days. It's So you don't have to worry if you missed it one day, you know, stay longer if you want. But if you're in a hurry and you wanna do other stuff, that's a great recommendation.[0:33:49] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mhmm.[0:33:49] Andrew Huberman: So you might wanna compensate with some extra time if you missed a day or two. And this is why I I've heard you say before, it's entirely possible to get severely jet lagged without traveling.[0:33:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely.[0:34:00] Andrew Huberman: Simply by staying in, being on your phone too much, not getting the sunlight.[0:34:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: And you saw this during the pandemic. Lot of People mentioned that their sleep wake cycle suffered a lot. Because if you're not going out and if you're staying at home and you don't have big windows And you're waking late waking up late, and then you're using very bright light till late at night, your body's gonna shift. And now your day is gonna start instead of, Like, really when the sun comes up, let's say, at 6 o'clock in the morning, it's gonna your day is gonna start at 11 o'clock in the morning. That's what your body's gonna think is the beginning of the day.[0:34:35] Dr. Samer Hattar: So then you're not gonna be able to sleep at 10 o'clock at night because now that's really for for your body is completely different timing. And you could see this happen during the pandemic at a very high scale. People get delayed in their sleep wake cycle a lot.[0:34:52] Andrew Huberman: And, there is this idea of chronotypes that we all each intrinsically have a a best rhythm of either being a morning person, you called yourself an early person, Or a night owl or more of a kind of standard, you know, to bed around 10:30 up around 7 type, thing. And the and I think there are now good data, correct me if I'm wrong, From the National Institutes of Mental Health and elsewhere showing that the more we deviate from that intrinsic rhythm, the more Mental health issues and physical health issues start to crop up.[0:35:23] Dr. Samer Hattar: So there is great data on this, and there is couple of things that complicate this. The first is The people who usually are late, they tell you that the society doesn't accommodate.[0:35:32] Andrew Huberman: What let by late, what what do you mean people that wake up late and go to sleep? Go to[0:35:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: sleep late and wake up late. They they have an overwhelmingly higher level of depression and failures. I mean, clearly, I mean, the reason The people say sleep early, wake up early, or better because human notice that people who wake up go to Sleep early and wake up early, they do better in life. They notice that. They just perform better.[0:35:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: They perform. But the question is is is that Intrinsic to the system or is that society? Because society start things usually early or late. That's a hard question.[0:36:05] Andrew Huberman: We discriminate and slate rises.[0:36:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: We in a way, we discriminate. Right? But the other explanation is Ken Wright's experiment. The these late riser, if they were truly Chronotypically late. Why would they shift so easily when you put them in the if you were really chronotypically late, And there is a phase relation between the light dark environment and your circadian clock.[0:36:28] Dr. Samer Hattar: Then doing this camping experiment should not have caused much changes because It's not that, you know, you you light is gonna affect you in a certain way. It's that this is the relationship that your body decided that I'm a late sleeper, Late waking. So I I'm honestly I'm still unable to figure out how much of this late waking up is controlled by the light environment And how much is intrinsic? I'm sure there are differences. But are they as big as we see in the environment?[0:36:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: Because you have people that go up to sleep at seven PM and wake up at 1 AM, these are clearly advanced face. So people that[0:37:06] Andrew Huberman: go to sleep at 7 PM and wake up at 1 AM Yeah. And feel good doing that.[0:37:10] Dr. Samer Hattar: I'm not so sure they feel good, but lot of the time you talk to people, they say they are high achievers. But they suffer because, you know, they they wake They go to 7 PM, wake up advanced face sleep syndrome, they call it. They they call it a syndrome. But, you know, But then you have people who would not be able to sleep till 5 AM and and not be able to wake up till 3 PM. Right?[0:37:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: And I'm not so sure that the circadian system is that variable in the human population. I mean, clearly, there are maybe some genetic factors that make a small Percentage of, like, everything with a bell shape. But I think most of the time, the light environment may play a role. And once As you as we've talked about, this is a long term effect of life. Once you get into a rhythm, and I I don't mean it as a pun.[0:37:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: In reality, once you get into a rhythm, It's hard to break out of that rhythm because if you start sleeping late and waking up late, you're not getting the morning sunlight.[0:38:06] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:38:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: And so you you're just gonna be late. And if you're like me waking up early, you're getting the morning sunlight. You're getting what size you said, I said his last name wrong.[0:38:19] Andrew Huberman: The one in Stanford who did the the Oh, Jamie Zeitzler.[0:38:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: Zeitzler.[0:38:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[0:38:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah.[0:38:23] Andrew Huberman: He actually worked for Seismic. Zeitzer. So Zeitzer and Zeistler. Yeah. There are a lot of z z's and i's in those in those in their names.[0:38:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Both phenomenal scientists. Yeah. What what It seems to me is the case is that the only way to really know if you're meant to be an early Bird, as they call it, an early person or a late person or somewhere in between, is to get morning sunlight and figure out whether or not that makes you feel better.[0:38:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: And to understand, To be educated about how to measure intensity, how to measure, I put it between quotation, because you either get a a measuring device, But you cannot depend on eye on your eye to measure intense.[0:39:03] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So how do we do that? Because you're you keep coming back to this so I I that tells me that it's important. It's very important. So there are apps, like free apps, like, light meter, where you can walk around and hold the button down and see how many luxe, You know, are in the[0:39:17] Dr. Samer Hattar: These are complicated because you have[0:39:19] Andrew Huberman: to point them to specific read. So so how how do people start to develop an intuitive sense Of the measurement of intensity.[0:39:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I think at one point, I posted on Instagram how I keep my nighttime at home, and I found out that My night vision is very strong. So I found out that I especially in the winter, I only need candlelight. So I literally use these tea lights, And I put, like, 15 or 20 of them. A romantic.[0:39:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: And it's so nice. I could see it clearly doesn't affect my circadian system. And your Cats And and my wife and your wife great. It's just great. Right?[0:39:55] Dr. Samer Hattar: But I don't expect people to have the same night vision as me. So The simp I mean, I tell people, do the experiment. So if you put 3 or 4 lights in your room, Switch to sit for 15 minutes.[0:40:09] Andrew Huberman: You switch to off.[0:40:10] Dr. Samer Hattar: Switch to off. Let's say you're using 5. And see, after 15 minutes, you will not recognize you switch these 2 off. My gut feeling is that most people would need at least 10 times less light than they use at night to see. The problem people use it because most The time they didn't see the morning sunlight.[0:40:28] Dr. Samer Hattar: They are actually hungry for light without their knowledge. So they come switch all these lights on, but at the wrong time Because they woke up late.[0:40:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Now now I understand. So so this morning light viewing goes way beyond[0:40:41] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely.[0:40:41] Andrew Huberman: Setting your clock. It's also a way to determine how how little light you need later in the day. Exactly. And we and we're gonna talk about this in a moment, but How little light you get later in the day is a very strong determinant of things like when you will wake up, whether or not you wake up feeling refreshed, etcetera. Let's That's that's why[0:41:00] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I'm gonna break it on your show, Andrew, that I'm gonna tell you, I think there is something else that people to need to think about, which is the model. That this model incorporate 3 components we should talk about in details that allows us humans and all animals To incorporate the circadian clock and its relation to light, the homeostatic drive, and the direct effect of the environment, which includes stress, light, all kind of stuff. They have to be incorporated together. If you think that's what I think right now.[0:41:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: If you think of 1 alone, You will always miss something.[0:41:37] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And when[0:41:38] Dr. Samer Hattar: you think of them as a whole, things really become clear. It's actually quite amazing.[0:41:42] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Well, we will definitely Want to hear about your tripartite theory and and go into detail about this homeostatic mechanisms. I wanna make sure that for people who are, I'm thinking now, I'm sure about light and how it impacts them. So the morning light viewing behavior, I like to think we've tacked down Clearly. And and thank you for that because there's so much information out there, and, I've tried to relay that information.[0:42:06] Andrew Huberman: Of course, you're my primary source for All things, Circadian as well as Jamie and others, of course, and Matt Walker, but I think you've made that very, very clear. Now Let's say I've gotten my morning sunlight. Okay? Or I made my bright artificial light, and throughout the day, you said to get a lot of light. So I'm working at my desk.[0:42:25] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I'll I'll go out during the day a few times, but I'm working at my computer. I'm doing things. Is there anything about light viewing in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind, or can they just sort of freestyle it depending on what they're doing? Most people are not, you know, in a dark room Yeah. Throughout the day.[0:42:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: My gut feeling, if you got your morning sunlight, you walk from your car slowly or you walk To work, you didn't wear sunglasses when the lights were still dim in the morning, that you could free style it. That even if you don't get a lot of light, there is a way To just you know, in the day, you don't have to just worry about getting a lot of bright light. But personally, I like to do that. So I go out at lunch And and have my lunch outside as well. This reminds the body that here it is even brighter now.[0:43:13] Dr. Samer Hattar: But the evidence is that you could literally Help your circadian clock by giving lights at dawn and dusk. But, again, if you think of the tripartite model, this may be important versus clock. But is it important for your mood? So that's where I think you need or the homeostatic drive. So that's where you need To think about it.[0:43:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: So for the clock, for in training your clock, you literally can entrain it only by the dawn sunlight. You actually don't need dawn on dusk. You better forget that.[0:43:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I appreciate that you're distinguishing between circadian effects and other effects of life. Yes. You're being very precise, which is is appreciated. Until we hear about this tripartite model, which we will cover, for the for the sake of the discussion, let's treat the light viewing behavior as what are the benefits or drawbacks of viewing light for all biological purposes, not just circadian setting.[0:44:07] Andrew Huberman: So in the morning, it's clearly gonna set the clock. And then during the day, it if I understand correctly, the idea is to get as much bright light as you can because you're feeding, it sounds like, a sort of, light hunger. Exactly. I see.[0:44:21] Dr. Samer Hattar: I love this way to put it. I think there is a weird light hunger considering that we're not photosynthetic organisms. There is a weird light hungers in animals that they need to measure. They need they they need measure. And I think that relates to the season because The whole reproduction cycle of animals gonna depend on the availability of food in the environment.[0:44:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: And If you don't know when the season's gonna happen, they don't have calendars. It's gonna be very hard to survive. So I think that's why we have It's light hunger. That's a major hypothesis. It's not being tested.[0:44:54] Dr. Samer Hattar: Interesting.[0:44:54] Andrew Huberman: So then afternoon and evening start to approach. So I've had this weird experience. Maybe you can psychologically or Mhmm. Biologically diagnose me now, Samer. So where if I go into a movie in the afternoon like a matinee and I come out and it's dark, I notice a significant drop in my mood and my ability to go to sleep.[0:45:17] Andrew Huberman: Whereas if I get some view of the light in the evening, doesn't have to be the sunset, although sunsets are nice, but I get some light pulse in the afternoon that I have no trouble whatsoever[0:45:29] Dr. Samer Hattar: And this happens in a daily on a on[0:45:31] Andrew Huberman: a single time to to watch them more or less. That's interest. And then you mentioned the camping experiment where when they went camping, they're seeing the sunrise and the sunset. Mhmm.[0:45:40] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mhmm.[0:45:41] Andrew Huberman: So what should people do in the afternoon slash evening time in terms of their light viewing behavior?[0:45:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, the best thing to do is to let the natural light creep in into darkness. Right? That would be the best. But clearly, That would be inefficient. You you wanna go home.[0:45:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: You wanna read. You wanna talk to your kids. You wanna talk to your family. So I think, You know, it's nice to extend the day. I don't think that's wrong if you somehow can block that light from affecting your circadian clock.[0:46:12] Andrew Huberman: So should people use blue blockers in the evening? I personally[0:46:16] Dr. Samer Hattar: do not like any blockers that take a single wavelength of light because, Again, if you think of a holistic approach, yes, the blue blocker is gonna prevent you from affecting your circadian clock very much, But then your vision is gonna be distorted because we always see in full spectrum. The sun has this beautiful spectrum. Right? And then when you start seeing without the blue, things look yellow and it can get really weird. Right?[0:46:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean so I I personally I've tried the blue blocker, and I couldn't even wear them. I I thought they were just really horrendous, to be honest.[0:46:53] Andrew Huberman: Well, along the lines of blue blockers, I think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long.[0:46:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: Oh my god. That would be bad.[0:46:59] Andrew Huberman: A lot of people do that. That would be bad. A lot of people do that. They think that The blue light is bad. I think that the No.[0:47:04] Andrew Huberman: No. The the concept of blue light being bad, led to the a lot of product development, And a lot of people are just assuming that viewing blue light is what was giving them headaches, when in fact, it might have just been looking at screens at at close distance.[0:47:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: So here's the problem. Right? Mean, the blue light got the bad reputation because people who gave a pure blue light showed that it caused a hugely retinal damage. But again, if you're using blue light In its pure form, it has a lot of energy because it's shorter wavelength. But we're talking about full spectrum light.[0:47:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: There are ways now where you could change the spectrum of the light and keep it white between day night and change the content of the color without you noticing. So you don't even have to affect your vision.[0:47:49] Andrew Huberman: So how would you go about doing that?[0:47:51] Dr. Samer Hattar: So you just lower the level of the blue light. You don't have to eliminate it. Just dim the lights. Dim the blue, but keep then increase the yellow, but keep all the colors in a certain white. So, you know, you could have different Warmness of white.[0:48:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: And people know how to do this. Physicists know how to do this. People who work with light know how to do this.[0:48:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, maybe somebody in the wellness slash, I I don't like the word, but biohacking or, optical community will do this. I think it's a really important I I see so many people wearing blue lockers.[0:48:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: I don't know why why they look Well, I[0:48:24] Andrew Huberman: think they're just uninformed. I think Yeah. Frankly[0:48:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: And to be honest, it's easy. Right? It's easier to explain to somebody If IPRGCs respond mostly to blue, remove blue, you'll be fine.[0:48:33] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:48:34] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? Right. But that's not as simple as[0:48:35] Andrew Huberman: that because they also receive input. So you wanna actually And, you know, we could go into details that's boring for you listeners, but it also affect the adaptation properties of the whole retina. So you don't wanna do something so drastic that you take just 1 color of the spectrum. It just seems very counterintuitive to me, to be honest. You've told me before as well that just because these intrinsically photosensitive circadian setting Ganglion cells respond best to blue light if the light is bright enough because they also get input from other components of the eye.[0:49:12] Andrew Huberman: It doesn't matter if you block the blues. Yeah. If you're looking at bright light at night, you're going to disrupt your circadian cycle.[0:49:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: And and that's why I didn't wanna go into the boring details. But them of the photoreceptors have a wide range of responsiveness. So they are most sensitive to blue light, but that doesn't mean they don't respond to green light or to shorter than blue light. They respond to very, very wide spectrum with different sensitivities. Unless you understand the system, just removing 480, I don't think it's gonna do anything.[0:49:41] Andrew Huberman: 108 nanometers. Yeah. So, Your home is a cave at night, basically, with some with some it's a nice cave[0:49:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah.[0:49:50] Andrew Huberman: With candles. That's right. Right? And you and your And they watch TV ads. And your cats and your lovely wife,[0:49:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: who[0:49:56] Andrew Huberman: I know who's also a phenomenal scientist in their own. Right?[0:49:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. She[0:49:59] Andrew Huberman: is. She is. And But you do keep your home quite dim to dark at night.[0:50:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: In fact, I did go to to meetings with with some of my Friends who work on this, and they really struggled with me. They said we could have broken our legs living in the same light environment that you do. So I am an extreme, but I measured it for myself, and I asked Reggie, my wife, if she's okay with it. She also liked the dimness. Both of us can see well in In dim conditions, and and that helps us a lot.[0:50:30] Dr. Samer Hattar: But I think you have to measure it for yourself. You really have to Do it's a very simple experiment. Just try to dim the light as much as you can. I I call it the minimum amount of light you require to see comfortably. And that's how[0:50:44] Andrew Huberman: you want your environment ideally at night.[0:50:47] Dr. Samer Hattar: This is what I think is the game changer. If you reach to a level Where it's just barely you're literally on the cusp of seeing uncomfortably versus seeing very comfortably. You are gonna be very much better than I don't like to make it completely dark. I think complete darkness induce anxiety in humans, be honest, so I don't like complete darkness. If Kids[0:51:12] Andrew Huberman: don't like complete darkness. They like a night light.[0:51:14] Dr. Samer Hattar: Animal even nocturnal animals don't like complete darkness. I mean, we have studies in animals that are nocturnal, that if you put them in complete darkness for several weeks, they they they have severe anxiety and depression like effect. So keep the light dim. You know, use Red light that is very dim if you wanna keep the room for sleeping. Red light that is very dim has very small effect On on on circadian clock, and below 10 locks of red light literally doesn't affect sleep at all.[0:51:47] Dr. Samer Hattar: So there are ways to do it. It just we need to educate the public, and I feel like you literally need a whole, lecture to just explain to the people How to deal with life because it's not as simple as people think.[0:52:01] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's what we're doing here. Yeah. We're stepping through it piece by piece, and, And the reason we're doing that is because it's not as simple as saying just block blue light or get a lot of light during the day and I mean, just just put it[0:52:11] Dr. Samer Hattar: in perspective to tell it, We only have 3 different cones in our retina that respond to 3 different colors. We call them red cones for simplicity, Green cones and blue cones. Yet we have only 3 of these, but we could see massive palette of colors. So that tells you something. If the system was just simply about a single color and is is just removing 480 or just blue is sufficient, Then we should only see in red, yellow, and blue.[0:52:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: We shouldn't see all these different hues of color. But because the system is not that, We see all these different colors. And that's why it's important to remind people that the white light is made of many different colors. It's actually like the rainbow. That's why you see the rainbow.[0:52:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's made of many colors. White light is never truly white. It's made of Lot of different colors.[0:53:03] Andrew Huberman: It's like the Pink Floyd album cover[0:53:05] Dr. Samer Hattar: Exactly.[0:53:06] Andrew Huberman: Like coming through Exactly. Exactly. So Dim at night, maybe dim red light ideally or candlelight, find that minimum required light level.[0:53:16] Dr. Samer Hattar: Just Just make sure when you lower the light, sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Let your system adapt. Because If you had it bright light and you switch it off, surely you're gonna suffer because your system didn't adapt it. It was used to very bright light. So you want to engage your rods which take a long time to dark adapt.[0:53:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: So that's why I tell you just wait a little bit. Don't just switch it off, I don't see. Put it on. Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes, and then see how you see. And then once you do that, you will notice that, actually, yeah, I could see quite well even with much less light.[0:53:57] Andrew Huberman: What do you do regarding screens?[0:54:00] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. That's that's the hardest thing. Again, I mean, There are beautiful programs that change the whole intensity and color of the screen. These could help dim your screen at night to the lowest part. I mean, Yes.[0:54:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: You won't see it when you wake up in the morning, but then you could increase the intensity. So try to decrease. I mean, just what we were talking about. Think of light intensity, duration, color, and time of day. You really have to keep these 4 things together.[0:54:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right?[0:54:28] Andrew Huberman: We've roomed together at a couple meetings from time to time no longer because one of us not to be named has a severe Snoring issue that made the other one pseudo homicidal. You can guess who that was, but I've seen you check your phone after dark[0:54:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mhmm.[0:54:48] Andrew Huberman: Once or twice, and you did it by sort of Pointing your phone away from you. Right? Absolutely. And, actually, I'm sort of half joking, but I and you dim it quite a bit.[0:54:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: Dim it.[0:54:59] Andrew Huberman: I'm sort of half joking, but It actually makes sense that, you know, if you shine a flashlight in your eye, it's much brighter than if you shine a flashlight[0:55:05] Dr. Samer Hattar: on the direct line. So if you just look on the side, most of the lights is gonna go this way, and you're on this thing.[0:55:10] Andrew Huberman: So you're okay. So and as silly as that might seem to people listening, I mean, what it means is that getting bright light in your eyes at night is something that you really wanna avoid, and but there is the reality that[0:55:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: And and even when I check sometimes, if if I, you know, if I have something, and I check it so fast and switch it off so fast. So I'm also aware of the durations. I'm I'm also aware on the duration. Right? So duration, intensity, color, and time of day.[0:55:38] Dr. Samer Hattar: Ideally, I should not check iPhones and Ipads. I don't use iPad at night because it's hard to lower it enough because it's a huge but even my iPhone, I try not to use it at night. And, like, once it becomes 8:30 or 9, I don't look at it at all.[0:55:53] Andrew Huberman: Unless it's World Cup or Euro Cup, in which case, Sanjay is on 24 hours, everybody.[0:55:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: That's only every 4 weeks.[0:56:00] Andrew Huberman: He's a big soccer fan. Alright. This has been incredibly, no pun, illuminating. Let's talk about the relationship between light and some of these other Non circadian or pseudo circadian effects, and and we will, try and link those. But you had a, What I consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published in Nature a few years ago showing that if you disrupt The exposure to light or the timing of the exposure to light that there are dramatic effects on the stress system and on the learning and memory system.[0:56:41] Andrew Huberman: We could talk about each of those separately or together. What what are the effects on stress and the effects on learning when light viewing behavior and sleep wake cycles are disrupted.[0:56:53] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. So just To remind you, you know that, but to remind your, listeners that I was trained as a circadian biologist. So I really was indoctrinated into thinking that light has to affect the clock, which then cause all these different effects. So that's That's what I believe. That's my dogma.[0:57:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: That's what would have made me really happy. And then Tara Leggates and Kara Altimus joined the lab and said and And we started discussing a lot of data, and we said, what if there is a direct effect of light that we're missing independent of the circadian clock? So this is not an easy question to ask to answer because as we've been talking all along, light affects the circadian clock. So how could you Give light at different times of the day and not mess up the circadian clock. Luckily, we came up with such a way, and that's why it was Important to do this experiment the way we did them.[0:57:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: And we proved that this light dark cycle does not disrupt the clock. There is still a circadian rhythm and does not close sleep does not cause sleep deprivation. And yet, surprisingly, if you give light at the wrong time of the day, even without disrupting the circadian or without causing sleep deprivation. As you mentioned, you get a huge mood changes in in The organisms and you get learning deficit. So this really and at the time, people have really hit us hard.[0:58:17] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, It it was really hard to publish this work, and and you could yeah.[0:58:22] Andrew Huberman: Well, it came out in nature, so I I in the end, you prevailed. But I wanna make sure that I understand. So you're you're saying that, yes, there are effects of light on the circadian rhythm. Absolutely. Meaning sleep and wake wakefulness Yes.[0:58:36] Andrew Huberman: And their timing. However, there are direct effects of light on mood that can be dissociated from the effects on on sleep and waking. So if I interpret that correctly, that could mean that when we view light and how much light could make us feel happier or less happy or even depressed, stressed, learning, etcetera.[0:58:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: Bingo.[0:59:00] Andrew Huberman: Even if we're sleeping and waking up at the appropriate times.[0:59:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: Bingo. I mean, eventually, because we're talking about the whole system, eventually, when you start having the other problems, you also develop sleep problems. But you're absolutely right. And in fact, now, Research from Diego Fernandez in the lab have found that now we know that they actually require different brain regions. So we don't only have a theory.[0:59:25] Dr. Samer Hattar: We don't only have a light environment that showed they can be dissociated. We know that they use completely different brain regions. So the SCN that I told you about earlier, the place where the central pacemaker is, the one that receives direct input from the retina Through the IPRGCs to adjust your circadian clock is not the area that receives the light input for mood regulation. It's a completely different brain region.[0:59:49] Andrew Huberman: What's the brain region called?[0:59:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: So the brain region, we called it the perihabenolar nucleus. I'm not so sure how good or bad the name, but doesn't matter. The PHB and what's really amazing, this region also receives direct input from the IPRGCs, but projects to areas in the brain that unknown to regulate mood, including the ventral medial prefrontal prefrontal cortex, which has been studied for many years to be impacted in a human depression. So just by by this amazing serendipity to find That a region that is so deep in the advanced brain, like the the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain, one of the most Elaborated in humans to see that they receive inputs from these ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us and told us how much we didn't understand the importance of light on human behavior.[1:00:43] Andrew Huberman: So how does that finding inform Daily protocols for you or for other people. I realize you can't leap to always from 1 paper to daily protocol. But if light indeed does control Prefrontal cortex, executive function, learning, stress, and mood. And let's say I'm waking up each morning and I'm sleeping. What what should I do differently?[1:01:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: That's why we came up with the tripartite model. Because, yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock with lights in and being dark throughout the day. But that may not be important for your whole physiological function. So now if we include these other effects of light, That's why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day. I don't wanna be in very dim light condition throughout the day.[1:01:27] Andrew Huberman: I see.[1:01:28] Dr. Samer Hattar: So even though it doesn't affect your clock, As you beautifully said, Andrew, it may affect your mood and learning and memory. It may affect your alertness level which is gonna allow you to learn better. It may affect your homeostatic drive. Maybe your homeostatic factor will go higher so you could sleep earlier. So it's important to think of light as stimulating all these brain regions, which means it's producing more activity, which in reality, this is how people think of the homeostatic drive that the more active you are, the more the homeostatic drive is built up, the better you sleep.[1:02:01] Dr. Samer Hattar: So that's why we came up with the tripartite model. Because as a circadian biologist, I only thought of light through the circadian clock affecting behavior. As a sleep biologist, they only thought of the homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. And for people who study light for vision and other They thought only of the environmental input. But now if you put them all together, you get with this tripartite model where it's really mind boggling, and it makes so much sense.[1:02:28] Dr. Samer Hattar: The organism doesn't wanna depend on a single component. But if you could incorporate these 3 together, you could have a beautiful system that is well adapted. So let me tell you the sleep wake cycle. Right? So we know there is a homeostatic drive to affect sleep.[1:02:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: We've had beautiful talks about that.[1:02:45] Andrew Huberman: Which is basically the longer you're awake, the more you wanna be asleep.[1:02:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: So that's your homeostatic drive. We've talked about the circadian influence of sleep And the fact that light dark cycle affect the circadian system, which eventually affects sleep. So these 2 components are well understood. Now the third factor Is your direct light or environmental input? How much stress, how much light you get from there also can highly impact sleep.[1:03:09] Dr. Samer Hattar: So even if you have a good circadian and homeostatic drive, if you're getting light at the wrong time of the day or if you're being stressed and thinking at the, Then your sleep is gonna suffer. So you have to think of the 3 together to have a beautiful sleep wake cycle. And that's why we came up with the tripartite monohydrate. The same thing happens with feeding. I could beautifully put it to people.[1:03:31] Dr. Samer Hattar: Your hunger, your energy level is measured by the nucleus. Your daily intake of food is again depending on the CNN and light dark input. We found that if food is not available, there is yet a third Input that is not dependent on the SCN, not dependent on the arcuate, depending on a completely brain different brain regions So the animal can actually start looking or the human can start looking for food when it's scarce even at time when they are not supposed to be active. So that's how the organism think they have to evaluate multiple inputs for them to decide what is the best physiological outcome at that moment, At that season. I see.[1:04:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: So[1:04:13] Andrew Huberman: I wanna get into arcuate and feeding, but just to keep, make sure we can, you know, keep our hands around this tripartite model. So if I understand correctly, we've got the circadian influence, then you've also got the drive to sleep. Right. Actually, one of the ways, that I think that can be best understood is If somebody ever pulls an all nighter, they get tired around 11 or 12 or so, and then very tired around 3, 4 AM. But then even if you stay up sometime right around 7 or 8 AM, your normal wake up time, you start to feel alert again.[1:04:44] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. And that's because the sleep drive is extremely strong, there's a circadian rhythm that drives wakefulness in the morning. Okay. So that's 2 of the components. Right.[1:04:53] Andrew Huberman: Before we get into the feeding component, I wanna talk about these effects of light on mood. Mhmm. Okay? Diego Fernandez's data. And this perihabenular thing.[1:05:03] Andrew Huberman: For sure. So let's just, for the moment, Set aside the tri part of the tripartite model and just focus on what are the direct effects of light on mood. And the way that I interpret what you've said so far is that The protocol that emerges from this, if one is trying to optimize their mood, is, yes, see light view light, I should say, early in the day in order to set your circadian clock, Maybe also in the evening as well. And, of course, avoid light at night. Get it as dim as possible.[1:05:30] Andrew Huberman: However, you said It's also a good idea to get as much bright light during the day as you safely can in order to improve your mood Independently of regulating your sleep wake cycle.[1:05:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: And that's a hypothesis. Here's the problem where it's not gonna be as satisfying as the circadian is that as you know, this brain region has been discovered very recently. Habenula. The perihabenula[1:05:53] Andrew Huberman: region. We've known about it a long time, but nobody knew what it did.[1:05:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: We knew about the habanula, but that's why the name is confusing. It's actually not the habanula itself. It's the perihabenula.[1:06:02] Andrew Huberman: Near the habanula.[1:06:03] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's near the habanula.[1:06:04] Andrew Huberman: Why don't you just call Semer Hartar nuclear. I[1:06:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: should have. I don't know why I haven't done that.[1:06:08] Andrew Huberman: Maybe because if you do that, it's not okay. Okay. So for here ever after, the perihabenular nucleus, We should probably call it the Hathar[1:06:16] Dr. Samer Hattar: Hathar Fernandez. How about[1:06:17] Andrew Huberman: the Hathar Fernandez burst in this? Okay. This is, like, nerdy science attribution stuff, but I'm just gonna call it the nucleus. Wikipedia, line it up. Okay.[1:06:27] Andrew Huberman: So this structure is taking light and independent of sleep Rhythms and circadian rhythms. It's driving changes in mood. How does it do that? Is this through the dopamine system, the serotonin system?[1:06:37] Dr. Samer Hattar: We Still recently, we haven't identified this region very well. We don't know what light does to it. We don't know how it interacts. So this is an area that is ripe for discoveries, And we're working on this right now. But that's why I said it's not satisfying.[1:06:51] Dr. Samer Hattar: This is like the function of sleep. Why do we sleep? We know sleep is very important to us, but we still don't have a satisfying function of why do we sleep. Right?[1:07:00] Andrew Huberman: I see. We have the why questions the why questions, I think it's Our our good friend and colleague at University of Washington, Russ Van Gelder, who always says, when somebody asks why, the the best answer is just to say I wasn't consulted at the design phase. Right? None of us really know why.[1:07:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: But the point is maybe I shouldn't have said why. What is the function of sleep? It's still very hard to know. Why would or what is the reason organisms have to go offline for so long? You know, people assume it's for repair, assume it's for learning and memory, assume all kind of stuff, but there is really no clear Function for sleeping.[1:07:37] Dr. Samer Hattar: There is no clear function for sleeping. I mean, if you talk to people, there are hypotheses.[1:07:42] Andrew Huberman: I mean, all we know is that if you don't sleep, if your sleep is very fractured, you get messed up.[1:07:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: And you could die even. Right? I mean, it's it's really bad if you don't sleep, But we don't know what is the function. What is this what is that sleep have done to organisms that couldn't have done with rest? What if you just could rest without sleeping?[1:08:03] Dr. Samer Hattar: Just sit down and rest.[1:08:04] Andrew Huberman: Well, my my lab is trying to figure out whether or not these non sleep deep rest protocols can compensate for For sleep. That would be great. Sleep is better, but many people are not getting the sleep that they need. But Right. But okay.[1:08:16] Andrew Huberman: So and if people are sensing that Samir and I are about to start talking over each other and arguing, that's always the goal when we talk. Right? Unlike other scientists I interact with, when Samir and I get together, it's considered a successful conversation if we get into a big fight and then go for a big meal where I pick the restaurant. Okay. So let's talk about food and eating and appetite.[1:08:39] Andrew Huberman: You had yet another. Yes. I I greatly admire your your success in in this way. Yet another incredible discovery showing that there are directs of direct, Excuse me. Effects of light on appetite and feeding behavior.[1:08:54] Andrew Huberman: Can maybe you could just summarize those results and, for And,[1:08:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: honestly, that paper is the one that allowed us to come with the tripartite model because we were thinking completely wrong about it. We wanted This experiment, it it'd be fun for your audience to hear why we started this experiment. Remember that when we discovered the IPRGCs, we figured if they are the Only re relay to entrain the circadian clock, then you could kill them and have an animal opposite to the one that we spoke or human to the one that we spoke about earlier where instead of having no pattern vision and have circadian photoentrainment, we could produce an animal that have pattern vision, but no So circadian blind. Circadian blind, but pattern sighted. And we succeeded in that.[1:09:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: The problem when you have these animals, which I've told you many times already, is that they don't adjust to the day night cycle. So doing experiments on them Become very complicated.[1:09:53] Andrew Huberman: How what is their behavior like if you don't have these cells? Are they awake and then asleep awake and then just[1:09:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: drift like the humans we've talked about.[1:09:59] Andrew Huberman: They think they're in Las Vegas. They No clocks are washed.[1:10:02] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? Exactly.[1:10:03] Andrew Huberman: They stay up later every night, and[1:10:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: they go come either depend their clock. If it's their clock is shorter, they come in earlier.[1:10:08] Andrew Huberman: If their clock is longer, they come in So they're really messed up.[1:10:11] Dr. Samer Hattar: They they really don't adjust to the if they were in the wild, they'll be eliminated in a second. Right? There's no way they'll survive. So me and Diego started talking, and we're like, What if we use none light in training agent? And what is the strong in none light in training agent?[1:10:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: Food. So we thought That the light defective animals will have more sensitivity to food and trim because as you know more than me, this is an area that you've worked really well on. For vision, if you're image blind, your hearing and and somatosensory get improved. Right? The the lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation.[1:10:49] Dr. Samer Hattar: But we found actually that if you don't have the lighter system, Actually, your feeding a bit the food ability to entrain the animal goes completely to the ground, completely opposite to[1:11:01] Andrew Huberman: what we predicted. So light Viewing and feeding behavior are interacting in ways that support one another, and[1:11:09] Dr. Samer Hattar: that's why we came with the tripartite model. We figured it's Different than sensation of the environment. When you sense with vision, vision and hearing interact, but your vision is a real full modality. You want to see. That's what vision want to do.[1:11:23] Dr. Samer Hattar: You want to hear. That's what hearing want to do. You want to sense. That's what sensing want to do. But for the circadian system, Light, food, all these in training Asian, they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system.[1:11:38] Dr. Samer Hattar: You don't just Assume if you remove light, this one is[1:11:40] Andrew Huberman: gonna be stronger. No. They need to know each other's. The light informs when the animal's gonna eat. Well, what I like about this so much is that, You know, in the other in the world outside of science in which I I don't really exist in, but that I I see a lot of this kind of wellness, You know, stuff like this, all this mind body integration stuff, it's interesting because people view the body more as a system.[1:12:06] Andrew Huberman: Right. A system of organs that interact as opposed to the way that standard science and medical profession is, like, you work on the liver or your ear, nose, and throat or heart and lung or brain or[1:12:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: That's a great way of thinking.[1:12:19] Andrew Huberman: You know? But the biology is integrated.[1:12:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I mean[1:12:22] Andrew Huberman: and so For somebody who's interested in affecting their eating behavior, something that you are familiar with and that we will Talk more about your experiences of in a moment. How should they use light in order to adjust their eating behavior?[1:12:40] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right. So now that I've told you about all these interaction between the different inputs to the circadian clock. Just You think about it as an engineer. What would be the best thing? The best thing is to know when your food times happen in the day, When should you get light and where is your when is your circadian clock in your system?[1:13:01] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? So if you eat at very specific times of the day, That's another signal that is telling your body, your clock, you're in a certain time of the day. So if you're having lunch at the correct time every day and you're getting bright light, now you have 2 systems that are informing your clock, your clock is gonna be better. So regular mealtimes? Regular mealtimes that fit Your circadian clock.[1:13:24] Dr. Samer Hattar: So and in fact, if you do that, when when I started doing this and it helped me lose weight, is that I'm exposing myself to the right Amount of light, dark cycle. I'm eating at regular time. It is amazing. You will be not hungry, let's say let's say you eat at noon. You will not Feel any hunger at 11:45, and then all of a sudden, the hunger jumps.[1:13:45] Dr. Samer Hattar: This is clearly not an energy issue because it could not be that drastic.[1:13:49] Andrew Huberman: Right. No. The desire to eat is mainly driven by these, these cues, these hormone cues that are Very exquisitely timed to Exactly. Sleep wake cycle, but also to light. Exactly.[1:14:02] Dr. Samer Hattar: And, you know, In the wild, you could imagine why energy level through the accurate is arcuate nucleus.[1:14:08] Andrew Huberman: Should explain to people what the arcuate is because I don't think we've done that adequately. The arcuate nucleus is an area of the thalamus that drives hunger and feeding behavior, and what we're talking about is the fact that it's taking cues from Your viewing of light, believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger, and, this is a a nontrivial way in which your Timing of hunger and amount of hunger is regulated by when and how much light you view. So let me ask you a couple practical[1:14:38] Dr. Samer Hattar: Can I just This is really before you ask me sorry, Andrew? We said we're gonna fight. But to me is is the the interesting thing to think about it, In the wild, when you didn't have the availability of food that we have, the arcuate plays a huge important role. Because If you're not if you weren't successful in getting food, then the arc is gonna tell you, look. You have to take risk and go get food because your energy level is very low.[1:15:03] Dr. Samer Hattar: And that's Great. There's tons of great research about that. But I think what's missing is the fact in humans, we're not getting to a situation, most of us. We're not getting to a situation where we have low energy levels. Most of the time, actually, we eat not because we want to, because we are Really have low energy, but because we wanna eat.[1:15:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: So I think that's why I feel that the timing is very important for us because we always have enough Energy level for us to eat. Mhmm.[1:15:31] Andrew Huberman: Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much that I'll eat just for the sensation of chewing.[1:15:35] Dr. Samer Hattar: True.[1:15:35] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I I enjoy the taste too. True. And I enjoy the social aspects,[1:15:39] Dr. Samer Hattar: and those[1:15:40] Andrew Huberman: are are a part of it, but I I literally enjoy the physical apps[1:15:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: chewing Absolutely. Uh-huh.[1:15:46] Andrew Huberman: Which explains a lot. Okay. So how regular are you, or do you recommend people be about mealtimes? Because what I'm hearing is that light viewing behavior is pretty straightforward. Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day, minimize it in the evening and at night, Generally speaking, for sake of mood and circadian rhythm.[1:16:09] Andrew Huberman: But for sake of regulating timing and Quality, I I should also say of food intake because people clearly make better choices about food intake when they are anticipating a meal and they aren't Constantly hungry. And so the ability to regulate hunger for particular phases of the circadian cycle is is quite valuable for all people, not just people trying to lose weight, but all people. Are we talking about down to the minute? Like, if I Yeah. Alright.[1:16:36] Andrew Huberman: Plus or so 12 noon is my normal lunch, let's say, plus or minus? Half an hour. Okay. Yeah. So eat around between 11:30 and 12:30.[1:16:45] Dr. Samer Hattar: If if that's the time and it depends if you also do multiple Meals. Remember, 3 meals, that's decision that somebody came up with. I don't know why.[1:16:54] Andrew Huberman: Nowadays, people are fewer people are doing that, I think. Yeah. Given our friends such and Panda's work.[1:16:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right. I mean, so you could have 2 meals. You could have very multiples Meals that are distributed across your active time. I I agree with Sachi Spanda's work that try to avoid Eating when your system is supposed to be relaxing, when you're supposed to be at non active time. So, You know, limit your eating to the active time of your of your cycle.[1:17:23] Dr. Samer Hattar: And that seemed to be and Joe Takahashi is doing some beautiful stuff on this. That seems to be incredibly important for, aspect of the circadian And[1:17:33] Andrew Huberman: for health.[1:17:34] Dr. Samer Hattar: And for health.[1:17:34] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, Sachin, We're referring to Sachin Panda's work. He wrote a beautiful book called The Circadian Code. Maybe, Samer, with with some luck, you'll write a book as well. Meaning the world will be lucky to have that book.[1:17:46] Andrew Huberman: But Sachin's data really strongly point to the fact that liver health, brain health, Metabolic factors and endocrine factors in in of various systems and organs all seem to benefit from having a period of each 24 hour day in which we are not eating anything and then eating it very regular sometimes. Let's talk about eating and mealtimes, and let's move a little bit away from the The science for the moment, although we will return to it, and talk a little bit more about your experience, with eating and meal times. So, you're looking in good shape lately. Thank you. I know you've been putting work into it.[1:18:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We talk a lot, and you've been exercising, and you've been Eating well, meaning quality food. You just came back from Jordan where I'm assuming the food is amazing.[1:18:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's the food is amazing. And, honestly, usually, I gain a lot of weight in Jordan, but this time, I didn't gain any weight, which was really nice. So[1:18:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You've you've when I met you, you were Probably about a £100 heavier than you are now.[1:18:49] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. 275 pounds. I'm 219 now. It's crazy. Yeah.[1:18:53] Andrew Huberman: You had a lot of vigor then, and you have a lot of vigor now. But I know that you undertook a very specific protocol in order to lose The weight based on your understanding of the circadian system and of light and appetite and mood, maybe you could just tell us a little bit about What that schedule looks like. And we realized that this is not a prescriptive for everybody, but you found what worked for you. Yeah. So maybe just describe those.[1:19:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mean, honestly, I followed my circadian cycle. Right? Of what we've talked about. Right? So I dimmed the light at night.[1:19:25] Dr. Samer Hattar: I slept at regular hours. I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch when I'm really active and I'm really hungry. And at night, When I avoid dinner because my circadian system really shuts off at 3. I'm an early person. Like, you could give me anything I would eat before 3.[1:19:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: After 3, nothing Appeals to me anymore. My system is shut off.[1:19:46] Andrew Huberman: But what time are you going to sleep and what time are you waking up?[1:19:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: So in my case is I should have put this I mean, I go to Sleep literally at 9:9 PM. I mean, I literally 5 minutes after 9 PM, I'm completely out. And I wake up between 4:30 and 5 AM. So So if I extend it, I go to 6 AM, but very rarely. It depends of how tired I was.[1:20:06] Dr. Samer Hattar: And that, as I recall,[1:20:09] Andrew Huberman: was an important set of changes for you to be able to regulate[1:20:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: your food intake. Absolutely. Because then I'm having very big breakfast at and, again, For different people, it's different. I have a big breakfast at 7 AM maximum. So I have a big breakfast, coffee, and all this stuff.[1:20:25] Dr. Samer Hattar: Then I have some simple snack around 10, then I have regularly lunch at noon or between noon to 1, then I have another snack at 3, and the hardest to regulate the food is between 12 and 3. This is what I'm I really feel hungry all[1:20:39] Andrew Huberman: is your equivalent of kind of late evening for most people. So for me, it would probably be between 7 and 10 PM.[1:20:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: Exactly. Exactly. And then at night, I'm I'm completely not hungry, but usually, as you said, the beauty the the enjoyment of food. Like, When my wife kicks cooks some really beautiful Indian food, I eat, but I'm not hungry. And I notice if I eat with that, I usually gain weight.[1:21:01] Dr. Samer Hattar: But if I regulate that at night, I also lose weight. So there is a combination of all these things that help you adjust these these the the The input of food, the input of light, the input of the clock, and the drive to hunger. Yeah.[1:21:16] Andrew Huberman: I appreciate you sharing that, Bien, and I wanna emphasize that Some people are not hungry early in the day. They might be late shifted people, in which case, eating later in the day will will work well for them.[1:21:25] Dr. Samer Hattar: Work as long as they don't eat early in the morning. That's Just you have to work with your schedule, with your active schedule.[1:21:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You and I have been talking about this offline for years. I'm glad we're finally having this discussion publicly now. What we're talking about really is finding your ideal sleep schedule Exactly. And finding your ideal eating schedule[1:21:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: Exactly.[1:21:43] Andrew Huberman: And understanding how those 2 things interact.[1:21:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: And, you know, the nice thing as you said, finding them out is gonna help you to understand how they interact because we know from the tripartite model that they are all interconnected. And for each person, they're gonna be interconnected differently. So for each person, you would you know, for me, If I exercise at night, I'm gonna mess up my whole system.[1:22:07] Andrew Huberman: When do you exercise?[1:22:08] Dr. Samer Hattar: Morning. Morning works great for me. I mean, It's amazing. Morning exercise for me works great. If I tried one time because it was easier for me to exercise at night before I leave when the traffic is there from the.[1:22:21] Dr. Samer Hattar: I think that messed me up because I couldn't sleep well, and I couldn't wake up well, and that led to more changes in my food. I gained weight again, actually, Believe it or not, even though I was exercising. So I think this really makes me think that you have To think of the tripartite model to see where is the best times and what is the best interrelation between the different component as you beautifully said, between your mealtimes, your light exposure, and your sleep that works for you.[1:22:50] Andrew Huberman: Well, thank you for that. Usually, Samir is insulting me. Today, he's complimenting me. I'm gonna compliment him right back by saying, I this is the first time that I've ever really understood how, Yes. Light can control sleep.[1:23:04] Andrew Huberman: Yes. It can in control mood. Yes. It can impact feeding, but that it's really about doing the self to align those in the way that works best. And what I'm hearing tell me if I'm wrong, but what I'm hearing is that Once you understand what gives you the best sleep wake cycle, then you should exercise during the period of time in which you feel most alert.[1:23:27] Andrew Huberman: And if it works for your schedule, ideally, you would also eat during the time in which you feel most alert and then stop eating And stop light viewing behavior as you head towards sleep. Right.[1:23:39] Dr. Samer Hattar: So the only thing I would say that complicates all of this, and that's what makes me sad, is your light Mine personally? Sorry.[1:23:46] Andrew Huberman: I'm just kidding.[1:23:47] Dr. Samer Hattar: The the people's light exposure. Right? This is what complicates it because You're not gonna be able to figure all this out if you're shifting yourself out of your comfort zone. By viewing By viewing light at the wrong time of the day. So let's say let's say you're if you were under an idle natural conditions, you're a person who would sleep later than me.[1:24:09] Dr. Samer Hattar: Let's say will sleep at midnight and wake up at 8 AM. Let's say you don't eat anything till noon, and as you said, you eat late in the evening. Then this would be perfect for you. But now see what happens if you now you include the light component. Now if you push your sleep from midnight to 4 AM, Now you're waking up in the morning, and you're you're actually really not the morning.[1:24:31] Dr. Samer Hattar: You're working up, sorry, at noon instead of 8 o'clock. And the time where you're not supposed to be hungry, now you're gonna start eating directly at noon or something like that or even delay it. And now you're shifting your whole cycle, and you don't know if this interaction between your sleep, feeding, and the light dark environment are still gonna be maintained or not. And that's the problem that people have.[1:24:52] Andrew Huberman: So mo you know, as I'm hearing this, what I'm realizing is most of us, probably me included, are messing up at least 1, 2, or 3 of these components. But that the that the the probe, the way to to figure out what's right for oneself is to start manipulating light exposure.[1:25:10] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right. And I'm I'm gonna be honest. I'm biased because I believe that light is the stronger is the Strongest time giver. And we lot of people disagree. Some people think feeding is.[1:25:21] Andrew Huberman: I always thought that light was the primary zite giver. The primary Yeah. But lot[1:25:24] Dr. Samer Hattar: of people think it's Food. Lot of people even sometimes mention social interaction.[1:25:28] Andrew Huberman: They read the literature?[1:25:29] Dr. Samer Hattar: I I agree with you. I I totally agree with you.[1:25:32] Andrew Huberman: Mean, my understanding is that light is the most powerful driver of the things we're talking about.[1:25:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: Why I think we need to regulate this first and everything else fits. And, you know, the nice thing is that your sleep wake cycle and exercise tell you really bluntly if you're doing it right or not. Tell me more about that. I'll tell you more. When I Shifted my exercise.[1:25:51] Dr. Samer Hattar: Honestly, things fell apart like never before.[1:25:54] Andrew Huberman: When you moved from exercising early in[1:25:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: the day In the morning. Yeah. It Completely fell apart for me. I didn't enjoy exercise at night. My pain tolerance for exercise wasn't as good.[1:26:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: I'm talking with n equals 1, and I'm aware of this. I've never tested this Empirically, but at least to me, it really messed up everything. I started having problem because my body temperature will go up, And that will affect my sleep. I possibly was running in the gym with a lot of lights, so maybe the light was a component. But for me, exercising in the morning, It's so much better for me, but lot of people can't even think of exercising in the morning.[1:26:29] Dr. Samer Hattar: So it depends on when you feel comfortable in your sleep wake cycle and your exercise. I think that tells you if your system is in in synchrony with one another.[1:26:38] Andrew Huberman: That's really interesting. You know, I we're good friends. Our Our friend, Pat Dossett, right, that we both know, you know, did 9 years in the SEAL teams, and he's one of these people. Says, you know, he's happy to go for a run or swim Anytime between 4:30 AM and 6 AM, and he'll train in the afternoon too because, you know, he's a SEAL team guy, and they'll do whatever anytime. That's part of the phenotype, But he feels best doing that.[1:27:00] Andrew Huberman: Right? I'm a mid I like to exercise midmorning. Interesting. And I'm happy to skip eating until 12 or 1. Great.[1:27:08] Andrew Huberman: And I like to go to sleep around 11:30, 12 because I'm a normal human being rather than you who goes to bed at night.[1:27:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: What about that, actually? I've never asked him what time.[1:27:16] Andrew Huberman: So Pat's ideal to sleep time, I've asked him this, would be around 8:30 or 9, except now that. No. But he has yes. But he has, 2 young Children 2 years old and a newborn, and so the cycle is disrupted.[1:27:29] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? But that's known. Right? I mean, the the effect of Childbearing, and I think there we could talk about this. That's more complicated, but that's pretty pretty much yeah.[1:27:38] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah.[1:27:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, I think we need to come up with a new name for, chronotype because chronotype implies that it's just about sleep and wake I agree. Being an early bird or a night owl, and what we're also talking about is how exercise and eating match on to those.[1:27:53] Dr. Samer Hattar: And the phase relation between them.[1:27:56] Andrew Huberman: Right. And the phases between different components, as you said. Because they interact.[1:28:00] Dr. Samer Hattar: Because they interact. Right. And they don't have to be in the same phase. Like, let's say my light and food could be very close to each other's. Your light and food could be different.[1:28:08] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? The phases don't have to be they can't be plastic. So you have to find this for yourself. You may you may be a person who eats late at night, exercises late at night, Or you may be a person who exercise early, eat later. So it doesn't as long as the phase is is good, that's what you that's what you have to find out.[1:28:27] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And if I understand correctly, when you're talking about phase relationship, it means you want to lump exercise, feeding, and light for And sleep. And sleep in a way that, As a coherent and total system makes you feel really good.[1:28:41] Dr. Samer Hattar: Temporally in a great order. Uh-huh. Absolutely.[1:28:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's and I think that And and[1:28:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: I could tell you to me is literally getting exposed to sun, you know, clearly in the morning, clearly at When I go out, I keep my windows in the office completely open, eating mostly in the early time of the day and exercising, and literally at the end part of the day. I'm literally in a more thoughtful vegetative state. Like, I really can't like, after 5, I tell my students, if you wanna tell me anything complicated, you're wasting your time. My brain just doesn't function. So even though I only but I'm really starting to shut off, ramp down.[1:29:21] Dr. Samer Hattar: Really I mean, it's you know, I could send the email, talk about brainless stuff, but My power, my energy to to do powerful stuff really dropped tremendously. So all my students who know me very well, they Put the meetings with me early in the morning because they know this is when I'm so everything for me and for me is very tight. So it could be different. It's very clustered in the morning. It's all tied together, and literally the remaining part seems to be just the, you know, vegetative state.[1:29:50] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Yeah. You and my, Bulldog, Costello, who unfortunately passed away recently Oh, no. Had that in yeah. I did not.[1:29:57] Andrew Huberman: That's true. Were good friends. Yeah. Life. Sorry to break it to you with, here.[1:30:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He he had a good long life, and he he went easy. But he had a circadian clock that basically would just sleep around 24 hours a day. Minimal activity interspersed every 3rd day or so. You do have this morning vigor.[1:30:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yes.[1:30:16] Andrew Huberman: And that's I'm that I think other people are gonna have more of an afternoon vigor. Do you think that this can change across the lifespan? It's the the rumor is that teenagers Naturally want to sleep in later and stay up later. Do you think that's social rhythm, or do you think that that's actually biological?[1:30:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. That's a tough question. I mean, The it it it could be both. One thing that worries me is that it seems that if anything with age, this morning rig rigor gets Stronger. So[1:30:44] Andrew Huberman: You mean you want people become more of morning.[1:30:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: More of morning.[1:30:47] Andrew Huberman: Why is that worry you? I think that's good.[1:30:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: Because for me, I'm already a very shift Good morning. I don't wanna be one of these 7 PM to 1 AM sleepers at some point.[1:30:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. On the other hand, it's it's also kinda nice because it's Quiet and you can get work done.[1:30:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: But, honestly, from 4:30 till 7:30 when my wife wake up, it's it can be very lonely. Yes. You achieve a lot, But it's quiet outside. It's you know? So it it I don't wanna be at 1 AM.[1:31:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: Let's put it this way.[1:31:12] Andrew Huberman: I don't want could tell Samir is more social than I am.[1:31:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: That's right. That is true.[1:31:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah, we touch on that, actually. So so your wife is she follows a different schedule. Yeah. And and so The social rhythm is important. Let I think what what should we do, how should we conceptualize, and how should we adjust ourselves according to the social?[1:31:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: And I honestly love this this This hypothesis that people came up with and and Pat's kids reminded me of. Because kids are really gonna disrupt your sleep week cycle. It Seems like there is a chrono attraction that usually people who attract each others have actually different sleep wake schedule. And the idea being is that this allows them to take care of their kids throughout the day night cycle.[1:31:57] Andrew Huberman: And have a peaceful marriage.[1:31:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: And have a peaceful marriage in a way. Right? So, I mean, we didn't have kids me and Rejis, so maybe this is but it seems like evolutionary, it makes sense that if you wanna protect your Protect your kids. You don't want everybody to be morning rigor and then the kids don't have so[1:32:13] Andrew Huberman: you want to distribute it across. I That makes sense. It's a reasonable argument. I've heard that One of the reasons that people think that the clock is not exactly 24 hours, but it's 24 hours plus or minus, you know, 20 minutes or so is because we believe that we evolved in clans or groups, villages, whatever, that were about a 100 to 200 people. And in order to have protection around the early morning hours when we're vulnerable to predation and in the late night hours that you would want some individuals of of our species to be naturally more like night owls and some more like early people.[1:32:51] Andrew Huberman: So your, theory of parenting is, is similar in that way.[1:32:55] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right.[1:32:56] Andrew Huberman: The social rhythm is is a powerful rhythm though. Meaning, if I go out[1:33:11] Dr. Samer Hattar: Levels like it affects your sleep. It affects how much you wake up or eat. But I'm not so sure it's as powerful as people think on the clock. Now eventually, it will mess up the clock because now if you're doing a lot of social at night, getting enough light, eating at the wrong time of the day, eventually, You're gonna have an effect, but I don't think that's the social interactions themselves have been shown to affect your clock very strongly for[1:33:36] Andrew Huberman: some reason. That's good to know. Well, for people hearing this, they're probably getting the impression, like, I'm the night owl, and then Samer is the one that's in bed at 9 and then, you know, wakes up at 4, but having attended many meetings with Samura, I can tell you that he's the party animal. So let's talk about that. I mean, let's talk about the fact that you're the the partier who's up until 2 dancing at these at these various meetings, which I've seen.[1:34:02] Andrew Huberman: Yep. Actually, a good dancer, I'm told. But what should we do when we do stay up very late for whatever reason? Could be because we had to take a midnight trip to the hospital, unfortunate reason or it could be because you're in the presence of people that you don't see very often, and you, and you go out for a really nice Night out on the town and you and you get to sleep around 2:30 or 3 in the morning, how should one get back on schedule? Do you force yourself to then get up and view light at the normal Time that you would get up and view light, or do you allow yourself to sleep in?[1:34:35] Andrew Huberman: What what's the optimal point?[1:34:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: I would allow myself to sleep in, and remember, this is a long term effect. This is something that you live with for a long period. And and remember I told you about the experiments we did with the mood? These require 2 weeks So that light schedule to cause mood disturbances. So these don't happen just in a single day.[1:34:52] Andrew Huberman: So this is the way you justify staying out late every once in a while.[1:34:55] Dr. Samer Hattar: Well, In the in the meetings you've seen me, I've done this for 5 or 6 days continuously, but what you didn't see that when I came back to my home, it took me 2 weeks as if I did a jet lag. So I really do suffer for 2 weeks after doing a 6 crazy night of staying up at night, drinking at the wrong time of the day. So it's not that I'm completely okay with it. When I go back, everything goes back. It takes me actually literally 2 weeks to recover From the circadian rhythm meeting that you've seen me partying at at at some point.[1:35:25] Andrew Huberman: Which is kind of ironic, the circadian I know. Rhythm meeting, people are totally disrupting the circadian cycle, but, scientists are human beings too.[1:35:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right. So I I think if you do it at very little occasions, I think you should not Worry too much that this will have a lasting impact. And the good news is that if you readjust your schedule, you could come back to it. The problem is When you maintain these wrong schedule for prolong team, it becomes chronic, prolonged periods of time. That's when you have the problems and the accumulation of the problems.[1:35:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: So when you have sleeping problem, you produce metabolic problem. When you have metabolic problems, you produce lack of exercise, and You could see how things can spiral out very quickly, and then it would be hard to come back[1:36:10] Andrew Huberman: to it. Well, certainly, sleep disruption is both a symptom of and Yes. A cause of almost all Absolutely. Mental health disorders. Right?[1:36:19] Andrew Huberman: And, certainly, the metabolic syndromes that people are talking about nowadays and all of this, It all funnels back to light. This is what's so remarkable. It's and so we have these devices, and I'm I use my phone and I use my computer. But do you think that the mere dimming of the screen or not interacting with screens aft you know, with it, Say, 90 minutes or 2 hours before bedtime. According to what we're saying today, this should have a profound effect[1:36:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: And it does. All these And I really believe it does. And I, you know, I again, I I think as part has, did these these these Inventions where you get a pouch where you put your phone in a pouch. Mhmm.[1:37:02] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so what what Samir's referring to is our friend, Pat, this, Former SEAL team member that we that, who's also very impressive person in the landscape of business and family, etcetera, real superhuman from, by any regard, has this habit of taking his phone and putting it into a sealed pouch in the evening. So it's basically And in his way,[1:37:23] Dr. Samer Hattar: he sends you actually these these Seal, you know, batches. And and so that I think is is a great idea because not only it will take away the light from you, but it also take away the Traction because you wanna repair and recover, and sleep does that. And if you have your phone dinging all the time or Or the light flashing from it is you're just not getting enough sleep, and you're causing yourself major problems.[1:37:50] Andrew Huberman: I'd never asked you this, but I I realized now that I I should have, long ago, but I'll ask you now. Why and how did you get into all this stuff?[1:38:02] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I mean, honestly, I I first of all, I want to become know, I wanted to study genetics, and I knew I wanted to do PhD in genetics. But I only got accepted in 1 university at the time, and I joined the learning and memory lab. And I like learning and memory. At the beginning, I worked on the snails on Aplysia and started looking at learning and memory, but then The same lab was looking at this daily variation.[1:38:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: I was really struck. Like, you never think about it outside of science. It really struck me that Organisms can measure day biologically. That was very shocking to me. And I just really got attracted and I wanted to see Why does this happen?[1:38:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: What is the effect of different times of day? And I just stuck with it. It's just it was mind blowing for me who was in medical school that have never heard about it before. You know, it's really amazing medicine. I think still now, we are very good at looking at stuff spatially, But we're very bad at looking at temporal aspects.[1:39:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: So we always, you know, like to see images, static images, Spatial information.[1:39:09] Andrew Huberman: Take an X-ray, measure a temperature, measure a blood pressure.[1:39:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: Exactly. But we don't think of them poor. And and, you know, you talk to John Hogenash Right now and he's telling you the importance of chrono medicine or chronopharma pharma 2 or whatever the word is. And it just It really just getting the the drugs at the right time of the day is gonna be essential for our health.[1:39:31] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that's gonna come from using better trackers like, Aura rings, whoop straps, these kinds of things.[1:39:37] Dr. Samer Hattar: I I love the trackers, but I think there's even more exciting discoveries. Now you could take a single blood sample and measure many Biological components and figure where you are in the circadian clock. Something that was very hard to do before. So if you have a marker to know where you are in the Clock, you could actually understand more the effect of everything, exercise, feeding, light input. What is the marker?[1:40:00] Dr. Samer Hattar: So there are some papers from, what's her name? Phyllis Zee and from, Akim Kramer, where they measure multiple RNAs that are known to Tell you what phase of the clock is or multiple, proteins or biological reactions. And depending on A combination of factor, not a single factor. You could tell where you are in the circadian clock. So they could instead of just measuring temperature or melatonin, just one measurement.[1:40:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: And melatonin specifically is also complicated by the fact that melatonin is affected by light. And, you know, and temperature your temperature and sleep can be easily dissociatable. Right? When you travel across different times, when you sleep at different times in the temperature So having multiple components measured will give you a better determination of your circadian phase. And understanding your circadian phase in humans will tell you what is the effect of giving certain drugs at certain times of the circadian phase.[1:40:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: So in the future, This is gonna be studied at a much higher level when you can determine the phase in relation to all the other stuff.[1:41:06] Andrew Huberman: It's striking to me that in all animals besides humans, if they deviate too much From the appropriate exposure to light and light dark cycle, they essentially don't mate and or die and or get killed off. But in humans, We are able to override that at least to some extent, but the ways in which we suffer appear to be things like Obesity, metabolic syndromes, reproductive syndromes that are accompanied the other syndromes, you know, endocrine syndromes, and mood and depressive disorders. Is there any effort at the level of the the nationally or or laboratories that you're aware of to try and use Light in order to improve mood and mental health.[1:41:52] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, honestly, this is my. This is the thing that I think people Because it's some I I I say don't take a pill, take a photon. Not I mean, you take pills. It's important. I'm just making it That really we have an opportunity right now with the incredible advances of LED lights, of changing spectra of light, Of regulating intensities.[1:42:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: And just to just just for simple changes, you could really improve Sleep wake cycle, productivity, and still you could actually get more done. Because as we've talked about, when you have all these messed up, Now you have to sleep more, but your sleep is fragmented. It's not very good.[1:42:33] Andrew Huberman: And you can't focus when[1:42:35] Dr. Samer Hattar: you need to do that. Focus when you don't have alertness when you need the alertness. So having all these, you could allow you to do even more actually at the end than less, and that's the the exciting part of it.[1:42:47] Andrew Huberman: One of the questions I get asked most often about is about ADHD. You know? I think there's a lot of self prescribed as well as Clinically prescribed ADHD, people are having a tremendously difficult time focusing and not just because they're sleepy. They just can't seem to anchor their attention. And there could be multiple reasons for this, But there are now several clinical trials ongoing using light to try and anchor people's attention and mood and well-being for sake of focus.[1:43:12] Andrew Huberman: And I think that while I love this saying that, you mentioned, you know, take a photon, not a pill. And with due respect to the need For pharmacology, for sir certain people, I think most people just haven't really dialed in their relationship to light in a way that allows to rule out whether or not they need medication.[1:43:30] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely. That's the best way to put it. I can't add to that.[1:43:34] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about Jet lag Mhmm. But not in the context of, okay, if somebody's traveling from Europe to Japan or from the East Coast because that varies tremendously. Right? I mean, there's As many different variations on travel as there are Mhmm. Individuals out there and with goals and jobs, etcetera.[1:43:52] Andrew Huberman: But, rather, let's talk about What are the 2 or 3 things that people can do to adjust their schedule quickly? Yesterday, I called you and said, look. I know somebody who's traveling 6 hours. I won't even mention in which direction because I don't want people to anchor to that example. And you described some very simple tools of viewing light A little bit earlier than normal and getting on the local food schedule, etcetera, that would allow them to shift more quickly.[1:44:20] Dr. Samer Hattar: And[1:44:20] Andrew Huberman: the reason I wanna have this conversation is, yes, for the travelers and for the, the shift workers, but mostly because of the the fact that You've proven again and again that people are disrupted in their circadian behavior at home. So what are the aside from what we've already talked about, how can one adjust quickly to a new schedule? Like, let's say, fall classes are starting. You start a new job or you have a baby or a puppy or whatever. What is the best way to shift the clock quickly?[1:44:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: So It's very simple as we've talked yesterday. So imagine you're in in the outside with no environmental with no industrial light. If you if your body thinks you're in early evening and you see a bright light, what does this tell you? Oh, wait. This is not early evening yet.[1:45:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's still early afternoon or late afternoon. So I have to delay my clock to go back to late afternoon. So if you get light early in the evening, it delays your clock.[1:45:19] Andrew Huberman: So what does Meaning that makes you wanna go to sleep later?[1:45:22] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yes. It delays your clock. So so you're in New York. Right? People in Italy have an advanced clock because they they are 6 hours ahead of us.[1:45:33] Dr. Samer Hattar: So if you're in New York and you get light early in the evening, you delay even further from Italy. So now you're delaying away from Italy. Now the same thing happens. Let's say you thought dawn came up, and you thought it's already dawn, but it was, let's say, 3 o'clock the morning or 4 o'clock in the morning, and then you get a bright light and you say, oh, wait a minute. Dawn is not up yet, so I should advance my clock.[1:45:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: Or I'm I'm at night, but I'm getting bright light, so I should run because dawn is already up. So then later in the night, Later in your night and actually, it just happens that in humans, you get a temperature later in the night, temp low temperature in your body. After that, lights start advancing your clock. So if you wanna go to Italy, instead of getting light early in the evening, you wanna get light after the Temperature law. So you could advance your clock even before you go to Italy, and you're catching up to the Italians just by using light.[1:46:32] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's as simple as that.[1:46:34] Andrew Huberman: Great.[1:46:34] Dr. Samer Hattar: So you could do it for every region. You could calculate how much they are advanced of you. You could know how much these light shifts happen per day, And you can calculate what you what you need to do, very simple math, to adjust either in direction of delaying. If you're going from New York to California, you wanna delay your clock, or advancing if you're going from New York to Italy.[1:46:56] Andrew Huberman: So in order to make that a visual and because a lot of people are listening to this, not looking at it on video, we will we will put a[1:47:03] Dr. Samer Hattar: a[1:47:03] Andrew Huberman: down a zero cost downloadable, figure of this on the hubermanlab.com website related to this episode. But I think I can summarize it in, in language as well. If I understand correctly, what you're saying is If your typical wake up time is, say, 7 AM, then your low point in temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5 AM. Yeah. And if you view light right or back around then, it's going to essentially advance your clock.[1:47:31] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. Because then your Your body thinks, oh, it's 7 o'clock, so advance your clock by 1 to 2 hours.[1:47:37] Andrew Huberman: But if I were to view, like, say, at 3 AM, then it would probably delay my clock. Yeah. Okay. Yep. So and then let's say I land in a new schedule.[1:47:47] Andrew Huberman: I wanna adjust to a new schedule. Let's say I didn't manage to do anything with my light viewing before I went in. I didn't I didn't anticipate the trip. Suddenly, I'm on a new schedule. Okay?[1:47:56] Andrew Huberman: I was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock and to avoid gastrointestinal issues is to eat on the local schedule[1:48:04] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mhmm.[1:48:05] Andrew Huberman: To start basically behaving like a local[1:48:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: Mhmm.[1:48:08] Andrew Huberman: Even though your circadian clock will take a little bit of time to catch up.[1:48:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely. But you have to remember the light. Right? So let's let's know that we explained it very simply. Let's take a very simple example.[1:48:19] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? New York to Italy. That's a simple example. New York time, Italy time, 6 hour difference. Right?[1:48:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: So let's say you fly from New York at night. You reach Italy at 8 o'clock in the morning. What is the time in your New York time? You although you reach[1:48:35] Andrew Huberman: 6 hours back.[1:48:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: 6 hours back. In the It's 2 AM. So when you land Italy, you wanna avoid light like the plague. Yeah. You could eat, but you really don't wanna get a light.[1:48:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right.[1:48:44] Andrew Huberman: Because otherwise, it's gonna delay you.[1:48:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: Delay you. It's gonna send you to California of sending you to Italy.[1:48:49] Andrew Huberman: Right. And so this is such a key point. If anyone's confused about this, we will put some diagrams up, but what Sam is saying is so crucial. Just because getting bright light in your eyes early in the day is really beneficial when you're at home, when you travel to a new time zone, You have to take into account what your body thinks what excuse me. You have to take into account Where your body thinks you are.[1:49:13] Andrew Huberman: And so if you're looking at the Italian sunrise having just flown from New York to Italy, and you didn't prepare for that trip by Waking up a little bit earlier in anticipation. Multiple days. Yeah. If you light at 2 a excuse me. It's at 6 or 7 AM Italian time.[1:49:27] Andrew Huberman: Beautiful Italian sunrise. You are going to delay your clock. You're going to basically throw yourself back to California, but you are in Italy. Gonna throw your biology back to California, and you are gonna be up in the middle of the Italian night, and you're gonna be a miserable. I'll tell a brief, anecdote because I called Samer in desperation.[1:49:46] Andrew Huberman: A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi to give a seminar. 12 hours out of faith. It's a 12 hour flip, and I thought I could just muscle it. I thought I'll get up, just view sunlight when the sun comes up, and I fell apart mentally and physically. And Samer came to my rescue.[1:50:04] Andrew Huberman: I called him. I said, I don't know what to do, and he said, go to the gym Wet at the local dawn, work out, eat, and then View sunlight starting the next day, and that basically got me on the schedule. So I used food and exercise to adjust myself because my light viewing activity was just completely out of whack.[1:50:25] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I mean and and we talked about other details, so you have to calculate it, but you're absolutely right. I mean, it's it's very important to avoid Getting the wrong light information when you're trying to adjust your body because, otherwise, it shifts you to the other to the other cycle. Absolutely right. Well, You[1:50:44] Andrew Huberman: are one of these people that has such vigor. It's one of these things where, having known you all these years, you have a tremendous capacity For work and for soccer and for arguing, respectful arguing, and, you know, sometimes, you know It's[1:50:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: getting worse with the age.[1:50:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, we could talk about that offline, but I think a lot of your vigor and a lot of your ability to work hard and focus and really do so many things at an impressive level is because you think about these issues, and you you think about when you're going to be optimal for focus, when you're going to be optimal for exercise, when and the when is the key. It's and I think a lot of people live in the landscape of feeling like there's something broken inside them because they can't focus or they get to it. Conscious.[1:51:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right. Remember, it's all subconscious. These effects and Anna, you're absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside about age, I really agree with you that I think part of the reason I'm to be able to do this that I really think about it and I make sure that I keep everything aligned. And and that Actually helps me a lot.[1:51:47] Dr. Samer Hattar: Like, I don't suffer in sleep. I don't suffer in waking up. I never use a timer to wake up. I mean, people say, aren't you scared? Like, You have to give a lecture at 8 or 7:30.[1:51:57] Dr. Samer Hattar: Honestly, I[1:51:58] Andrew Huberman: was like, there is no way[1:51:59] Dr. Samer Hattar: I'm gonna go beyond that. It just even if I try, I can't sleep beyond 6 AM In my regular times, it's just it's not gonna happen. By 4:30, my eyes are wide awake and I'm in bed. It's just System is so aligned. It works.[1:52:15] Andrew Huberman: A lot of times people will say, how come I go to sleep, I fall asleep Fine. But then I wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning and can't fall back asleep. Is it possible that those people were supposed to go to bed at 8 PM?[1:52:26] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's possible. I mean, it is possible. It is also possible that sometimes people will wake up and go back to sleep. But But yeah. I mean, it is possible, or it's possible that their clock is completely misaligned that they are getting maybe enough Time at night when they are supposed and then they possibly feel so sleepy in the day.[1:52:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: So they're all these are possible combination.[1:52:46] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's an interesting idea I hadn't considered. So I[1:52:48] Dr. Samer Hattar: mean[1:52:49] Andrew Huberman: that what they think is their sleep, their body is so out of whack with the light dark cycle that it's actually a nana.[1:52:55] Dr. Samer Hattar: Or or the weaker part of the sleep. I mean, you see this in In when you travel to different time zone before you adjust, you go to sleep really well, but 2 hours later, you're fully up. 2 hours. If you were so tired and this is your regular sleep, there's no way you're gonna wake up in 2 hours. So Then you feel very sleepy later in the day or something like that.[1:53:17] Dr. Samer Hattar: So it depends of how your whole system is aligned to the environment.[1:53:21] Andrew Huberman: That's very interesting idea. I, I think that's gonna resonate with a lot of people. I wake up every morning around, 3 or 4, I generally use the bathroom, and then I fall back asleep very, very deeply. Doesn't seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness. And I think a lot of people obsess over the that waking up and worry there's something wrong.[1:53:41] Andrew Huberman: Provided they can go back to sleep to sleep, it's okay.[1:53:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: If you can't go use the bathroom, go back to sleep, That should not be a problem. Maybe some people when they go to use the bathroom, they use very bright light and then they get an alerting signal. So if if you maybe that's it could be as simple as that that affects you. Maybe when you wake up, you put tons of light or you start reading your iPad. So there's all these combination that we still don't know about that could be affecting their sleep wake rhythms and their sleep maintenance.[1:54:10] Andrew Huberman: Do you use melatonin? Do you take melatonin?[1:54:13] Dr. Samer Hattar: I don't need it, to be honest. In my case, there is no reason to use it because I could guarantee you That by maybe 8 o'clock, my melatonin has already started to go up. And by the time I sleep, my melatonin is very high because I don't use a lot of lights After sunset And light inhibits melatonin. And life's really blocks melatonin level.[1:54:33] Andrew Huberman: But you hear this myth that the pineal gland It calcifies as we get older. Is that do you know anything about that?[1:54:39] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, I've heard about that, but I don't know how what does I mean, there is not Very clear evidence that affects the sleep. I don't know much about it, to be honest. Yeah.[1:54:47] Andrew Huberman: The evidence that I've seen is that, yes, there's some calcification around the pineal just because of where it sits in the In the brain, it's close to some bony bony structures, but I don't think there's any evidence that it has negative effects.[1:55:01] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, if if you still have, you could measure melatonin, and that should tell you if it has any it's such an easy thing to do.[1:55:08] Andrew Huberman: I think this is more of a of a Internet wellness thing that, that got outside the, the cage.[1:55:14] Dr. Samer Hattar: You're absolutely right.[1:55:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It sounds terrible. Calcification[1:55:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: of the[1:55:18] Andrew Huberman: mirror, not the thing. Right? The hard thing. Right? Yeah.[1:55:21] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Let's talk about seasonality a little bit. I learned, and I don't know if this is still true, but that most suicides occur In April, in the spring. I think there's a poem that says April is the cruelest month. I think it be is the poem begins.[1:55:44] Andrew Huberman: Are there data that suicides are more frequent at particular times of year? And if so, is the spring that time of year?[1:55:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I mean, lot of people talk about Yes. And and one of the hypothesis that is that the winter month that are very bad for mood make People not wanting to do anything, and they they get into such deep level of depression that when the sun comes up, they get actually the energy to act on their depression, It sounds really terrible, and it is terrible.[1:56:12] Andrew Huberman: It's terrible.[1:56:13] Dr. Samer Hattar: So that's so that's the idea that the lack of light throughout the winter caused them to go into such depression that they don't Feel like doing anything. Then when the light comes in with rigor in the spring, it gives them that after all the depression they suffered, it gives them that push to To take that sad final, you know,[1:56:33] Andrew Huberman: act, I guess. What other seasonal effects have been demonstrated in humans?[1:56:37] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I mean, I think in humans, it's not very clear because we don't think about seasonality. But if you start thinking about Us, I think we go through major seasonal changes. I really do. I think our eating pattern change across the year.[1:56:51] Dr. Samer Hattar: I could tell you that Me thinking about this, there's a clear changes that happens to me across the year. But for animals, this is really essential because For animals, they have to time their mating behavior was when they deliver their their progeny in the most abundant amount of food. An artificial light is causing major disruption because if you change the way these animals are receiving the light information, They either start mating much earlier or much later, and their numbers dwindle, and they get into the dangers of really completely getting eliminated or extinct.[1:57:28] Andrew Huberman: Well, human birth rates are definitely going down. I mean, in in the US in the US, in particular. Areas. Not others. Not others.[1:57:36] Andrew Huberman: Right. But are there other effects of seasonality on humans that we are aware of?[1:57:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: I honestly like, you could see it, Honestly, you could see it perfectly, I think, in in Scandinavia. I mean, you could talk to people in in who live in[1:57:51] Andrew Huberman: Sure. They get seasonal depression.[1:57:53] Dr. Samer Hattar: What season depression is 1, but actually when you start asking them questions, they tell you, like, in the winter, they barely could wake up. They barely have the energy. Before even depression, even people who don't get seasonal depression, they'll tell you our energy level is lower. Our ability to go to work is It's not the same. And in the summer, most people actually sleep very little.[1:58:14] Dr. Samer Hattar: They tell you we we really can We we feel like we're manic. We have all this energy. And not in a negative way, in a funny way. Right? I mean but if you wanna sleep, we have to put this curtain.[1:58:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: I think in these situations, you could really appreciate the seasonality of humans. I think we kind of destroyed our seasonality because we don't get exposed to that much natural light. We have all this artificial light. But I think, honestly, One of the thing that is gonna happen if they follow your recommendations about giving light at the same time, giving Food, giving answers Let's[1:58:51] Andrew Huberman: be clear. Those are your recommendations.[1:58:52] Dr. Samer Hattar: Well, I[1:58:52] Andrew Huberman: mean No. I'm just I'm I'm just fair attribution.[1:58:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: What I'm saying is that this is gonna cause them to also Experience some changes across the season because now they're gonna see the sun differently. If you're gonna go out in the morning, In the summer, you're gonna get the much bright that's why I don't like the change in time. I know people think, oh, because you're biased, you because I think wait.[1:59:15] Andrew Huberman: Wait. Wait. Wait. Sorry. The change are you talking about daylight savings?[1:59:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: Daylight saving. It's such a bad idea because it disrupts that rhythm that you're having. Because I think your buddy if you keep that rhythm, you will see the whole seasonality. And I look at it from a different aspect than other people. It really and people say I'm biased because I'm[1:59:34] Andrew Huberman: a morning person. And it may be true, but there's situation conspiracy about mourning people.[1:59:41] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. But there is if you think about it, Andrew, there is a situation where you're getting light well. And then all of a sudden, they delayed by 1 hour because and then even though it's the summer, your body now, if you're still not adjusting, think, Oh, wait. What happened? What kind of happened?[1:59:58] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up because I always thought, you know, what's the big deal? 1 hour. Right. 1 hour shift. You know, spring forward fall back.[2:00:06] Andrew Huberman: Just 1 hour after. But the but this goes back to the beginning of our discussion. It's not just 1 hour. Right. Because it's 1 hour across that one day, but there's this cumulative effect on the clock and these, three elements of your Yeah.[2:00:21] Andrew Huberman: Tripartite model. Right? The homeostatic sleep and the, like, direct effects on mood.[2:00:25] Dr. Samer Hattar: And when it's so close, it's sometimes hard to Figure out how to adjust it perfectly because, you know, we're already sleep deprived in our society. And then you shift it by You know, so it it just it all accumulates, and it has no benefit.[2:00:40] Andrew Huberman: Well, you work at a major government organization, National Institute of Mental Health. Why don't we Yeah. A campaign for[2:00:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: I have no idea. I mean, it makes no sense.[2:00:48] Andrew Huberman: Saying why don't we go campaign?[2:00:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I would love to. I mean, it makes no sense to have the summer Light goes up at 9 PM. The light goes down in, where I live in Baltimore at 9 PM. And then all of a sudden, When you really want to see the light longer in the day, you now shift the other way, and now it goes all of a sudden at 6 PM.[2:01:08] Dr. Samer Hattar: Why do you do these drastic changes? Well, let it Blend across the whole season. You know? Yes. Later, earlier at night, but it's at least consistent.[2:01:17] Dr. Samer Hattar: It goes in a very consistent manner. I just don't understand why they do this. It makes no sense.[2:01:23] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think that the reason they do it is because they don't understand the biology. Because 1 hour seems trivial, unless you understand that the repercussions of that 1 hour shift. Because What's also clear now based on what you're saying is that that 1 hour shift is taking you out of alignment with the natural light dark cycle in exactly the wrong direction.[2:01:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: Shanna. It's pushing people to get even later. Yeah. In the summer when light is gonna push you later anyway. It doesn't make sense.[2:01:52] Dr. Samer Hattar: You put it beautifully.[2:01:53] Andrew Huberman: I just Rambled, and this is No. No. No. You made it you made it clear.[2:01:56] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, it's like, literally, it made you it made people who are having problem, Having an advanced sleep rhythm because they are delayed, now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed. You push them even later in the day night cycle. It just doesn't make sense at all.[2:02:14] Andrew Huberman: I think 2022 should be the year that we abolish[2:02:17] Dr. Samer Hattar: Wow, man.[2:02:18] Andrew Huberman: Daylight savings.[2:02:19] Dr. Samer Hattar: The day for me, honestly.[2:02:20] Andrew Huberman: Well, it send well, also, if it has a positive effect on the what is essentially an epidemic of mental health issues and other issues related to improper interactions with light. That, I think, is is a well worthwhile cause, And, and we can explore. So for once, we're gonna fight with some with another group. I would love to battle as opposed to with one another.[2:02:44] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, the people, honestly, as you give them credit, have been trying for years to abolish daylight saving.[2:02:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The problem is they all go to sleep at 9 PM and wake up at 4 AM, so we never see them. Figuring out what we need.[2:03:02] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right.[2:03:02] Andrew Huberman: And then the challenge, of course, is making sure that people get what they need.[2:03:07] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right.[2:03:07] Andrew Huberman: And making sure that at a societal level, we're not And Vaulting ourselves into the[2:03:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: wrong direction. Problem is that the late waking people, they think that really and I'm gonna try to put it in a better way now. They think, oh, because you're a morning person, you wanna see the sun early, so you want me to suffer it dropping late. But that's not the case because what happens is when they shift it back after the daylight saving. Now they're gonna make you suffer really badly because now It's gonna be earlier.[2:03:39] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right.[2:03:39] Andrew Huberman: In the fall. In the[2:03:40] Dr. Samer Hattar: fall when there is not enough light. If they keep it the same way. So try to convince them that actually this at the end Cause it more trouble when you need the light for your late schedule in the fall when they shift it back. Then they say keep it daylight saving all the time, and that has been proven that it's very bad. Like, people have done studies that literally two Areas close to each others and areas that were the whole year on daylight saving has much more problems.[2:04:10] Dr. Samer Hattar: Even in cancer rates and depression, so You don't wanna do that. So that's what trying to convince people that you need to prevent that switch, and you don't need daylight saving at all. That's where the problem happens.[2:04:25] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. I had not thought about that, but, yes, you late risers that in the fall when they when this The fallback, as they say, spring forward, fall back, you dial back the clock. It's really compounding the problem that already exists.[2:04:39] Dr. Samer Hattar: And it's really nice if you think if you keep it consistent. In the spring, you get the you know, when you you get the equinox, and then the days start going up. And then even in the summer start going down, then the fall, you get the other equinox and go back. So it's very symmetrical. Right?[2:04:54] Dr. Samer Hattar: It goes Into short day, longer, long, long, long, long, then short day again. But now you're getting these bumps in both sides of the Spring and fall. Why would you do that? Something that is beautifully symmetrical, beautifully smooth. You're putting bumps into it.[2:05:10] Dr. Samer Hattar: Well and we And not just beautiful because[2:05:12] Andrew Huberman: it's there, but it but it evolved. I mean, essentially, this is the system we evolved in for seasonality for months of years.[2:05:18] Dr. Samer Hattar: Even Apart from the exact equator, every part of the earth has seasonality.[2:05:25] Andrew Huberman: I wanna briefly touch on something which is Individual and genetic variation in sensitivity to light. Yeah. So not chronotype, but, First of all, a very basic question. Do people with light eyes, light colored eyes, are they more sensitive to light than people with Darker pigmented eyes.[2:05:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: I mean, honestly, it it makes sense there will be more because if you think of my dark pupil, it's blocking more light. So if you have light pupil, yes, for vision, it may not be very obvious, but for something that is measuring the amount of light, you're getting more light than me. So you probably need less light to be effective as as somebody who's darker. And and that maybe could plain why sometimes lighter people say, I don't wanna go into very bright conditions because it's really bright.[2:06:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I can't, I can't even be at a cafe without one of these reflective table's like a metal table, unless I have very dark sunglasses on it. Exactly. So bright, it's painful[2:06:24] Dr. Samer Hattar: for me.[2:06:24] Andrew Huberman: Whereas some people like you, we've sat outside, had meals, and you're like, fine. Assumed it was kind of Jordanian toughness, you know, versus, you know[2:06:31] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's really the pupil blocks more light. So I think it is possible that it's as simple as the pupil blocking more light can have sensitivity. But your question is also goes deeper. Are there more sensitivity differences? And and my understanding would be I would Think that it may be.[2:06:47] Dr. Samer Hattar: It depends on how effective your cells are in responding to light, how how healthy your iPRGCs are. So I would but there's not many studies to show that. What is really clear that is happening is that patients with bipolar, They seem to have different sensitivities to light. So it seems that at least people who have, psychological, changes, they may have differences to the sensitivity of light. So[2:07:16] Andrew Huberman: it were are those differences in a particular direction?[2:07:19] Dr. Samer Hattar: I don't remember the exact We'll have[2:07:21] Andrew Huberman: to we can look it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[2:07:24] Andrew Huberman: I you know, I and people have heard me say this ad nauseam to the point where they actually roll their eyes, but, you know, the these are the only 2 pieces of Brain, you know, I'm pointing to my eyes, folks, that are outside the cranial vault. They are 2 pieces of brain that it basically inform the brain about Whether or not to be alert or asleep. Absolutely. But you can imagine that those 2 little pieces of brain that we call eyes would have genetic variations. Of course.[2:07:46] Andrew Huberman: Eye color is genetically Modula is that determined, that there would be genetic variations based on whether or not your ancestry evolved near the equator or further from the equator. Right. I mean, you see more blue eyes in Scandinavia than[2:08:01] Dr. Samer Hattar: you do in the It's the lack of light that said you need more less Inhibition because there's not enough light. Right? So that's the idea of the changing color. Mhmm.[2:08:11] Andrew Huberman: So[2:08:12] Dr. Samer Hattar: Yeah. I totally agree with you. I mean, I think this is an area that will be studied later and will be empirically determined. The problem we have in this field right now, which I think is the biggest problem, is we don't have a way to measure The IPRGC sensitivities in humans. So we still like, it's easy to measure your rod cone function if you go to an optometrist, They measure all the details.[2:08:36] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right? Contrast detection.[2:08:37] Andrew Huberman: Look at the chart. You look at the list. That one chart. You look at the letters of the DMV. Yeah.[2:08:42] Dr. Samer Hattar: But for the None subconscious, we still don't have a good measuring systems to figure out what is Andrew's sensitivity, what is What is this person's sensitivity? And I think we're starting to work on something like that to hopefully develop these techniques. But till we develop them, it's gonna be very hard To figure out if there is a sensitivity difference, how do they relate and on men and women, you know, dark and and light and all the, You know, normal versus psychologically on effect and stuff like that.[2:09:14] Andrew Huberman: Fascinating. And every time You talk, I learned so much. It's like a in the best way, the best sense of the of the term, it's it's like a it's a waterfall of knowledge. As a final question, I have a question about sensitivity of a whole other kind. Mhmm.[2:09:32] Andrew Huberman: And that's the sensitivity to spicy food. Now the reason I'm asking this question, what seemingly out of the blue, is that I made the mistake once of having Samara cook for me, and I said not too spicy, and he said, okay. Not too spicy. He actually said, okay. Not too spicy, and It almost killed me.[2:09:55] Andrew Huberman: Like, it was, like, 2 or 3 days. So you know a lot about biology outside the visual system light, etcetera. You've been around a while. Are there known genetic or inherited of any kind sensitivities to Spicy food to things like red peppers and capsaicin, because what you call mild, my friend, almost put me into the hospital.[2:10:20] Dr. Samer Hattar: I think this is similar to you swimming in the ocean, and I need to get develop the[2:10:24] Andrew Huberman: pain. True. True. I like cold water swims, and Sandra's not a fan.[2:10:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: But I[2:10:27] Andrew Huberman: think that's gonna change. Is optimal. That's gonna change.[2:10:31] Dr. Samer Hattar: Optimal. That's my belief. Before I met, I was like you. And and once I started eating a lot of spicy food, I lost Touch of how spicy my food is, so I nearly killed you, Andron. I apologize for that.[2:10:43] Dr. Samer Hattar: I forgive you.[2:10:43] Andrew Huberman: So, basically, what you're saying is that marriage toughened you out.[2:10:46] Dr. Samer Hattar: Stuff with me. Exactly. Yeah.[2:10:48] Andrew Huberman: Maybe that's maybe that's the solution.[2:10:50] Dr. Samer Hattar: You need. Yeah.[2:10:51] Andrew Huberman: Samer, this has been An amazing march through the importance of light, not just for regulating sleep and wakefulness, but also for Food timing, the interactions with mood, the interactions with exercise, I'm certain that people are going to start thinking about how to change their relationship with light as a way to anchor everything that they do and that's important to their health. And I just on behalf of all of them and and just Directly from me as your friend and as a colleague for many years now, I just wanna say thank you for the incredible work you're doing and for sharing it with us.[2:11:27] Dr. Samer Hattar: Thank you so much. And I actually now thinking about all of this, and you said I should write a book. I should write a book and call it the tripartite model. I think that would put all these components together would be very interesting to do at some point.[2:11:41] Andrew Huberman: You should write a book. You should write they'll probably try and change the title to, like, food, mood, and you, you know, or something because but you can put in little print on the tri part model or whatever. But regardless of what it's called, I you absolutely should write a book. And, and so if you'd like Sam, or to write a book or if you'd like to learn more about him, let's talk a little bit about where people can find you. Your laboratory is at the National Institutes of Mental Health.[2:12:06] Andrew Huberman: He is head of the chronobiology unit, all these things that I've mentioned earlier, but, you are active on Twitter and Instagram.[2:12:13] Dr. Samer Hattar: Right.[2:12:13] Andrew Huberman: So what is your, Twitter handle?[2:12:15] Dr. Samer Hattar: It's at Samir Khattar. Mhmm.[2:12:18] Andrew Huberman: And we and we will provide a link for that in the in the show notes.[2:12:20] Dr. Samer Hattar: Sorry. The yes. At the Twitter at Samir Haptar, and I think the same for Instagram. Yeah. Actually.[2:12:26] Andrew Huberman: And Samir, has been coaxed on to Instagram, so he does post from time to time, mostly Pictures of food that is, incredibly spicy, but also information about chronobiology. He comes on for an Instagram live every once in a while with me, and, so definitely give him a follow there and on and on Twitter, and, and I'm sure that he'll be happy to answer questions, and Entertain any and all discussions about chronobiology.[2:12:53] Dr. Samer Hattar: Absolutely. Yep. And light. Yeah.[2:12:57] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you, Samir.[2:12:58] Dr. Samer Hattar: Awesome. Thank you, Andrew.[2:12:59] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor Samir Khattar. I hope you found it as interesting and informative as I did.
