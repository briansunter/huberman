I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Gina Poe. Doctor Gina Poe is a professor in the department of integrated biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles. Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning, in particular, how specific patterns of brain activity that are present during specific phases of sleep Impact our ability to learn and remember specific types of information.[0:00:38] Andrew Huberman: For instance, procedural information, that is how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks, as well as encoding of emotional memories and discarding emotional memories. Indeed, her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep Can act as its own form of trauma therapy, discarding the emotional tones of memories. In addition, her laboratory focuses on how specific phases of sleep Impact things like the release of growth hormone. Growth hormone, of course, plays critical roles in metabolism and tissue repair, including brain tissue repair, and therefore has critical roles in vitality and longevity. Today, you will learn many things about the relationship between sleep, learning, emotionality, and growth hormone.[0:01:19] Andrew Huberman: One basic but very important takeaway that you'll learn about today, which was news to me, is that it's not just the duration and depth of your sleep that matter, But actually, getting to sleep at relatively the same time each night ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release in the 1st hours of sleep. In fact, If you require, let's say, 8 hours of sleep per night, but you go to sleep 2 hours later than your typical bedtime on any given night, you actually miss The window for growth hormone release. That's right. Getting growth hormone release in sleep, which is absolutely critical to our immediate and long Term health is not a prerequisite of getting sleep even if we are getting enough sleep. As doctor Poe explains, there are critical brain circuits and endocrine, that is hormone circuits, that regulate Not just the duration and depth and quality and timing of sleep, but when we place our bout of sleep, that is when we go to sleep each night, Plus or minus about a half hour or so strongly dictates whether or not we will experience all the health promoting, including mind promoting benefits of sleep.[0:02:19] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode covers that and a lot more in substantial detail. You will learn, for instance, how to use sleep in order to optimize learning as well as forgetting for those things that you would like to forget. During today's episode, doctor Gina Poe shares critical information about not just neuroscience, but physiology and the hormone systems of the brain and body that strongly inform mental health, physical health, and performance. So by the end of today's episode, you'll be far more informed about sleep and how it works, the different roles it performs, you'll have several new actionable steps that you can take in order to improve your mental health, physical health, and performance. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:02:58] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, And no sugar.[0:03:20] Andrew Huberman: Now the electrolytes are critical to the function of every cell in your body, in particular, the neurons, the nerve cells. So I've talked about before on this podcast, neurons, nerve cells, Require adequate sodium and potassium as well as magnesium in order to fire action potentials, which are the electrical signals that allow neurons to do everything from Generate focus and attention, allow you to learn, and generate neuromuscular connection, and allow you to exercise or train or do any kind of skilled activity with a high degree of Put. I take LMNT about 2 or 3 times per day, typically once in the morning and again after or during my bout of exercise each day. And sometimes an additional one, if I sat in a hot sauna and sweat a lot or if the weather is very hot. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element, that's l m n t.com/huberman To claim a free element sample pack with your purchase.[0:04:08] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drink element, l m n t.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are the absolute highest quality. Sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. When we are sleeping well, all of those things excel.[0:04:27] Andrew Huberman: And when we are not sleeping well, all of those things Suffer. Now the surface that you sleep on, that is the mattress that you sleep on is critical, and Helix understands that everybody has slightly different sleep needs. So if you were to go to the Helix site, which I invite you to do, and take their brief 2 minute quiz, it will match your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect to those questions. I went and took the sleep quiz at Helix, and it matched me to the so called Dusk mattress, d u s k. I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress over a year ago, And it's the best sleep that I've ever had.[0:05:04] Andrew Huberman: It's completely transformed the depth and duration and quality of my sleep in ways that make me feel Far better during the daytime. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to helix sleep.com/huberman, take their 2 minute sleep quiz, And they'll match it to a customized mattress, and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and 2 free pillows. Again, if interested, go to helixsleep. Com/huberman for up to $350 off and 2 free pillows. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.[0:05:32] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and Sleep tracking capacity. Now, again, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance, but what many people don't realize is that in order to fall and stay asleep, Your core body temperature has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. Conversely, in order to wake up each morning and feel refreshed, your body temperature actually has to increase by 1 to 3 degrees. Therefore, controlling the temperature of your sleeping environment is absolutely key. With 8 Sleep, that's very easy to do.[0:06:01] Andrew Huberman: Depending on whether or not you typically run Too cold or too hot during the night, you can program your 8 Sleep mattress cover so that it's the optimal temperature, not just for you, but for each phase, the early, middle, and late phase of your sleep and for waking up in the morning. In fact, you can even control the temperature of your 8 Sleep mattress cover differentially across the mattress If you're sleeping alongside somebody else. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman and check out their PodPro cover and save $150 at checkout. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, and select countries in the EU and Australia.

To find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, livemomentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with doctor Gina Poe.[0:06:59] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Gina Poe, welcome.[0:07:00] Dr. Gina Poe: Thank you.[0:07:01] Andrew Huberman: I've really been looking forward to this conversation Because I'm familiar with your work, and I know that many people are going to be excited to learn about your work as it relates to sleep, as it relates to problem solving, creativity, addiction and craving, relapse, and a number of other important topics. So To start things off, I would love for you to educate us a bit about this thing that we are all familiar with and yet very few of us understand, which is Sleep. And if you would, could you describe the various phases of sleep that exist? What distinguish them? And perhaps Frame this within the context of what would a perfect night sleep look like?[0:07:41] Dr. Gina Poe: Okay.[0:07:42] Andrew Huberman: How long would it last, more or less?[0:07:44] Dr. Gina Poe: Mhmm.[0:07:44] Andrew Huberman: And what would the biology look like? What what is a perfect night sleep?[0:07:49] Dr. Gina Poe: Oh, yeah. That's a great question. Alright. So sleep is really different from wakefulness and, in fact, can't be replaced By any state of wakefulness that we've been able to come up with so far, our brain chemistry is completely different. And in the different stages of sleep, which there are is non REM and REM are the 2 major states of sleep, and every animal we've studied so far seems to have both of those states.[0:08:13] Dr. Gina Poe: Anyway, those 2 states are entirely different from one another too. And even within non REM, there are 3 states. Stage 1, which is what you slip into when you 1st, falling asleep, it's dozing. There's kind of an interesting rhythm that goes on in the brain. It's kind of a fast gamma rhythm.[0:08:29] Dr. Gina Poe: And then there's stage 2, which is a really cool state. We sort of used to ignore sleep researchers because it was a transient state between wakefulness and the deep stage 3, slow wave sleep, which is the most impressively different, and then and between that and REM sleep. So stage 2, I'll talk a little bit more about, and then the deep Slow wave sleep state, which is when big slow waves sweep through our brain, and now we've realized that it cleans our brain. One of the things that those big slow waves do is cleans our brain and Those are the really important things to restore us, from a day of wakefulness. And then REM sleep, which is most popular because that's where we have the most active dreams.[0:09:10] Dr. Gina Poe: And, when you wake up someone out of REM sleep, they'll almost always report Having dreamed something really bizarre, that's called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. So those are the 4 states of sleep of human sleep, and We cycle through them every 90 minutes or so. When we go to sleep, say, 10, 10:30, 11 o'clock, our first REM sleep period comes about a 105 minutes after we fall asleep and, lasts about 20 minutes. Actually, it comes about 95 minutes in the last 10 or 15 minutes. And then, we start over again.[0:09:47] Dr. Gina Poe: And we have about 5 of those per night for a perfect night sleep, 4 or 5, something like that. So a perfect night sleep is 7a half, 8 hours. There was a really great study that, put people in a semi darkened room with nothing but the bed for 12 hours every day for a month. And what people did initially is because Because we're in a sleep deprived nation is that they slept a lot more than usual, like 10 or 11 hours of the 12, and then They leveled off after a week or two to about 8 hours and 15 minutes of sleep, so you actually can't oversleep. I mean, they had nothing else to do but sleep, And they would round off to, on average, 8 hours and 15 minutes a night, and then they spend the rest of the time twiddling their thumbs, humming tunes, and just daydreaming.[0:10:32] Andrew Huberman: I wanna get back to the contour of a perfect night's sleep, but I'm intrigued by this idea that people can't oversleep. I'm often asked whether or not we can get too much Sleep and whether or not sleeping too log long, excuse me, can make us groggy the next day. Is there anything to that? Mhmm. And how does one determine How long they should sleep[0:10:51] Dr. Gina Poe: Right.[0:10:51] Andrew Huberman: On average?[0:10:52] Dr. Gina Poe: On average. Yeah. Well, that's interesting because different people need seem to need Different amounts of sleep, but we don't really even know exactly what sleep is for. So what they need is, you know, kind of It's, you know, murky. So we do know a lot of things that sleep It does now for us, but we don't know how long those things take.[0:11:17] Dr. Gina Poe: So how long we need to sleep is also just a big Question mark. But some people don't feel rested until they've slept 9 hours, and some people don't feel rested after 3 or 4a half. But most people, if they consistently deprive themselves of sleep so that they're only sleeping 4, 4 and a half hours a night, build up cognitive deficit that just builds up over time. The more nights you have with sleep deprivation, the more cognitive deficit you have. And So you need sleep again to sleep more to recover.[0:11:51] Dr. Gina Poe: Now the question you had about[0:11:54] Andrew Huberman: Can you over sleep?[0:11:55] Dr. Gina Poe: Oversleep. Right.[0:11:56] Andrew Huberman: Sleep to the point where It's too much. You know, that we I growing up, when I was in high school, my girlfriend's dad had this belief that no one should sleep in past 6 AM. So he would wake all the there were 2 children in that home. He would wake up the kids in that house. He had this thing against oversleeping regardless of when people went Went to sleep.[0:12:16] Andrew Huberman: And I always thought that was, an interesting mentality. Yeah. It's not terrible,[0:12:20] Dr. Gina Poe: actually, because what that will do is it'll put you make you sleepier the next night to get to bed on time. So it'll build up your homeostatic need if you wake up too early. But, So I don't think you can oversleep, but people who sleep a lot, like people who sleep over 9 hours, it's probably indicative of some other problem. Because, In fact, if you have, a lot of different conditions, it will cause you to sleep a lot more probably because what it does is it interferes with your efficient sleep, The efficiency of your sleep. So if you find yourself sleeping consistently 9 hours plus every night, Then you might wanna consult a doctor about maybe what else it might be.[0:13:00] Dr. Gina Poe: It could be cancer. It could be, sleep apnea, that just affects a lot of people. It could be that your sleep is super inefficient because you're snoring a lot more than you know or you're waking up a lot more than you know every night. So you might wanna sleep steady just to see how your sleep is and then see what else might be causing you to sleep so much.[0:13:22] Andrew Huberman: And that wouldn't be if somebody is sleeping 9 or 10 hours, you know, every once in a while. You mean if they're consistently sleeping for More than 9 hours.[0:13:30] Dr. Gina Poe: Feel like they need it in order to function cognitively the next day. It it might be that your sleep is just not efficient, and You might wanna look into why that that's the case.[0:13:40] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Yeah. Forgive me for the anecdote, but I can't resist. Years ago, I went to an acupuncturist, and, He gave me these red pills, of which I don't know what they contained.[0:13:51] Dr. Gina Poe: Uh-oh.[0:13:52] Andrew Huberman: But I took them because he told me they would help with my sleep. Okay. And I would fall asleep about 30 minutes after taking them.[0:13:58] Dr. Gina Poe: Mhmm.[0:13:58] Andrew Huberman: And I would have incredibly, excuse me, vivid dreams.[0:14:02] Dr. Gina Poe: Mhmm.[0:14:02] Andrew Huberman: And I'd wake up 4 or 5 hours After having gone to sleep, feeling completely rested, something that I've never really experienced Interesting. On a consistent basis. Mhmm. I wanna do mass spec on these pills. I still have no idea what was in them whatsoever.[0:14:16] Dr. Gina Poe: Wanna do mass spec on those pills?[0:14:17] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Some people had thought, that perhaps they had GHB, gamma Droxibutyrate, which is, by the way, an illegal drug. It can kill you. It's not a not something you wanna take. That's not good.[0:14:26] Andrew Huberman: But, anyway, if if ever someone can figure out what the red pills were, I'll be very, That's really good. Is not a red pill of the of the other sort red pill. This is just the red sleep pills.[0:14:36] Dr. Gina Poe: Interesting. I mean, could have been even a placebo effect because placebo is extremely strong. So[0:14:42] Andrew Huberman: Although I I don't know. There was really something to these red bills. So, shout out to the acupuncturist and and the eastern medicine. But to return this I to this idea of the architecture of a perfect night sleep. So you said, we fall asleep the 1st 90 minutes of sleep.[0:15:01] Andrew Huberman: REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, will arrive at about 95 minutes in. Yeah. Does that mean that The rest of that 90 minutes is consumed with slow wave sleep.[0:15:11] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Non REM sleep. Okay.[0:15:12] Andrew Huberman: And what about the sleep where we are lightly Asleep. Mhmm. And we might have a dream that has us somehow thinking about movement or that we jolt ourselves awake. That often happens early in the night.[0:15:23] Dr. Gina Poe: Right? Yeah. That's the first Stage stage 1 and stage 2 sleep. And stage 2 sleep is really cool because that has something called sleep spindles and k complexes. And what sleep spindles are are, a little blurb of activity that's 10 to 15 hertz In frequency, it's a conversation between the thalamus and the cortex.[0:15:46] Dr. Gina Poe: The thalamus is the gateway to consciousness, And the neocortex, you know, processes all our cognition. And, so it's it's these spindles. They're called sleep spindles. And if you wake up out of that state, you will often report a dream, like a hallucination style dream. It won't be a long dream report like you have out of REM sleep, but it will be some hallucination state.[0:16:11] Dr. Gina Poe: During while we're falling asleep, one of the reason we call it Falling asleep is because in stage 1 and stage 2, our muscles are relaxing. And if there's part of our brain that's conscious enough to sort of recognize that Relaxation will feel like we're falling and will jerk away. So often that hallucination, it's called hypnagogic hallucination, will feel like It'll be include some falling aspect that we'll wake up out of.[0:16:37] Andrew Huberman: That's really interesting to me. I've Long felt that sensation of almost, like, dropping back into my head Mhmm. So much so that if I elevate my Feet just slightly, and I tilt my head back just slightly. Mhmm. In order to go to sleep, I find that I fall asleep much much faster.[0:16:53] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. But it does feel as if I'm gonna fall, like, almost gonna do a backwards somersault. I actually really like the the sensation. And, usually, because it proceeds falling deeply is[0:17:02] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. That's really interesting. I'm somebody has to do a study of elevated feet. And[0:17:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There there's a little bit on, body position Mhmm. And sleep and some of the washout that we'll talk about. So early in the night, you got these Lighter stages of sleep, less rapid eye movement sleep. What can we say about the dreams that occur during the, say, first And second, you know, 90 minute cycles of sleep.[0:17:26] Andrew Huberman: Are they quite different than the patterns of sleep and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning?[0:17:32] Dr. Gina Poe: Well okay. That's an interesting question. There's a lot of facets to it. There is some evidence that the first 4 hours of sleep are very important for memory processing. And in fact, if you've learned something knew that day or have experienced a new sensory motor experience, then Your early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience much more than the later sleep dreams.[0:18:02] Dr. Gina Poe: Later as that memory gets consolidated from The early structures, which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe to the cortex in a distributed fashion, That memory seems to move from that hippocampus to the cortex and also the dreams that incorporate that memory Also move later in the night. So, nobody knows why, but it does there was a great study by Sidhartho Ribeiro, who studied the consolidation of memories from the quartet from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat across the period of a full day sleep because rats sleep in the daytime. And he found that each subsequent REMS Sleep period moved that memory from the hippocampus to the first first area that projects to it and then the 2nd area and then the 3rd area, And you can see the memory moving, through the throughout the sleep Cool. Period. Yeah.[0:18:58] Andrew Huberman: Very cool. So you have to read that study. So, there's Number of different hormones associated with the different stages of sleep. We know that melatonin is a hormone[0:19:09] Dr. Gina Poe: Of nighttime.[0:19:10] Andrew Huberman: Of nighttime that makes us sleepy. Mhmm. What about growth hormone release? When does that occur during sleep?[0:19:15] Dr. Gina Poe: So growth hormone release happens all day long and all night long, but the deep Slow wave sleep that you get the very first sleep cycle, is when you get a big bolus of growth hormone release And in men and women equally. And if you miss that 1st deep, slow wave sleep period, you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release. And you might get ultimately across the day just as much overall growth hormone release, But endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses do different things than a little bit eked out over time. So that is Well, we know there's also a big push to synthesize proteins. So that's when The protein synthesis part that builds memories, for example, in our brain happens in that 1st cycle of sleep.[0:20:08] Dr. Gina Poe: So you don't wanna miss that, Especially if you've learned something really big and needs needs more synaptic space to encode it.[0:20:15] Andrew Huberman: How would somebody miss It's that first 90[0:20:17] Dr. Gina Poe: minutes. Themselves. Yeah.[0:20:19] Andrew Huberman: So So let's say I normally go to sleep at, 10 PM.[0:20:22] Dr. Gina Poe: Mhmm.[0:20:24] Andrew Huberman: And then from 10 to 11:30 would be this 1st phase of sleep, and that's when the growth big bolus of growth hormone would be released. Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead at 11:30 or midnight that I miss that first phase of sleep? Yeah. Why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep Just simply starting later.[0:20:41] Dr. Gina Poe: It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body that knows when things should happen, and it's Every cell in our body has a clock, and all of those clocks are normally synchronized. And those circadian clocks are synchronized, and so our cells are ready to respond to that growth hormone release at a particular time. And if we miss it, And it's a time in relation to melatonin also. So if you miss it, yeah, you might get some growth hormone release, but it's occurring at a time when that your clock has already moved to the next phase, and so it's it's just a clock thing.[0:21:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I don't think, we can overstate the importance of what you just described. And to be honest, Despite knowing a bit about the sleep research in circadian biology, this is the very first time that I've ever heard this, That if you normally go to sleep at a particular time and growth hormone is released in that 1st phase of sleep, that you can't simply initiate your sleep out later and expect to capture that 1st phase of sleep. Yeah. That's incredible and, I think, important, and, as many listeners are probably realizing also highly actionable.[0:21:49] Andrew Huberman: So what this means is that we should have fairly consistent bedtimes in addition to fairly consistent wake times. Is that right?[0:21:55] Dr. Gina Poe: Exactly. And in fact, one of the best markers of good neurological health when we get older is consistent bedtimes.[0:22:04] Andrew Huberman: Wow. Okay. I don't wanna backtrack, but I did write down something that I think is, important for me to resolve, or for you to resolve. So I'm gonna ask this, people that sleep 9 hours or more, perhaps that reflecting an issue, Some underlying issue, perhaps, is, being a teenager or an adolescent and undergoing a stage of of of development where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth, an exception to that because[0:22:31] Dr. Gina Poe: Yes.[0:22:32] Andrew Huberman: I don't recall sleeping a ton when I was a teenager. I had a ton of energy[0:22:36] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:22:36] Andrew Huberman: But I know a few teenagers, and they sleep a lot. Yeah. Like, they'll just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep. Should we let them sleep and sleep and sleep? Okay.[0:22:45] Dr. Gina Poe: Them sleep.[0:22:45] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So that's the one exception. What about[0:22:47] Dr. Gina Poe: Just like babies.[0:22:48] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:22:48] Dr. Gina Poe: When when you're developing something in your brain or the rest of your body, You really need sleep to help organize that. I mean, sleep is doing really hard work in organizing our brains and and making it develop right. And if we Deprive ourselves of sleep. We will actually also just like like I said, we have a daily clock. We also have a developmental clock, and we can miss A developmental window if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to.[0:23:16] Andrew Huberman: What other things inhibit Growth hormone release or other components of this first stage of sleep. In other words, if I go to sleep religiously every night at 10 PM, Are there things that I perhaps do in the preceding hours or the preceding day, like ingest caffeine or alcohol, that can make that first stage of Sleep less effective even if I'm going to sleep at the same time?[0:23:37] Dr. Gina Poe: Alcohol definitely will do that because alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant, and it even presses some of that stage 2 transition to REM with those sleep spindles. And those sleep spindles, we didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important for Moving memories, to our cortex. It's a unique time when our hippocampus, the sort of like the ram of our brains, writes it to a hard disk and which is the cortex. And they're it's a unique time when they're connected. So if you don't wanna miss you don't wanna miss REM sleep when is also a part of the consolidation process and, schema changing process And alcohol in there, you know, before we go to sleep, we'll do that.[0:24:18] Dr. Gina Poe: Until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies, it will affect our sleep, badly.[0:24:24] Andrew Huberman: It's probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol within the 4 to 6 hours preceding sleep Yeah. Given the half life.[0:24:33] Dr. Gina Poe: Give it a[0:24:33] Andrew Huberman: hell of a or at all or at all would be better, but I know some people refuse to go that way.[0:24:37] Dr. Gina Poe: Maybe a little bit is okay. I don't know what the dose response is, but, There are studies out there you can look at.[0:24:44] Andrew Huberman: Great. Yeah. So we're still in the 1st stage of sleep, and I apologize for slowing us down. But it sounds like it's an incredibly important 1st phase of sleep. Yeah.[0:24:54] Andrew Huberman: What about the 2nd 3rd 90 minute blocks of sleep? Is there anything that makes those, unique? What what is their signature, besides the fact that they come 2nd and 3rd Yeah. In the night.[0:25:05] Dr. Gina Poe: There's more and more REM sleep the later the night we get. There's also A change in hormones, you know, the growth hormone and, melatonin levels are starting to decline, but other hormones are picking up. So it is a really different stage that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on. And I think that's the stage many studies are showing that those are the Times in sleep when the most creativity can happen. That's when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into a new way, And, and our schema are built during that time.[0:25:42] Dr. Gina Poe: So, yeah, we can change our minds best during those phases of sleep.[0:25:48] Andrew Huberman: Could you elaborate a little bit more on schema? No one I don't think anyone on this podcast has ever discussed Schema. I'm a little bit familiar with schema from my, courses on psychology, but it's been a while. So maybe if you could just refresh mine and everyone everyone[0:26:01] Dr. Gina Poe: else's memory. It's still a A concept. Sure.[0:26:04] Andrew Huberman: Schema is this is define schema. Right.[0:26:06] Dr. Gina Poe: Right? I think of schema as, Like, we have a schema of Christmas. Right? We we we have all kinds of ideas that we sew together And call Christmas, the holiday season in the Northern Hemisphere. It's cold.[0:26:22] Dr. Gina Poe: We have Santa Claus and reindeer and jingle bells and Even things that are false that but we normally associate with Christmas presents, family gathering, when it is, all of this stuff is sewn together into 1 there's a thread linking them all, and we can just give ourselves a list of words and, and none of them contain the word Christmas, and then ask people later, you know, give them another list of words and include the word Christmas, and they'll say, oh, yeah. That word was there. Because in their minds, they brought up that word Christmas because it's part of that whole Schema. So that's what it's sort of a related a lot of related concepts, I guess. That's all.[0:27:04] Andrew Huberman: Think about it sort of like on the desktop of my computer, would scare some people, but it's just a ton of folders. Yeah. But each of the folder names mean something very clear and specific to me.[0:27:14] Dr. Gina Poe: Right.[0:27:14] Andrew Huberman: And inside of those folders are collections of things that Makes sense in terms of how they're batched. Is that kind of one way[0:27:19] Dr. Gina Poe: to think about it? No. That's a great way to think of it. And and when you're in REM sleep in the later parts of the night and that transition to REM, That's when your computer of your brain is comp opening folders and comparing documents, seeing if there is there anything the same? These 2 documents look Very much the same, but there's a little bit of difference, and it can it can link those conceptually.[0:27:41] Dr. Gina Poe: So that that's probably one of the origins of creativity is Finding things that are related, maybe just linked a little bit, and you can find that link and strengthen it if it, You know, make sure schema interesting and different. Yeah.[0:27:56] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. Mhmm. Many people, including myself, tend to wake up Maybe 1 string in the middle of the night to use the restroom. I've tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep. I've I've heard also that, The impulse to urinate, forgive the topic, but a lot of people deal with this.[0:28:13] Andrew Huberman: So the impulse to urinate is also dictated by how quickly you drink fluid, not just the total volume. So I've switched to, I'm sipping fluids more slowly from my last beverage of the day Yeah. Which seems to help. But the point here is that I think a lot of people wake up once in the middle of the night. Oftentimes, they use the restroom, but oftentimes, just Around 3 AM and might be up for a few minutes, hopefully not on their phone or viewing any bright light, which can cause more wakefulness, but then go back to sleep.[0:28:38] Andrew Huberman: Is there any known detriment to this middle of the night waking, or should we consider it a normal feature for some people's Sleep architecture.[0:28:47] Dr. Gina Poe: I think we shouldn't worry about it, actually. I think, you know, sleep is really incredibly well homeostatically regulated. And so, Really, don't worry about how much you're sleeping as long as you're not intentionally depriving yourself of sleep by doing something really rewarding and exciting because even that is Stressful to your body and deprives you of a lot of the things we're talking about. So don't worry about it. It's absolutely normal to wake up At least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.[0:29:15] Dr. Gina Poe: And as long as you can get back to sleep in a reasonable amount of time, you know or even if it takes you an hour, Don't worry about it as long as you have a lifestyle that allows you to then make up that sleep either the next morning or the next night, or going to bed a little earlier.[0:29:31] Andrew Huberman: So if I understand correctly, there's a little bit of asymmetry to sleep that catching that 1st phase of sleep, it's like you either get it or you don't, and you have to get it by going to sleep Yeah. Essentially The same time[0:29:42] Dr. Gina Poe: each[0:29:42] Andrew Huberman: night, maybe plus or minus 15 minutes or so. Yeah. But then if I wake up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep, I can not catch up, but I can Gather all the sleep that I would have gotten had I just slept the whole way through the night. Is that right?[0:29:54] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And and we don't know.[0:29:57] Dr. Gina Poe: Actually, the answer to whether or not The sleep in the middle between that early sleep and the late sleep is in fact different for another reason. And whether depriving yourself of sleep from, say, 1 to 2:30 in the morning is bad in a different way. We don't know.[0:30:12] Andrew Huberman: Well, I suppose I am the experiment in that case because I do tend to wake up once per night, and I've I've sort of come to, recognize it as part of my normal sleep architecture. I don't obsess over it. Right. I do notice that when I go back to sleep and especially toward morning Mhmm. That my sleep is incredibly deep.[0:30:28] Andrew Huberman: My dreams are incredibly vivid.[0:30:30] Dr. Gina Poe: Oh, that's good.[0:30:30] Andrew Huberman: I don't always remember them, but what is Unique perhaps about the architecture of dreams and sleep in the, let's say, the last 3rd of the night or the or the second half of the night. Right.[0:30:41] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. In the second half of the night, we have Longer REM sleep periods, and those are considered the deepest sleep even though slow wave sleep big slow wave is considered deep. It is deep. Deep[0:30:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They call slow wave sleep, deep sleep, and a REM sleep rapid eye movement, but now you're telling me that REM sleep is actually the deepest sleep. Okay. There needs to be a new nomenclature of sleep[0:31:02] Dr. Gina Poe: researchers.[0:31:02] Andrew Huberman: Shouldn't[0:31:02] Dr. Gina Poe: call it deep or not[0:31:03] Andrew Huberman: deep. Please.[0:31:04] Dr. Gina Poe: The reason why you call slow wave sleep deep sleep is because it's difficult to arouse people out of that state. And when you do arouse them out of that state, they're most most often confused and just want to go back into sleep and can go back pretty easily. If you arouse someone out of REM sleep, they're more likely to report something that was really kind of almost like wakefulness. It's it was so vivid. But in fact, if you give someone a nonthreatening kind of stimulation like somebody dropping keys or, a ping or something like that.[0:31:38] Dr. Gina Poe: Instead of waking that same volume will wake someone up out of non REM sleep, But out of REM sleep and instead lengthen the amount of time or make it even more dense, your rapid eye movements more dense, And often people will incorporate that sound into their dreams.[0:31:55] Andrew Huberman: So the body and brain are somehow conscious of the, of the sound. And I've heard also smells can even make it into our our dreams and and REM sleep, but that We it doesn't arouse us[0:32:07] Dr. Gina Poe: as much as us as often. Yeah.[0:32:09] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[0:32:09] Dr. Gina Poe: And maybe one of the reasons why REM sleep is deeper is, especially in adults and older people, that Deep slow wave sleep goes away. So it's not as deep. It's not as big. The slow waves aren't as large, which is probably problematic, but we are not sure. And so then REM sleep becomes the deepest stage.[0:32:28] Dr. Gina Poe: Actually, in children, it's kind of a toss-up because they it's really hard to wake them up out of that Deep slow wave sleep. And in fact, fire alarms don't wake them up, even really loud fire alarms out of that state of sleep. So that's why they're trying to change fire alarms so that instead of something that the kids Don't associate with anything like the whatever they don't associate when it says their name or something else that Maybe less loud, but more salient to them and will wake them up.[0:33:02] Andrew Huberman: I don't know. Having carried sleeping children in from the car, I don't know that I want children to start waking sleep. Because that's one of the best things when you get home and the kids are asleep in the back seat. You can literally throw them over your shoulder Yes. Gently, of course Yes.[0:33:15] Andrew Huberman: And put them to sleep, and and it they are Completely out.[0:33:18] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. It's wonderful.[0:33:19] Andrew Huberman: It is wonderful. One one of nature's gifts. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.[0:33:39] Andrew Huberman: The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens Once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by Gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.[0:34:14] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, And they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d three k two. So this, enhanced volume or or proportion of of rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night, relates to more elaborate dreams. We are paralyzed during REM sleep.[0:34:49] Andrew Huberman: Correct?[0:34:49] Dr. Gina Poe: Yes. Normally, paralyzed, and that's really good Because that's the time when we're actively dreaming storyline dreams, and we could, hurt ourselves. We're actually really cut off From the outside world in terms of, you know, responding to, say, this table or window or door. And so different from Sleepwalking, which is out of slowest sleep. And out of slowest sleep, that sleepwalking is a mixture between sleep and wakefulness.[0:35:17] Dr. Gina Poe: So you actually will respond to the door. You can Cook a full meal. Drive your car while you're in deep, slow asleep. It's scary because you never know what you're going to do. You don't have Voluntary voluntary control over it.[0:35:30] Dr. Gina Poe: You have no conscious control over it, but you can actually safely navigate, some situations In sleepwalking, and actually have a conversation, although it may not make much sense when you're sleep talking. In REM sleep, you're not processing the outside world. And instead, when you're acting out your dreams, you could be doing things like walking through a plate glass window or falling off of, You know, down the stairs, things like that. So you really want your muscles to be inactivated during REM sleep. Otherwise, you will act out those dreams and really hurt yourself or your bed partner.[0:36:08] Andrew Huberman: What about sleep talking or talking in sleep. Mhmm. I don't know how many relationships have, been saved by sleep talking, but I'm guessing a few have, been destroyed. And I'm guessing that, talking in sleep could have meaning or perhaps has no meaning just as dreams Yeah. Could have meaning or no meaning Yeah.[0:36:26] Andrew Huberman: As we recall them.[0:36:27] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Do not Take sleep talking seriously. No matter what people say, it doesn't necessarily reflect truth. So it's not like you're being more truthful When you're sleep talking[0:36:37] Andrew Huberman: You just saved a number of relationships. So. I'm not directing this at anyone in particular, but I I guarantee you just did. Noted. So as people start to approach morning or the time when they normally would wake up Mhmm.[0:36:54] Andrew Huberman: I've heard that it's important to, if possible, complete one of these 90 minute cycles prior to waking up. That is if you set your alarm for Halfway through one of these 90 minute cycles that come late in the night of sleep that it can lead to, rather groggy patterns of waking. So I'll just ask you directly. Do you use a, an alarm clock?[0:37:17] Dr. Gina Poe: I do not. Thankfully, I'm in a line of work that doesn't require me normally to Do anything at any particular time. I do it when I do it. Right. Unless I have to catch a plane, and then I always set my alarm just in case.[0:37:29] Andrew Huberman: Well, as a fellow academic, I can tell you there are plenty of features about being an academic scientist that, that offset the fact that, you don't have to use an alarm clock, but it is nice that you can Often set your own schedule. Yeah. So would you recommend that, if possible, that people not use an alarm clock?[0:37:44] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Absolutely. If you can just Listen to your body and wake up when you need to wake up, that would be great. But, one of the reasons why we have such grogginess, It's called sleep inertia. When we wake up out of the wrong state, which is, deep slow wave sleep is because I liken it To, like a washing machine cycle.[0:38:04] Dr. Gina Poe: This 90 minute cycle is like a washing machine cycle. And and, the first part is to add water. Right? And, then your clothes are soaking wet. You don't wanna open the washing machine and try and function, put them on, and wear them around while they're soaking wet and full of soap.[0:38:20] Dr. Gina Poe: So You have to wait until the cycle is through before you can well, actually, let's put it in the dryer too before you wanna wear them. So, yeah, you can function. It just takes a little while for those Close that brain to dry out so you can actually function well, but it's better to wait through the whole cycle is complete. And So that's why you want to set that 90:90 minute alarm clock. And, again, that's around 90 minutes because the first Stage of sleep, the 1st cycle of sleep is actually a little longer, more like a 105, 110 minutes.[0:38:59] Dr. Gina Poe: But then the 2nd ones and third ones, It gets sort of shorter and shorter as the night goes on. And in the last few cycles, you're just doing the n two REM sleep cycle, which takes less time. And if you wake up out of REM sleep, it's usually no problem cognitively. You you're you're good to go.[0:39:16] Andrew Huberman: Are you a fan of of sleep trackers?[0:39:20] Dr. Gina Poe: Sure. Yeah.[0:39:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Do you use 1?[0:39:22] Dr. Gina Poe: I have 1 on. I don't take I don't I don't, live my life by them because they are the best ones right now are about 70% effective at Staging your sleep, so 70%. It's okay. It's it's okay, but, take it with a grain of salt is what I'm saying.[0:39:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I've tried various ones, and I compare the mattress based one to a I actually wear it on my ankle instead of my wrist. But Mhmm. And I do find it informative, but A, a colleague of mine at Stanford, Ali Crum, who works on mindset and belief effects Mhmm. Talked to me about a study they did where people often will bias Their sense of daytime wakefulness based on their sleep score more than their subjective[0:40:04] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:40:04] Andrew Huberman: Score.[0:40:04] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:40:05] Andrew Huberman: In other words, if they were told they got a poor night even if they got a great night sleep in the in and this was, of course, measured in the sleep lab, so they they're able to compare. People will report feeling more groggy, And the opposite is also true Yeah. That if it says a 100% or 90% on your sleep score, then people, oh, I feel great even though they might not have slept well. So this speaks to the I don't wanna say placebo effect, but the sort of belief effects that are woven in with a score. Yeah.[0:40:27] Andrew Huberman: That's right. So it seems to me that combining Subjective and objective data Yeah. Is probably best.[0:40:32] Dr. Gina Poe: And I do believe that you should trust your own physiology and the way that your body is telling you to feel, because in fact, it used to be that people with insomnia weren't were often not believed because you put them in a sleep lab, and they look Like, they slept great, and you wake them up in the morning, they say, oh, I've I didn't sleep very well at all. And that's because probably we we just came out with a paper that shows that Subcortical structures can be in a completely different sleep state than cortical structures as which is what we measure in the sleep lab, what the cortex is doing[0:41:06] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[0:41:07] Dr. Gina Poe: So it might be that people who say I did not sleep all night long, even though the cortex is saying, oh, no. You had great sleep, was because they're They're monitoring their subcortical, hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, other other structures that The sleep lab just can't access unless you have depth electrodes, which nobody really wants.[0:41:30] Andrew Huberman: Right. Because that requires holes in the skull Holes in the skull. Wires. Yeah. Wow.[0:41:34] Andrew Huberman: So does that mean that the last 50 plus years of sleep science, it's potentially flawed in some way because they're only recording from, I guess this would be the analogy would be it's like recording from, the surface of the ocean Yeah. As opposed to the depth of the ocean. Right.[0:41:50] Dr. Gina Poe: And trying to ascertain The life moving down deep in the depth of the[0:41:55] Andrew Huberman: Brace yourselves, colleagues at Stanford Sleep Lab and elsewhere. But please just tell us because I think Scientists wanna know the truth.[0:42:02] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. I mean, it's not for nothing that you wanna know what the cortex is doing. I mean, the cortex is really important for a lot of things, But it doesn't necessarily tell you what a lot of other really important parts of the brain are doing in terms of sleep. And, but There's hope, because in fact, it would be great. I think that's possible from the paper.[0:42:23] Dr. Gina Poe: If you look at it, it's in PNAS this year, that you could detect subtle changes in the cortical EEG that might be able to tell you what the sore subcortical structures are doing, Things like the absolute power, in that sleep spindle band, that sigma band would change if The hippocampus is in REM sleep, and the cortex is in that sleep spindle state and and vice versa. So there is some hope, that we can gain from people with depth electrodes or animals, with depth electrodes that we could backwards machine learn What the cortex might be able to tell us about subcortical structures from the cortical EEG. So[0:43:08] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. This is gonna be a A stimulant yes. Stay tuned. It's gonna be a stimulus for development of new technology, which is always going to assist in scientific discovery. Yeah.[0:43:19] Andrew Huberman: There's One more thing I wanted to ask about the architecture of the night sleep Yeah. In terms of early part of the night. Earlier, you mentioned the washout Mhmm. Of debris and Mhmm. The so called glymphatic system, I think, is what you're referring to.[0:43:33] Andrew Huberman: Could you tell us a little bit more about the washout that occurs in the brain during sleep? Yeah. What What that is and what roles it's thought to serve, and perhaps if there are any ways to ensure that it happens or to ensure that it Doesn't happen. Right. And, obviously, we want this to happen.[0:43:48] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Great question. We talked about the Circadian clock and how certain things happen at certain times.[0:43:56] Dr. Gina Poe: Well, one of the things that happens when we're awake and talking to each other is that there's a lot of Plasticity. There's something that I'm learning from you today and you're learning from me, and that changes our synapses, and it changes the way our proteins are Going to be folded and and changed during sleep. It unfolds. This process actually uses a lot of ATP, the power, structure the fuel of the brain, and, it unfolds also proteins while we're doing this, while we're using them. And so during that 1st part of the night, when we first fall asleep in the 1st 20 minutes or so, we're building that, Adenosine back into ATP, and that's, probably why power naps are called power naps because we're actually rebuilding the power.[0:44:46] Dr. Gina Poe: And then, we're also cleaning out through the deep slow waves of slow wave sleep. We're cleaning out all those misfolded Proteins, unfolded proteins, and other things that get broken down and, you know, need to be rebuilt When we're asleep because of its use during wakefulness. So I liken that to, you know, having a big party during wakefulness, and you need all those Partygoers to leave in order to do the cleanup. And so what I think the mechanism is, and this is still something to be tested, is actually slow waves themselves, Which is bad news for us as we get older and those slow waves get smaller and, slower sleep goes away. So, so what happens when a neuron is firing is that it expands.[0:45:34] Dr. Gina Poe: The membrane expands a little bit. It becomes more translucent. How we know one of the ways we know that neurons expand when they fire. And so every action potential, it the membrane expands a little bit as Sodium brings water into the cell. And then when they're silent, they contract.[0:45:51] Dr. Gina Poe: And so in during slow waves, the cool thing is that The reason why you can measure them is that all the neurons at the same time, not all of them, but a good portion of them are firing at the same time and silent at the same time. And so You think about that as contracting and expanding all at the same time. It's kind of like a bilge pump of the brain. So that can pump out Glia are also really important for this, in in terms of cleaning up debris and transferring it to where it needs to go. So, so I think of it actually as a bilge pump, cleaning out our brain.[0:46:27] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. I've heard about the glymphatic system and the lymphatic washout. I've never thought about the mechanical aspects of it before. I always thought that for some reason, Mechanical aspects of it before. I always thought that for some reason that now it's obvious to me that there had to be something mechanical, but only now that you've Educate me about this.[0:46:41] Andrew Huberman: I thought that for some reason, the the cerebral spinal fluid just starts washing through, but here you're talking about literally an Expansion and a contraction of the neurons in unison and pushing the fluid through[0:46:53] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:46:53] Andrew Huberman: Cleaning out any misfolded proteins or debris that might occur Yeah. On the basis of these metabolic pathways. And the consequence of that is to, to what? To leave the brain in a state of, more pristine action for for the next day. Yeah.[0:47:10] Andrew Huberman: Is that right?[0:47:11] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. You think of it, again, like a party. And if you don't Clean up after that party and you try and hold another one the next day, it's gonna get more clogged. You know, it's people have a harder time moving around and enjoying themselves. And, if that builds up day after day, you know, it's gonna be cognition that would be the partygoers moving around, becomes Hard.[0:47:33] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:47:33] Andrew Huberman: And so this, build pump that you described is associated with the big slow waves of of deep well, of slow wave sleep. Yeah. So this is gonna occur more or less in the 1st 3rd of the night. Is that right?[0:47:46] Dr. Gina Poe: That's right.[0:47:47] Andrew Huberman: And, are there things that inhibit this process, and are there things that facilitate this process?[0:47:54] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. So, well, one thing to inhibit is not to get it. But[0:48:00] Andrew Huberman: Right. And here too, sorry to interrupt. But And and is this similar to the case with growth hormone where if you go to sleep later than you would normally, you miss the washout. Yeah. It's It's not you don't delay it.[0:48:12] Andrew Huberman: No. You miss You miss the washout.[0:48:14] Dr. Gina Poe: That's right. So if you go to sleep at 1 or 2 in the morning, your sleep is still gonna be dominated by n two and REM sleep, Not by slow wave sleep, so you need to you need to get that 1st bit of sleep.[0:48:27] Andrew Huberman: Would a caveat to that be if somebody normally goes to sleep 1 or 2 AM and wakes up at 10 AM Yeah. That if that's their normal sleep cycle Yeah. That[0:48:36] Dr. Gina Poe: should be okay. It should be okay. You would probably wanna do somebody would wanna do a sleep study with people who do that normally and see if also the melatonin release is later and the Corticosterone rise that happens normally in the morning also happens later. So if everything shifted, good.[0:48:57] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There there are few studies I've come across that really do argue for the fact that waking up Cirque du sunrise. Mhmm.[0:49:06] Andrew Huberman: That doesn't mean at sunrise, but within an hour or 2, maybe 3 hours of sunrise and going to sleep Within 4 hours after sunset or so Mhmm. It is, is actually better for The health of all human beings then is being a night owl. And the night owl there's almost like a night owl posse out there, especially on social media. They get very Set.[0:49:27] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:49:28] Andrew Huberman: When you say that you should see morning sunlight, that after 10 AM, you kind of miss the boat. Mhmm. They get very upset because I think there are About 20 or 30% of people perhaps who, who really feel like they function better staying up late and waking up late, and they function Much less well waking up early and going to bed early, but the data on health metrics Yeah. Suggests that, sorry, night owls[0:49:51] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:49:51] Andrew Huberman: That they are wrong.[0:49:52] Dr. Gina Poe: Yep. Sorry, me, because I'm a night owl.[0:49:54] Andrew Huberman: Oh, boy. Okay. Well, then I'm apologizing directly. And here, I'm not a really early morning person. I'm kinda more typical if I wake up naturally around 6:30 Yeah.[0:50:02] Andrew Huberman: Somewhere between 6:30 and 7:30 AM. Go to sleep somewhere between 10 and 11 PM. Yeah. These are averages. But I do notice that when I force myself to get up a little earlier and go to sleep a little earlier, that My mood and alertness and just overall productivity is much higher, and there could be other variables there too.[0:50:25] Dr. Gina Poe: Absolutely right. I'm a night owl. I love staying up at night doing you know, writing grants, writing papers, watching movies, whatever it is, I love it. But Oh, I, like you and like every human being on earth, do better if I go to bed earlier and wake up earlier. So One good thing for night owls is to have a child because they will wake you up.[0:50:47] Dr. Gina Poe: Their circadian rhythms are so strong. They will wake up. And even if you deprive them of sleep in the first half of the night, they will still wake up like clockwork because their circadian rhythms are so strong At 6 AM. And so what you've you haven't done anything good for your kid. You haven't moved their cycle till later and be more in line with yours.[0:51:06] Dr. Gina Poe: In fact, you've just Sleep deprived them and made them miss a window and made them cranky the next day and made your life more miserable. So go to bed, soon after your kids go to bed and wake up with them. That's the way to do it.[0:51:17] Andrew Huberman: Great. The child alarm clock. Another reason I have children. Yes. I got a dog, a puppy, and then that became a dog specifically well, For many reasons, but one reason was I wanted to be one of those early morning, Raj, you know, 5:30 AM every morning, but I ended up getting a bulldog that would literally sleep 16 hours Yes.[0:51:36] Andrew Huberman: If he could. A nuclear bomb could go off, and he wouldn't wake up. But what I started to learn was that bulldogs actually have sleep apnea. They're there's a as far as I know, they're the only species that has a genetically, they're essentially an inbred, sleep defect.[0:51:52] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:51:52] Andrew Huberman: And so I actually don't encourage people to get bulldogs because it's kind of a cruel breed. They suffer a lot in that body that they're born into. Anyway, a dog can accomplish some some of this, but get the get the, the breed of dog that is going to wake up early. So in other words, don't get a bulldog or a mastic.[0:52:08] Dr. Gina Poe: Well, you know, interestingly, All all predatory animals like dogs and cats and lions and us, Well, more dogs, cats, and lions than us will can sleep, you know, 16 hours a day. Ferrets It's our predatory. They can[0:52:24] Andrew Huberman: see pet ferret? Yeah. I used to and, sadly, I also used to work on ferrets, publish a number of papers. Yeah. Yeah.[0:52:30] Andrew Huberman: Delightful animals.[0:52:31] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. And Great because you can study development. It's really cool, because they're born very altricial like we are with brains that are not very well developed, and so you can see What happens through development and how important these different phases of development really are. But yes. Yeah.[0:52:50] Dr. Gina Poe: Maybe we're not as predator as much predators as we think because, in fact, we our sleep is somewhere between The prey and the predators, in terms of the amount of sleep that we usually need at night. But those predators can sleep 16 hours, Napping all day long and and and more crepuscular, perhaps, like their prey arm or[0:53:11] Andrew Huberman: So dawn and dusk active?[0:53:12] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Dawn and dusk active. Yeah. But, anyway, yes. Children and dogs actually, in if there was a poll done by the National Sleep Foundation to see what the number 1 thing is that wakes people up at night, and number 2 is going to the bathroom.[0:53:29] Dr. Gina Poe: Number 3 is children because, you know, your when your children are young, but that only lasts a few years that they'll wake you up, when they're babies. But the number one thing is pets, And pets needing to go out, or cats wanting to curl up with you or whatever it is, pets' needs will wake you up more in the middle of the night than anything else.[0:53:49] Andrew Huberman: Another reason to not get a nocturnal pet. Yes. People who get hamsters pretty quickly realize that they are nocturnal, and they wanna run on their wheel around.[0:53:57] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. You gotta put them in the living away from where you sleep.[0:54:00] Andrew Huberman: I vote fish tank, folks. Freshwater fish tank. There are all sorts of reasons to not get a saltwater tank. Freshwater fish tank, or a child. I appreciate that vote, and I appreciate you mentioning ferrets.[0:54:12] Andrew Huberman: And by the way, folks, they are carnivores. They are not rodents, and they are They have very elaborate brain structures[0:54:18] Dr. Gina Poe: Oh, yeah.[0:54:18] Andrew Huberman: And they're very smart[0:54:19] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[0:54:20] Andrew Huberman: In the same family as the honey badgers and the other mustelids. Anyway, I shouldn't geek out too much on on the mustelids, or else I'll take the the remainder of all our time. I'd love for you to tell us about REM sleep and the sleep later in the night as it relates to dreams and emotionality. And this is probably, the appropriate time For you to introduce us to this incredible structure in the brain, which is the locus coeruleus. A difficult, structure to spell, but a beautiful A beautifully named structure.[0:54:53] Andrew Huberman: I find locus coeruleus to be just fascinating, and I know I you know, a small fraction of what it does, and I'm hoping you're gonna educate me and and our audience about more about what it does, and hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship to Epinephrine, aka, adrenaline.[0:55:09] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. I'm so glad you brought this up because I can totally geek out on the locus ceruleus.[0:55:14] Andrew Huberman: Please do.[0:55:15] Dr. Gina Poe: Locus meaning Spot or place, and ceruleus meaning blue, so you could just call it the blue spot. That's the easiest. Every, animal with a brain has a blue spot. And, yeah. And I mean every other animal with the brain because, of course, there are animals with nervous systems are not centralized like jellyfish.[0:55:36] Dr. Gina Poe: But anyway, we're we're digressing there. So, the locus coeruleus is Filled with neurons that have in them norepinephrine, which is the brain's version of epinephrine or adrenaline. It's also called noradrenaline. And what it does is it just like adrenaline in the rest of our bodies, it helps prime us to respond to our environment. So When locus coeruleus neurons fire and fire in a burst, we can switch our attention.[0:56:03] Dr. Gina Poe: And they will fire in a burst if, for example, a loud noise happens in the middle of your concentrating on something. So you can it helps it fires, and it helps you switch your attention to that thing and then learn quickly from it. So it's really important in a stress response. It helps us do a quick one trial learning. And, and then the tonic activity During the day when you're just, you know, doing your normal going about your normal concentration kind of activity activities is really good for, sustained attention.[0:56:34] Dr. Gina Poe: It it works with the cholinergic system of our basal forebrain, which is really important for learning and memory also to Help us learn about things and put things together, but just tonic level levels are signature of wakefulness and alertness. So too much is panic with the locus coeruleus activity. A burst is switching attention, and then tonic levels are sustained Constant attention. And then when we go to sleep, the locus coeruleus slows and goes from about, on average, 2 hertz to about 1 hertz, One cycle per second, tonically, and then when we go into REM sleep, it's the only time when it shuts off completely. And it Appears that that complete silence is really, really important for a number of things.[0:57:26] Dr. Gina Poe: And the main thing that I think it's important for is The ability to erase and break down synapses that are no longer working for us. So they encode things that are false now Or they are encoding things that we, learned in the novelty encoding pathway and set of our of our brain that have now been consolidated to other pathways, and so we need to now erase them from the novelty encoding pathway. And that is really, really important for being able to Continue to learn, things all of our lives. So, like, erasing that RAM, or that I don't know. What do you call those disks that you stick into computers?[0:58:05] Dr. Gina Poe: But No.[0:58:05] Andrew Huberman: Hard drive. No.[0:58:07] Dr. Gina Poe: Thumb drives. Thumb drives. You're racing your thumb drives. So you that thumb drive is what you carry around all day long. And then during sleep, you write that thumb drive to the cortex, to the long term memory structures, and you need to refresh that thumb drive.[0:58:20] Dr. Gina Poe: And that's what happens during REM sleep when the locus coerus is off. Because whenever it's on and noradrenaline is there, it helps us to put things together. It helps us to learn and strengthen synapses, but it does not allow us to actually weaken synapses that are also a really important part For life important part of lifelong learning. Yeah. There's so much more I could say about that.[0:58:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Locust arreulis sounds fascinating. So it's Connected to the basal four brain cholinergic system Mhmm. The neurons in locus coeruleus, if I'm not mistaken, release Norepinephrine. Mhmm.[0:58:56] Andrew Huberman: Perhaps epinephrine as well?[0:58:59] Dr. Gina Poe: Well, no. The brain's version of epinephrine is norepinephrine. The other thing it also, the precursor to Norepinephrine is dopamine, and so the source of dopamine in the hippocampus seems to be the locus coeruleus. And it's still a mystery as Under what conditions the locus rilles also releases dopamine, but it's really important when we're learning something new To also release dopamine or to at least activate the dopaminergic receptors in our hippocampus. So yeah.[0:59:27] Dr. Gina Poe: So dopamine, norepinephrine, and then there's also, galanin, which is important for releasing when we're stressed, and it helps also without rapid learning. It works in concert with Norepinephrine and in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses so that we learn really quickly.[0:59:47] Andrew Huberman: I I love, that there are multiple molecules involved because that signals us to a principle, which is that Even if people can't remember all all the names Mhmm. That rarely in biology is something handled by just One molecular pathway that redundancy is the rule Yeah. Because signaling attention to specific events is so important. So that, I'm gonna use that as a just so story. I always say, you know, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but it makes sense to me as to why redundancy would exist in the system.[1:00:20] Dr. Gina Poe: And in fact, when we form hypotheses about the brain, we're always wrong. And the reason why we're always wrong is because it's more complicated than we'd like to think. And because in our brains, when we're forming hypotheses, it's we fail to account for All of the factors that are involved, you know, the glia, the neuropeptides, the neurotransmitters, the physical structure of synapses. And so When I was going through grad school 35 years ago, we the dogma was that every neuron contains 1 neurotransmitter and releases 1 neurotransmitter. And you had Excitatory neurotransmitters and inhibitory neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, but that's as complicated as it got.[1:01:00] Dr. Gina Poe: And then we felt started talking about Neuropeptides, and people said, oh, no. Please don't don't complicate it. And then we started talking about how neurons contain both neuropeptides and neurotransmitters and maybe more than 1 neurotransmitter.[1:01:11] Andrew Huberman: Even hormones too.[1:01:12] Dr. Gina Poe: And hormones and, oh, lord. You know? It's just so complicated, but, I mean, Gotta admit, that's why it works. Right? And every time the brain teaches us something new about itself that we didn't hypothesize, we say, oh, of course.[1:01:25] Dr. Gina Poe: That wouldn't work if the way I hypothesized it with it. You know, we actually need redundancy. We need all these systems to work together.[1:01:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's, It's, daunting sometimes, but it also ensures many, many careers in science and neuroscience in particular. So, note That, aspiring scientists, there's plenty of room, for discovery.[1:01:46] Dr. Gina Poe: Do you want me to talk about Norepinephrine and Yeah.[1:01:48] Andrew Huberman: So what emotion? Yes. Well, what I'd love what I'd love for you to, tell us about is, you know, what role this lack of norepinephrine release during Rapid eye movement sleep[1:01:59] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:02:00] Andrew Huberman: Is thought to achieve. And maybe you could also review some of your work describing conditions under which Norepinephrine invades[1:02:08] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Invades sleep.[1:02:10] Andrew Huberman: Rapid eye movement sleep and other patterns of sleep and how that can be detrimental.[1:02:14] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. So a lot of this is hypothetical, but based on a lot of good evidence that we're sowing together into the schema from which these hypotheses come. So a model, schema from which these hypotheses come. But one thing that happens to people with post traumatic stress disorder is that there is a lot of evidence that The locus coeruleus doesn't stop firing in REM sleep. So whereas their levels of norepinephrine might be Similar to people without PTSD during the day and even during the 1st part of the night, during the wee hours of the morning and when you measure levels from metabolites, in the blood or the cerebral spinal fluid.[1:02:55] Dr. Gina Poe: You see that people with PTSD, It's during the wee hours of the morning when you have the most REM sleep that they have. Their norepinephrine levels differentiate most from those that don't have PTSD. And so that's evidence that the locus reals is not shutting down during REM sleep like it should. Other evidence is heart rate variability. When our locus reals firing.[1:03:17] Dr. Gina Poe: Our heart rates are generally a little higher, and they don't vary as much as they do when the locus coeruleus is not firing. So during slow wave sleep, normally have this big juicy variability in heart rate with every breath in and breath out because our nordinergic levels or norepinephrine levels are lower during REM sleep that goes away entirely, and our heart rate is is is, dominated by, parasympathetic rather than sympathetic activity and also what our brain is driving, you know, what are we dreaming about. For example, for dreaming. We're running. Our heart rates will go up.[1:03:53] Dr. Gina Poe: But norepinephrine levels still should be low or off. So, people with PTSD that we're studying these in rats too. Is it true that our locustules doesn't, shut off when we have post traumatic Stress disorder and the preliminary evidence is, yes, it's true that it doesn't shut off. So what that would do is, Norepinephrine would act at synapses to prevent that, weakening that you really need, for example, of novelty encoding structures. And it keeps memories in that novelty encoding structure even once it's consolidated to the rest of the brain.[1:04:31] Dr. Gina Poe: So in the hippocampus, which is important for Remembering things throughout our lives and and it's that thumb drive. We We need it to be erased so that we can learn new things, once it's been consolidated to the the hard drive of our cortex. And so if we're not able to do that, we fill up that ram, really quickly or that thumb dive really quickly, and we're not able to Learn new things. So for example, after a trauma, I talked to all the locustodialis responding in stressful situations. That's great.[1:05:05] Dr. Gina Poe: It's very adaptive, But then you need it to stop. Once you've learned what you need to learn from it and you wanna go to sleep, you need the locust rose to calm down. And during REM sleep, you want it to stop because then when you've consolidated that traumatic memory to the cortex, you need to erase it from the novelty encoding structures, example, in the hippocampus, so that then when you're in the context of safety, you can learn those new things, those new contexts, and, and stop responding to those same stimuli as though you're in that original situation. So if you're not able to erase That thumb drive, you will always feel like that trauma happened that same day, like earlier that same day, And, respond as you would to an early, a recent trauma, which is with beating heart and all of that. So even memories that are years past, if you're never able to downscale that novelty Encoding structure and you purge it from that traumatic memory, it will stay fresh and new and then become maladaptive.[1:06:13] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to just take a brief moment and thank one of our podcast sponsors, which is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform They analyze this data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason That blood work is the only way that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors, etcetera, that impact your immediate and long term health. One major challenge with blood work, however, is that most of the time, it does not come back with any information about what to do in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, into the ranges that you want. With InsideTracker, changing those values becomes very straightforward Because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use to address the nutrition based, behavior based, supplement based approaches that you can use in order to move those values into the ranges that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.[1:07:08] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker now includes a measurement of Apolipoprotein b, so called Apo b and their ultimate plan. Apo b is a key marker of cardiovascular health, and therefore, there's extreme value to knowing your Apo b levels. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. What approaches are you aware of that can, turn down the output of locus coeruleus during these phases of sleep?[1:07:40] Andrew Huberman: And for that matter, what things can cause ramping up of locus coeruleus during this phase of sleep. We've had a couple podcast episodes, solo episodes, and with guests talking about trauma. We had doctor Paul Contee, who's a Stanford trained, Harvard trained, psychiatrist who talked a lot about Trauma wrote an excellent book on trauma, and, certainly, sleep was emphasized as a as a key thing, like get enough sleep. But here you're saying even if somebody with trauma gets enough Sleep, if locus coeruleus is hyperactive during sleep, those traumas are gonna persist. And most of the trauma treatments that I'm aware of are Everything ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy, talk therapy, drug therapy, EMDR, hypnosis.[1:08:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Nowadays, there's a lot of interest and attention on, Clinical studies on exploring psychedelics Yeah. High dose psilocybin and MDMA. Yeah. So that's a vast landscape.[1:08:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. None of which, as far as I know, is really focused on sleep Specifically[1:08:34] Dr. Gina Poe: No. They're not. And they should be because, actually, psychedelics is a sleep like state, and, it's a REM sleep like state. Although, of course, there are some major differences. So, yeah, so much to talk about here.[1:08:49] Dr. Gina Poe: So antidepressants, are often noradrenergic or serotonergic reuptake inhibitors. So they leave norepinephrine actually out there in the synapses, and What that does is it inhibits REM sleep. And if you're able to get REM sleep, it would probably be REM sleep with some noradrenergic activity. So, actually, I think, anyway, I'm not a physician, that, antidepressants are counterindicated. You don't wanna take them if you've experienced a trauma and you're experiencing PTSD because if anything, it's going to make it worse or at least prevent the type of adaptive REM sleep that you really need in order to resolve those emotions and move on.[1:09:30] Andrew Huberman: Is that statement specific to antidepressants that, tickle the noradrenergic pathway? So The the one that comes to mind is, bup I can never pronounce it. Bupropionine, which is, what I think brand name is Wellbutrin. It's a dopaminergic and noradrenergic agonist. Mhmm.[1:09:46] Andrew Huberman: So that's the net effect as opposed to the Prozac Zoloft variety, which are SSRIs.[1:09:51] Dr. Gina Poe: Yes. Yes. But SSRIs themselves also are problematic because we didn't talk about it yet, but the dorsal raphe nucleus, which produces serotonin, which the So specifics serotonin specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors block from being reuptaken, leaves too much serotonin out there. And what serotonin also is another neurogenic I mean, sorry. Another neurotransmitter that's downregulated during REM sleep that's Specifically off during REM sleep.[1:10:20] Dr. Gina Poe: And what serotonin does is it weights all of our cognition to being able to recognize novelty Again so it sort of weights, our brain away from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty. And, it might be one reason why it's an effective antidepressant because it makes the world feel fresh and new again. Right? But you when you have a too much you're holding a novel traumatic memory, in your novelty encoding structure too strongly already, you don't want to, again, weight things toward novelty. You need that absence of serotonin also to help you get that sense of familiarity and to start erasing the novelty encoding structures, So you need both to be absent.[1:11:12] Andrew Huberman: It's really interesting. We hear a lot about serotonin, and, it's not often discussed in terms of its Features related to novelty enough, I think. Mhmm. And what you just described, I'm accusing to something that, doctor Paul Contee and others have I've said in terms of trauma and here, I'm paraphrasing, so my apologies to them for not getting this exactly right, that that an effective treatment for trauma Does not erase the traumatic memory, but it causes a transition of what once was disturbing and invasive and maladaptive to eventually just become kind of a boring old story Mhmm. That has kind of a Fuzzy texture to it as opposed to this kind of sharp, high friction texture that invades our thinking, and, obviously, our sleeping states as well.[1:12:01] Andrew Huberman: So, again, and I appreciate the disclaimer, the caveats around, you know, Not being a clinician, etcetera. But I do think that there's a lot of interest now in whether or not antidepressants are effective for trauma or not, and I think these these aspects of neuromodulation As they relate to, let's call it erasing traumas or changing the emotional load of traumas during sleep, is something important to take note. We also have a lot of clinicians that Listen to this podcast, so they should also take note. Yeah. Please.[1:12:29] Andrew Huberman: So if I want to reduce the amount of Norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus during rapid eye movement sleep to eliminate the troubling or maybe even traumatic memories Yeah. And allow late stages of sleep each night to have their maximum positive effect. Mhmm. Is there anything that I can do besides avoiding, avoiding traumas, avoiding, serotonergic or noradrenergic compounds?[1:12:58] Dr. Gina Poe: Well, I would also avoid anything just prior to going to sleep that might Excite those systems. So a lot of novelty, a lot of, you know, exciting, stress inducing video games. Try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can. So maybe deep breathing exercises. That's a beautiful Way to calm your sympathetic fight or flight system is deep breathing.[1:13:26] Dr. Gina Poe: And, we haven't been able to test this with rats because can't ask them to do a deep breathing exercise. There might be a way we can do that, but I haven't found out or figured it out yet. But if there's a way you can make your sympathetic system nervous system calm down before you go to sleep, Might free for you meditation or deep breathing exercises. It might be for some, a warm bath or a comforting book. Nothing too exciting, but, also nothing too boring, perhaps.[1:13:57] Dr. Gina Poe: Just something right in the middle which makes you feel happy and calm is what you should do. And if you instead go to sleep while you're anxious or, you're hyped up, then your sleep could become maladaptive. Another thing that happens in rats that we have yet to know if it happens in women is that female rats have, 3 phases of their estrous cycle that, their locustrallis doesn't seem to calm down during REM sleep as much. And we don't know why, but during the high estrogen phases of their estrous cycle, the locustrallis Shuts down just like it does in male rats, but in the other 3 phases, it doesn't. So, one thing that might work, and in fact, there are few studies that Show it, it could work really well is, giving women after a trauma event, something that contains estrogen because estrogen somehow is protective against PTSD, and they know that through a retrospective studies where they, gave women an emergency room, either a pill with estrogen and or without, and those that had pill with in it were much less likely to get PTSD from that trauma as measured a year later than those that had the pill without.[1:15:16] Dr. Gina Poe: So, There's some really good studies by Bronwyn Graham. She's out of Australia to really hone in on How much estrogen do you need? And also testosterone, just so you know, gets converted to estrogen in the brain. So testosterone also can be Protective because it gets converted to estrogen, but there's something about estrogen that's really helpful and protective about, that from From the high locus coeruleus firing. And this is, again, preliminary data that we don't have full we don't have all the answers yet, and, We are looking into it actively right now, but it's really important.[1:15:53] Dr. Gina Poe: The other thing about women is that we are 2 to 4 times more susceptible to anxiety related Mental health disorders including post traumatic stress disorder. So if we could figure out what's happening to the locus coerus during sleep in women, that and then figure out a way to normalize that so the locus reals is silent when it needs to be silent. I think we could go a long way in and helping women be more resilient to stress related, disorders.[1:16:22] Andrew Huberman: Oh, what are some other, sex differences as they relate to sleep?[1:16:27] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good question. There have been very few studies, unfortunately, of women in sleep, women in an estrous cycle or menstrual cycle in sleep. And, but what we have found, which actually Largely replicated the study in 1960, is that that women or females rather at high hormonal phases of their estrous cycle or menstrual cycle sleep a lot less, but that sleep is more efficient.[1:17:00] Dr. Gina Poe: So that sleep is more dense in those sleep spindles, which I haven't gone into what they might do except this connection between the hippocampus and cortex, But as those sleep spindles are more dense and more coherent across the brain areas, the theta cycle, which is 5 to 10 Hertz in the hippocampus, important for 1 year learning and also important during REM sleep, is also bigger and juicier, during the high hormonal phases. So even though there's less sleep, it's more efficient and better. But, so So all of that efficiency seems to be reduced in those other hormonal phases. So even though you might sleep a little more, you might need more sleep, in fact, in order to accomplish the same thing that you can get With that short, very efficient sleep of high hormonal phases.[1:17:54] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. I think There's a growing trend at least among, NIH funded grants to, require, that, they refer to it in the grants, biological sex as a variable. Yes. And then here we're talk nothing about sex, the, the verb. Although, I'm sure there's studies about that too, but biological is a variable because there is a a dearth of studies exploring sex differences Yeah.[1:18:18] Andrew Huberman: In in most everything. Yeah. There's there are all sorts of reasons for that, but more importantly, the Fortunately, the trend is shifting.[1:18:25] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. And even when you study males versus females, a lot of people just Say include females in their studies, but then don't track the estrous cycle or menstrual cycle, and hormones have huge effects on our behavior. I mean, just think of oh, you said sex. You know, before our hormones come in, we're not interested in it. And suddenly, You know, that's kind of a main driver of behaviors.[1:18:50] Dr. Gina Poe: Hormones, can definitely change who we are and what we do, so we should be studying hormones, not just sex.[1:18:57] Andrew Huberman: I always say that, puberty is perhaps the most massive transformation and rate of aging that any of us go through in a short amount of time. Individual their cognition changes. Their worldview changes, and that's largely hormonal driven, and and, obviously, neural architectures change too. I'm Very happy that you mentioned, trying to get into calmer states prior to sleep and some ways to do that. I'm a big fan, and I've talked a lot before on this podcast about Things like yoga nidra, which is a non movement based practice, sometimes called non sleep depressed, where people actually take some time each day to practice to go into a more parasympathetic, AKA relaxed state deliberately Mhmm.[1:19:35] Andrew Huberman: Because it's a bit of a skill.[1:19:37] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:19:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's, and there's There's some good data, really, mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia showing huge increases in, nigrostriatal dopamine, when people Go basically, engage in a practice of deliberate, non movement Mhmm. And that the brain actually enters states of a very shallow sleep. So Sort of nap ish. Mhmm.[1:19:59] Andrew Huberman: But the idea is to actually stay awake, but motionless. And it does seem to restore a certain number of features of neurochemistry, but perhaps more importantly, It teaches people to to relax, which is something that most people are not very good at. Yeah. But in any event, and people who listen to this podcast have heard me say this over and over again, so I sound like a broken record. But this practice, as a zero cost practice that doesn't require any, pharmacology, Does seem to really enhance people's ability to fall asleep more quickly and to fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night.[1:20:30] Andrew Huberman: So in any event, another plug for NSDR yoga nidra.[1:20:33] Dr. Gina Poe: Well, I just also wanna add to that. That's one of the reasons why insomnia is so insidious is because when people feel like they haven't gotten enough sleep and not getting enough sleep become anxious about getting out of sleep, and then you're anxious before going to sleep. Like, I'm not gonna fall asleep. It's gonna be 45 minutes. And then then that's a Positive feedback loop.[1:20:51] Dr. Gina Poe: So you need to break that loop. Say, okay. My body's gonna get as much sleep as it needs. I needn't worry about it, and then practice This relaxation to say, hey. It's it's all okay.[1:21:03] Dr. Gina Poe: It's gonna be alright. And and then concentrate on things that relax you, Whether it's concentrating or not concentrating, whatever it is. You met mentioned yoga nidra, and That reminded me of, transcendental meditation, which is something that also hasn't been studied well, largely because we can't ask nonhuman animals to do it, and so we don't know what's happening with our neurochemistry and our, brain activity in a deep and meaningful way. But one thing that has has been shown and those that can do it really well is that that theta, activity that I said happens when you're learning something or when you're in REM sleep. It it's well established and and increases during the transcendental meditation.[1:21:53] Dr. Gina Poe: So it might be that some states of meditation could, in some ways, Replace or mimic some functions of, for example, REM sleep. But, again, we don't know if all the neurochemistry is right To do, for example, the thing that I was talking about, which is erasing the novelty encoding structures of the brain, that needs an absence of Norepinephrine and serotonin, Which we don't know if that goes away with with, transcendental meditation. We just don't know the answer to that yet.[1:22:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The the studies on On yoga nidra and sleep replacement are kind of interesting. It does seem to be the case that nothing can really replace sleep except sleep, but that if one is Sleep deprived or is having trouble falling back asleep that these, things like and I hear it's I acknowledge this is Essentially, like yoga nidra, but we now call it nonsleep deep breast or NSDR because oftentimes for, names like yoga nidra act as a Kind of a barrier for, what would otherwise be, people willing to try a practice. It sounds mystical. And yoga.[1:22:54] Andrew Huberman: It sounds like flying carpets and you know, it sounds like you have go to Esalen by the way, Esalen's, a beautiful place, but it sounds like you have to go there or or live in the West Coast to to believe in this stuff, but it's simply not the case. These are practices that that are really just self directed relaxation Mhmm. As a practice that that allows people to get better and better at directing their brain states towards more relaxation, and and most people have an asymmetry. Like, for instance, most people can force themselves to stay up later Mhmm. But they have a hard time going to sleep earlier.[1:23:24] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And that just speaks to the asymmetry that's probably adaptive and survival based that we can Ramp ourselves up far more easily than we can tend to calm ourselves down.[1:23:33] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. And, actually, you know, to appeal to other Christians like me, prayer can be a wonderful way to calm yourself down because through prayer, you're giving your cares to god And saying, you know and then you are relaxed more relaxed. And I just wanna say that because The same reason that yoga might put some people off. It might put some people off, to to talk about prayer, but it's the same process of being able to relax. Mhmm.[1:24:05] Dr. Gina Poe: And, yeah.[1:24:07] Andrew Huberman: And get outside our own experience a little bit.[1:24:09] Dr. Gina Poe: Experience. Yeah. Yeah. Back out, get a worldview that might actually also help us to relax.[1:24:16] Andrew Huberman: Well, you'd you might be surprised at how many, clinicians and scientists who've come on this podcast, have mentioned things like prayer from various perspectives, Christianity, Judaism, Muslim traditions, and others that, As a as a parallel to all of these things. And I think what it it speaks to is the fact that ultimately, the biological architectures that we're all contending with are going to be identical. Right? And so different ways to tap into them and and ones that are congruent with people's beliefs, I think, is are great.[1:24:44] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Yeah. Because anything non congruent with your beliefs is also stressful.[1:24:49] Andrew Huberman: Right. And feels forced. And that's why, you know, this idea of calling it nonsleep Rest in addition to yoga nidra was not to detract from the naming or the history around yoga nidra, but I was finding that it was a barrier. You know, likewise, yoga nidra tends to include things like intentions, whereas NSDR scripts and by the way, we will provide links to some NSDR and yoga nidra scripts, but NSDR has no Intentions is simply body scan deep relaxation based. Mhmm.[1:25:13] Andrew Huberman: So it's sort of the scientific version of all of this stuff. And, actually, we study it in the laboratory and Yeah. And some of the brain states that people go into. But that's a Yeah. Discussion for another time.[1:25:22] Andrew Huberman: This is[1:25:23] Dr. Gina Poe: hard not. My mother used to tell me when I said, well, we could play. I can't go to sleep. She'd say, well, You know, start with your toes and relax. So you would clench your muscles around your toes, then you relax them, and do that all the way from your toes all laid her head.[1:25:37] Dr. Gina Poe: And I don't know where she got this. It might have been her own common sense, or she might have gotten it from this, n p NPR show. It's called The Mind Can Keep You Well. She used to listen to, but that's another intentional relaxation that focuses on the body, rather than on your own mental processes. But[1:25:56] Andrew Huberman: I do a little bit of work with the military, and, there's a method within certain communities of special operations in the US military where If they can't sleep or they're having challenges sleeping Yeah. They will deliberately try and relax their facial muscles in particular, like, So drape the facial muscles Mhmm. And, use long or exhale emphasized breathing Mhmm. Does seem to increase the probability of transitioning back into sleep. Right.[1:26:23] Andrew Huberman: And those are hallmarks of yoga nidra, nonsleep, deep rest, body scans. Yeah.[1:26:28] Dr. Gina Poe: And and[1:26:28] Andrew Huberman: so I think all of these things converge on Yeah. On a common theme. You know, as neurobiologists, we can say all of the things that we are describing Certainly, move the needle away from locus coeruleus activation. I mean, we haven't done the the experiment to really look at that, but Seems all these things are counter to noradrenaline release.[1:26:45] Dr. Gina Poe: Right. Oh, another one is yawning. Yawning in itself is is that kind of sort of tensing of all the Muscles in your face and then relaxing them. So it might be why we yawn. We don't know why we yawn yet, but, it might also have It would be really great.[1:27:01] Dr. Gina Poe: Actually, animals yawn too. You know?[1:27:03] Andrew Huberman: My bulldog was a was a perpetual if he wasn't sleeping, he was yawning.[1:27:08] Dr. Gina Poe: And it would be interesting to see what yawning does to the locus coerus. Does that also come and switch locus coerus activity? Because it's an interesting that facial nerve, like Trigeminal nerve, you know, the through the vagus connects, indirectly to the locus coeruleus and has a powerful effect on that.[1:27:25] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. A common, I think, friend of ours and direct colleague of yours, Jack Feldman was a guest on this podcast telling us about all the amazing structures he and others have discovered in the In respiration and breathing Yeah. Sounds like we have a collaboration brewing that the 3 of us should should definitely carry out.[1:27:41] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:27:41] Andrew Huberman: I'd love for you to share with us a little bit more about, the spindles that have come up a few times. And I don't know if it's relevant to this. So if it's not, let's separate it out. But I'd love for you to tell us a little bit about The role of sleep in problem solving and creativity. And if spindles are involved, then I'll consider myself lucky for batching them in the same question.[1:28:01] Andrew Huberman: And if they're not involved, simply Feel free to separate them out.[1:28:04] Dr. Gina Poe: I think they could be involved. Okay. And the reason why I think they could be involved because we now know a lot more about spindles. First of all, the first thing that we knew 1st of all, we ignored them. Then we thought they had something to do with keeping us asleep, and that was their function is when the an external stimulus came, they would keep us asleep because they would arise.[1:28:21] Dr. Gina Poe: But now we know that the density of our sleep spindles, the number that we produce per minute, is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place and that no matter what your intelligence is, and no matter what your sleep spindle density is, if you learn something during the day and increase your sleep spindle density, It's really almost perfectly correlated with our ability to consolidate that information and and incorporate it into the schema that we already have in our brain. So If you try and learn something new, even if your sleep spindle density at baseline is great, if you don't increase your sleep spindles that night, you're not gonna, You know, use sleep to really incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles are poor in those with schizophrenia. It's one of the characteristic Signatures of sleep, is that sleep spindles are very few and far between, which might mean that, that people with schizophrenia might not be able to incorporate new information into already existing schema, and instead it sort of flaps in the breeze out there and can be accessed, erroneously at times when you, you know, you don't want it to be in involved. So, I digress.[1:29:30] Dr. Gina Poe: So sleep Spindles and creativity. So one of the things we now know through some great studies by Julie Seep and Anita Luthi is that Sleep spindles are accompanied by an incredible plasticity out in the distal dendrites, the listening branches of our neurons that listen to other cortical areas. So there are proximal dendrites in our neurons that listen to the external world and are conducted through the thalamus. And then there are distal dendrites, which listen to an internal kind of, you know, conversation that's having happening in our brains. It's kind of, you know, our internal state, really.[1:30:08] Dr. Gina Poe: And during sleep spindles, that's when those distal dendrites are able to best Learn from other cortical areas and from the hippocampus. It is during sleep spindles at the hippocampus and the cortex are best connected and when that class incredible plasticity can happen. When I talk about schema, that's a cortical, cortical thing. That's when, You know, the image of Santa Claus and presents, you know, comes together. It's not through some external thing.[1:30:34] Dr. Gina Poe: Once we learn those things together, It's our cortex that that encodes that and brings those images back up together. And that's during sleep spindles when that's happening, when that, there's big surges of calcium into those, distal dendrites and where plasticity happens in in just huge amounts. During that sleep spindle stage of sleep, which is n two stage, there's also some another excitatory, event that comes all the way from the brainstem and projects everywhere in our cortex, which is called PGO waves. That's p for pons, g for geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which is where they're first discovered, and o for occipital area, which is our visual area, which is again where they're first discovered. But in fact, it's now been shown that PGO waves, which we should generalize to p waves because they come from the pons and go to the thalamus, and then the cortex Happens all over the brains, and that is where, glutamate, which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter Involved in learning and plasticity is being released in big amounts also in those distal dendrites.[1:31:41] Dr. Gina Poe: So p waves and spindles work together to cause plasticity And so are schema together, which could be the origins for, insight and creativity. Now when PGO waves or p waves were first discovered. It was thought to be random because this small area that generates p waves all over the brain, You know, gen projects all the all over the thalamus and causes p waves all over, and you don't measure p waves all over the brain at the same time. In fact, it's just seems sporadic and random. So that's probably and p waves are also happening even more During REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.[1:32:19] Dr. Gina Poe: So that's probably that's why people think that REM dreams are so random is because these P waves are random, and they could generate dreams because they're an internal source of excitation that Kind of replaces the outside world during our dream state. And so these p waves, if they are random, could could function Could be the underlying reason why REM sleep dreams are random, and it might also be why Creativity can happen there just because we're randomly activating coactivating different things in our brain that we can then So together, but it might not be as random as we think. So that's the caveat there.[1:33:03] Andrew Huberman: Well, I just learned a lot from you because I I teach brain stem to Medical students and, I talk about the ponds. Mhmm. And the ponds is like this dense collection of all these different nuclei involved in a bunch of different things, and it's Close by, a bunch of interesting things, and, it's still kind of a mysterious brain area. But when I learned about PGO waves, I thought Pons, geniculate, occipital, because occipital is most commonly associated with visual cortex.[1:33:27] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:33:28] Andrew Huberman: I thought it was the origin of The visual component of dreams[1:33:32] Dr. Gina Poe: It probably is.[1:33:33] Andrew Huberman: I'm very happy to learn that they should be called p waves because they include Lots of different areas of the brain, and it makes really good sense to me why the kind of pseudo randomness of Mhmm. Dreams, especially these late night On early morning, later in sleep, I should say, and early morning dreams seem to be cobbled together from Kind of desperate experiences. I mean, you know, you you walk through a door and suddenly it's a completely different context and landscape.[1:34:01] Dr. Gina Poe: Yes.[1:34:01] Andrew Huberman: Beautiful. Yeah. I I I like this idea a lot. It makes intuitive sense. It makes biological sense.[1:34:07] Andrew Huberman: It also gives me something to talk about, to the medical students next quarter when I talk about ponds.[1:34:11] Dr. Gina Poe: Right. You wanna talk about where in the ponds? Right below the locus coeruleus. It's called the subsuruleus. They're glutamatergic.[1:34:17] Dr. Gina Poe: It's also called, SLD, sublateral dorsal nucleus. So[1:34:23] Andrew Huberman: Love it. So, note to any aspiring neurobiologists, there's a a vast landscape of yet to be undiscovered Structure and functions in the pods. You wanna work on something that is sure to reveal something novel, work on the pods. Right. Because it's in every textbook.[1:34:37] Andrew Huberman: It's A clinically very important structure. Yeah. Sadly, gliomas can and another, cancers of the brain can sometimes, It can often surface in the in the ponds, but but we still know very little about it. Yep. I read a paper this Last year or and I think it was covered in a bit of popular press that during rapid eye movement sleep, People can solve problems or respond to external stimuli.[1:35:04] Andrew Huberman: Like, for instance, they would give the math problems. They'd whisper in their ear while they were in REM sleep. Yeah. You know, what's 2 plus 2, and people would say even though they were paralyzed, apparently, they could still move their mouth because they'd say 4 or something like that. Or they'd say, you know, what's your name, and people could respond.[1:35:19] Andrew Huberman: And so that in REM sleep, perhaps, people, some elements of cognition are still, active[1:35:25] Dr. Gina Poe: I'm glad you brought that up.[1:35:27] Andrew Huberman: That What do you think of and I don't know the authors of that study, and, and, listen. If ever I say something wrong, it's Great on this podcast because someone will tell us in the YouTube comments. It's one of the great, uses of YouTube comments. Yeah. But I'd love to know your thoughts on that study.[1:35:41] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:35:41] Andrew Huberman: I mean, is that just kind of a I, an odd feature that or does this have meaning? Should we actually care about this result?[1:35:49] Dr. Gina Poe: There's no just about it. It's really actually Intriguing and interesting and might relate to this paper that I talked about where we where we said different areas of the brain can be in different states at the same same time. So Lucid dreaming is another thing we can't ask animals to do or can't ask them if they've done it. But, we can certainly ask humans to do it, and some people can do it really well. And it would be really interesting to see in those people who could lucid dream really well whether they spend more or less time In this, asymmetrical state where one area of the brain is in one state and another area of the brain is in another, and it might be that those people can respond to Questions during REM sleep best are those that have the most asymmetry or or dissimilarity or dissociation between subcortical and cortical structures or it might be that they're the ones with the most symmetry.[1:36:40] Dr. Gina Poe: We don't know. I do worry a little bit about lucid dreaming because people are it's a Fad people are really excited about it, and to be able to remember one's dreams is fun often unless they're nightmares. And but it's really interesting. Or to be able to direct one's Dreams, if they are nightmares, is really wonderful power to have, to be able to redirect a nightmare that has been repeated to something else and then kick yourself out of that. Repetitive nightmare is really nice, but, I worry a little bit about because we know so little about what's actually going on in the brain.[1:37:14] Dr. Gina Poe: And if This lucid dreaming state is preventing us from, for example, from the locus coeruleus from calming down or the serotonergic system from Silencing like it should. And maybe what we're doing during this state is, yeah, we're activating the learning and memory structures, but in a way that's, maladaptive in terms of the erasure that we need to do. So maybe one of the reasons why most people don't remember most of their dreams is for good reason. Your hippocampus is in a state where it's not writing new memories. In fact, it's writing out its the memories it learned during the day to the cortex, and it's, immune from incoming new information.[1:37:52] Dr. Gina Poe: So, so maybe lucid dreaming is bad because You're you're activating the hippocampus in a way that's writing new memories, and it might be really maladaptive for things like, you know, PTSD. On the other hand, let me just argue myself right out of this. When I used to have a repeated nightmare when I was a kid, my mother, who's so wise, would tell me, well, listen. Just next time you're in that dream, you know, say, hey. I'm in a dream, and then change something about So she and I rehearsed what the horrible dream that it was.[1:38:26] Dr. Gina Poe: It was a big monster, you know, running after me, and my legs were like mud. And I couldn't run away, and it was just Terrifying. And that was a dream I would have, you know, time and time again. She said, okay. Next time, what are you gonna do?[1:38:38] Dr. Gina Poe: And that monster comes after you. Gonna run away. No. You that's what you do every time, and it's always the same outcome. You can't run.[1:38:44] Dr. Gina Poe: So let's do something different. Like, what what could you do that's different? So I came up with all I could turn around and punch it in the nose. Yeah. That's great.[1:38:53] Dr. Gina Poe: So the next time I had that dream, I did recognize this is That same old dream, which means that there's part of my brain that's conscious enough to know that this that I'm in a dreaming state. And then I didn't have the courage in my dream because I was terrified to punch, you know, or touch the monster in any way, but I did have the courage to turn around and look it in the eye and say, no. That was enough. I said, no. And that was enough to knock me out of that rut of that dream so that I never had it again.[1:39:22] Dr. Gina Poe: I never had that same dream again. And in fact, it gave me peace about dreaming because I knew that if ever there was a nightmare that was just too scary, I could probably Do something to change it and knock myself out of it. So even though I don't recommend lucid dreaming on a normal day to day basis, If it's enough that can knock you out of a rut, one thing that happens with people with PTSD is they have the same repeated, horrible nightmare, which is often a reliving of the day's trauma that that that they that they had. So maybe lucid Dreaming can be used on occasion to be a powerful tool because there's so much plasticity that happens during REM sleep To knock you out of that rut of of reliving that event and and just change it. You know?[1:40:11] Dr. Gina Poe: And you could probably practice that during wakefulness, rehearse the event that happened that was so traumatic, and then just introduce a new element like, you know, Now I'm safe. Now, you know, the sound that was associated with that really traumatic thing, I should now associate with something else. And next time I have that dream, I'm gonna Change it so that sound is now this new thing that it should be associated with safety. And that might be enough, maybe, I hope, to knock you out of that repeated nightmare and maybe even start you on the path to recovery. Because if you can calm down about those nightmare states of sleep, Then maybe your locus coeruleus, which is involved in stress, can also relax, and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done.[1:40:57] Andrew Huberman: I love it. I seem to recall a paper, and I'll have to find the reference and and, send it to you. We will also put in the show note captions that described a protocol that essentially matches this, idea. And, well, I think what they had people do was either Cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness than to try and recall a recurring nightmare.[1:41:19] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:41:20] Andrew Huberman: Then during the night's sleep, They have the tone playing in the background, which would then cue them to the wakeful state. They're still asleep, mind you, but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state. And then try and Change some variable Yeah. As you're describing. Some either look the the, predator in the eyes or do something different.[1:41:37] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:41:37] Andrew Huberman: And then in the waking state, Take a little bit of time to try and script out a different, narrative altogether, and it took several nights as I recall or more Mhmm. But that they were able to escape recurring nightmare.[1:41:49] Dr. Gina Poe: Oh, it's like a week or something. Yeah.[1:41:50] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so you're familiar with the study.[1:41:52] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. It's a beautiful study. I loved it.[1:41:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We we will, put a reference to that. I, I need to revisit that study. It was pretty recent, but I I'd need to dive into it again because I think I I didn't go as deep into it as I I should have.[1:42:04] Dr. Gina Poe: No. No. But the one thing that you that you well, said many right things, but one of the things you said is that they were able to cue the dreamer, when they knew and they were going to REM sleep, And then they played the sound or had the odor. Now when you're normally asleep alone in your bed, you're not gonna be able to chew yourself, but it might be that Rehearsal enough before you go to sleep is enough to, you know, help cue you, to that repeated nightmare. Remembering what the nightmare is And then figuring out how to cue yourself to do something different.[1:42:36] Andrew Huberman: For years, I had the same recurring nightmare Over and over and over again, and it was so salient and so clear. And I'm not gonna share what it is because it's, it's not that it's that disturbing. It was just I think it was the Emotional load of it and just how salient certain features were. Like, 1 person in, who's a real life person had a particular, Clothing Yeah. On.[1:42:59] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And it's like and that just served as this cue. And Yeah. I don't know if I ever did any direct work to try and deal with it, but now it almost seems Silly to describe it?[1:43:06] Dr. Gina Poe: Oh, yeah. Well, dreams are usually silly to describe. Pretty[1:43:09] Andrew Huberman: pretty silly. But your emotions violent dream.[1:43:11] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. And your emotional system is so geared up During REM sleep, which is another thing we could talk about.[1:43:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Please. I would love to yes. So locus coeruleus is Ideally, suppressed. So we can't release Norepinephrine.[1:43:25] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We can't act out our dreams. This, during these very emotionally laden, Thoughts Yeah. And and story lines during sleep. This almost, like, starts to sound like a little bit of a built in, While sleeping, trauma therapy.[1:43:40] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Because most trauma therapies involve trying to get people into states of, Counter to what most people think, you actually wanna get close to the trauma in terms of the narrative That's right. Or try and suppress the emotional[1:43:51] Dr. Gina Poe: Right.[1:43:52] Andrew Huberman: Activity of it. Or Mhmm. And I guess that's the motivation for ketamine based therapies for trauma. Mhmm. Or I've also heard, and this is still perplexing to me, that other Waking based trauma therapies involve taking people the other way, making it very cathartic.[1:44:05] Andrew Huberman: Take them to the peak of the emotional response, but then allow that to Finally cycle down into a more relaxed response. So please, if there's anything about locus coeruleus and and dreams and That can help people basically extinguish traumas or traumatic features to to real life events. Sure. We definitely wanna know about them.[1:44:25] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think one of the Things that people thought might help after a trauma, like a school shooting or whatever, you know, car accident is to talk about it. And In but in fact, that ended up being counterproductive. And I think one of the reasons why it was counterproductive is because it didn't take you them back down.[1:44:45] Dr. Gina Poe: It brought them up and continue to reactivate the emotions of it, but then didn't, you know, emphasize the safety, the fact that it's over, or help them work through how they might avoid it again in the future to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again before they went to sleep in an and then and it none of these studies has sleep ever been considered. But to me, that's the key part is bringing down your sympathetic system before you go to sleep so that your sleep can be adaptive. Your locustroles can shut off like it normally does or should do and then able to Erase the novelty of it. The other thing that, I just mentioned a minute ago was that the emotional system is Highly activated in REM sleep, and that's definitely true. And that might seem counterproductive in terms of, you know, the nightmares and and how to help REM sleep be a therapeutic thing rather than a, than a, in reinforcing the emotionality of the trauma.[1:45:48] Dr. Gina Poe: And I think the key to that again is the absence of norepinephrine. So even though the emotional system is in high gear, Without Norepinephrine, you can actually divorce those highly activated emotions from the cognitive parts of the memory that you have just written out in that n two stage of sleep when the Sleep spindles are going. So, so you've just now consolidated the information that you'll need to survive and to, you know, to make that adaptive, And now you need to divorce from that schema and from that semantic parts of memory, the emotional part because whenever you remember something, it's fine if you remember the being emotional at the time, but you don't wanna Bring back and sew into that memory all of the same emotional systems. You don't wanna bring back, you know, the heart rate changes in the sweating and and all of that. You wanna be able to remember all the parts of it and even remember that you were traumatized and that you did cry and that you did have you know, your heart was racing.[1:46:57] Dr. Gina Poe: But when you're talking about it years later, you don't wanna have to relive all that. Otherwise, who would who would ever want to recall a traumatic memory? Because you're basically putting yourself through the same trauma, which is what people with PTSD have. They don't want to recall this traumatic memory because they're it's reliving it. Like, it's just happening again.[1:47:17] Dr. Gina Poe: So that's what we're thinking is that, the emotional parts are no long are not able to be divorced because the norepinephrine system is not downscaled during REM sleep. And so that REM sleep serves to instead reinforce and, in fact, amplify the emotions because your your emotional system is up. Look. The surrealist is high. Resowing in every night The emotionality of those memories and with the memory itself.[1:47:46] Andrew Huberman: You've, told us a lot about locus coeruleus and norepinephrine from locus coeruleus. Is there adrenals. My understanding is that norepinephrine and nephron will not cross the blood brain barrier, which is probably why we have a brain based Neuroadrenergic system[1:48:10] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:48:10] Andrew Huberman: Locus coeruleus Yeah. And other and other neurons. Actually, that's a question I should ask you.[1:48:14] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:48:14] Andrew Huberman: Are there other sites in the brain where norepinephrine is released from, or is it just Locust cerules.[1:48:19] Dr. Gina Poe: So there are 7?[1:48:21] Andrew Huberman: Oh, okay.[1:48:22] Dr. Gina Poe: 9 different adrenergic yes. There's 9 different adrenergic structures.[1:48:27] Andrew Huberman: I'm sorry. I've been asked, but but it just occurred to me that, in some cases, like with raphe Mhmm. There are other sources of serotonergic Drive in the brain, but raphe is like the main sign.[1:48:38] Dr. Gina Poe: That's the one that goes to the cortex, and and and the locus coerce is also the one that goes to the cortex. But there are other adrenergic sources, some that, from the brain stem that descend and help us to ignore pain, for example, when we're stressed and needing to run away from the tiger. Right? We don't wanna be thinking, oh, my ankle hurts. You know?[1:48:57] Dr. Gina Poe: You wanna just be able to ignore it and go do what you need to do. So, Yeah. So there are lots of other noradrenergic, nuclei, but the locus coeruleus is the main one that projects all over the brain. Actually, the only place it doesn't is the dorsal striatum. You talked about ventral striatum and addiction.[1:49:14] Dr. Gina Poe: The dorsal striatum is the only place the locus rose doesn't project to, and that's involved In procedural learning, motor learning, the kinds of learning that take over when your hippocampus, for example, is compromised bilateral, if you don't have good hippocampus, you can still do procedural learning and do and it's great. It's a redundant system. And so, If your locus coeruleus is not working, if you don't have it anymore, you can still do if you if you don't have a good hippocampus, you can still do learning through this dorsal striatum structure. So It might be for those kinds of learning, functions. Sleep deprivation where you never let the locust Joe's stop firing is okay because it doesn't have any receptors for norepinephrine anyway.[1:49:59] Dr. Gina Poe: So yeah.[1:50:01] Andrew Huberman: And what about bodily, the like, Adrenals Yeah. You know, I I often remind people there's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se, that adrenals don't actually, burnout. But some people have, adrenal insufficiency syndrome. Other people have adrenals that are just chronically Cranking out Mhmm. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and Yeah.[1:50:22] Andrew Huberman: Cortisol Yeah. At the wrong times in particular.[1:50:25] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Yeah. So that those are great questions, and I think the answers to them have yet to be discovered, the connections between our periphery and our central nervous system. But we know that there are beautiful connections, and it's untapped source of being able to manipulate our brains is to work through our bodies. And so, our adrenals do great things.[1:50:49] Dr. Gina Poe: They constrict our blood vessels causing higher blood pressure, which help blood rush out to all the Remedies that need blood, you know, our muscles, for example, for running away from the lion, or the tiger Or Whatever. A grant deadline[1:51:04] Andrew Huberman: or meeting a grant deadline. Or catching a train. Yeah.[1:51:07] Dr. Gina Poe: Catching a train. Yeah. Yeah. The adrenals help our hearts faster. Our muscles get perfused with the, blood it needs.[1:51:16] Dr. Gina Poe: It diverts blood and everything away from our, Parasympathetic system, which is rest and digest. We don't really need to digest that croissant when we're running for a train. We can do that later. Mhmm. So It's doing really important things.[1:51:31] Dr. Gina Poe: What we don't know, because it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier, is how that affects the brain and whether our if we can independently activate our adrenals, when a time when our brain thinks that we should be fine and calm and asleep, how our brain detects that. Is it a feedback through, you know, heart is racing and then our brain stem says, what's going on? My heart is racing and then wakes us up, And then our hearts were racing together with our brain racing. We'd we just don't know the answers to these questions yet. There are some good Good studies, old studies, but we need a lot more.[1:52:09] Dr. Gina Poe: Mhmm.[1:52:09] Andrew Huberman: Very well. Another another nod to the fact that there's lots of great work ongoing Yeah. And still to do, I'd love for you to tell us about some of the work that you're doing more recently on the relationship between sleep and opioid use, Withdrawal, relapse[1:52:25] Dr. Gina Poe: Relapse.[1:52:26] Andrew Huberman: And, and craving. Just addiction, generally. I get a lot of questions about People trying to come off Benzodiazepines or, people's challenges with Benzodiazepine and other types of addiction. Mhmm. Yeah.[1:52:40] Andrew Huberman: What What is the role of sleep in addiction and recovery from addiction and opiates in particular?[1:52:46] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah. Well, this is a very young area. And in fact, my laboratory has just I have a graduate student who's been in my lab for just 1 year. She's done amazing work already, but completely groundbreaking work. And what she has already.[1:53:01] Dr. Gina Poe: We don't have the paper out yet, but, we're working on it, is that, when animals withdraw from opiates, And this has been sort of replicated in other ways with other types of things. Our sleep is disturbed. Our sleep is Terribly disturbed, and the amount of sleep disturbance predicts relapse behaviors. And you might think, well, of course, you're going to relapse if you can't sleep because Opiates calm you down. Well, the one of the reasons why opiates calm you down is because the locus coeruleus, again, loose spot is covered with opiate Receptors, that are normally really responsive to our endogenous opiates.[1:53:39] Dr. Gina Poe: And so what what happens when we're pleased, for example, or laughing or whatever. Our endogenous opiates those receptors in the locus reals and calm it down. It it actually, suppresses locus reals activity. It makes us happy and relaxed. One of the things reasons why opiates are so addictive is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed.[1:54:03] Dr. Gina Poe: But the problem with exogenous opiates is that they really bind strongly bind these receptors on our locus coeralis. And if you take exogenous opiates again and again, like you're recovering from surgery, for example, and take these pain medications, is that our locus root struggles to do what it's supposed to do, which is keep us awake and learning and and concentrating on things. So it will down regulate. It will internalize these receptors that are normally only occupied by endogenous opiates, and and and it will do this. It will change our genes that are associated with producing these receptors so you actually have very many fewer receptors.[1:54:41] Dr. Gina Poe: So the locus rose, at least during wakefulness, can fire and help us to do these things like learn about our environment. And so if you long term reduce the number of receptors out there, then when you withdraw the exogenous opiates, there is not enough of your endogenous opiates to, to Be able to occupy those few receptors that are there, and our locus reals has nothing to calm it down anymore, no pacifier. And it just fires and fires and fires. And that Phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out because it's normally associated with stress. And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that and it also activates our locus rilles.[1:55:22] Dr. Gina Poe: There's nothing to calm it down again, and so it just keeps firing. It disturbs our sleep. And so that's why maybe sleep disturbance is a an indicator of hyperactive locus coeruleus and, and such a good predictor of relapse behaviors because nobody likes to live in that high stress state, and they will do anything, to get back to normal. So the problem with with, Taking these drugs is that it it leaves you excited and or sorry, excited, relaxed and happy, but then when you come off of it, you're worse than when when you were at baseline. You take it again.[1:56:05] Dr. Gina Poe: It only brings you up this far because you have fewer receptors. When you come off it, you're down even more depressed and and anxious. And depressed is a word I use loosely, and that's not not what I say.[1:56:17] Andrew Huberman: Central nervous system depression. I mean, sleepier, less motivated, lowered mood. Yeah.[1:56:23] Dr. Gina Poe: I mean, our locus coeruleus is actually it it's a it's a the anxiety kind of depression, actually, the anxiety related depression. So, yeah. So We don't know yet what, and there's some good research going on right now, what could restore our own endogenous receptors so that our endogenous opiates can Properly calm our locus coeruleus, once that they have been tamped down by exogenous opiates, but that would be really one way that you can access, the sleep disturbance. So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep in terms of learning and memory, the importance of the structure of the 90 minute cycle for all of that. So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed by too much locus coerce activity, the the the structure and the function of those sleep spindles and that Theta during REM sleep and the and the lack of norepinephrine, all of those structures, all those functions for For learning something new like a new behavior that as as it involved the drugs becomes, compromised.[1:57:26] Dr. Gina Poe: And so that's something that Tanya Lugos in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA that we're we're looking at how is learning and memory affected by the sleep disturbance, if there are way we can, in animals that have coming off of opiates, can we restore their sleeps to normal so then they are less likely to, do relapse kinds of behaviors.[1:57:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Fascinating. And I'm I We'll certainly have to have you back on to tell us the results of those studies. Meanwhile, I think for anyone who's trying to, come off opiates, exogenous opiates and restore these systems, what I'm hearing is that it's going to take some time, but that any and all things that people can do to buffer their Healthy, normal sleep architecture like morning and daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering the temperature at night, a number of things that we've talked about[1:58:16] Dr. Gina Poe: on this podcast. Deep breathing exercises, meditation, whatever it is that helps you calm yourself before sleep. Yeah.[1:58:23] Andrew Huberman: Right. Would would facilitate not just sleep, but perhaps even accelerate the The recovery and, and shorten this period of withdrawal, which from the questions I get and from what I hear, can be absolutely brutal.[1:58:36] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:58:36] Andrew Huberman: So[1:58:37] Dr. Gina Poe: I can imagine. I had to take opiates for I only took it for 3 days after giving birth to my, 1st son, I think, 2nd son, one of them. And, and just I just said after 3 days, this is enough. I'm just gonna try Tylenol. And, so I I weaned myself, not weaned.[1:58:56] Dr. Gina Poe: I just did a sudden sharp cutoff. And even though I felt I didn't get the high of opiates when I was taking the, Tylenol codeine. When I went off at boy, it was like PMS times 100. I was So anxious and upset at little things. Thankfully, it only lasted a few hours, but if I had taken it for a week or 2 weeks, who knows if I my endogenous opioid receptors would have been permanently downregulated, and I would have been an addict, You know, an addict.[1:59:28] Dr. Gina Poe: I would have been addicted. I shouldn't say an addict. There's negative connotations. It's just a very physiological state, so, no judgments at all associated with it. So, yeah, they're powerful, powerful painkillers, but can also alter your entire brain and rewire it.[1:59:44] Dr. Gina Poe: Yeah.[1:59:45] Andrew Huberman: Well, all the more reason why I and many others are grateful that you're doing this work to figure out ways that people can recover, more quickly and more thoroughly. I must say you've taught us a tremendous amount in, in a relatively short amount of time, about the architecture of sleep, the different phases, The relationship between sleep and dreaming and this incredible structure, locus coeruleus, and I'm so happy we also got into the ponds that just delights me because, We rarely talk about the pawns on this podcast, but it's such an interesting structure. Sex differences, that are important in creativity and problem solving and, and trauma, sleep been those just such a wealth of information and much of it that's actionable for people. So first of all, I wanna say thank you for taking the time to sit down and have this conversation that so many people are sure to benefit from. I also wanna thank you for doing the work you do.[2:00:35] Andrew Huberman: Even though I'm a fellow neurobiologist, I think that, It's not often that, we take a step back and realize that it's really the work of, hard Thinking hard, strongly motivated, PIs, stands for principal investigator, by the way, PIs like yourself, graduate students, and postdocs really drive the discovery forward and that lead to these new therapeutics. Physicians are wonderful. Clinicians are absolutely wonderful, but Clinicians don't develop new treatments. They they only implement the ones that researchers discover. So thank you for being a brain explorer Oh.[2:01:11] Andrew Huberman: With Thank you. With a focus on, growing the good in the world, I know I speak for everybody when I say thank you so much.[2:01:20] Dr. Gina Poe: Thank you so much, Andrew. Thank you for being an amazing interviewer. You brought a lot out of me in a coherent form fashion that normally I can't do when I'm speaking in public.[2:01:29] Andrew Huberman: I don't know about that. I've heard your lectures, and they're superb. We'll direct people to some of the other ones.[2:01:33] Dr. Gina Poe: Well, thank you. And I also wanna put a plug in for graduate Students in general in a key and amazing role that they play in research. I I'm a PI, as you said. I used to be a graduate student and a Doc, trainee, myself doing all of this on the ground, hands on experimentation, it's so hard to do. It's so hard to do right.[2:01:52] Dr. Gina Poe: It's so hard to think through all of that. Now I'm a PI. I get to be an idea person and just say, hey. Why don't you do this? And, hey.[2:01:59] Dr. Gina Poe: You know, what do you think about that? And they, of course, intellectually contribute so much to these, these planned experiments, but they also do the really hard work. And so I just wanna say Thank you, graduate students. Thank you to my graduate students and all graduate students out there. Thank you,[2:02:17] Andrew Huberman: all stats. Underpaid and and and listen. And to the major institutions, Stanford, UCLA, and all other major institutions, pay them more, please.[2:02:24] Dr. Gina Poe: Yes.[2:02:25] Andrew Huberman: We need them, and they need to have a standard of living. Yes. Not I'm not afraid to say that despite my primary employer. Pay them more. They need it.[2:02:32] Andrew Huberman: They deserve it.[2:02:32] Dr. Gina Poe: They deserve it. Absolutely. Great.[2:02:35] Andrew Huberman: Well, we will Absolutely have you back again if you'll if you'll be willing. And, meanwhile, we will direct people to where they can learn more about you and your exciting work, and once again, thanks so much.[2:02:45] Dr. Gina Poe: Thank you so much.[2:02:46] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me today for my discussion about sleep, mental health, physical health, and performance with doctor Gina Poe. I hope you found it to be as informative and as actionable as I did. In fact, I'm already implementing the regularity of bedtime plus or minus half an hour In order to get that growth hormone released, and I can already see both my sleep scores improving and my feelings of daytime vigor and focus and other markers of sleep health improving as well.
