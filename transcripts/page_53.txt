I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor David Berson, Professor of medical science, neurobiology, and ophthalmology at Brown University. Doctor Berson's laboratory is credited with discovering the cells in the eye that set your circadian rhythms. These are the so called intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells.[0:00:31] Andrew Huberman: And while that's a mouthful, All you need to know for sake of this introduction is that those are the cells that inform your brain and body about the time of day. Doctor Berson's laboratory has also made a number of other important discoveries about how we convert our perceptions of the outside world into motor action. More personally, doctor Berson has been my go to resource for all things neuroscience for nearly 2 decades. I knew of his reputation as a spectacular The researcher for a long period of time, and then many years ago, I cold called him out of the blue. I, basically corralled him into a long conversation over the phone after He invited me out to Brown, and we've been discussing neuroscience and how the brain works and the emerging new technologies and the emerging new concepts in neuroscience for a very long time now.[0:01:21] Andrew Huberman: You're going to realize today why doctor Berson is my go to source. He has an exceptionally Clear and organized view of how the nervous system works. You know, there are many, many parts of the nervous system, different nuclei and connections and circuits in chemicals and so forth, but it takes a special kind of person to be able to organize that information into a structured and logical framework that can allow us to make sense of how we function in terms of what we feel, what we experience, how we move through the world. Doctor Berson is truly one of a kind in his ability to synthesize and organize and communicate that information, and I give him credit as one of my mentors and one of the people that I respect most in the field of science and medical science generally. Today, doctor Berson takes us on a journey From the periphery of the nervous system, meaning from the outside, deep into the nervous system layer by layer, structure by structure, circuit by circuit, Making clear to us how each of these individual circuits work and how they work together as a whole.[0:02:22] Andrew Huberman: It's a really magnificent description that You simply cannot get from any textbook, from any popular book, and frankly, as far as I know, from any podcast that currently exists out there. So it's a real gift to have this opportunity to learn from doctor Berson. Again, I consider him my mentor in the field of learning and Teaching neuroscience, and I'm excited for you to learn from him. One thing is for certain, by the end of this podcast, you will know far more about how your nervous system works than the vast majority of people out there, including many expert biologists and neuroscientists. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this CAST is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:03:00] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens every day since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.[0:03:23] Andrew Huberman: The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that it covers all of my vitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs. Nowadays, there's a lot of data out there pointing to the fact that a healthy gut microbiome, literally little microbes that live in our gut that are good for us, is important to support Our immune system, our nervous system, our endocrine system, and various aspects of our immediate and long term health. With Athletic Greens, I get all the vitamins and minerals that I need, plus The probiotics ensure a healthy gut microbiome. It also tastes really good. I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice.[0:03:56] Andrew Huberman: I'll have that Early in the day and sometimes a 2nd time later in the day as well. It's compatible with intermittent fasting. It's compatible with vegan diets, with, Keto diets and essentially every diet that you could possibly imagine out there. It's also filled with adaptogens for recovery. It has digestive enzymes for gut health and has a number of other that support the immune system.[0:04:17] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin d three supports a huge number of metabolic factors, immune system factors, endocrine factors. Basically, we need vitamin d 3. We can get it from the sun, but many people are deficient in vitamin d 3 even if they are getting what they think is sufficient sunlight.[0:04:48] Andrew Huberman: And k two is important for cardiovascular health. So, again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you can claim their special offer, the 5 free travel packs plus the year supply of vitamin d three k two. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.[0:05:21] Andrew Huberman: And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, can also get information about how your specific genes are impacting your immediate and long term health. Now a problem with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back, but you don't know what to do with those numbers. With InsideTracker, they make it very simple to figure out what to do to bring those numbers into the ranges that are right For you, they have a dashboard that's very easy to use. You can see the numbers from your blood and or DNA tests, and it will point to specific Lifestyle factors, nutritional factors, as well as supplementation, maybe even prescription factors that would be right for you to bring the numbers into range that are ideal for your immediate and long term health goals. Another feature that InsideTracker has is their inner age test.[0:06:03] Andrew Huberman: This test shows you what your biological age is and compares that to your chronological age and what you can do to improve your biological age, which, of course, is the important number. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, tracker. You can visit InsideTracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Also, an interview I did With Longevity research doctor and InsideTracker's founder, doctor Gil Blander, is out now on their podcast, the Longevity by Design podcast, and a link to that interview can be found in today's show notes. Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.[0:06:35] Andrew Huberman: Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, Grain free, keto friendly cereal. Now I don't follow a ketogenic diet. The way that I eat is basically geared toward feeling alert when I wanna be alert And feeling sleepy when I want to go to sleep, which for me means fasting until about 11 AM or noon most days, then I eat low carb during the day. I'll have some meter fisher chicken and some salad. That's what works for me.[0:06:57] Andrew Huberman: And in the afternoon, I remain on a more or less low carb ish diet. And then in the evening, I eat pastas and things primarily, and I throttle back on the protein, and that's what allows me to fall asleep at night. That's just what works for me. So if I want a snack in the afternoon, I want that to be a ketogenic or low carb snack. And that snack these days is magic spoon.[0:07:16] Andrew Huberman: Magic Spoon is really terrific. It has 0 grams of sugar, 13 to 14 grams of protein, and only 4 net grams of carbohydrates in each serving. It's really delicious. They have a number of different flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, and frosted. I particularly like frosted.[0:07:31] Andrew Huberman: It tastes like donuts, and I really like donuts, although I Try not to eat donuts too often, if ever. What I do lately is I take magic spoon. I put it in some Bulgarian yogurt, which is really good, and I mix that up. I put those in there, and sometimes I put some Cinnamon on them. And as I'm describing this, I'm getting hungry for Magic Spoon.[0:07:46] Andrew Huberman: So if you wanna try Magic Spoon, you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman get $5 off. And now for my discussion with doctor David Berson.[0:08:05] Dr. David Berson: Welcome. Thank you. Yeah. So nice to[0:08:07] Andrew Huberman: be here. Great to have you. For more than 20 years, you've been my go to source for all things nervous system, how it works, how it's structured. So today, I wanna ask you some questions about that. I think people would gain a lot of insight into this machine that makes them think and feel and see, etcetera.[0:08:28] Andrew Huberman: If you would, could you tell us how we see? You know, a photon of light enters the eye. What happens? Right. I mean, how is it that I look outside, I see a truck drive by, or I look on the wall, I see a photo of my dog?[0:08:45] Andrew Huberman: How does that work?[0:08:46] Dr. David Berson: Right. So this is an old question, obviously. And, clearly, in the end, the reason you have a visual experience is that your brain It's got some pattern of activity that dissociates with the input from the periphery, but you can have a visual experience with no input from the periphery as well. When you're dreaming, You're seeing things that aren't coming through your eyes. Are those memories?[0:09:09] Dr. David Berson: I would say in a sense, They may reflect your visual experience. They're not necessarily specific visual memories, but, of course, they can be. But the point is that the experience of seeing is actually a Brain phenomenon. But, of course, under normal circumstances, we see the world because we're looking at it, and we're using our eyes to look at it. And, fundamentally, when we're looking at the exterior world, it's what the retina is telling the brain that matters.[0:09:35] Dr. David Berson: So There are cells called ganglion cells. These are neurons that are the key cells for communicating between eye and brain. The eye is like the camera. It's detecting the initial image, doing some initial processing, and then that signal gets sent back to the brain proper. And, of course, It's there at the level of the cortex that we have this conscious visual experience.[0:09:56] Dr. David Berson: There are many other places in the brain that get visual input as well doing other things with that kind of information. So I I get a lot[0:10:03] Andrew Huberman: of questions about color vision. If you would, could you explain how is it that we can perceive reds and greens and blues and things of that sort.[0:10:13] Dr. David Berson: Right. So the first thing to understand about light is that it's just a form of electromagnetic radiation. It's vibrating. It's oscillating. But when say[0:10:24] Andrew Huberman: it's vibrating, it's oscillating. You mean that photons are actually[0:10:27] Dr. David Berson: moving? Well, in a sense, photons are they're certainly moving through space. We think about photons as particles, and that's one way of thinking about light, but we can also think of it as a wave, like a radio wave. Either way is acceptable, and the radio waves have frequencies like the frequencies on the your radio dial. And certain frequencies in the electromagnetic Spectrum can be detected by neurons in the retina.[0:10:50] Dr. David Berson: Those are the things we see, but there's still different wavelengths within the light that can be seen by the eye. And those different wavelengths are unpacked in a sense or decoded by the nervous system to lead to our experience of color. Essentially, different wavelengths give us the sensation of different colors through the auspices of different Neurons that are tuned to different wavelengths of light.[0:11:17] Andrew Huberman: So when, a photon so when a little bit of light hits my eye Right. Goes in, The photoreceptors convert that into electrical signal.[0:11:26] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:11:27] Andrew Huberman: How is it that a given photon of light gives me the perception eventually leads the perception of red versus green versus blue.[0:11:35] Dr. David Berson: Right. So, if you imagine that In the 1st layer of the retina where this transformation occurs from electromagnetic radiation into neural signals, That you have different kinds of sensitive cells that are expressing they're making different molecules within themselves for this express purpose of absorbing photons, which is the first step in the process of seeing. Now it turns out that altogether, there are about Five proteins like this that we need to think about in the typical retina. But for seeing color, really, it's 3 of them. So there are 3 different proteins.[0:12:13] Dr. David Berson: Each absorbs light With a different, you know, preferred frequency, and then the nervous system keeps track of those signals, comparison, contrast them to extract some understanding of the wavelength composition of light. So you can see just by looking at a landscape, Oh, it must be late in the day because things are looking golden. That's all, you know, a function of our absorbing The light that's coming from the the world and interpreting that with our brain because of the different composition of the the the light that's reaching our eyes.[0:12:45] Andrew Huberman: Is it fair to assume that my perception of red is the same as your perception of red?[0:12:50] Dr. David Berson: Well, that's a great question.[0:12:51] Andrew Huberman: And that mine is better. No. I'm just I'm just kidding.[0:12:55] Dr. David Berson: It's a great question. It's a deep philosophical question. It's a question that really probably can't even ultimately be answered, by the usual empirical scientific Processes because it's really about, you know, an individual's experience. What we can say is that the Biological mechanisms that we think are important for seeing color, for example, seem to be very highly similar from 1 individual to the next, whether it be human beings or other animals. And so we think that the physiological process looks very similar on the front end.[0:13:29] Dr. David Berson: But, know, once you're at the level of perception or understanding or experience, that's something that's a little bit tougher to nail down with the The sorts of,[0:13:40] Andrew Huberman: you know, scientific approaches that we approach biological vision, let's say. You mentioned that there are five Different cone types, essentially, cones being the cells that absorb light of different wavelengths. I often wondered when I had my dog, what he saw and how his vision differs from our vision, and, certainly, there are animals that can see things that we can't see. Right. Are some of the more outrageous examples of that?[0:14:09] Andrew Huberman: I've seen things in the And in the extreme Right. You know, Dogs, I'm I'm guessing see reds more as oranges. Is that right? Because they they don't have these the same array of of neurons that we have for Foreseeing color. Right.[0:14:23] Dr. David Berson: So the first thing is it's not really 5 types of cones. There are really 3 types of cones. And if you look at the way that Color vision is thought to work. You can sort of see that it has to be 3 different signals. There are a couple of other types of pigments.[0:14:37] Dr. David Berson: One is really mostly for Dim light vision when you're walking around in a moonless night and you're seeing things, with very low light. That's the rod cell that uses its own pigment. And then there's another class of pigments we'll probably talk about a little bit later, the melanopsin pigment.[0:14:54] Andrew Huberman: I thought you were referring to, like, ultraviolet and infrared and and things of that sort.[0:14:58] Dr. David Berson: Right. So in the case of a typical, well, let's put it this way. In in human beings, most of us have 3 cone types, and we can see Colors that we that that stem from that. In most mammals, including your dog, or your cat, There really are only 2 cone types, and that limits the kind of vision that they can have in the domain of wavelength or color as you would say. So, really, a dog sees the world kind of like a particular kind of color blind human might see the world because instead of having 3 channels to compare and contrast, they only have channels, and that makes it much more difficult to figure out exactly which wavelength you're you're looking at.[0:15:40] Andrew Huberman: Do, color blind people suffer much as a consequence of being color blind?[0:15:44] Dr. David Berson: Well, you know, we're it's it's like so many other disabilities. We are, you know, the the the world is built for people Of the most common type. So in some cases, the expectation can be there that Somebody can see something that they won't be able to if they're missing one of their cone types, let's say. So in those moments, that can be a real problem. You know, if there's a lack of contrast to their visual system, they will be blind to that.[0:16:13] Dr. David Berson: In general, it's a fairly modest, visual, limitation as things go. You know? For example, if not being able to see acutely can be much more damaging, not being able to read, you know, fine print, example[0:16:26] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I suppose if I had to give up, the ability to see certain colors or give up the ability to see clearly, I'd certainly Trade out color for clarity.[0:16:37] Dr. David Berson: Right. Of course, color is very meaningful to us as human beings. You know? So we would hate to give it up. But, obviously, dogs and cats and all kinds of other mammals do perfectly well in the world.[0:16:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Because we take care of them. I spend most of my time taking care of that dog. He took care of me too. Let's talk about the that odd Photopigment.[0:17:00] Andrew Huberman: Photopigment, of course, being the thing that absorbs light of a particular wavelength. And let's talk about these specialized Ganglion cells that communicate certain types of information from eye to the brain that are so important for so many things. What I'm referring to here, of course, is your co discovery of the so called intrinsically photosensitive Cells, the neurons in the eye that do so many of the things that don't actually have to do with perception, but have to do with important biological functions. What I would love for you to do is, explain to me why once I heard you say we have a bit of fly eye in our eye. Yeah.[0:17:38] Andrew Huberman: And you showed this Slide of, like, a giant fly from a horror movie Yeah. Trying to attack this woman. Yeah. And Maybe it was an eye also. So what does it mean that we have a bit of a fly eye in our eye?[0:17:54] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. So this is this last pigment is a really peculiar one. One can think about it as really the initial sensitive element in a system that's designed to tell your brain about how bright things are in your world. And the thing that's really peculiar about this pigment is that it's in the wrong place in a sense. When you think about the structure of the retina, you think about a layer cake, essentially.[0:18:22] Dr. David Berson: You've got this this thin membrane at the back of your eye, but it's actually a stack of thin layers. And the outermost of those layers is where these photoreceptors you were talking about earlier are sitting. That's where the film of your camera is, essentially. That's where the photons do their magic with the photo pigments and turn it into a neural signal. I like that.[0:18:39] Andrew Huberman: I've never really thought of the photoreceptors as the film of the camera, but that makes sense.[0:18:42] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. Or like the sensitive chip On, you know, CCD chip in your in your cell phone, it's the surface on which the light pattern is imaged by the optics of the eye, And now you've got an array of sensors that's capturing that information and creating a bitmap, essentially. But now it's in neural signals distributed across the of the the retina. So all of that was known to be going on a 150 years ago. A couple of types of photoreceptors, cones and rods.[0:19:10] Dr. David Berson: If you look a little bit more closely, 3 types of cones. That's where the transformation from electromagnetic radiation to, to neural signals was thought to take place, but it turns out that this last photo pigment is in the other End of the retina, the innermost part of the retina, that's where the so called ganglion cells are. Those are the cells that talk to the brain, the ones that actually can communicate directly What information comes to them from the photoreceptors? And here, you've got a case where, actually, some of the output neurons Though we didn't think had any business being directly sensitive to light, we're actually making this photo pigment, absorbing Light and converting that to neural signals and sending to the brain. So that made it pretty surprising and unexpected, but there are many Surprising things about these cells.[0:20:01] Dr. David Berson: So and what is the relationship to the fly eye? Right. So the the link there is that if you ask How the photo pigment now communicates downstream from the initial absorption event To get to the electrical signal, that's a complex cellular process. It involves many chemical steps. And if you look at how Photoreceptors in our eyes work.[0:20:26] Dr. David Berson: You can see what that cascade is, how that chain works. If you look in the eyes of Flies or other insects or other invertebrates is a very similar kind of chain that but the specifics of how the signals get from the absorption event by the pigment to the electrical response that the nervous system can understand are characteristically different between fuzzy, furry creatures like us and Insects, for example, like the fly. I see. So these funny extra photoreceptors that are in the wrong layer doing something completely different are actually using A chemical cascade that looks much more like what you would see in a fly photoreceptor than what you would see in a human photoreceptor, a rod or a cone, for example.[0:21:14] Andrew Huberman: So it sounds like it's a very primitive part of[0:21:17] Dr. David Berson: primitive aspect of biology that we maintain. Exactly right.[0:21:21] Andrew Huberman: You know, and despite the fact that dogs can't see as many colors as we can and cats can't see as many colors as we can, we have all this extravagant stuff for seeing color, and then you got this other pigment Sitting in the wrong not wrong, but in a different, part of the eye, sending processing light very differently Right. And Sending that information into the brain. So what do these cells do? I mean, presumably, they're there for a reason.[0:21:47] Dr. David Berson: They are. And the The interesting thing is that 1 cell type like this carrying one kind of signal, which I would call A brightness signal, essentially, can do many things in the brain.[0:22:02] Andrew Huberman: When you say brightness signal, you mean that it like, right now, I have these cell do I have these cells in mind? Of course not. I'm joking. I hope I have these cells in mind. And they're paying attention to how bright it is overall, but they're not paying attention, for instance, the edge of your ear or or what else is going on in the room?[0:22:16] Dr. David Berson: Right. So so it's the difference between knowing what the objects are on the table And knowing whether it's bright enough to be daylight right now. So what why does your nervous system need need to know whether it's daylight right now? Well, one thing that needs to know, that is your circadian clock. You know, if you travel across time zones to Europe, now your internal clock Thinks it's California time, but the rotation of the Earth is, you know, for, you know, a different part of the planet.[0:22:46] Dr. David Berson: The rising and setting of the sun is not at all what your body is anticipating. So you've got an internal representation of the rotation of the earth in your own brain. That's your circadian system. It's keeping time, but now you've played a trick on your nervous system. You put yourself in a different place where the sun is rising at the, quote, wrong time.[0:23:05] Dr. David Berson: Well, that's not good for you. Right? So you gotta get back on track. One of the things this system does is sends a, oh, it's daylight now signal to the brain, Which compares with its internal clock, and if that's not right, it tweaks the clock gradually until you get over your jet lag and you feel back on track again. So the jet lag case makes[0:23:25] Andrew Huberman: a lot of sense to me, but, presumably, these, elements didn't evolve for jet lag. Right. So what What what are they doing on a day to day basis?[0:23:35] Dr. David Berson: Right. Well, one way to think about this is that the clock that you have in not just your brain, In all the cells before almost all of the cells of your body, they're all oscillating. They're all, you know They got little clocks, and then clocks in them themselves. They're all they're all clocks. You know, they need to be synchronized appropriately, And the whole thing has to be built in biological machinery.[0:24:04] Dr. David Berson: This is actually a beautiful story about how gene expression Can control gene expression. And if you set it upright, you can set up a little thing that just sort of hums along at a particular frequency. In our case, it's humming along at 24 hours because that's how our earth rotates, and it's all built into our biology. So this is great, but the reality is that the clock can only be so good. Mean, we're talking about biology here.[0:24:29] Dr. David Berson: It's not precision engineering, and so[0:24:32] Andrew Huberman: it can be a little bit off. Well, also, it doesn't it's in our brain, so it doesn't have access to any Regular, unerring signal.[0:24:39] Dr. David Berson: Well, if in the absence of the rising and setting of the sun, it does it. If you put someone in a cave, Their biological clock will keep time to within a handful of minutes of 24 hours. That's no problem for one day. But if this went on without any correction, eventually, you'd be out of phase. And this is actually one of the things that blind patients often Complain about if they've got retinal blindness is insomnia and,[0:25:08] Andrew Huberman: or sleep apnea. The night. Exactly.[0:25:10] Dr. David Berson: They're not synchronized. Their clock is there, but they're drifting out of phase because their clock's only good to, you know, 24.2 hours or 23.8 hours. Little by little, they're drifting, so you need a synchronization signal. So even if you never cross time zones, and, of course, we didn't back on the Savannah. We stayed within walking distance of where we were.[0:25:34] Dr. David Berson: You still need a synchronizer because, otherwise, you have nothing to actually confirm when the rising and the setting of the sun is, that's what you're trying to synchronize yourself to.[0:25:44] Andrew Huberman: I'm fascinated by the circadian clock and The fact that all the cells of our body have essentially a 24 hour ish clock in them. Right. We hear a lot about these circadian rhythms and circadian clocks. The fact that We need light input from these special neurons in order to set the clock, but I've never really heard it described how the clock itself works and how the clock Signals to all the rest of the body when, you know, the liver should be doing one thing and when the stomach should be doing another. I know you've done some work on the clock.[0:26:18] Andrew Huberman: So if you would just maybe briefly describe where the clock is, What it does and some of the, you know, top contour of how it tells the cells of the body what to do.[0:26:29] Dr. David Berson: Right. So the first thing to say is that, as you said, the clock is all over the place. Most of the tissues in your body have clocks.[0:26:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We probably have, what, millions of clocks[0:26:39] Dr. David Berson: in our I would say that's that's probably fair. You have millions of cell types. You might may have millions of claws. Is to coordinate all of these. And this is, there's a little nucleus, a little collection of nerve cells in your brain.[0:26:59] Dr. David Berson: It's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the SCN, and it is sitting in a funny place for the rest of the structures in the nervous system that get Direct retinal input is sitting in the hypothalamus, which you can think about as sort of the great coordinator of[0:27:17] Andrew Huberman: Drives and The source of all our pleasures and all our problems Right. Or most our problems.[0:27:22] Dr. David Berson: Yes. It really is. But it's sort of, you know, deep in your brain, things that drive you to do things. If you're freezing cold, you put on a coat, you you you shiver. All these things are coordinated by the hypothalamus.[0:27:34] Dr. David Berson: So this pathway that we're talking about from the retina and from these peculiar cells that are encoding light intensity We're sending signals directly into a center that's surrounded by all of these centers that control autonomic nervous system And, your hormonal systems. So this is a part of the your your visual system that doesn't really reach the level of consciousness. It's It's not something you you think about. It's happening under the radar kind of all the time, and the signal is working its way into the this Central clock coordinating center. Now what happens then is not that well understood, But it's clear that this is a neural center that has the same ability to communicate with other parts of your brain as any other neural center.[0:28:25] Dr. David Berson: And, clearly, there are Circuits that involve connections between neurons that, you know, are are conventional, But in addition, it's quite clear that there are also sort of humoral effects that things are being are oozing out of the cells, in the center and maybe into the circulation or or just, diffusing through the brain to some extent that can also affect, neurons elsewhere. But The hypothalamus uses everything to control the rest of the body, and that's true of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, this this circadian center as well. It it can get its fingers into the autonomic nervous system, the the humeral system, and, of course, up to the centers of the brain that Organized coordinated rational behavior. So if I understand correctly, we have this group of cells, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. It's got a 24 hour rhythm, it that rhythm is more or[0:29:20] Andrew Huberman: less matched to what's going on in our external world by the specialized set of neurons in our eye. But then the the master clock itself, the SCN, releases things in the blood humoral signals, that go out various places in the body. And they said to the autonomic system, which is regulating more or less how alert or calm we are, as well as our thinking and our cognition. So the I'd love to talk to you about the autonomic part. Presumably, that's through Melatonin, it's through, adrenaline.[0:29:55] Andrew Huberman: How how is it that that, this clock is impacting how, the autonomic system, how alert or calm we we feel. Right.[0:30:02] Dr. David Berson: So there there are pathways by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus can access With the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. Just so people know, the sympathetic nervous system is the[0:30:14] Andrew Huberman: one that tends to make us more alert, and the Parasympathetic nervous system is the portion of the autonomic nervous system makes us feel more calm Right. In in broad To first, yeah,[0:30:24] Dr. David Berson: to first approximation. Right. So this is both of these systems are within the grasp of the circadian system through hypothalamic circuits. One of the circuits that will be, I think, of particular interest to some of your listeners is a pathway that involves this Sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, the fight or flight system, that is actually through a very circuitous route Innervating the pineal gland, which is sitting in the middle of your brain.[0:30:55] Andrew Huberman: The so called third eye. Right.[0:30:57] Dr. David Berson: So this is We'll have to[0:30:58] Andrew Huberman: get back to why it's called the 3rd eye because yeah.[0:31:01] Dr. David Berson: That's an interesting You[0:31:02] Andrew Huberman: can't call something the 3rd eye and not and just, you know Just leave it there. Just leave it there. Right. Right.[0:31:08] Dr. David Berson: Anyway, this is the major source of melatonin in your body.[0:31:11] Andrew Huberman: So light comes into my eye Yes. Passed off to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, essentially, not the light itself, but the the signal representing the light.[0:31:21] Dr. David Berson: Sure.[0:31:21] Andrew Huberman: Then the CN, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, can impact the melatonin system Right. Via the pineal.[0:31:28] Dr. David Berson: Right. The way this is seen is that if you were to measure your melatonin level over the course of the day, if you could do this, you know, Hour by hour, you'd see that it's really low during the day, very high at night. But if you get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom and turn on the Bright fluorescent light. Your melatonin level is slammed to the floor. Light is directly impacting your hormonal levels, through this mechanism that we just described.[0:31:57] Dr. David Berson: So this is one of the routes by which light can act on your Hormonal status through pathways that are completely beyond what you normally would think about. Right? You're thinking about this the things in the bathroom. Oh, there's the toothbrush. You know, there's the tube of toothpaste.[0:32:13] Dr. David Berson: But meanwhile, this other system is just counting photons and saying, oh, wow. There's a lot of Photons right now, let's shut down the melatonin release.[0:32:22] Andrew Huberman: This is one of the main reasons why I've encouraged people to avoid bright light exposure in the middle of the night, Not just blue light, but bright light of any wavelength. Because there's this myth out there that blue light, because it's the Optimal signal for activating this pathway and shutting down melatonin is the only wavelength of light that can shut it down. But Am I correct in thinking that if a light is bright enough Right. It doesn't matter if it's blue light, green light, purple light, even red light Right. You're going to slam melatonin down to the ground, which is not a good thing to happen in the middle of the night.[0:32:57] Andrew Huberman: Right. Correct? Right.[0:32:59] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. I mean, any any light will affect the system to some extent. The blue light is somewhat more effective, But don't fool yourself to in into thinking that if you use red light, that means you're, you know, you're avoiding the effect. You it's certainly still there. And, certainly, if it's very bright, it'll be more effective in driving the system than dim blue light would be.[0:33:20] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. A lot of people wear blue blockers. Right. And In a kind of odd twist of misinformation out there, a lot of people wear blue blockers during the middle of the day Right. Which Basically makes no sense because during the middle of the day is when you wanna get a lot of bright light and including blue light into your eyes.[0:33:38] Andrew Huberman: Correct? Absolutely. And not[0:33:40] Dr. David Berson: just for the reasons we've been talking about in terms of circadian effects. There are major effects of light on mood, and Seasonal affective disorder apparently is essentially a reflection of the same system in reverse. If you're Living in the northern climes and, you know, you're not getting that much light during the middle of the the winter in Stockholm, you might be prone to depression, and phototherapy might be just the ticket for you, and that's because there's a direct effect of light on mood. There's there's an example where if you don't have enough light, it's a problem. So I think you're exactly right.[0:34:18] Dr. David Berson: It's not about is light good or bad for you. It's about what kind of light and when, that that makes the difference.[0:34:25] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The general rule of thumb that I've been living by is to get as much bright light in my eyes, ideally from sunlight, Anytime I wanna be alert Right. And doing exactly the opposite when I want to be asleep Yeah. Or getting drowsy.[0:34:37] Dr. David Berson: And and there there are aspects of this that that Spin out way beyond the conversation we're having now to things like this. It turns out that the incidence of myopia. Nearsightedness. Nearsightedness, right, is strongly related to the amount of time that kids spend outdoors.[0:34:56] Andrew Huberman: In in what direction of effect?[0:34:57] Dr. David Berson: The more they spend time outdoors, the less nearsightedness they have. So this is all because[0:35:03] Andrew Huberman: they're viewing things at a distance or because they're a lot of blue light. This[0:35:06] Dr. David Berson: sunlight. It's a great question. It is not fully resolved what the epidemiological what the basis of that epidemiological finding is. One possibility is the amount of light which would make me think about this melanopsin system again, but it might very well be A question of accommodation that is the process by which you focus on near or far things. If you're never outdoors, everything is nearby.[0:35:28] Dr. David Berson: If you're outdoors, you're focusing far.[0:35:30] Andrew Huberman: So this is on your phone Right. Exactly. Which there's a tremendous amount of interest these days in, you know, watches and things that count steps. I'm beginning to realize that we should probably have a device that can count photons during the day Right. And can also count photons at night and tell us, hey.[0:35:48] Andrew Huberman: You're getting too many photons. You're gonna shut down your melatonin at night, or you're not getting enough photons. Today, you didn't get enough bright light, whether or not it's from artificial light or from sunlight. The I guess the where would you put it? I guess you put it on the top of your head or you probably want it someplace outward facing.[0:36:02] Dr. David Berson: Right. Probably what you need is as Many photons over as much of the retina as possible to recruit as much of this system, you know, as possible. In thinking about other effects of this Non image forming pathway, that involves these special cells in[0:36:18] Andrew Huberman: the eye and the SCN. You had a paper a few years ago looking at Retinal input to an area of the brain, which has a fancy name, the perihabenula, but names don't necessarily matter, that had some important effects on mood and other aspects of of light. What maybe you could tell us a little bit about what is the perihabenula?[0:36:42] Dr. David Berson: Oh, wow. So, you know, that's a fancy term, but I think the way to think about this is is a chunk of the brain that is sitting As part of a bigger chunk that's really the linker between peripheral sensory input of all kinds, virtually all kinds, whether it's auditory input or tactile input, or visual input To the region of your brain, the cortex that allows you to think about these things and make plans around them and to integrate them and that that kind of thing. So, you know, we've known about a pathway that gets from the retina Through this sort of linker center, it's called the thalamus, and then on a Sunday station. Exactly. Standard pattern.[0:37:39] Dr. David Berson: You have sensory input coming from the periphery. You've got these peripheral elements that are are doing the initial stages of The the eye, the eye, the nose. Skin of your fingertips. Right? You know, the the taste buds on your tongue, they're taking this raw information in, and they're doing some preprocessing maybe or, you know, the early circuits are.[0:37:59] Dr. David Berson: But, eventually, most of these signals have to pass through the gateway to the cortex, which is in the thalamus. And we've known for years, for for decades, many decades, What the major throughput pathway from the retina to the cortex is and where it ends up. It ends up in the visual cortex. You know, you pat the back of your head. That's where the where the Receiving center is for the main pathway from retina to cortex.[0:38:23] Dr. David Berson: But wait a minute. There's more. There's this little pathway that goes to a different part of that linking thalamus center,[0:38:31] Andrew Huberman: the gateway to the cortex. Local train[0:38:33] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. From Grand Central to It's in a weird part of the neighborhood. Right? It's a it's a completely different it's it's like a little trunk line that branches off and goes out into the hinterlands, And it's going to the part of this linker center that's talking to a completely different part of cortex way upfront, frontal lobe, Which is much more involved in things like planning or, self image or[0:38:57] Andrew Huberman: Self image, literally, how one views oneself.[0:39:00] Dr. David Berson: And do you feel good about yourself, or, you know, what's your plan for next Thursday? You know, it's it's a it's a very high level center in the highest level of your nervous system, and this is the region that is getting input from this Pathway, which is mostly worked out in its function by Samir Hartara's lab. I know you had him on the podcast.[0:39:23] Andrew Huberman: We didn't talk about this pathway.[0:39:24] Dr. David Berson: This pathway at all. Right. So, Diego, Fernandez and and Samarin and the folks that work with them were able to show that this pathway doesn't just exist and get you to a weird place. But if you activate it at kind of the wrong time of day, Animals can become depressed. And if you silence it under the right circumstances, then weird lighting cycles that would normally make them Acts sort of depressed no longer have that effect.[0:39:57] Andrew Huberman: So it sounds to me like there's this pathway from I to This unusual train route through the structure we call the thalamus, then up to the front of the brain that relates to Things of self perception, kinda higher level functions. I I find that really interesting because most of what I think about when I think about these fancy well, or these Primitive, rather, neurons that don't pay attention to the shapes of things, but instead to brightness, I think of well, it regulates melatonin, circadian clock, Mood, hunger, the really kind of, vegetative stuff, if you will. Right. And this is interesting because I think a lot of people Experience depression, not just people that live at you know, in Scandinavia in the middle of winter, and we are Very much divorced from our normal interactions with light. It also makes me realize that these intrinsically photosensitive cells that set the clock, etcetera, are involved in a lot of things.[0:40:56] Andrew Huberman: I mean, they seem to regulate a dozen or more different basic functions. I wanna ask you about a different aspect of the visual system now, which is the one that relates to our sense of balance. So I I love boats, but I hate being on them. I love the ocean from shore because I get incredibly seasick. I'll just it's awful.[0:41:19] Andrew Huberman: I think I'm gonna get seasick if I think about it too much. And once I went on a boat trip, I came back, and I actually gots I got Motion sick or wasn't seasick because I went rafting. So there's a system that somehow gets messed up. They always tell us if you're feeling sick, to look at the horizon, etcetera, etcetera. Right.[0:41:37] Andrew Huberman: So what is the link between our visual system and our balance system, and why does it make us nauseous sometimes when the world is moving in a way that we're not accustomed to. Right. I realize this is a big question because it involves eye movement, etcetera.[0:41:51] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:41:51] Andrew Huberman: But let's Maybe just walk in at the simplest layers of vision, vestibular, so called balance system, And then maybe we can piece the system together for people so that they can understand. And then also we should give them some tools for adjusting their, nausea when their, when their vestibular system is out of whack.[0:42:12] Dr. David Berson: Cool. So, yeah, I mean, the the first thing to think about is that the vestibular system is, designed to allow you to see how you're or detect Since how you're moving in the world, through the world, it's a funny one because It's about your movement in relationship to the world in a sense, and yet it's sort of interoceptive in the sense that it is Really, in the end, sensing the movement of your own body.[0:42:45] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So interoception, we should probably delineate for people is when you're focusing on your internal state as opposed to something outside you. Right. But is it is it a it's a gravity sensing system.[0:42:55] Dr. David Berson: Well, it's partly a gravity sensing system in the in the sense that Gravity is a force that's acting on you as if you were moving through the world in the opposite direction.[0:43:06] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Now you gotta explain that. You gotta explain that one to me.[0:43:10] Dr. David Berson: Okay. So, basically, the idea is that, if we leave gravity aside, we're just sitting in in a in a car, In the passenger seat and the driver hits the accelerator and you start moving forward, you sense that. If your eyes were closed, you'd sense it. If your ears were plugged and your eyes were closed. You'd still know it.[0:43:31] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. Many people take off on[0:43:32] Andrew Huberman: the plane like this. They're dreading the flight, and they know when it's The plane is taking off. Sure.[0:43:37] Dr. David Berson: That's your vestibular system talking because anything that jostles you out of the current position you're in right now will be detected by The vestibular system pretty much. So this is a complicated system, but it's basically in your inner, you know, ear Very close to where you're hearing. They put it there. There's And I don't know who they is. Know.[0:43:58] Dr. David Berson: They're starting to ride to ride.[0:44:00] Andrew Huberman: I'm just kidding. This To steal our friend Russ Van Gelder's explanation, we weren't consulted the design phase, and no one is[0:44:06] Dr. David Berson: That's a great lie.[0:44:07] Andrew Huberman: That's that's a great lie. But it's interesting. It's in the ear.[0:44:11] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. Right? It's, Yeah. It's deep in there, and it's served by the same nerve, actually, It serves the hearing system. One way to think about it is both the hearing system and this distributor self motion sensing system are really detecting the signal in the same way.[0:44:29] Dr. David Berson: They're hairy cells, and they're excited.[0:44:32] Andrew Huberman: Hairy cells?[0:44:33] Dr. David Berson: Sort of. They got little cilia sticking up off the surfaces. And depending on which way you bend those, the cells will either be inhibited or excited. They're not even neurons, but then they talk to neurons with a neuron like Processing, off you go. Now you've got an auditory signal.[0:44:47] Dr. David Berson: If you're sensing things bouncing around in your cochlea, which is[0:44:52] Andrew Huberman: You always[0:44:53] Dr. David Berson: Sympathetically, the bouncing of your eardrum, which is in sympathetically the sound waves in the world. But in the case of the vestibular apparatus, Evolution has built a system that detects the motion of, say, fluid going by those hairs. And if you put a a sensor like that in a Tube that's fluid filled, now you've got a sensor that will be activated when you rotate that tube Around the axis that passes through the middle of it, those, you know, who are just listening won't won't be able to install it. Says.[0:45:23] Andrew Huberman: I I always think of it as 3 hula hoops.[0:45:25] Dr. David Berson: Right. Three hulosomes.[0:45:26] Andrew Huberman: Standing up, 1 lying down on the ground Right.[0:45:28] Dr. David Berson: That you know The other one. And one the other way. Three three directions. Yeah. You know, the people who fly will talk But roll, pitch, and yaw, that kind of thing.[0:45:35] Dr. David Berson: So 3 axes of encoding just like in the cones[0:45:40] Andrew Huberman: of the retina. The no. No. And then I always say it's and then the puppy head tilt.[0:45:44] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. The puppy head tilt. Yeah. That's that's the the other one. So the the point is that your your brain is eventually going to be able to Hack, what these sensors are telling you about how you just rotated your head in very much the way that the 3 types of cones we were talking about before are reading the incoming photons in the wavelength domain differently.[0:46:06] Dr. David Berson: And if you think you could yeah. You think gray and truss, you get red, green, Blue. So it's it's same basic idea. If you have 3 sensors and you array them properly, now you can tell if you're rotating your head left or right, up or down. That's The sensory signal coming back into your brain confirming that you've just made a movement that you will.[0:46:26] Dr. David Berson: But what about on[0:46:27] Andrew Huberman: the plane? Because when I'm on the plane, I'm completely stationary. The plane's moving Right. But my head hasn't moved. Right.[0:46:32] Andrew Huberman: So I'm just moving forward. Gravity is constant. Exactly.[0:46:36] Dr. David Berson: How do[0:46:36] Andrew Huberman: how do I know I'm accelerating?[0:46:37] Dr. David Berson: So what's happening now is your brain is sensing the motion, and the The brain is smart enough also to to ask itself, did I will that movement, or did that come from the outside? Now in terms of sort of understanding what the the distributor signal means, it's gotta be embedded in the context of what you tried to do or what your other sensory's, systems are telling you about what's happening[0:47:02] Andrew Huberman: right now. So, it's very interesting. I but it's not conscious. Or at least if it's conscious, it's very it not conscious. It's it's It's definitely very fast.[0:47:11] Andrew Huberman: Right? The moment that plane starts moving, I know that I didn't get up out of my chair and run forward.[0:47:15] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:47:15] Andrew Huberman: But I'm not really thinking about getting up out of my chair. I just know.[0:47:19] Dr. David Berson: I guess the way I think about it is that the nervous system is, quote, aware at many levels. When it gets all the way up to the cortex and we're thinking about it, you're talking about it, you know, that's cortical. But the the lower levels of the brain that don't require you to actually actively think about it, they're just doing their thing, are also made aware. Right? A lot of this is happening under the surface of what you're thinking.[0:47:47] Dr. David Berson: These are reflexes.[0:47:48] Andrew Huberman: K. So we've got this gravity sensing system right, for I'm nodding for those that are listening for a yes Movement of the head and no movement of the head or the tilting of the head from side to side.[0:48:02] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:48:03] Andrew Huberman: And then you said that knowledge about whether or not Activation of that system comes from my own movements or something acting upon me, like the plane moving Right. Has to be combined with other signals. And so how is the visual information or information about the visual world combined with balance information? Right.[0:48:23] Dr. David Berson: So, Yeah. I mean, I guess maybe the best way to think about how these 2 systems work together is to think about what happens when you suddenly rotate your head to the left. When you suddenly rotate your head to the left, your eyes are actually rotating to the right automatically. You you do this in complete darkness. If you had an eye infrared camera and watched yourself in complete darkness, you can't see anything.[0:48:49] Dr. David Berson: You're rotating your head to the left. Your eyes would rotate to the right. That's your vestibular system saying it's I'm gonna try to compensate For the head rotation, so my eyes are still looking in the same place. Why is that useful? Well, if it's always doing that, Then the image of the world on your retina will be pretty stable most of the time, and that actually helps vision.[0:49:14] Andrew Huberman: Have they built this into cameras for, Image stabilization. Because when I move, when I take a picture with my phone, it's blurry. It's not it's not clear.[0:49:22] Dr. David Berson: Well, actually, you know, you might wanna get a better phone because now what they have is software in the better apps that will do a kind of image stabilization post hoc by doing a registration of the images that are bouncing around. Say this the edge of the house was here. Mhmm. So let's get that aligned in each of your images. So you may not be aware if you're using a good new phone That if you walk around a a landscape and hold your phone that, you know, there's all this image stabilization going on.[0:49:52] Dr. David Berson: But it's built into Standard cinematic, you know, technology now. Because if you tried to do a handheld camera, things would be bouncing around. Things would be unwatchable. You wouldn't be able to really understand what's going on in the scene. So the the brain works really hard to mostly stabilize the image of the world your retina, now, of course, you're moving through the world, so you can't stabilize everything.[0:50:14] Dr. David Berson: But the more you can stabilize most of the time, the better you can see. And that's why when we're scanning a scene, looking around at things, we're making very rapid eye movements for very short periods of time, and then we just Rest. But we're not the only ones that do that. If you ever watch a hummingbird, it does exactly the same thing in a feeder. Right?[0:50:35] Dr. David Berson: So it is with its body. Jolting. It's gonna make a quick movement, And then it's gonna be stable. And when you watch a pigeon walking on the sidewalk, it does this funny head bobbing thing. But what it's really doing is racking its Head back on its neck while its body goes forward so that the image of the visual world stays static.[0:50:54] Andrew Huberman: Is that why they're doing Ellis?[0:50:56] Dr. David Berson: And you you've seen the funny chicken videos on YouTube. Right? You've taken chicken, move it up and down in its face in one place. It's all the same thing. All of these animals are trying hard to keep the image of the world stable on their retina as much of the time as they possibly can.[0:51:10] Dr. David Berson: And then when they've gotta move, make it fast, Make it quick, and then stabilize again.[0:51:15] Andrew Huberman: That's why the pigeons have their head back?[0:51:16] Dr. David Berson: It is. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I mean, if you[0:51:20] Andrew Huberman: I just need to pause there for a second and digest that. Amazing. In case people aren't, well, there's no reason why people would what we're doing here, but, essentially, what we're doing is we're building up from sensory, you know, light onto the eye, make color, to what the brain does with that, The the integration of that, you know, circadian clock, melatonin, etcetera. Now what we're doing is we're talking about multisensory or multimodal combining one sense vision with another sense, balance. Right.[0:51:50] Andrew Huberman: And it turns out that pigeons know more about this than I do because pigeons know to keep their head back as they walk forward. Right. Alright. So that gets us to this issue of motion sickness. Right.[0:52:02] Andrew Huberman: And if you don't have to go out on a boat. Anytime I go to New York, I sit in an Uber or in a cab in the back, and if I'm looking at my phone while the car is driving, I feel Nauseous by time I arrive at my destination. Right. I always try and look out the front of the windshield because I'm told that helps, but it's a little tiny window.[0:52:22] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:52:22] Andrew Huberman: And I end up feeling slightly less sick if I do that. So what's going on with the vision and the balance system that causes a kind of a nausea. And, actually, if I keep talking about this, it probably will get sick. I don't throw up easily, but, But for some reason, motion sickness is a is a real thing for me.[0:52:42] Dr. David Berson: It's a problem for a lot of people. I I mean, I think the the fundamental problem typically when you get motion sick is What they call visual vestibular conflict. That is you have 2 sensory systems that are talking to your brain about how you're moving through the world. And as long as they agree, you're fine. So if you're driving, you know, your body Senses that you're moving forward, your vestibular systems, you know, is is picking up this acceleration of the car, And your visual system is seeing the consequences of forward motion in the sweeping of the scene past you.[0:53:19] Dr. David Berson: Everything is honky dory. Right? No problem. But when you are headed forward, but you're looking at your cell phone, what is your retina seeing? Your retina is seeing the stable image of the Screen, there's absolutely no motion in that Or the motion is[0:53:34] Andrew Huberman: just or some other motion[0:53:35] Dr. David Berson: that can move you or not. If you're playing a game or you're watching a video, a football game. You know, the motion is uncoupled with what's actually happening to your body. Your brain doesn't like that. Your brain likes everything to be, You know, aligned.[0:53:48] Dr. David Berson: And if it's not, it's gonna complain to you.[0:53:50] Andrew Huberman: By making me feel nauseous.[0:53:51] Dr. David Berson: Feel nauseous, and maybe you'll change your behavior. So you're getting I'm getting punished. Yeah. For for for for setting it up so you're signals slow. Click.[0:53:59] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:53:59] Andrew Huberman: By the vestibular You'll learn. Visuals in time. I love it. I love the idea of of reward signals, and we've done a lot of, discussion about this on this podcast of things like dopamine reward and things, but also punishment signals. And, I I love this example.[0:54:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, maybe marching a little bit further along this pathway, visual input is combined with Balance input, where does that occur? And maybe because I have some hint of where it occurs. You could tell us a little bit about this, kinda mysterious little mini brain, that they call the cerebellum. Cerebellum.[0:54:39] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. So, you know, the way I tried to describe the cerebellum to my students is that it serves sort of like The air traffic control system functions in air travel so that it's a system that's very complicated and is Really dependent on great information. So it's taking in information about everything that's happening everywhere, not only through your sensory systems, But it's listening in to all the little centers elsewhere in your brain that are computing what you're gonna be doing next and so forth. So it's just ravenous for that kind of information.[0:55:15] Andrew Huberman: So it really is like a Little mini brain.[0:55:17] Dr. David Berson: It is. It's it's it's got access to all of the signals, and it really has an important role in con in in Coordinating and shaping movements. But, you know, if you suddenly eliminated the air traffic control system, Planes could still take off and land, but you might have some unhappy accidents in the in the process. So the cerebellum is kinda like that. It's not that you would be paralyzed if your cerebellum was gone because you still have motor neurons.[0:55:51] Dr. David Berson: You still have ways to talk to your muscles. You still have reflex centers, and it's not like you would have any sensory loss because you still have your cortex getting all of those beautiful signals that you can think about, but you wouldn't be coordinating things so well anymore. The timing between input and output might be off. Or if you were trying to practice a new athletic move like an overhead serve in tennis, you'd You'd be just terrible at learning, but the all of the sequences of muscle movements and the feedback from your sensory apparatus that would let you really Hit that ball exactly where you wanted to after the nth rep. Right now, the thousandth rep or something, you get much better at it.[0:56:35] Dr. David Berson: So the cerebellum is all involved in things like motor learning and refining the precisions of of movement so that they get you where you wanna go. If you reach for a glass of champagne, then you don't knock it over or stop short. You know, that's what he's good at.[0:56:54] Andrew Huberman: People who have selective damage to the cerebellum. Absolutely. And and what, like, I'm familiar with, Well, Korsakoff's is is different. Right? Isn't that a b vitamin deficiency from in chronic alcoholics?[0:57:07] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:57:07] Andrew Huberman: And they have a they tend to walk Kinda bow legged, and they can't coordinate their movements. Is that, that has some that memory bodies, but also cerebellum?[0:57:16] Dr. David Berson: I'm not sure about the cerebellar involvement there, But, you know, the the typical thing would be, a patient who has a cerebral or stroke or a tumor, for example, might be, not that steady on their feet. You know, if if the, You know, dynamics of the situation you're standing on a on a street car with your with no hit no pole to hold on to. They might not be as good at adjusting all of the little Movements of the car, you know, there's a kind of tremor that can occur as they're reaching for things, because they'll they reach a little too far and then they overcorrect and come back, things like that. So it's it's Very common neurological, phenomenon, actually. Cerebellar ataxia is is what the neurologists call it, and it can happen not just with cerebellar damage, but damage to the tracks that feed the information into the cerebellum or properly.[0:58:12] Dr. David Berson: Structure. Exactly. Or output from the cerebellum.[0:58:15] Andrew Huberman: And so the cerebellum is where a lot of visual and and balance information is combined.[0:58:19] Dr. David Berson: In a very key place in the cerebellum, which is, It's really one of the oldest parts in terms of evolution, the the flocculus. Right. This is a it's a critical place in the Cerebellum where visual and distributor information comes together for recording just the kinds of movements we were talking about, this image stabilizing Network is all happening there, and there's learning happening there as well so that if your vestibular apparatus is a little bit Damaged somehow. Your visual system is actually talking to your cerebellum saying there's a problem here. There's an error, And your cerebellum is learning to do better by increasing the output of the vestibular system to compensate for whatever that loss was.[0:59:03] Dr. David Berson: So it's a little error correction system that's sort of typical of the cerebellar function, and it can happen in many, many different domains. This is just one of the domains of motor integration that, it explains there.[0:59:16] Andrew Huberman: So I should stay off my phone in the Ubers. If I'm on a boat, I should essentially Look and, as much as possible, act as if I'm driving the the machine.[0:59:25] Dr. David Berson: Right.[0:59:26] Andrew Huberman: That'd be weird if I was in the passenger seat pretending I was driving the machine, but I do always feel better if I'm in the front seat passenger.[0:59:32] Dr. David Berson: Right. Some more of the of the visual world that you can see as if you were actually the one doing the motion, I would think.[0:59:39] Andrew Huberman: Let's stay in the inner ear for a minute as we continue to march around the nervous system. When you take off in the plane or when you land or sometimes in the middle of the air, your ears get clogged, or at least my ears get clogged. That's because of pressure buildup in the various tubes of the inner ear, etcetera. We'll get into this. But Years ago, our good our good friend, Harvey Carton, who's another world class neuroanatomist, Gave a lecture, and it talked about how plugging your nose and blowing out versus plugging your nose and sucking in can Should be done at different times depending on whether or not you're taking off or landing.[1:00:23] Andrew Huberman: And I always see people try to unpop their ears. Right. And when you do scuba diving, you learn how to do this without necessarily I can do it, by just kinda moving my jaw now because I've done a a little bit of diving. But What's the story there? We don't have to get into all the differences in atmospheric pressure, etcetera, but if I'm taken off and my ears are plugged Yeah.[1:00:44] Andrew Huberman: Or I've Recently ascended. Plane took off. My ears are plugged. Do I plug my nose and blow out, or do I plug my nose and suck in?[1:00:49] Dr. David Berson: Right. So the the basic idea is that if your Ears feel bad because you're going into an area of higher pressure. So if they pressurize the cabin more than the pressure that you have on the surface of the planet, your eardrums will be bending in, and they don't like that. If you push them more, they'll hurt Even[1:01:08] Andrew Huberman: though description that the you know, that pressure goes up, then they're gonna bend in.[1:01:12] Dr. David Berson: Bend in. And then reverse would be true if you go into an area of Low pressure. So if you knew you you started to drive up the mountain side, you know, the pressure is getting lower and lower outside. Now the The air behind your eardrum is ballooning out. Yep.[1:01:26] Dr. David Berson: Right? So it's just a question of, you know, are you trying to get more pressure or less pressure behind the eardrum? And this tube that does that and comes down into your, you know, back of your throat there and you force pressure up that tube, you're gonna be putting more air pressure into the compartment[1:01:41] Andrew Huberman: To counter it. To to[1:01:42] Dr. David Berson: if if it's if it's not enough and if you're sucking, you're going the other way. In reality, I think as long as you open the passageway, I think the Pressure differential is gonna solve your problems. So I think you could actually blow in when you're not, quote, supposed to.[1:01:55] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So you could Just hold your nose and blow air out or hold your nose and suck in the Right. Effect. Either way is fine.[1:02:05] Dr. David Berson: I think so.[1:02:05] Andrew Huberman: I think so. You just I just won a $100 from Harvey Parton. Thank you very much. There's a lot we Harvey and I used to teach her anatomy together. I'll say, I don't think it matters, but thank you, Bruce.[1:02:14] Andrew Huberman: I'll I'll split I'll split that with you. Okay. This is, this is important stuff. But but it's true you hear this. You know?[1:02:23] Andrew Huberman: So so it doesn't matter either way.[1:02:24] Dr. David Berson: I yeah. I'm no expert in this area. Don't worry. Don't quote me. He's not gonna[1:02:28] Andrew Huberman: well, I'm going to quote you, but, Okay. So we we've talked about the inner ear, and we've talked about the cerebellum. I want to talk about an area of the brain that is rarely discussed, which is the midbrain. Yeah. And for those that don't know, the midbrain is an area beneath the cortex.[1:02:45] Andrew Huberman: I guess we never really defined cortex. It was kinda the outer layers or is are the outer layers of the least mammalian brain or human brain. But the midbrain is super interesting because it controls a lot of unconscious stuff, reflexes, etcetera. And then there's this phenomenon even called blindsight. So could you please tell us about the midbrain, About what it does and what in the world is blindsight.[1:03:15] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. So this is a there's a lot of pieces there. I think the first thing to say is if you imagine the nervous system in your mind's eye, you see this big honking brain, and then there's this little Sit then little, wand that dangles down into your vertical column, the spinal cord, and that's kind of your visual impression. What you have to imagine is starting in the spinal cord and working your way up into this big, magnificent brain. And what you would do as you enter the skull is getting to a little place where the spinal cord kind of thickens out.[1:03:50] Dr. David Berson: It still has that sort of long skinny trunk like Feeling? Sort of[1:03:55] Andrew Huberman: like a paddle or a spoon shape.[1:03:56] Dr. David Berson: Right. It starts to spread out a little bit, and that's because your, you know, evolution has packed more interesting goodies in there for processing Information and and generating movement. So beyond that is this tween brain we were talking about. So this link this linker brain with Diencephalon really means the the between brain.[1:04:14] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I[1:04:15] Dr. David Berson: thought you said tween. Well, it is. Yes. No. No.[1:04:17] Dr. David Berson: Between. Between.[1:04:18] Andrew Huberman: I'm sorry. I said I said tween.[1:04:19] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. It's the between it's the between brain is is what the the name means. It's the linker from the spinal cord in the periphery up to these grand centers of the cortex. But this midbrain you're talking about is the last bit of this enlarged sort of spinal cordy thing in your skull, which is really the brain stem is what call it the last bit of that before you get to this relay up to the cortex is the midbrain, and there's a really important visual center there. Called the superior colliculus.[1:04:52] Dr. David Berson: There's a similar center in the brains of other vertebrate animals, a frog, for example, or a lizard We have this. It's called the optic tectum there, but it's, a center then in these nonmammalian, vertebrates is really the main visual center. They don't really have what we would call a visual cortex, although there's something sort of like that. But this is where most of the action is in terms of interpreting visual input and, organizing behavior around that. You can sort of think about the this region of the brain stem as a reflex center that can reorient the animal's, gaze or Body or maybe even attention to particular regions of space out there around the animal, And that could be all for all kinds of reasons.[1:05:43] Dr. David Berson: I mean, it might be a predator just showed up in one corner of the forest, and you pick that up and you're trying to avoid it. We're just any movement. Many movement. Right? It might be, you know, that suddenly, you know, something splats on the page when you're reading a novel and and your eye Reflexly looks at it.[1:06:01] Dr. David Berson: You don't have to think about that. That's a reflex. What if[1:06:04] Andrew Huberman: you throw me a ball, but I'm not expecting it? Right. And I just reach up and and try and grab it, catch it or not.[1:06:10] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:06:10] Andrew Huberman: Is that handled by the midbrain?[1:06:12] Dr. David Berson: Well, that's probably not the midbrain. Although it I mean, by itself Because it's gonna involve all these limb movements, this movement of your arm and body. And start about ducking if[1:06:24] Andrew Huberman: something's suddenly thrown in[1:06:25] Dr. David Berson: the head? Sure. Right. Things like that are will certainly have a brain stem component, a midbrain component. You know, something looms and you duck.[1:06:33] Dr. David Berson: It may not be the superior colliculus we're talking about now. It might be another part of the visual midbrain. But these are centers that emerged early in the evolution of brains like ours To handle complicated visual events that have significance for the animal in terms of space, where is it in face. And in fact, the same center actually gets input from all kinds of other sensory systems that take information from the external world from particular locations And where you might wanna either avoid or approach things according to their significance to you. So you get input from the touch system.[1:07:08] Dr. David Berson: You get input from the Auditory system. I worked for a while in rattlesnakes. They get input from a part of their, warm sensors on their face. They're in these little Pits on the on the face. Used to[1:07:20] Andrew Huberman: work on baby rattlesnakes. Right?[1:07:22] Dr. David Berson: Well, they're they're adults, actually.[1:07:23] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I wasn't trying to diminish the danger. I thought for some reason they were little ones.[1:07:27] Dr. David Berson: No. Why in the world[1:07:28] Andrew Huberman: would you work on rattlesnakes?[1:07:30] Dr. David Berson: Well, because they have a version of an extra receptive Sensory system, that is they're looking out into the world using a completely different set of sensors. They're using the same sensors that would Feel the warmth on your face if you stood in front of a bonfire, except evolution has given them this very nice specialized system that lets them image where the heat's coming from. You can sorta do that anyway. Right? If you walk around the fire, you can feel which where the fire is from the the, you know, the heat Hitting your face[1:08:00] Andrew Huberman: Is that the primary way in which they detect prey?[1:08:04] Dr. David Berson: It's one of one of the major ways, and in fact, they use vision as well, And they bring these 2 systems together in the same place, in this tectum region, this brain stem, midbrain region.[1:08:15] Andrew Huberman: The tongue jutting about when the snakes[1:08:17] Dr. David Berson: That I don't know. That may be olfactory. There may[1:08:20] Andrew Huberman: be They're sniffing the air with their tongue.[1:08:22] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. There may be,[1:08:23] Andrew Huberman: because we are in our drive. You told me that flies actually taste things with their feet.[1:08:27] Dr. David Berson: They do. Yeah. Yeah. That's so weird. Yeah.[1:08:29] Dr. David Berson: They have they have taste receptors in lots of funny places.[1:08:32] Andrew Huberman: I, I wanna pause here just for one second before we get back into the midbrain. I think what's so interesting In all seriousness, about taste receptors on feet, heat sensors, tongues jutting out of snakes, And vision in all this integration is that it really speaks to the fact that all these sensory neurons are Trying to gather information Right. And stuff it into a system Right. That can make meaningful decisions and actions, And that it really doesn't matter whether or not it's coming from eyes or ears or nose or bottoms of feet because in the end, it's just electricity flowing in. And so it's It sounds like it's placed on each animal.[1:09:14] Andrew Huberman: It always feels weird to call fly an animal, but they are creatures. They are[1:09:19] Dr. David Berson: animals. It's placed in different locations on different animals depending on the particular needs of that animal. Right. But how much more powerful If the nervous systems can also cross correlate across sensory systems so if you've got a weak signal From 1 sensory system, you're not quite sure there's something there, and a weak signal from an another sensory system that's telling you the same locations is It's a little bit interesting. There might be something there.[1:09:47] Dr. David Berson: If you've got those 2 together, you've got corroboration. Your brain now says it's much more likely that that's gonna, you know, Be something worth paying attention to.[1:09:56] Andrew Huberman: Right. So maybe I I'm feeling some heat on one side of my face, And I also smell something baking in the oven. Right. So now there's it's neither is particularly strong, but as you said, there's some corroboration.[1:10:10] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:10:10] Andrew Huberman: And that corroboration is occurring in the midbrain.[1:10:12] Dr. David Berson: Right. And then if you throw things into conflict, now the brain is confused, and that may be where your your motion sickness comes from. So it's great to have you know, as a as a brain, it's great to have as many sources of information as you can have. Just like if you're a, You know, you're you're a spy or a journalist. You don't want as much information as you can get us about what's out there.[1:10:33] Dr. David Berson: But if things conflict, that's problematic. Right?[1:10:45] Andrew Huberman: Eject us from the midbrain and go back to the vestibular system. But I do have a question that I forgot to ask about the vestibular system, which is why is it that for many people, including me, there's Despite my motion sickness in cabs, that there's a sense of pleasure in moving through space and getting tilted relative to the gravitational pull of the earth. For me, growing up, it was skateboarding, but people like to corner in cars, corner on bikes. It may be for some people, it's done Running or dance, but, you know, what is it about moving through space and getting tilted? A lot of surfers around here getting tilted that Can tap into some of the pleasure centers.[1:11:24] Andrew Huberman: So is do we have any idea why that would feel good? I[1:11:27] Dr. David Berson: have no clue. Is there dopaminergic input to this System. Well, you know, the dopaminergic system gets a lot of places. You know? It's pretty much, to some extent, Everywhere in the cortex, a lot more in the frontal lobe, of course, but, you know, that's just for starters.[1:11:45] Dr. David Berson: I mean, there's basically dopaminergic innovation most places in the central nervous system. So there's the potential for dopaminergic involvement, but I really have no clue about the tilting phenomenon.[1:11:55] Andrew Huberman: I mean People pay money to go on roller coasters.[1:11:58] Dr. David Berson: Right. Well, I think that may be as much about the thrill as anything else.[1:12:01] Andrew Huberman: And falling is the falling reflex is very robust in all of us. Right. When the visual world's going up Very fast, it usually means that we're falling. Right. Right.[1:12:09] Andrew Huberman: Some people like that, some people don't.[1:12:10] Dr. David Berson: Right. And kids kids tolerate a lot more, know, sort of distributor craziness spinning around until they've dropped. Well, I've obviously[1:12:19] Andrew Huberman: I have friends it always, you know, Worries me a little bit that will they throw their kids. I'm not recommending anyone do this. When they're little kids, you know, like, throwing the kids really far back and forth, kids some kids seem to love it.[1:12:30] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. Yeah. Her son loved being shaken up and down very, very, vigorously. He that's the only thing that would calm[1:12:38] Andrew Huberman: him down sometimes. Interesting. Yeah. So I'm guessing we can we can, guess that maybe there's some activation of the reward systems from Yeah. Being move moving through space.[1:12:50] Dr. David Berson: Well, that mean, if you think about it, you know, how rewarding it is to be able to move through space and how Unhappy people are who are used to that, who suddenly aren't able to do that. There is a sense of agency. Right? If you you can choose to move through the world And to tilt, that's not only you're moving through the world, but you're doing with a certain amount of finesse. Maybe that's what it is.[1:13:09] Dr. David Berson: You can feel like you're the master of your own movement. Mhmm.[1:13:13] Andrew Huberman: In a[1:13:13] Dr. David Berson: way that you wouldn't if you're going straight. I'm I'm just blowing smoke here. Right?[1:13:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, we can speculate. That's fine. I I couldn't help but ask the question. Okay.[1:13:21] Andrew Huberman: So if we, move ourselves, pun intended, back into the midbrain, the midbrain's combining all these different signals for reflexive action. At what point does this become deliberate action? Because if I look at something I want and I wanna pursue it, I'm going to go toward it, and Many times, that's a deliberate decision.[1:13:42] Dr. David Berson: Right. So this gets very slippery, I think, because What you have to try to imagine is all these different parts of the brain working on the problem of staying alive, you know, in in surviving in in in the world, they're working on the problem simultaneously, and there's not one right answer To how how to do that, but the one way to think about it is that you have high levels of your nervous system that are Very well designed to override an otherwise automatic movement if it's inappropriate. So if you imagine you've been invited to Tea with the queen, and she hands you, you know, very fancy Wedgwood, you know, teacup, very thin Wedgwood teacup. Yes. With very hot tea in it and you're burning your hand, you probably will try to find a way to put that back down on the saucer rather than just dropping it on the floor Because you're with the queen.[1:14:42] Dr. David Berson: You you know, you're trying to be appropriate to that. So you have ways of reining in Automatic behaviors if they're gonna be maladaptive. But you also want the reflex to work quickly if it's the only thing that's gonna save you. The looming, know, object coming at your head, you don't have time to think about that. So this is the interplay in these hierarchically organized centers of the nervous system at the lowest level.[1:15:07] Dr. David Berson: You've got the automatic sensors that and centers and reflex, you know, arcs that will keep you safe Even if you don't have time to think about it, and then you've got the higher center saying, well, maybe we could do this as well or maybe we shouldn't do that at all. Right? So you have all of these different levels operating simultaneously, and you need bidirectional communication between high level Cognitive centers, decision making on the one hand, and these low level very helpful reflexive centers, but they're a little bit rigid. Mhmm. Little hardwired, so they need some nuance.[1:15:44] Dr. David Berson: So this they're both of these things are operating in tandem in real time all the time in our brains, And sometimes we listen more to 1 than the other. You've heard people in sports talking about messing up with the play because they overthought it. You know, Thinking too hard about it. That's partly you've already trained your cerebellum how to hit a fastball right down the middle.[1:16:04] Andrew Huberman: Right. If you start looking for for something new or different Right. You're gonna mess up your your reflexive swing.[1:16:11] Dr. David Berson: Right. If you're trying to think about the physics of the ball As it's coming at you, you've already missed. Right? You know?[1:16:16] Andrew Huberman: Because you you know, you're not using your this all those reps have built a kind of knowledge This is what you wanna rely on when you don't have enough time to, contemplate. This is important and a great segue for What I'd like to discuss next was it which is the basal ganglia. This really interesting of the area of the brain that's involved in go Type commands and behaviors instructing us to do things and no go, preventing us from doing things. But so much of motor learning and skill execution And, not saying the wrong thing or sitting still in class when or as you used with the, you know, tea with the queen example, Feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior, and sometimes it's activating behavior. Right.[1:17:05] Andrew Huberman: You know, tremendous amount of online attention is devoted to, trying to get people motivated. You know, this isn't the main focus of our podcast. We touch on some of the underlying neural circuits of of Motivation, dopamine, and so forth. But so much of what people struggle with out there are elements around Failure to pay attention[1:17:25] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:17:26] Andrew Huberman: Or challenges in paying attention, which is essentially, like, putting the blinders on there, you know, getting a soda straw view of the world and maintaining that for a bout of work or something of that sort and trying to get into action. So, Of course, this is carried out by many neural circuits, not just the basal ganglia. But what are the basal ganglia, and what are their primary roles In controlling go type behavior and no go type behavior.[1:17:51] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. So, I mean, the the basal ganglia are sitting deep In what you would call the forebrain, so the highest levels of the brain, they are sort of cousins to the cerebral cortex, Which we talked about is sort of the highest level of your brain, the the thing you're thinking with.[1:18:09] Andrew Huberman: Cerebral cortex being the refined cousins, and then you've got the[1:18:12] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:18:13] Andrew Huberman: You know, the brute stuff. Yeah.[1:18:15] Dr. David Berson: I mean, that's probably totally unfair, but that that's the point.[1:18:18] Andrew Huberman: I like the basal ganglia. I can relate to the brutish parts of the brain. Little bit of hypothalamus, little[1:18:24] Dr. David Berson: bit of basal ganglia. Sure. We need it all. We need it all. And, you know, This area of the brain has gotten a lot bigger as the cortex has gotten bigger, and it's deeply intertwined with cortical function.[1:18:39] Dr. David Berson: The cortex can't really do what it needs to do without the help of the basal ganglia and vice versa. So they're really intertwined. And in a way, you can think about this logically is saying, you know, if if you have the ability to withhold behavior or to execute it, How do you decide which to do? Well, the cortex is gonna have to do that thinking for you. You have to be looking at all the contingencies of your situation to decide, Is this a crazy move, or is this a really smart investment right now?[1:19:10] Dr. David Berson: Or, you know, what? Right.[1:19:11] Andrew Huberman: I don't wanna go out for a run-in the morning, but I'm gonna make myself go out for a run. Or I'm having a great time out on a run, and I know I need to get back, but I kinda wanna go another mile.[1:19:20] Dr. David Berson: I mean, another great example is that, you know, the marshmallow test the little kids, you know, they can get 2 marshmallows if they hold off, you know, just 30 seconds initially. You know? They can have 1 right away, but if they can wait 30 seconds, they got 2. You know? So that's the no go because their cortex is saying, you know, I would really like to have 2 more than having 1, But they're not gonna get the 2 unless they cannot reach for the 1.[1:19:45] Dr. David Berson: So they've gotta hold off the action, and that has to result from a cognitive process. So the cortex is involved in this in a major way.[1:19:57] Andrew Huberman: Yes. I recall in that experiment, the kids used a variety of tools to some would distract themselves. I particularly related to the kid that would just put himself right next to the Marshmallows and then would and then some of the kids cover their eyes, some of them would count or sing. Yeah. So that's all very cortical, right, coming up with a novel strategy.[1:20:15] Andrew Huberman: Simple example that we're using here, but, of course, this is at play anytime someone decides they wanna go watch a motivational speech or something, just, You know, a Steve Jobs commencement speech just to get motivated to to engage in their day.[1:20:26] Dr. David Berson: Sure. I take this new job. Mhmm. It has got great benefits, but it's in a lousy part of the country.[1:20:32] Andrew Huberman: Why do you think that some people have a harder time running these go no go circuits, and other people seem to have very, Low activation energy, we would say. They could just you know, you they have a task. They just lean into the task. Right. Whereas some people getting into task completion or That things of that sort is is very challenging for them.[1:20:52] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. I mean, I think it's really just another it's a special case of a very general phenomenon, which is Brains are complicated, and brains you know, the brains we have are the result of genetics and experience. And my genes are different from your genes, and my experiences are different from your experiences. So the things that are be easy or hard for us won't necessarily be aligned. They they might Just happened to be just because they are.[1:21:18] Dr. David Berson: But the point is that, you know, you you're dealt a certain set of cards. You have certain set of genes. You are handed a, you know, a brain. You don't choose your brain. It's handed to you.[1:21:30] Dr. David Berson: But then there's all this stuff you can do with You you know, you you can learn to, you know, to to have new skills or to act differently or to show more straight, which is kind of relevant to what we're talking about here, or maybe show less restraint if your problem is you're so buttoned down, you never have any fun in life. And you you should loosen up little bit. Right?[1:21:51] Andrew Huberman: You. I appreciate the insight. Yeah. David's always encouraged me to have a little more fun in life. So basal ganglia are they're kind of the disciplinarian or they there's they're sort of the instructor or conductor of sorts.[1:22:07] Andrew Huberman: Right? Go, no go. You know, you be quiet. You start now.[1:22:11] Dr. David Berson: I wish I knew more about the basal ganglia than I than I do. My sense is that it, You know, this system is key for implementing the plans that get cooked up in the cortex, but they also influence the plans that the, you know, cortex is is dishing out because This is a major source of information to the cortex, so it becomes almost impossible to figure out where the computation begins and where it ends and who's Patient begins and where it ends and who's doing what because these things are all interacting in a complex network, and it's all of it. It's the whole network. It's not, You know, 1 is the leader and the other is the follower. Right.[1:22:50] Andrew Huberman: Of course. Yeah. These are the all the structures that we're discussing are working in parallel. Right. And, there's a lot of Changing crosstalk.[1:22:59] Andrew Huberman: I have this, somewhat sick, habit, David. Every day, I try and do 21 no gos. So if I wanna reach for my phone, I try and not do it just to see if I can prevent myself from engaging in that behavior if it was reflexive. It's something I want to do, deliberate choice, then I certainly allow myself to do it.[1:23:20] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:23:20] Andrew Huberman: I don't tend to have too much trouble with motivation with go type functions, Mostly because I'm so busy that I I wish I had more time for more goes, but, so to speak. But Do you think these circuits have genuine plasticity in them?[1:23:35] Dr. David Berson: Absolutely. I mean, everybody knows how they've learned over time To wait for the 2 marshmallows. Right? You know, you you don't have to have instant gratification all the time. You know, you're willing to do a job sometimes It isn't your favorite job because it comes with the territory and you want the salary that comes at the end of the week or the end of the month.[1:23:53] Dr. David Berson: Right? So we can defer gratification. You know, we can choose not to say the thing that we know is gonna inflame our partner and create a, you know, a meltdown for the next week. You know, we we learn this control, but I think these are skills like any other. You can get better at them if you practice them.[1:24:13] Dr. David Berson: So I think you're you're choosing to do that spontaneously is a it's kind of a you know, it's a mental practice. It's a discipline. It's a way of building a skill that you wanna have. Yeah. I find it[1:24:22] Andrew Huberman: to be something that when I Engage in a no go type, situation. Then the next time and the next time that I find myself About to move reflexively, there's a little gap in consciousness that I can inter that I can make a decision whether or not this is really the best use of my time. Because I I I sometimes wonder whether or not all this business around attention certainly, there's the case of ADHD and clinical diagnosed ADHD, but all these, the issue around focus and attention is really that people just have not really learned how to short circuit a reflex. And so much of what makes us different than rattlesnakes or well, actually, they could be deliberate, but from the other animals and is our ability to suppress reflux.[1:25:06] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. Well, that's the cortex. I mean, or let's just say the forebrain. Cortex and basal ganglia are working together, Sitting on top of this lizard brain that's giving you all these great adaptive reflexes that help you survive, you just hope you don't get The surprising case where the thing that your reflex is telling you is actually exactly the wrong thing and you make a mistake. Right?[1:25:27] Dr. David Berson: And that's right. Right. So that's what the cortex is for. It's adding nuance and context and experience, past association, and in human beings, obviously, learning from others through, You know,[1:25:40] Andrew Huberman: communication. Well, I was you, went right to it, and it was where I was gonna go. So let's talk about the cortex. We've worked our way up The so called neuro axis as, the, aficionados will will know. So we're in the cortex.[1:25:54] Andrew Huberman: This is the seat of our higher consciousness, self image, planning, and action. But as you mentioned, the cortex isn't just about that. It's got other regions that are involved in other things. So maybe we should, staying with vision, let's talk a little bit about visual cortex. You told me a story, an amazing story about visual cortex, and it was somewhat of a sad story, unfortunately, about someone who had a stroke to visual cortex.[1:26:17] Andrew Huberman: Maybe if you would share that story because I think it illustrates many important principles about what the cortex does.[1:26:25] Dr. David Berson: Right. So, you know, the visual cortex is you could say the projection screen. The first, You know, place where this information streaming from the retina through this thalamus, you know, connecting linker Gets played out for the, you know, highest level of your brain to see. I mean, it's a representation. It's a map of things going on in the visual world that's in your brain.[1:26:55] Dr. David Berson: And When we describe a scene to a friend, we're using this chunk of our brain to be able to put words which are coming from a different part of our cortex To the objects and and movements and colors that we see in the world. So, you know, that's A key part of your visual experience when you when you can describe the things you're seeing, you're you're looking at your visual cortex. And this is Could I just ask[1:27:24] Andrew Huberman: a quick question? So right now, because I'm looking at your face Right. As we're talking, there are neurons In my brain, more or less in the configuration of your face that are active as you move about. And, What if I were to close my eyes and just imagine I do this all the time, by the way, David. I close my eyes, and I imagine David Berson's I don't tend to do that as often.[1:27:50] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I should, but you get the point. I'm I'm now using visualization Right. Of what you look like by way of memory.[1:27:56] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:27:57] Andrew Huberman: If we were to image the neurons in my brain, would the activity of neurons resemble the activity of neurons that's present when I open my eyes and look at your actual face?[1:28:09] Dr. David Berson: This is a deep question. We don't really have a full[1:28:12] Andrew Huberman: Seems like a human experiment to do.[1:28:15] Dr. David Berson: Yes. Except, you know, you're talking about looking in detail at the activity of neurons in a human brain, And that's not as easy to do as as it would be in a you know, in some kind of animal model. But, you know, the bottom line is that you You have a spatial representation of the visual world laid as a map of the visual world laid down on another surface of your cortex. The thing that's surprising is that it's not one map. It's actually dozens of maps.[1:28:44] Andrew Huberman: What do each of those maps do?[1:28:46] Dr. David Berson: Well, we don't really have a full accounting there either, but it looks a little bit like the diversification of the output neurons of the Retina, the ganglion cells we were talking about before, there are different types of ganglion cells that are encoding different kinds of information about the visual world. We talk about the ones that were Encoding the brightness, but other ones are encoding motion or color, these kinds of things. The same kinds of specializations in Different representations of the visual world in the cortex, seem to be true. It's a complex story. We don't have the whole the whole picture yet, But it does look as if some parts of the brain are much more important for things like reaching for things in the space around you, other parts of the cortex are really important for making associations between particular visual things you're looking at now and their significance.[1:29:35] Dr. David Berson: What they what what is that object? What can it do for me? How can I use it?[1:29:39] Andrew Huberman: What about the really specialized areas of cortex? Like, the Area like, neurons that respond to particular faces or, neurons that, I don't know, can Help me understand where I am relative to some other specific object.[1:29:54] Dr. David Berson: Right. So, yeah, this these are are properties of neurons that are extracted from detected by recording the activity of single neurons in some experimental system. What's going on when you actually perceive your grandmother's face is a much more complicated question. It clearly involves hundreds and thousands and probably millions of neurons Acting in a cooperative way. So you can pick out any one little element in this very complicated system and see that it's responding differentially to certain kinds of visual patterns, and you think you're seeing a glimpse of some part of the process by which you recognize your grandmother's face.[1:30:36] Dr. David Berson: But that's a long way from a complete description, and it certainly isn't gonna be at the level of a magic single neuron that has the Special stuff to recognize your grandmother. It's gonna be in some pattern of activity across many, many cells resonating in some kind of special way That will represent the internal, you know, memory of your of your mother. So She's really incredible.[1:30:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean I mean, the every time we do this deep Dive, which we do from time to time, you and I, we kinda, like, march into the nervous system and explore how different aspects of our of our life experiences is handled there and how it's organized. The it after so many decades Doing this, it it still boggles my mind that that the collection of neurons, 1 through 7, active in a particular sequence gives The memory of a a particular face and, run backwards 7 through to 1, it gives you a you know, it could be, you know, rattlesnake, Good viper, heat sensing organs[1:31:38] Dr. David Berson: Right. As[1:31:38] Andrew Huberman: we're talking about earlier. So it sounds is it true that there's a lot of multipurposing Of the circuitry, like, we can't say 1 area of the brain does a and another area of the brain does b. So, you know, areas can Multitask or have multiple jobs. They can moonlight. Right.[1:31:56] Dr. David Berson: But I I, yeah, I think in my career, the hard Problem has been to square that with the fact that, you know, things are specialized, That there are specific genes expressed in specific neurons that make them make synaptic connections with only certain other neurons, And that particular synaptic arrangement actually results in the processing of information that's useful to the animal to survive. Right? So it's it's not as if it's either a big undifferentiated network of cells and looking at anyone is never gonna tell you anything. That's too extreme on the one hand, nor is it the case that everything is hardwired and every neuron has 1 function and this all happens in 1 place in the brain. It's way more complicated and interactive and interconnected than that.[1:32:49] Andrew Huberman: So we're not hardwired or softwired.[1:32:51] Dr. David Berson: Both.[1:32:52] Andrew Huberman: We're sort of, I don't know what the analogy should be. What what substance would work best, David?[1:32:57] Dr. David Berson: No idea there. But, you know, the the idea is that It's always network activity. There's always many many neurons involved, and yet there's tremendous specificity In the neurons that might or might not be participating in any distributed function like that. Right? So you have to get your mind around the fact that it's Both very specific and very nonspecific at the same time.[1:33:19] Dr. David Berson: It's a little tricky to do, but I think that's kinda where the truth lies.[1:33:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And so the this example that you mentioned 1 to me once before about a woman who had a stroke in visual cortex, I think speaks to some of this. Right. Could you share with us that story? Sure.[1:33:35] Andrew Huberman: So the the point[1:33:36] Dr. David Berson: is that you you all those of us who who see have Representations of the visual world in our visual cortex. What happens to somebody when they Become blind because of problems in the eye, the retina perhaps. You have a big chunk of the cortex. This is really valuable real estate for neural processing, that has come to expect input from the visual system, and there isn't any anymore. So you might think about that as fallow land.[1:34:08] Dr. David Berson: Right? It's just it's an an used by the nervous system. That would be a pity, but it turns out that it in is in fact used. And the the case that you're talking about is of a woman who was, blind from very early, in her life and who had risen through the ranks to a very high level executive Secretarial position in a major corporation, and she was extremely good at braille reading and she had a braille typewriter and that's how everything was done. And, apparently, she had a stroke and was discovered at work, collapsed, and they brought her to the hospital.[1:34:48] Dr. David Berson: And, Apparently, the neurologist who saw her when she finally came to said, you know, I've got good news and bad news. Bad news is you've had a stroke. The good news is that it was in an area of your brain you're not even using. It's your visual cortex, and I know you're blind from birth, so there shouldn't be any issue here. The problem was She lost her ability to read Braille.[1:35:11] Dr. David Berson: So what appears to have been the case, and this has been confirmed In other ways, by imaging experiments in humans is that in people who are blind from very early in birth, the visual cortex Gets repurposed as an a center for processing tactile information. And especially if you train to be a good braille reader, You're actually reallocating somehow that real estate to your fingertips, you know, a part of the cortex that should be listening to the eyes. So that's an extreme level of plasticity, but what it shows is the visual cortex is kind of a general purpose processing machine. It's good at Spatial information in the skin of your fingers is just another spatial sense and deprived of any any other input. The brain seems Smart enough, if you wanna put it that way, to rewire itself, to use that real estate for something, useful.[1:36:05] Dr. David Berson: In this case, reading braille.[1:36:08] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. Somewhat tragic, but incredible. At least in that case, tragic. Yeah.[1:36:12] Dr. David Berson: Very informative. Very informative.[1:36:13] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, it can go the other way too Right. Where people can Gain function in particular modalities like improved hearing or tactile function in the absence of vision. Right. Tell us about connectomes. We hear about genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, these days.[1:36:36] Andrew Huberman: What's a connectome, and why is it valuable?[1:36:39] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. So so connectome actually now has two meanings. So I've only referred to what the one that is my passion right now, and that is really trying to understand the structure of nervous tissue at a scale, that's very, very fine. Like Smaller than a millimeter. Way smaller than a millimeter, a nanometer or or less says that's a 1000 times smaller, or or or it's actually, you know, a a a a a a 1000000 times smaller.[1:37:12] Dr. David Berson: So really, really tiny. On the scale of individual synapses between individual neurons or even smaller, like the individual synaptic Vesicles containing little packets of neurotransmitter, they're gonna get it released to allow 1 neuron to communicate to the next. So very, very fine, but the notion here is that you're doing this section after section at very fine scale. So in theory, what you have is a complete description of a chunk of nervous tissue that is so complete That if you took enough time to identify where the boundaries of all the cells are, you could come up with a complete description of the synaptic wiring of that chunk of nervous tissue because you have a complete description of where all the cells are and where all the synapses between where all the cells are. So now you essentially have a wiring diagram of this complicated piece of tissue.[1:38:04] Dr. David Berson: So the omics part is the exhaustiveness of it rather than looking at a couple of synapses that are interesting to you from 2 different cell types. You're looking at all the synapses of all of the cell types, which, of course, is this massive, Avalanche of data. Right? So in genetics, you have genetics, and then[1:38:24] Andrew Huberman: you have genomics, which is the idea of getting the whole genome.[1:38:27] Dr. David Berson: All of it.[1:38:27] Andrew Huberman: And we don't really have an analogous word for genetics, but it would be connectivity and kinemics. Right. Or Connectivity and kinematics. Connectomics.[1:38:36] Dr. David Berson: Sure. Sure.[1:38:36] Andrew Huberman: Activity and connectomics.[1:38:38] Dr. David Berson: Right. So it's it's it's wanting it all. And, of course, it's crazy ambitious, but, you know, that's that's where it gets fun. You know, it's it really, it's A use of electron microscopy, a very high resolution microscopic imaging system On a new scale with way more payoff in terms of understanding the connectivity of the nervous system, and it's just emerging. But I really think it's gonna revolutionize the field because we're gonna be able to query these circuits.[1:39:07] Dr. David Berson: How do they actually do it? Look at the hardware in a way that's never been possible before. The the[1:39:12] Andrew Huberman: way that I describe this to people is, if you were to take a chunk of, kind of cold cooked but cold spaghetti Right. And slice it up very thin. You're trying to connect up each image of each slice of the edge of the spaghetti As figure out which ropes of spaghetti belong to which.[1:39:30] Dr. David Berson: And have a complete description of where this piece of spaghetti touches that piece of spaghetti, and is there Something special there, obviously.[1:39:36] Andrew Huberman: Sauces and all the other cell types and the the Right. Yeah. The pesto, and all where it all is around the spaghetti because those are the other cell the blood vessels and the glial cells. And so what's it good for? I mean, maps are great.[1:39:52] Andrew Huberman: Right. I always think of connectomics and genomics and proteomics, etcetera, as necessary, but not sufficient.[1:40:00] Dr. David Berson: Right. Right. So, I mean, in many cases, what you do is you go out and and probe the the the function, and you understand how the brain does the function by finding neurons that seem to be Firing in association with with this function that you're observing. And little by little you work your way in and now you wanna know what the connectivity is, maybe the anatomy could help you. But this Konnectomics approach or at least the serial electron microscopy reconstruction of neurons, approach Really is allowing us to frame questions starting from the anatomy and saying, I see a synaptic circuit here, my prediction would be that these cell types would interact in a particular way.[1:40:38] Dr. David Berson: Is that right? And then you can go and probe the physiology, and you might be right or you might be wrong. But more often than not, it looks like the structure is pointing us in the right direction. So in my case, I'm using this to try to understand a circuit that is involved in this image stabilization network we're talking about, keeping things stable on the retina. And this thing will only respond at certain speeds of motion.[1:41:04] Dr. David Berson: These these cells in the circuit, like slow motion, they won't respond to fast motion. How does that come about? Well, I was able to probe the circuitry. I knew what my cells looked like. I could see which other cells were talking to it.[1:41:17] Dr. David Berson: I could Categorize all the cells that might be the players here that are involved in this mechanism of tuning the thing for slow speeds, And then we said it looks like it's that cell type, and we went and looked, and the data bore that up. But the anatomy drove the search for the particular cell type because we could it connected in the right place to the right selves. I see. So it's that creates the hypothesis that lets you go query the physiology, but it can go the other way as well. So it's always the Synergy between these functional and structural approaches, it gives you the the most, lift.[1:41:51] Dr. David Berson: But, You know, in many cases, the anatomy has been a little bit the weak sister in this, the structure trying to work out the diagram because we haven't had the methods. Now the methods exist, And this whole field is is expanding very quickly because people want these circuit diagrams for the particular part of the nervous system that they're working on. If you don't know the cell types and the connections, how how do you really understand how the the machine works? Mhmm.[1:42:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. What I love about is, we don't know what we don't know.[1:42:20] Dr. David Berson: Right.[1:42:20] Andrew Huberman: And, scientists, we don't ask questions. We pose hypotheses. Hypotheses being, of course, some prediction that you wager your time on, basically. Right. And it either turns out to be true or not true.[1:42:33] Andrew Huberman: But if you don't Know that a particular cell type is there. You could never, in any configuration of life, or a career Or exploration of a nervous system wager a hypothesis because you didn't know it was there. So this allows you to say, there's this little interesting little Connection between this cell that I know is interesting and another cell that's a little mysterious but interesting, I'm going to hypothesize that it's doing blank, blank, and blank, and go test that. In the absence of these connectomes, you would never know that that cell was lurking there in in the shadows. Right.[1:43:07] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:43:07] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. And if you're just trying to understand how Information flows through this biological machine. You wanna know where things are. You know? Neurotransmitters are dumped out of the terminals of 1 cell, And they diffuse across the space between the 2 cells, which is kind of a liquidy space, and they hit some receptors on the postsynaptic cell and they have some impact.[1:43:28] Dr. David Berson: Sometimes that's not through a regular synapse. Sometimes it's through a neuromodulator like you you often talk about on your podcast that are sort of oozing Dopamine. Dopamine. Exactly. Oozing into the space between the cells, and it may be acting at some distance far from where it was released.[1:43:44] Dr. David Berson: Right? But if you don't know where the release is happening and where other things are that might respond to that release, you're groping around in the dark. Well, I[1:43:52] Andrew Huberman: love that you are doing this, and, I have to share with, the listeners that the first time I ever met David and every time I've ever met with him in person, at least at his laboratory at Brown, He was in his office, door closed, drawing neurons and their connections, and this is somewhat unusual for somebody who's a, you know, endowed Full professor, chairman of the department, etcetera, for many years, to be doing the hands on work. Typically, that's the stuff that's done by technicians or graduate students or postdocs, but I think it's fair to say that you really love looking at nervous systems and drawing the accurate renditions of How those nervous systems are organized and thinking about how they work.[1:44:37] Dr. David Berson: Yeah. It's pure joy for me. I mean, I'm a very visual person. My wife is an artist. We look at a lot of art together.[1:44:43] Dr. David Berson: Just the forms of things are are gorgeous in their own right, but to know that the form is in a sense the function That the that the architecture of the connectivity is how the computation happens in the brain at some level, even though we don't fully understand that in most Context gives me, you know, great joy because I'm working on something that's both visually beautiful, but also deeply beautiful in a sort of a Higher sort of, knowledge context. You know? What is it what is it all about?[1:45:17] Andrew Huberman: Love it. Well, as a final question, I get asked very often about how people should learn about neuroscience, or how they should go about pursuing maybe an education in neuroscience if they're At that stage of their life where that's appropriate for their current trajectory, do you have any advice to young people, old people, and anything in between about how to learn about the nervous system more maybe in a more formal way. I mean, obviously, we have our podcast. There are other, sources of neuroscience information out there. But For the young person who thinks they want to understand the brain, they wanna learn about the brain, what should we tell them?[1:45:55] Dr. David Berson: Well, that's a great question, and there's so many sources out there. It's almost a question of, you know, how do you deal with this avalanche of information out there? I mean, I think your podcast is a great way for people to to learn more about the nervous system in an accessible way, but there's so much stuff out there and it's it's not just that. I mean, the resources are becoming more and more available for average folks to participate in neuroscience research on some level. There's this famous EyeWire project of best[1:46:21] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. Maybe tell us[1:46:23] Dr. David Berson: I about EyeWire. Yeah. So that's connectomics, and that's a a situation where a very clever scientist realized that the the Physical work of doing all this reconstruction of neurons from these electron micrographs, there's a lot of Time involved. Many, many person hours have to go into that to come up with the map that you want of where the cells are, And he was very clever about setting up a context in which he could crowdsource this, and people who are interested in getting a little experience Looking at nervous tissue and participating in a research project could learn how to do this and do a little bit. From their living room.[1:47:00] Dr. David Berson: From their living room. Their laptop.[1:47:01] Andrew Huberman: We'll put a link to Eyewire. That's also is a great bridge between what we were just talking about connectomics and actually participating in research. Right. And you don't need a graduate mentor or or anything like that.[1:47:12] Dr. David Berson: Right. And so the more of this is coming, and I'm actually interested in building more of this, so that people who are interested, wanna participate some level, don't necessarily have the time or resources to get involved in laboratory research, can can get exposed to it and and participate and actually contribute. So I think that's, you know, one one thing. I mean, just asking questions of the people around you who know a little bit more and have them point you in the right direction. Here's a book you might like to read.[1:47:42] Dr. David Berson: There's lots of great popular, books out there that are accessible that will give you some More sense in the full range of what's out there in the neurosciences and how We can[1:47:52] Andrew Huberman: put some links to a few of those that we like Right. On on basic neuroscience. Right. Our good friend, Dick Masland, The late Richard, people will call him Dick, Dick Maslin, had a good book. I forget the title.[1:48:04] Andrew Huberman: At the moment, it said it's sitting behind me somewhere over there on the shelf, but, about vision and how nervous systems work. A pretty accessible book for the general public.[1:48:12] Dr. David Berson: Right. Yeah. Right. So, you know, that and and, you know, there's there's so many sources out there. I mean, Wikipedia is a great way.[1:48:18] Dr. David Berson: If you have a particular question about visual function, I would say, by all means, you know, head to Wikipedia and and get the first look And follow the the references from there or go to your library or you know? There there's so many ways to get into it. It's such an exciting field now. There's so many I mean, any particular realm that's special to you, your experience, your, you know, your strengths, your passions, there's there's a field of neuroscience devoted to that. You know, if you've got if you know somebody who's got a a neurological problem or a psychiatric problem.[1:48:50] Dr. David Berson: There's a branch of neuroscience that is devoted to trying to understand that and to solve these kinds of problems down the line. So feel the feel the buzz. It's it's an exciting time to to get involved.[1:49:03] Andrew Huberman: Great. Those are great resources that people can access from anywhere, zero cost As you need an Internet connection, but aside from that, we'll put the links to some. And I'm remembering, Dick's book is called, We Know It When We See It.[1:49:15] Dr. David Berson: Right. One of my heroes.[1:49:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Wonderful colleague who, unfortunately, we lost a few years ago. But, listen, David, this has been wonderful. It's been a blast. We really appreciate you taking the time to do this.[1:49:26] Andrew Huberman: As, people probably realize by now, you're an incredible wealth of knowledge about the entire nervous system. Today, we just hit this, top contour of a number of different areas to give a flavor of the different ways that the nervous system works and is organized and how that's put together, how these areas are talking to one another. What I love about you is that you're such an incredible educator and and, have taught so many students over the years, but, also, for me, personally, as friends, but also anytime that I want to touch into the the beauty of the nervous system, I rarely lose touch with it, but anytime I wanna touch into it and and start thinking about new problems in ways that, the nervous system is doing things that I hadn't thought about, I call you. So I've, please forgive me for the calls past, present, and future unless you change your number. And even if you do,[1:50:14] Dr. David Berson: I'll be calling. It's Been such a blast, Annie. You know, this has been a a a great session, and it's always fun talking to you. It always gets my, brain racing. So, thank you.[1:50:27] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor David Berson. By now, you should have a much clearer of how the brain is organized and how it works to do all the incredible things that it does.

And while supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive benefit from them for things like sleep or focus or or anxiety relief and so on.[1:51:33] Andrew Huberman: One issue with the supplement industry, however, is that oftentimes, the quality will really vary across brands. That's why we partnered with Thorne, t h o r I n e, because Thorne supplements are of the absolute highest standards in terms of the quality of the ingredients they include The precision of the amounts of the ingredients they include. In other words, what's listed on the bottle is what's actually found in the bottle, which is not true of many supplements out there that have been tested. If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.com/theletteru/huberman. And there, you can see the supplements that I take, and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.[1:52:09] Andrew Huberman: And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site through that portal, thorne.com slash the letter u slash Huberman, you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne happens to make. If you're not already following Huberman Lab on Instagram and Twitter, feel to do so. Both places, I regularly post short video posts or text posts that give tools related to health and so forth. And most of the time, that information is non overlapping with the information on the podcast. Again, it's just Huberman Lab on Instagram and Twitter.[1:52:39] Andrew Huberman: And last but not least, thank you for your interest in science.
