Kronikle AI - Chris Voss: How to Succeed at Hard Conversations | Huberman Lab Podcast - TranscriptChris Voss: How to Succeed at Hard Conversations | Huberman Lab Podcast - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Chris Voss. Chris Voss spent more than 2 decades as an agent with the FBI or Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he was a lead crisis negotiator and a member of the Joint Terrorist task force. Chris is also the author of a phenomenal best selling book entitled Never Split the Difference.[0:00:33] Andrew Huberman: In addition, he has taught courses in negotiation at Harvard, At Georgetown and at the University of Southern California. As a world expert in all forms of negotiation, today, Chris teaches us about how to hold hard conversations where we are seeking particular outcomes or perhaps where we don't know what the optimal outcome could be. He talks about this in the context of business, in the context of relationships, including romantic relationships, but familial and work relationships as well. And he talks about how we should think about ourselves in the context of negotiations so that we can all arrive at the best possible outcomes. Indeed, during today's episode, you will learn to pay attention to emotions, not just other people's emotions, but your own emotions in order to determine whether or not you are processing the information you're hearing accurately, and equally important, whether or not you are being heard accurately When you are in a discussion of any kind, but especially heated discussions.[0:01:29] Andrew Huberman: In addition, we discuss the role of both physical and mental stamina in the context of difficult conversations, Negotiations and decision making. Because in the real world context, oftentimes, those can take place not just within a single conversation, but over the course of several days or even several weeks, months, or years. Chris also teaches us about deception, That is how to determine if somebody is lying by asking particular types of probe questions. Thanks to Chris Voss's both breadth and depth of expertise in the negotiation process that he gleaned during his more than 2 decades service in the FBI, as well as his generosity in sharing that information. By the end of today's episode, You will have an excellent understanding of what the negotiation process is really all about and how to better carry out those negotiations so that they can best serve you and others.[0:02:18] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Plunge. Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile at home self cooling cold plunge for deliberate cold exposure.[0:02:42] Andrew Huberman: I've talked numerous times on this podcast about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure. Deliberate cold exposure, especially deliberate Cold exposure done up to the neck in water can be used to achieve a number of important endpoints related to mental health, physical health, and performance. Plunge uses a powerful cooling filtration and sanitation unit to give you access to deliberate cold exposure in clean water whenever you want. I've been using a plunge for more than 2 years now. I can tell you that it makes it very easy to get your deliberate cold exposure at home.[0:03:12] Andrew Huberman: It doesn't require much cleaning. In fact, it's very easy to keep clean, which is essential. You don't want bacteria and other things growing in your cold plunge. Basically, everything about the plunge is made easy so that anyone, including myself, can get their deliberate cold exposure on a regular basis at home. If you're interested in getting a plunge, you can go to p l u n g e.com/huberman and get $150 off your cold plunge.[0:03:35] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's plunge.com/huberman for $150 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca. Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order you to be able to see clearly in different environments. ROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that you always see with crystal clarity. Originally, their glasses were designed for performance, that is for running and cycling and for sport.[0:04:07] Andrew Huberman: And indeed, they can still be used for performance. They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty. They're extremely lightweight. But I should mention that Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses come in some of the aesthetics more typically associated with Performance glasses like those Cyborg style glasses, but they also have a number of styles that you'd be perfectly comfortable wearing out to dinner or Work. I wear readers at night or when I drive, and I wear sunglasses during the day if I happen to be driving into bright light or outside and it's just Overwhelmingly bright.[0:04:36] Andrew Huberman: I do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight viewing to set my circadian rhythm, and I suggest that you do the same. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to ROKA, r o k a, dot com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your 1st order. Again, that's Roka, r o k a, dot com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. And now for my conversation with Chris Voss. Chris Voss, welcome.[0:05:02] Chris Voss: Andrew, pleasure, man. I've been wanting to talk[0:05:04] Andrew Huberman: to you on record for a while. You are Quite the, what we call in science, n of 1 when somebody is a true sample size of 1. I realized that, yes, you are because you have this incredible skill set from your time in the FBI. You but you also have an incredible Understanding and knowledge of how to communicate about that skill set so that people can glean useful information from it. You are also the guy that I text or call every once in a while when I've, run myself into a jam or when I think I might be in a jam and I won't reveal details, but You tell me whether or not things are okay.[0:05:42] Andrew Huberman: Unfortunately, the last couple times I reached out, you said, you're good. So thank you.[0:05:46] Chris Voss: Always happy to help, man.[0:05:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Thank you. Well, I have a lot of questions today, but what I'd like to start off talking about is negotiations take many forms. But if we could break those down into their broad categories, that will be useful. But before we do that, I wanna know about the mindset that you have when you go into a negotiation and whether or not there are any sort of practices.[0:06:13] Andrew Huberman: I realize You've been in this profession a long time, and so perhaps became reflexive to you at some point. But all of us at some point are gonna go into negotiations, business negotiations, relationship negotiations, etcetera. Is there a process of getting one's mind and body right for a negotiation? You know, shifting from more listening and less talking or, what are there any tools that you use on the regular that could be, useful for us to keep in mind as we extend into the different categories and negotiations and ways to approach those negotiations.[0:06:48] Chris Voss: And it can it can be a couple different first of all, just trying to figure out what what's really going on is is The real issue, and then how can I get an approach where I'm most likely to get the best possible outcome? So there's always more than meets the eye. And there's a certain, there's a certain few cliches, but the real issue is there's always a better deal, Or, there's no deal at all. So first of all, trying to my first thing is I wanna find out whether or not there's a deal at all or whether or not it's a bad deal. And then I'm gonna walk away really fast because those are gonna be complete waste of time.[0:07:31] Chris Voss: It's not a sin to not get the deal. It's a sin to take a long time to not get the deal. What's this in to take a long time to get a bad deal? So I, you know, I wanna know I'm gonna try to figure out real quick Whether or not is there a cutthroat on the other side of the table? Is there somebody I could trust?[0:07:47] Chris Voss: I'm I'm getting I'm leaning a little more inclined to dealing with the difficult people now as long as I don't give in. So I gotta I wanna diagnose early on what the possibilities are. Now If I'm curious, if I'm actually interested. Now another aspect of the mindset is, like, if I'm in a great mood, Like, if I'm just gonna be playful, a couple of really huge personal negotiation wins recently was when I was just trying to be playful. I mean, I was just I was in a great mood, and I'm joking around.[0:08:23] Chris Voss: And great negotiation is not exciting. It's astonishing. I'm in a a we're in conversations right now with a possible non scripted TV show. And so I was telling the producers, you know, this ain't gonna be Real Housewives. For to make this show properly, there ain't gonna be any screaming.[0:08:43] Chris Voss: It's not gonna be Bar Rescue where we're yelling at people. We're not gonna be Hell's Kitchen where we're yelling at people. It's never gonna be exciting, But it is gonna be astonishing. Like, you'll get outcomes where suddenly you find yourself in a place like, what in the world? How did that just happen?[0:09:03] Chris Voss: And so I I lose a suitcase in an airport the other day. And I'm walking into the lost luggage place, and I'm in a great mood because I'm home, and I'm happy to be home. And I'm gonna get a good night's sleep. And even though it's late in the day, I'm just happy. And now you're ready to walk into this the lost luggage store where these people are battered children.[0:09:25] Chris Voss: Like, they expect you they know that you expect them to wave a magic wand, and poof, your luggage is gonna be there. So for whatever reason, that's what I say when I walk in the doors. Young lady says, how can how can I help you? Well, first of all, how you could help me is obvious I'm in a lost luggage. There's only one reason I'm in it.[0:09:43] Chris Voss: So that's kind of a silly question. And I go, I need you to wave a magic wand. And she just laughs, and she looks at me. She ends up walking me out to the carousel, climbing up on the carousel, And she walks down a ramp the luggage comes out of, and I guarantee you they're not supposed to do that. And she sticks her head and she looks around.[0:10:05] Chris Voss: She comes back out, and I've never seen any of these people leave the office, let alone walk back to the carousel. And she says, wait here. And she she disappears into the bowels of the airport, which like looks like a superhighway down there. Right? Like, god knows what it looks like underneath the airport.[0:10:21] Chris Voss: And pretty soon, the carousel starts up again, and my bag and another bag pops up. This other poor shmuck is sitting there waiting. And I'm like, I have never seen anybody do this ever. Like, normally, they say, here here's a number. We'll call you in 24 hours.[0:10:38] Chris Voss: It might show up at your house. And I and I look around at the, there's another young lady there, and I say, you know, please tell her thank you for me. I I gotta go because she she doesn't come back out for, Like, almost 10 minutes. And on my way out, she she comes out the door, and she high fives me. She says, how is that for waving a magic wand?[0:10:59] Chris Voss: And that was the magic phrase, and I never would have said it to her if I wasn't playful in a moment. And I've got a couple of others, like when I was just playful, and I'm joking with people almost at my expense. It's shocking, astonishing, What you can get people to do if you if you hit them the right way.[0:11:20] Andrew Huberman: So interesting. I wonder what it tapped into, but it sounds like It might have tapped into her sense that everybody's always asking me for a magic wand kind of ability, but finally, somebody just Said it directly, and that would be kind of fun to to actually play that role because normally they're restricted to their keyboard and their phone. Yeah.[0:11:38] Chris Voss: You[0:11:39] Andrew Huberman: know? I love that. On the opposite side of that spectrum, if ever you're feeling tense, stressed, jet lagged, angry, you know, I can think about negotiations where, like, People are trying to keep their egos in check. They wanna be right. You know, their breakups, negotiations, there's Not necessarily romantic breakups that could include that, but also professional breakups, you know, the the dissolution of a of a contract or something like that.[0:12:09] Andrew Huberman: Do you ever have to check yourself? Like, okay. I I need to I need to I mean, I imagine being calm is better than not being calm for most most all things. Do you have a process of doing that? You seem like a pretty steady guy.[0:12:23] Andrew Huberman: I've never seen you, loot.[0:12:27] Chris Voss: Overall, I'm pretty steady. Well, the late night FM DJ voice That, I'm not sure that I coined the phrase, but kinda famous for, to calm you down also calms me down. Mhmm. So if I get bent out of shape, I will and the conversation gets heated, I'll switch into that voice With the intention of of calming you down, because it you know, that's the that's the hostage negotiator's voice. But it'll calm me down too.[0:13:02] Chris Voss: Like, intentionally going to that voice tamps down the negative emotions, which I'm convinced make me dumber in the moment, Interfere with my capacity to process information. Got reasons for that. Layman's reasons. No scientific academically rigorous studies that have been in any journals.[0:13:20] Andrew Huberman: Well, after you you're done, I'm gonna tell you something that will perhaps be astonishing to you as to why there's real neuroscience behind that late night FM DJ voice Having an impact on other people's brains.[0:13:32] Chris Voss: But I yeah. And and I'll do that because it calms me down. Now if I can if I can make the shift, The hard part is a shift into a positive mindset. If I can make that shift, but I can only make it from a calm voice. I also think it's emotions are kind of a rock, paper, scissors sequence.[0:13:54] Chris Voss: I don't think you can go from sadness to elation directly. Sad, depressed, down. I think there's something to, getting angry to pull you out of sadness. And I think if you're angry, you've gotta go to calm next. And so but if I can get out of anger and go to calm, Then I can say something to myself like, the reality is this is a luxury problem, or I was in a negotiation with a counterpart that I knew was deceiving, lying to me.[0:14:28] Chris Voss: And I remember saying to myself, you know, I'm lucky to be in this negotiation. Mean, they wouldn't they wouldn't be trying to hustle me if we weren't really good, if we didn't have a product that was phenomenal. I wouldn't be targeted at at all, so I'm actually lucky to be in this conversation. So if I can make that next shift emotionally, then I'm good. The hard part is making those shifts.[0:14:52] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna just share with you what I learned recently about sound and emotion. I'm researching an episode on music and the brain. Fascinating topic.[0:15:03] Chris Voss: Yeah. Believe it[0:15:03] Andrew Huberman: or not, there's a lot known. And the auditory system has this property where, of course, there are neurons and nerve cells that respond to different frequencies of sound. Low Low frequency, you know, deeper tones, and high frequency squeals and that sort of thing. Right. Okay.[0:15:19] Andrew Huberman: That's pretty straightforward. Just like we have neurons that respond to different different colors or different, you know, angles of light in in the room. Right. But what I learned and I confirmed with a good friend of mine who's a auditory neuroscientist and and neurosurgeon's name is Eddie Chang, who was a Guest on this podcast previously is that low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is, that late night FM DJ voice, are responded to in the brain by neurons. No surprise there.[0:15:52] Andrew Huberman: But the frequency that those neurons fire is also low frequency. In other words, when you speak in your low voice Right. The other person's brain hears that and starts firing in a low frequency tone. In other words, it entrains to your voice, Not just the timing, but it's actually like you're essentially playing an emotional piano down in the low keys of their[0:16:20] Chris Voss: Alright.[0:16:20] Andrew Huberman: Of their mind. Now when you go up to the high frequencies, the neurons can't follow that high frequency. So there's something special about low frequency sound that actually changes the emotional tone of the people that hear that low frequency sound. This is wild. Right?[0:16:38] Andrew Huberman: I mean I mean, of course, the content of the words matters too. But, anyway, there's there's real neuroscience to support, The voice that you were endowed with and that you, that you employed for your work.[0:16:49] Chris Voss: Well, then and then also the point then too is it's not the other side is not making a choice. It's an involuntary reaction.[0:16:54] Andrew Huberman: That's right. This is not something one can override, except by perhaps plugging their ears. Right. Right.[0:17:00] Chris Voss: Right.[0:17:00] Andrew Huberman: If they're hearing that, their their mind is getting shifted toward a state of low frequency oscillation, which is one of more calm.[0:17:09] Chris Voss: Yeah.[0:17:10] Andrew Huberman: So that yeah. So that's a real thing. And and were you to have a high squeaky chipmunks, boys. You might not have been the negotiator. You would although, who knows?[0:17:19] Andrew Huberman: Maybe there'd be another tactic there. I mean, I I think back to the, what I guess it was during one of the Gulf War campaigns whether they weren't they trying to squeeze out, Saddam and some of, his people by playing, like, milli vanilli at high volume for hours and hours. Is that tactic actually used?[0:17:39] Chris Voss: So that that was that was, Panama they were trying to get Noriega Okay.[0:17:43] Andrew Huberman: So I'm only a few I'm only a few countries over.[0:17:45] Chris Voss: You see, you know, I I had 1 ocean or I get the trivia. You know? I was telling you before and the wacky, fascinating, useless information around terrorism and stuff like that. I tried that at at Panama, and and for whatever the military guys, They were playing music and and sounds. And then, also, among the many stupid things that the FBI did at Waco, Then late at night, they tried that in the Waco compound too.[0:18:12] Chris Voss: And it was just that was one of the things that the hostage negotiators were adamantly against Admittedly against, but they got overruled, by oncine command, among the many stupid things that were done at Waco That was also done in Waco. It was stupid. It's counterproductive. Hostage negotiators were always against it.[0:18:31] Andrew Huberman: So for those of you who don't remember Waco, Waco is, Branch Davidians, David Koresh. Right?[0:18:36] Chris Voss: Yeah. There was a, Netflix series that was out about it recently that's fair, about the how how it went down?[0:18:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Sad ending. He eventually set the the building ablaze, killed himself and everybody else.[0:18:50] Chris Voss: And People inside set the building on fire.[0:18:52] Andrew Huberman: Including a lot of children, Parrish.[0:18:54] Chris Voss: Including some children. Yeah. Some there are some, FBI agents that have still not gotten over that.[0:18:59] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to talk about Some different types of negotiations. Oftentimes, I think because you're a former FBI negotiator, We have to terrorist task force, this kind of thing. We tend to focus on the negative negotiations. Right? Get the hostages away, and we'll talk about that stuff.[0:19:18] Andrew Huberman: Breakups, business deals that have gone wrong, people lying, cheating. What about negotiations that are benevolent? Let's say that 2 people want to, come to a a true win win around, you know, what they each see to be their best interest in, Let's say friendship. 2 friends taking a trip together on vacation. Who's gonna pay for what?[0:19:42] Andrew Huberman: Who's gonna pay up front? Are people gonna pay each other back? Or a romantic relationship? 2 people are considering, you know, fusing finances to some extent or moving in together. What sorts of Questions should people be asking themselves prior to those negotiations?[0:19:59] Andrew Huberman: In particular, is it very important that people know exactly what they want Going into a negotiation or I can recall many times when I've gone into life circumstances Knowing I wanted a certain set of feelings or outcomes, but not being extremely specific about, you know, I want this salary. I want to live in, You know, in a west facing house on this particular location, you know, an exploration, can of potentials, I think can also take the form of negotiation. So Yeah. How how should people think about approaching benevolent negotiations? Like, where we're not talking about something tragic happening if it doesn't go through.[0:20:38] Andrew Huberman: It might hurt. It might be a little bit high friction, but Let's talk about how to get to a win win.[0:20:45] Chris Voss: Yeah. Well, there's there's couple interesting things there. First of all, you know, the phrase win win, because win win is just great collaboration. I mean, in point of fact, it should be win win, which might only be emotional win win. Now the phraseology win win, I know that if Someone's opens a negotiation with me, and they say right off the bat, look.[0:21:09] Chris Voss: I wanna do a win win deal with you. That Correlates extremely highly with someone who's trying to pick my pocket. So I if you use that phrase in the first 5 minutes, I already know where you're coming from. You're trying to get me to drop my guards. You win, I lose.[0:21:28] Chris Voss: So and this came up on an Instagram post I put up recently, Which is essentially watch watch out for the person that says win win. Now I didn't say win win is bad. I said watch out for the person that says it. Also, you gotta be cautious if if you like some of the win win mindset, And people set themselves up to just get slaughtered by the person who's expressing a desire for win win and looking to pick their pocket. Like, if I feel win win in my heart, you go, let's do a win win deal.[0:22:03] Chris Voss: If I don't watch it, I'm like, okay. What do you want? And then I find myself giving away the store. So there's a lot behind the win win phraseology that you have to have a complete understanding of. In point of fact, All sides should feel good about the outcome.[0:22:17] Chris Voss: And isn't that the definition of win win? Well, kinda, sorta, But it's how they feel about it more than really what they got. So in a benevolent negotiation Among friends, where are we gonna go to eat? Where are we going on vacation? What route are we gonna take?[0:22:36] Chris Voss: People really just wanna be heard out More than anything else, which operationally seems to be I don't understand how it's gonna make any difference. Makes all the difference in the world. And how what's the best way for somebody to feel heard out? Well, I'm gonna start out by telling you describing to you, not telling you, But describing to you what my best guess is on your perspective because it's really calibrating me Actually finding out where your position is. And the only way I can find out where your position actually is, I'm gonna I'm gonna increase you telling me if I start taking a guess at it first because you immediately right away, you you immediately gonna tell me either I'm right or I'm wrong.[0:23:23] Chris Voss: You're gonna correct me. Correction is, is a satisfying thing to do, And you're gonna be much more candid with me if you're correcting me than if I'm asking you. So I'll and you'll feel good about correcting me. It's gonna there's all these great emotional lubricants to me getting you to correct me. So I'm gonna start out by saying, like, here here's here's what I think you're thinking.[0:23:47] Chris Voss: Here's how I think you're approaching this. Here's what I think you're wanting out of this out of this. Not what you should be, But what you probably are based on your perspective and that's gonna accelerate the conversation exponentially. Like, it's ridiculous how much faster things are gonna go. And then it becomes both an in information gathering and a rapport building process simultaneously instead of separately, which is what makes this approach faster even though it seems more indirect.[0:24:17] Chris Voss: So if we're getting ready to let's say you and I are gonna take a car trip to, to San Francisco from here. And I'm gonna say, alright. So my guess is you wanna take the most direct route because you hate wasting time. And you're probably gonna say to me, no. No.[0:24:33] Chris Voss: No. No. No. I wanna go up the Pacific Coast Highway because this beautiful stretch of, country. Like, I realized it's gonna be a waste of time if we go up to Pacific Coast because we gotta jump off it at some point, but I really wanna see the scenery.[0:24:45] Chris Voss: You would have I've taken a guess at what you want, and you're gonna come back real quick and correct me. And then maybe I'm thinking time on the trip, But I've forgotten how beautiful it is to roll up the coast. And so when you throw that out, I'll be like, oh, yeah. It is a beautiful ride, and we might not get another shot. Like, who knows what's gonna happen?[0:25:08] Chris Voss: So, yeah, I know. Now now that we're having a conversation, I'd rather run up the Pacific Coast Highway before we before we go inland and make the trip, and that and that's how we get to, we collaborate For better a better outcome may be a better idea than what I had in mind in the 1st place.[0:25:26] Andrew Huberman: I love that because what you just described is hypothesis testing. Yes. It's the way scientists are trained. You know, many people don't know this, but they teach us in science not to ask questions. But to start with a question, like, you know, I don't know.[0:25:40] Andrew Huberman: How does this, how does the brain develop or something? And then you you say a hypothesis. And you test hypotheses, and then you figure out if they're right or wrong, and that takes you through a set of decision trees, and you eventually get at what you hope is some core truth. And then, hopefully, others arrive there as well, and you get a consensus. So I love the idea of hypothesis testing.[0:25:58] Andrew Huberman: In fact, when you said, take the most direct route from where we are now, in Los Angeles to, San Francisco, I like to take 101, Not the 5. The 5 is faster, so I immediately think but I like 101. First of all, there are a couple really great taco and hamburger spots along the way that I used to stop with my bulldog and get. Also, you get to see it the coast, and it makes those extra 2 hours completely worth it. And so you're exactly right in, in that Working through the decision tree doesn't necessarily mean presuming that the the hypothesis is right, it sounds like you'd be Equally okay with the hypothesis being wrong because, really, what you're trying to do is just learn.[0:26:41] Andrew Huberman: And in learning, Set up this collaboration.[0:26:43] Chris Voss: Yep. I love that. A couple of things. First of all, when you talk about hypothesis and when when my son Brandon was involved in a company, he's on he's Out on his own now, but he used to always say hypothesis. Test your hypothesis.[0:26:55] Chris Voss: He always used that term. And then even now, like, we were talking about it and you just said You knew some hot dog and hamburger places, I'd be like, holy cow. I didn't even know that. Yeah. And, yeah, I wanna check those places out.[0:27:07] Chris Voss: So that's how you discover new stuff in a conversation.[0:27:10] Andrew Huberman: I love it. So, and, also, I'm sure people are noting to not say the words win win when approaching any kind of negotiation. What what do you think it is about those little, catchphrases that that signal lack of authenticity or trustworthiness? Is gonna be a win win for both of us. Now I know to never say that with you, but you could imagine that somebody really means that.[0:27:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But for you, it sounds like it's a flag that, they're trying to pull one over.[0:27:45] Chris Voss: It's it's, it correlates really strongly with the people that are definitely trying to cut your throat, And I've had I've had him admit that to me candidly. Amazing. Like, I'll be, I've experienced it. Like, if somebody throws win win out early to me, I'll say, alright. I think I know where this is going, but let me explore it.[0:28:06] Chris Voss: And they'll say, yeah. You know, this is a great opportunity for you. That's another top. And we're gonna put you in a room with all these billionaires, and there's gonna be All this opportunity for you if you just come in and speak, and, you know, we don't have a budget.[0:28:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, I've gotten that one before. Yeah. The The the famous that the famous, the world war would just work out in your favor because Magic. Because it's gonna work out in my favor.[0:28:30] Chris Voss: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Right.[0:28:32] Andrew Huberman: Been I've been on the receiving end of those offers many a time. Fascinating. Conversely, what sorts of openers, do you think established the best rapport and, you know, benevolent discovery of a topic?[0:28:48] Chris Voss: Well, what I'm seeing correlates Real strongly with people I wanna do business with, if if they figured out something that they know is valuable for me and they've just done it, and they've just offered it, Like, right off the bat, no strings attached. They they found a way to drop something on me that's valuable. They didn't approach me with their hand out. They approached me with some sort of generosity. Like, a friend of mine, Joe Polish, runs this Outfit called Genius Network, Joe says life gives to a giver.[0:29:21] Chris Voss: I Joe did a bunch of favors for me before I ever joined. And he was trying to help me out and get my book sold, and he asked me to come in and speak. And he'd he'd done a he'd Emphasize my book on his podcast and in different conversations, and I, you know, I I finally paid the fee to join because he had done so much for me. Like, there's not much Joe could ask me for right now because he's done so much for me that He gets a blanket pretty much, yes, right away. What do you want?[0:29:51] Chris Voss: What what do you want? What do you need? Because he's just generous. And the generosity approach, Universally, I'm seeing a lot of really successful people that lead by generosity. And so if if you start out That, you know, if you if you give me a 5 star review of the book on Amazon, no strings attached or anything.[0:30:13] Chris Voss: Like, that goes a long, long way to somebody who wants to establish a long term relationship collaboration.[0:30:20] Andrew Huberman: When I first opened my laboratory In, 2011, I had a technician at the time, who had been a technician for a lot of years. And there's this culture in science of People borrowing things from laboratories and not giving them back or breaking them. These can be little things like a, you know, a small instrument or a A forceps, but, you know, as a student or postdoc, these are the things that you covet. Like, a really nice pair of forceps is like a great thing. You know?[0:30:46] Andrew Huberman: You drop them once. They're not They're not good anymore, by the way. It's like they're they're[0:30:49] Chris Voss: Oh, wow.[0:30:49] Andrew Huberman: You have to treat them with respect. Surgical tools have to be treated with respect. These are very fine instruments, And people used to come by our lab all the time and borrow stuff from us, and he'd always lend it out.[0:31:00] Chris Voss: And I was like, what[0:31:01] Andrew Huberman: are you doing? But anytime I went to go borrow something, he'd say, do not borrow anything from anybody else because then we're gonna owe them. Right now, everybody owes us everything.[0:31:11] Chris Voss: And I[0:31:12] Andrew Huberman: was like, you're running up our budget, giving away these instruments. They come back with the forceps, dentists, and he said, just trust me. This is the way to do it. And I don't recall ever, Quote, unquote cashing in on any of that, but he was exactly right. When I eventually decide to move institutions, we've given away so much, And we had asked for so very little, maybe nothing, that you know, it's when you leave a place, typically, there can be a little bad blood, and all we got was sorry to see you go kind of stuff.[0:31:39] Andrew Huberman: Had it been me, I would have been in a kind of a an exchange of, oh, we ask for things. We give things. You know? It's kind of a neighborhood. I grew up in a neighborhood where you'd borrow Eggs are milk from the neighbor.[0:31:48] Andrew Huberman: Remember those days?[0:31:49] Chris Voss: Yeah.[0:31:49] Andrew Huberman: I don't know if people do that any longer. But I think it falls well into what you're describing that, You know, when when you just do things for people, out of goodness, then, you know, sure, you sort of have a A history where you could return to that they owe you, but there's also just something good about just doing things out of goodness Yep. And also not asking for so much, and expecting people to provide that. So I I love that, and I actually, I love providing good reviews for things I like. You know, on the phone when, you know, the airline that don't do the same more.[0:32:27] Andrew Huberman: We book our own flights, but anytime I get help on the phone and, you know, if it's really great help, I'll say, how can I help? And they'll say, oh, it would mean a lot if you would send an email to this to my business, just saying I I did a great job or[0:32:38] Chris Voss: something like that.[0:32:39] Andrew Huberman: And I actually really enjoy doing that. So, I love the points you're making because they're very actionable. As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, But oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings.[0:33:07] Andrew Huberman: But with AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adapt Gins to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one. I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better, and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer, AG one.[0:33:28] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try AG one, go to drinkagone.com Slash Huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2. Again, That's drink a g one.com/huberman. Shifting slightly into the more, let's call them High friction, negotiations are the types of negotiations where there is the potential for a truly bad outcome. Right.[0:33:55] Andrew Huberman: I know you've been asked this before, but some of our listeners are going to be learning about you for the first time. Do you recall Of the many negotiations that you did while in the FBI, any one particular negotiation that felt like if this doesn't work out, This is really catastrophic, and would you be willing to share that with us?[0:34:17] Chris Voss: Well, I learned A young man named Jeff Schelling was grabbed by terrorist group, Abu Sayed, and, he ended up walking away because we we stole the bad guys long enough that we just you know, sometimes if you can slow it down, You wait for something good to fall out of the sky, and it will. And that ended up happening in that case, and the bad guy Ends up calling the negotiator that I coached on a phone after it was over to basically tell him that they still had a good relationship. It was nuts. Why does a bad guy Call the negotiator that's responsible for him losing everything and say, you know, you did a good job, which is exactly what happened. So we roll into a case, and I hadn't had anything go bad at that point in time.[0:35:23] Chris Voss: A very nice case, a Burnhams and Barrel case, by a different faction of the terrorist group. 13 months later, ends up in 2 to 3 remaining hostages shot and killed by friendly fire. On along the way, have been executed. American had been executed early on, and it was it was a train wreck. And lots of people got killed all along the way and just really ridiculous bad things happening, and that that was bad all the way through.[0:35:56] Chris Voss: So we learned, you know, Learned a lot from it. Went back and checked everything we did, and we didn't do anything wrong that we felt, Based on our strategy, didn't didn't miss anything, and that was why I ended up going, collaborating with the guys at Harvard because my reaction was if this If we did everything we know how to do and it wasn't enough, that means we're not smart enough. We gotta get better. And so that case taught me a lot about The dynamics that really happen on the other side and the difference between, you know, whether Now people are really on your side. The US government was not highly collaborative.[0:36:37] Chris Voss: The Philippine government was not highly collaborative. The everybody wanted to get their pounded flesh out of the other out of the other side. I mean, just everything bad that you can imagine. Early on when Guillermo Sabero, was murdered By the Abu Sayef, it was a national holiday in the Philippines, and the bad guys had a history of killing people on national holidays. And we were in front of Philippines, and we had no idea that that day was a national holiday.[0:37:05] Chris Voss: And we showed up at, Philippine National Police Headquarters in Manila, and it was closed. Now we got an on well, I got an ongoing hostage case with bad guys Threatening to kill hostages, and we show up at the gates. And the gates are closed, and we're like, what the hell is going on here? It was a national holiday, and nobody's working today. I'm like, first of all, nobody told us that.[0:37:29] Chris Voss: Secondly, I don't think the bad guys really care that it's a national holiday and nobody's working. Our negotiator is nowhere to be found. We got we got a we got a guy there that, the previous negotiator we worked with, Philippine National Police was not that happy that they didn't have him under complete control, so they give us a guy that Will not tell us anything until after he's told them. So he's having conversations with the bad guys, and we're actually hearing about them secondhand. He didn't show up that day.[0:37:59] Chris Voss: And then and, of course, that day, the bad guys announced they're gonna kill, kill a hostage, and give it as a gift to a country of the Philippines because it's a holiday. And then go, oh, by the way, they like doing this on holidays. And we're so and and Guillermo started getting his head cut off With the because of all the warring factions on our side of the table not telling each other what the hell is going on. So I had assumed at that point in time that people tell us the stuff we need to know we didn't need to ask. And and after that, I got like, look.[0:38:34] Chris Voss: There ain't nothing here that I don't need to I don't if it's a holiday coming up, then you assume I know. You you gotta tell us. So really learned a lot about collaboration on our side of the table And, also, the lack of collaboration on the other side of the table. Just because we're a mess doesn't mean they got their act together, and the bad guys didn't have their act together. And, ultimately, the hostages, one of the reasons someone didn't come out because internally, they they had double crossed each other.[0:39:03] Chris Voss: So learned a lot about what really fundamental human nature dynamics are in teams, and your team has not got its act together And the other team does not either. So what can you do as a communicator to make up for that? Really learned a lot about that in that case. I had cases subsequent to that involving Al Qaeda when Al Qaeda was killing people on a regular basis. But we saw those coming, and we did everything we could do to keep the train from smashing into us.[0:39:31] Chris Voss: You see a train coming down the tracks. You know it's coming down the tracks, and you do the best you can to derail it, and sometimes you can't.[0:39:40] Andrew Huberman: I've heard it said that When people take somebody captive that they either want their money, their body, or their life, or some combination of those.[0:39:52] Chris Voss: Yeah. It's it's probably one of those 3. Yeah. That's very true.[0:39:56] Andrew Huberman: And as the Negotiator trying to rescue the hostage. Is it important to identify early on which of those 3 or which all of those 3, thereafter, like, how serious they are. Are they willing to actually kill the hostage? Are they, You know, will they go for any amount of money above x number of dollars?[0:40:19] Chris Voss: Right. Right. Right.[0:40:20] Andrew Huberman: I'm trying to figure out their threshold. Right? I mean because the person is On the other side is gambling. Right? They're gambling their their freedom.[0:40:27] Andrew Huberman: They're gambling their, reputation with whoever their reputation matters to. Is it important to get into the mindset of the person you're negotiating with quickly, using the hypothesis, generating method.[0:40:42] Chris Voss: Yeah.[0:40:43] Andrew Huberman: And if so, could you give an example of of how that played out in in your previous work?[0:40:50] Chris Voss: Yeah. The, the indicators are really there. I mean, once you sort of, lose your illusions about how you think How you think things should play out. Then the patterns of behavior are generally pretty quick, and clear. And Just because you don't like the patterns, like with Al Qaeda, we recognize the patterns, and knowing what they are doesn't mean you can change what they are.[0:41:14] Chris Voss: And Al Qaeda in 2004's time frame was very clear about killing people on deadline, and we had to recognize that. So there there there becomes a pattern of behavior, and it's usually specificity in what they say. And this is this is all this is all human nature. Like, if if If you're in a business negotiation and they say, you know, we're gonna do something horrible here. You know?[0:41:39] Chris Voss: We're gonna walk out. You know, that's fairly nonspecific. And if they say, look. If we don't get this by this specific deadline, if we don't get these specific things met by this specific time, That's pretty specific. That it's specificity.[0:41:55] Chris Voss: You're looking for it. I learned to look forward in kidnapping negotiations. We're working a case again in the Philippines, And the bad guys say, you know, if, if we don't get a ransom for the son, 17 year old boy at the time he's kidnapped, You know, you tell his father he's gonna lose an egg, and that's a youth youth euphemism for losing a child. And early on, when that threat came through on our side of the table, everybody's like, oh my god. They're gonna kill them.[0:42:22] Chris Voss: You know, this is really bad. We gotta make sure the family can pay the ransom. I'm like, no. No. No.[0:42:26] Chris Voss: No. No. It didn't it didn't say when it was gonna happen. They didn't say how it was gonna happen. They didn't say who was gonna do it.[0:42:35] Chris Voss: You know, the basic specificity of who, what, when, and where. Like, they left themselves an out here, a very clear out. And we never said we were gonna do it. We never said when it was gonna happen. We never said which child.[0:42:48] Chris Voss: You know, what? They're just trying to scare you. They're throwing out something vague. Said we got we got plenty of time to play with this. We gotta we gotta push this all the way through the process until the end.[0:42:59] Chris Voss: Now later on in that case, When the family tried to deliver a ransom and it was screwed up by god knows who, the bad guys came up back on the phone and they said, if we don't get paid tomorrow, your son dies. And I said, alright. Now that's specific. And these guys sound like they mean it. So we're gonna have to make sure this thing goes down tomorrow or that's the end of this kit.[0:43:27] Chris Voss: And at that point in time, we allowed the family we were in a a position to allow or disallow. We were in a position to offer thoughts, and our thoughts were, they mean it now, and you need to do something now or likely something bad's gonna happen. And now that they're this serious, because you always gotta worry about what we used to refer to as a double dip. Do they take the money and then and they come back and say, no. That was a down payment.[0:43:59] Chris Voss: That wasn't The ransom, that was just a down payment. You gotta make sure you don't get double dipped if you let the family pay. And you gotta give them your honest opinion as to whether or not they're gonna let the go off your pain now? And our our thoughts were, you pay him tomorrow, your son's coming out, and he did.[0:44:18] Andrew Huberman: The double dip is a scary thing to hear about. At a much lower level, meaning more minor level, people sometimes get shaken down online. You know, like, their password will get taken. There are people everywhere who Go for the click on this link. You know, you get a text message.[0:44:38] Andrew Huberman: You know, we've identified that your account has, you know, been changed. Verify. You click on the link, Takes you someplace where you put in your login and password and boom, it's gone. And then they try and sell it back to you, typically through cryptocurrency because it's not traceable.[0:44:52] Chris Voss: By the way, those those negotiations can be a lot of fun if you let them.[0:44:56] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm hoping that our discussion about this now is going to save some people, the trouble of having their their accounts hacked. I've known people who've had their accounts hacked, and these are some smart people. But what's interesting is that I've also observed those situations where somebody gets to the point where they say, you know, I'm just gonna give them what they want. And I I remember in this one particular instance Saying, no. No.[0:45:17] Andrew Huberman: No. Do not give them the money because then they're just gonna say they want more. There's no there's no guarantee that they're gonna give you back what you want. Right. And why would they?[0:45:27] Andrew Huberman: Right? If you think about it, why would they? The money funnels in, and, like, they just can pivot and go to the next thing. So how do you, gain confidence that you are likely to be double dipped or not.[0:45:41] Chris Voss: Well, first of all, I gotta find out If, you know, if they're in a position to carry out the threat or if they're in any sort of legitimate position to begin with, you know, for lack of a better term, it's proof of life. And there are a lot of people that are trying to scam you, but they don't really have the ability to scam you. So you gotta find out you know, do do some confirmation. Do they Do they have access to your account? Do they do they have your data?[0:46:05] Chris Voss: Do they have your money? Do do they have it in a position, or are they just trying to make you believe that they have that position of influence on you. There are a lot of a lot of the bad guys out there that are just rolling a dice dialing for dollars, if you will. And if they don't scam you when they have no leverage on you, they'll find somebody else that'll give in. So there's a bit of, you know, authenticity, Are are they in a position to do it?[0:46:30] Chris Voss: And, the same rule applies in any negotiation. The other side is gonna give in when they feel like they've gotten everything they can. Kidnappers, I'd be asked by an ambassador, asked by an FBI commander when is this gonna be over, when the bad guys feel like they've gotten everything they could. Not when they did, When they felt like they did. So our job is just make them feel it sooner.[0:46:58] Chris Voss: So, you know, how how hard you make it Innocently on the other side. Everybody everybody wants to feel like they did a they got a good day's pay for a good day's work. So if you let them feel like they're in charge and you make them work By asking them innocent how and what questions, which are very hard and fatiguing to answer, Then you're gonna get to the point where you're gonna get a solid outcome where you don't get double dipped, and they're gonna be happy that it's over because they felt like they got everything they could. It Could be your data. It could be your bank account.[0:47:37] Chris Voss: Could be anything. The other side is gonna be satisfied with the outcome when they feel like they worked for it. And in in business negotiations, you're selling your car. And some you put a price Tag on your car, and a guy walks up to you and says, I'll give you full amount right now. What's your reaction?[0:47:56] Chris Voss: I should ask for more. Maybe I won't sell my car. You know? Every human interaction, the other side wants to feel like that they earned what they got. And so the idea of empathy and hostage negotiations is really just to make them feel that sooner.[0:48:15] Andrew Huberman: We're gonna come back to empathy because it's such a big and important topic, but I've heard it said before that if somebody You don't know, but maybe also somebody you know, places a real sense of urgency on, you know, need the money now or, I need you to do something right away or else, not a threat of physical violence, but that any request for, expediting something is a red flag Yeah. That it's likely to be a scam. You know, very seldom, do you need to click on the link within 24 hours? Right? I mean, how could that possibly be?[0:48:56] Andrew Huberman: Right?[0:48:57] Chris Voss: Right. Right.[0:48:57] Andrew Huberman: But we but that's one way in which people are exploited.[0:49:00] Chris Voss: Yep.[0:49:01] Andrew Huberman: That some request comes in by phone or by, you know, email or text or Maybe even person, somebody says, you know, you need to do this right now or else something bad is gonna happen. Capture people's sense of urgency. Get them to make a mistake, and then they're They're left reeling because that request for something right now or else, I think, hits a a a fundamental nerve in us.[0:49:24] Chris Voss: You know? They wanna help. To be a rescuer.[0:49:26] Andrew Huberman: Right. So, is that a good rule of thumb for people to keep in mind? To to not[0:49:31] Chris Voss: I think that's a great rule of thumb. I mean, I I a friend of mine, somebody got a hold of his phone number not that long ago, and, I got I was getting texts from his number. Sound like, look, man. I got some real problems. Look.[0:49:44] Chris Voss: I I need some money from you now. It was a friend, a friend's number. And, I remember when I first saw it actually, if when I first saw it, I was really busy, and I felt bad that I didn't get back to him that day. And then I didn't hear from him again, and so I thought, well, whatever it was, you worked it out. So a couple weeks later, I I get the text again.[0:50:05] Chris Voss: You got a real problem. You gotta get back to me right now. So I'm I'm I decide, if it's really my buddy, I am gonna help him right now. Gotta make sure it's really my buddy. And I said, hey, man.[0:50:18] Chris Voss: You know, you didn't raise this at all last time I saw him in Vegas because I'd seen him in Vegas recently, and he's like, yeah. You know, I was busy. I couldn't bring it up. And something like ours, there's no direct confirmation or denial. We had we had breakfast together in Vegas.[0:50:36] Chris Voss: So then I shoot back. I said, like, And, man, I gotta tell you something. That was such a crazy night, and I still owe you money from them. So, you know, that night when we were gambling, I I still owe you money. I'm happy to help.[0:50:49] Chris Voss: Now it wasn't a crazy night. It was breakfast, and I didn't owe him money. And his next response was like, yeah. Don't worry about it. You know?[0:50:56] Chris Voss: You can make that up from For to me with this, something like, alright. Cool. So now I start making stuff up. And I said, you know And when we were with those strippers and that dog and the clown and the pony, I'll never get over that. And so now the guys, what are you talking about?[0:51:14] Chris Voss: And I said, by the way and then I started throwing in some stuff about his wife and his mother, and the guy got insulted and called me names and stopped texting me. And then I then I sent all those text messages to the real guy, including, you know, what I'd said about his mother, And he texted me back. He's got a great sense of humor. He says, by the way, my mom does think you're attractive.[0:51:37] Andrew Huberman: Oh, man. I think[0:51:38] Chris Voss: But I start I started it all by just Checking the source. Mhmm. If it was my friend, I woulda helped him immediately. And I need to throw something at him That's gonna confirm that it's him, and then I'm there for him. But I'm also gonna have put a little bit of a curve in there that that if he doesn't catch, I know it's I know it's a con, and then I'm gonna have fun[0:52:00] Andrew Huberman: with it. Incredible knowledge that, you know, people will hear this and they might think, oh, you know, that's never gonna happen to me. But Like I said, I had known family members and friends who they make the mistake. They take the bait of clicking on the link, and then now they're getting the shakedown. Actually, a good friend of mine said that her parents called at some point.[0:52:24] Andrew Huberman: Her parents are probably in their late seventies now. Someone had called their house and told them that their child, this woman, had been Kidnapped[0:52:37] Chris Voss: Right.[0:52:37] Andrew Huberman: And that they needed to send money.[0:52:38] Chris Voss: Right.[0:52:39] Andrew Huberman: And that if they called the police, they'd kill her or harm her in some way. Right. So they started sending money, and they were afraid to contact her. And you can see, like, what a bind a a loving parent would be in. Right?[0:52:51] Andrew Huberman: They obviously don't wanna get this Child of theirs hurt, and they obviously are willing to do whatever it takes in order to get them back. Turns out it's total scam.[0:53:00] Chris Voss: Right.[0:53:00] Andrew Huberman: Because eventually, there was communication that made them realize that their their daughter was perfectly okay and never even interacted with kidnappers. So those kinds of scams happen pretty often.[0:53:10] Chris Voss: I've heard that happen to a friend also.[0:53:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So the sense of urgency should have been the first flag.[0:53:17] Chris Voss: That's a that's a great point. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And and look.[0:53:21] Chris Voss: Look. Even if they've got your loved one, The secondary issue is if you do what they want, are they gonna let them go? Which is actually a legitimate question. Like, if there really are bad guys, one of the things we learned in hostage negotiation that apply to business negotiation, There are legitimate questions that it's okay to ask. You you're not being disrespectful.[0:53:45] Chris Voss: You're not pushing back. There's there are fair, you know, to use the f bomb, fair, legitimate questions that you can ask under any circumstances, which is basically, you know, if I comply, is this gonna work out the way that you're articulating it? Anything that adds Communication into it, which gives you more information to find out what the ultimate outcome looks like. Even in kidnappings, How do you know that how do you know that if you pay, they're gonna let them go? That's a legitimate question.[0:54:21] Andrew Huberman: There are examples somewhere in between, you know, getting your Instagram account hacked, your bank account hacked, and you god forbid, your child kidnapped. For instance, there's a whole Practice within the legal profession of probing to see whether or not somebody is gonna give up money to avoid a lawsuit, for instance. Right? This is, actually, a lawyer friend of mine recently described their job very well. He said, in his words, first person, he said, I scare people for money.[0:54:54] Andrew Huberman: The operative word being scare people.[0:54:56] Chris Voss: It's being and it's being honest.[0:54:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He's being very honest. He scares people for money. He's very good at it. And, and he understands how other people scare people for money, and he works both sides, you know, and, plaintiff for defense type situations.[0:55:09] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, it made me realize that, you know, a lot of the legal profession is not, okay, the lawsuit slid across the table. It's the okay. Here's what the lawsuit would look like. Here are all the statutes that potentially were were violated, and then there's a probe of, like, What somebody's finances are and, you know, how much they're willing to pay, and do they have liability insurance? Do they have an umbrella policy?[0:55:30] Andrew Huberman: All the sorts of things that are that are really it's not necessarily an illegal shakedown, but it's, you know, a probing as to whether or not, You know? There's it's worth the effort.[0:55:42] Chris Voss: Diagnosing the other side's ability to pay.[0:55:44] Andrew Huberman: You're right. And so that happens really often. I can give a specific example where, Somebody had a incident at a dog park where their dog Allegedly ran into somebody, maybe charged at somebody. You know, dog park people are standing around, and the person moved and and and apparently injured their knee. But rather than sue the owner of the dog, what they typically do is deliver some set of documents that say, you know, I was, injured.[0:56:15] Andrew Huberman: Your dog was responsible for this. And if you don't settle up for x number of dollars, You're gonna be sued for usually an exorbitant amount[0:56:26] Chris Voss: above that. Right. Right. Right. And then[0:56:27] Andrew Huberman: there's this question that the the lawyers have to figure out. Like, is it puffery? Right? Are they saying, oh, I'm gonna sue you for $4,000,000. Is there any basis for that?[0:56:33] Andrew Huberman: And good lawyers will say, that's puffery. They're they're trying to scare you with a big number. But a lot of people See that number and go, oh my goodness. Yep. What do they want?[0:56:42] Andrew Huberman: You know what? Like, I don't even know if they were injured. If they were, that's terrible. I'd want that taken care of. If My dog's response, well, I don't want that taken care of, but what what do they need in order to make this this go away?[0:56:53] Chris Voss: Right.[0:56:53] Andrew Huberman: And that happens millions of times A day throughout the country, and a good portion of those probably happen here in California because there's a that's kind of the way the legal system is arranged.[0:57:03] Chris Voss: Right.[0:57:04] Andrew Huberman: So this is not Somebody, you know, it could be somebody manipulating the law. It could also be somebody who's being entirely honest about their experience of being injured by somebody else's dog. So under those conditions, I mean, it sounds like the same set of rules apply. You wanna know how serious they are. Do they have a case, so to speak?[0:57:24] Andrew Huberman: That's the the work of the lawyers. But in assessing how serious somebody is, you said You it's fair. You called it the f word. I like that. I'll never forget that.[0:57:34] Andrew Huberman: It just ask a fair question. Like like, how much money do you think you deserve? Or, is that would that be a good example of a very direct question? Or is it, how likely are you to walk away if we don't give you the money? Like, you know, is there I mean, because I could imagine there's all sorts of reasons why people would be dishonest about about answering those questions.[0:57:54] Chris Voss: Well and then, how much money you think you could deserve, you deserve is is a really good question, not necessarily what the answer is, but how they answer it. You you're you're gonna get how quickly they fire back and whether or not they stop and think about it. How and what questions typically are best to judge the other side's reaction, and the answer is secondary. Because the how or what question causes what we would refer to as, deep thinking, slow thinking, Danny Kahneman, Behavioral economics, thinking fast and slow. Slow thinking is in-depth thinking.[0:58:37] Chris Voss: You ask a how or what question to make the other side think 1st and judge their reaction to how they think about it. And do they actually do they actually think about it, or do they fire right back at you? It gives you a a clearer picture of who you're dealing with, where the outcome is gonna go. How much money do you think that you deserve if they immediate you know, $10,000,000? Alright.[0:59:00] Chris Voss: So this is I got a shakedown artist on the other side. Or they say, alright. If they stop and think about it they give you a thoughtful answer. That's a completely different person on the other side. You're asking a question to get a to diagnose how they respond first.[0:59:17] Chris Voss: The answer is second. And sometimes I if it's a cutthroat on the other side, I'm gonna start with how and what questions Just to where I'm at, that's passive aggression. If I if I got a cutthroat aggressor on the other side, I'm gonna drop into passive aggressive behavior to slow them down and where I'm at. One of my hostage negotiation heroes, a guy named Johnny Pico was John Domenico Pico, not not Johnny like Johnny Rockets. Italian Johnny, John Domenico.[0:59:53] Chris Voss: Got all the, Western hostages out of Beirut in the mid eighties. Wrote a book called Man Without a Gun, negotiated in person face to face with Hezbollah. The only guy that ever did that. Got everybody out. And in his book, he wrote, one of the great secrets to negotiation is learning how to exhaust the other side.[1:00:15] Chris Voss: And when you've got a really dangerous adversary on the other side of the table, you don't go nose to nose. You don't argue. You don't you're not combative. You wear them out. Exhaust them.[1:00:26] Chris Voss: And if you got somebody really combative or cutthroat on the other side, start peppering them with how and what questions because to even think about the answer, it tires them out, and it's passive aggressive, and it's deferential, and it really works.[1:00:44] Andrew Huberman: So if the person on the opposite side of a high friction negotiation is aggressive, The goal is to slow things down, fatigue them Yeah. And get them to just Either relent or to reveal something that's that's a loophole.[1:01:02] Chris Voss: Yeah.[1:01:02] Andrew Huberman: Am I right?[1:01:03] Chris Voss: Yeah. If if I have to make the deal, then I'm gonna wear them out.[1:01:09] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etcetera, mean, and Behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health.[1:01:55] Andrew Huberman: Right now, InsideTracker is conducting a giveaway valued at $6,000. This giveaway includes a full year of InsideTracker tests, A consultation with a registered dietitian and a hydro indoor rowing machine. To learn more about InsideTracker and to enter this zero cost giveaway, Go to fitness fuels longevity.com to enter. That's fitness fuels longevity.com to enter. I'm interested in drilling a little bit further into this Process of wearing them down and the passive aggressive way of, reducing the aggressor's stance.[1:02:29] Andrew Huberman: And I I wanna highlight for people that, you know, what we're talking about here isn't, you know, manipulation to extract something. We're actually talking about the reverse. We're talking about a bad actor who's aggressive Right. And trying to, defang that bad actor.[1:02:45] Chris Voss: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[1:02:45] Andrew Huberman: What does that process of of wearing them down look like or sound like? Could you give us a couple of examples of let's say I'm the bad actor. We could play this game. I won't be very good at this. And I am saying, look.[1:03:00] Andrew Huberman: I want x number of dollars, like, at this date, or You're not gonna get what you want. They're gonna die or disappear. It's that simple. And I'm, you know, a stonewall kind of approach. What is the approach that you take to wear that person down?[1:03:20] Chris Voss: Well, what what are they're gonna be how and questions that are mostly how and what, And they're gonna be legitimate questions, which is, how do I know you're gonna follow through? What does that look like? Like, if I do what you want, how do I know you're gonna follow through?[1:03:45] Andrew Huberman: So get them to talk about the alternative. Okay? So if you were to well, if you deliver by that date, I'm gonna pass them to you without fail. Like, if they're just getting kind of brief answers where the person is just, again, this kinda, like, rigid stonewall approach.[1:04:01] Chris Voss: Yeah. Well and so there's a phrase that we use all the time. Vision drives decision. So if if you're really gonna comply if I if I give in and when I said, how do I know you're gonna you're gonna follow through? I'm not talking about the threat.[1:04:15] Chris Voss: I'm not trying to get you to clarify the threat. I'm trying to get you to clarify what implementation looks like. So I need to know based on your reaction to that, If you plan on following through, if I comply, you will already have that in your head or be open to it. Vision drives decision. You've thought it through in advance.[1:04:39] Chris Voss: What does letting the hostages go look like? If you'd if you have no intention of ever release releasing the hostage if I follow through, then you're not gonna be able to answer the question or and you're probably gonna throw it back on me really quickly. And So then now I'm I know, like, alright. So you got no plans on complying. If I give in, you're not gonna comply.[1:05:05] Chris Voss: So I but you still want the money. Then I'm gonna ask, well, how am I supposed to pay you if you don't have any plans for compliant? And if you're willing to entertain a conversation about what compliance looks like there was a kidnapping That, my unit worked just before I was in it in Venezuela, where they weren't entirely sure that the bad guys were gonna the FARC, I think, had had the hostage. They agreed on an exchange point to let the hostage go that was some distance from where they had a pretty good idea the hostage was being held. So they figured they're not gonna drag the hostage all the way to this river crossing if they're not gonna let him go.[1:05:51] Chris Voss: It's just too much effort. And then it it was one of the few times there was gonna be a theoretically, a simultaneous exchange, but they're gonna have to send the money across the river before the hostage was let go. So if we agree to this alright. So they're not gonna drag this this guy all the way to this river crossing. They don't plan on letting them go.[1:06:12] Chris Voss: And if it's a long way to drag them and they got their money, do they wanna drag them back? Like, even if they're ambivalent, once they get there, if they've gone through all the effort to get to the meeting location and the hostage is there, We've now just increased the chances significantly. They're gonna go ahead and comply because it's a pain in the neck to take them back. This is all human nature stuff, human nature investment. How do you get them to engage in actions and behaviors and then verbal commitments That actually means something to them.[1:06:43] Chris Voss: When I was working kidnappings, the very last thing we'd always have the family get the bad guys to say it last, not first, but last, We we'd actually get a verbal promise to let him go. Again, at the end, Because we've been talking to them long enough at this point in time, we got a pretty good idea of what they sound like when they're lying and what they sound like when they're telling the truth. If somebody tells the truth, they pretty much tend to tell the truth the same way every time if they tell the truth. You talk to somebody long enough, you got a line on, do they ever tell the truth? And if they do, what does it sound like?[1:07:20] Chris Voss: People lie 20 ways. They tell the truth one way. So we've been coaching the negotiations with the kidnappers long enough that we know what they sound like when they tell the truth. And that that'll be the last thing to seal the deal. You know?[1:07:43] Chris Voss: How do you continually stack the odds in your favor for implementation?[1:07:47] Andrew Huberman: Do you have a bodily, Like a somatic sensor for lying. The reason I ask is years ago, I had the experience of, knowing somebody, and, they turned out to be a generally good person, but I sensed early on that something was, like, off. I couldn't relax around them.[1:08:07] Chris Voss: Right.[1:08:07] Andrew Huberman: I just couldn't relax around them, and and I could not tell you why, but it was as if my I couldn't even identify the neuroanatomy of it. You know? I might say it was the vagus nerve or something, but I teach neuroanatomy, and I can't point to 1 pathway in the body. There was something about my autonomic Response that would just start cranking up when I was around them, like, something is off. Something is off.[1:08:28] Andrew Huberman: Something else. And I and I kid you not, 5 years later 5 years later, I discovered a series of lies that all ratcheted together that were actually pretty meaningless in the total context of things. But I remember thinking at that moment, Oh my goodness. Like, my my system knew, like, knew. And, you know, For all my knowledge of neuroscience, I I can't tell you to this day, like, what it was in in the in my biology, but it had Something to do with my bodily response.[1:09:01] Andrew Huberman: It wasn't just a thought. Like, that doesn't quite add up or I feel like I'm getting the runaround or or this it was it was a Physical sensation. Are you familiar with that experience?[1:09:13] Chris Voss: Yeah. Well, it's a little bit, what you guys and your colleagues are still discovering, the science behind the gut And what we are actually teaching, you know, my company now, we're teaching people, learn the difference between your gut and your amygdala, For lack of a better time, your fear centers, and know which one is which and listen to your gut. Your gut is ridiculously accurate. Now where where does that information come from? One of your podcast recently I was listening to, we were talking about olfactory cues.[1:09:42] Chris Voss: Right? Smells. Like, I never thought of that. Of course. You know?[1:09:46] Chris Voss: Yeah. They're the the, what's the term for the, the the molecules that you're putting off that that Oferomones. Oferomones. What if how hormones molecules. Gonna kick get kicked out.[1:09:58] Chris Voss: Like, of course, and that's why some of the great investigators Inou would say, I can just smell it. I can smell it. So what all is feeding your gut, and what what are the senses That the science hasn't yet discovered. You know? You can't you can't make me believe I'll I will never believe that the life force stops at the surface of our skin, that there's energy and that we can pick up on the energy.[1:10:22] Chris Voss: I mean, our gut is being fed by all these different inputs that we're aware of or that we have yet to be made aware of. The tone of voice doesn't match their their words. The the the head tilt. You've got a supercomputer in your brain. Your gut is incredible.[1:10:40] Chris Voss: If you could listen to it instead of your fear centers. And as soon as you start listening to your gut, You can't explain it at the time, but you got a you got a bad feeling in your gut. And later on, then you saw it all it all came together where your brain was picking up these cues. Your your brain was probably when you're in their presence. There's gotta be an odor somebody gives off when they're when they're intentionally deceiving.[1:11:02] Chris Voss: You don't you didn't know that that that was a smell, And maybe you you couldn't have consciously smelled it, but you're still picking it up. So long answer to I'm a very big believer in in the gut. I think there's Science that we know and yet to discover that tells us that the gut is just ridiculously accurate if we listen to it instead of our fear centers.[1:11:24] Andrew Huberman: I completely agree that there are, energetic exchanges that neuroscience can't yet explain. The field of neuroscience that is is starting to explore some of these things. There's basically, 3 Apex journals, The the most competitive journals to publish in Science, Nature, and Cell. And, I only mentioned that because there was a series of articles written In Science Magazine about magnetoreception in humans. You know, the idea that humans can detect magnetic fields sounds like quackery.[1:11:54] Andrew Huberman: Right? Turtles can detect magnetic fields. They migrate by them, actually, long distances. But the idea is that humans can't do that, and yet there are some well controlled studies where people have to guess about the orientation of a magnetic field, and they do it better than chance. Not everyone can do it, but some can do it better than chance in a way that cannot be predicted by anything else except some inherent form of magnetoreception in their nervous system.[1:12:21] Andrew Huberman: There are capabilities of the nervous system that are starting to be revealed, which we don't have a lot of evidence, but there's enough evidence to suggest that these things are really happening. The other example which you might find interesting is a little bit, more little less esoteric, but there was a beautiful paper published in one of the sell press journals, a couple of years ago showing that when people listen to the same story, the distance between their heartbeats tends to be very similar. Now it doesn't mean that their exact heart rates are similar, but if you look at the distance between their heartbeats, They all entrain to the same rhythm, the same song. And get this, they're in completely separate rooms. The experiments are being done on completely separate days, And yet if I were to line up just, you know, the the distance between the the heartbeats for you, they would line up like a set of columns.[1:13:12] Andrew Huberman: Wow. For dozens of individuals listening to the same story. So, you know, clearly, there's a passage of energy from things we hear and things we see that goes into our nervous system at a level that's below our conscious detection. Here's the last thing I'll say about this. We have a series on mental health coming out, not mental illness, but mental health, by, I think to be among the very finest psychiatrists in the world, doctor Paul Conte.[1:13:37] Andrew Huberman: And he said, you know, we all think that the forebrain is the supercomputer.[1:13:40] Chris Voss: Right.[1:13:41] Andrew Huberman: He said, no. The subconscious is the supercomputer. Yeah. Yeah. That's where the real knowledge Processing is happening.[1:13:48] Andrew Huberman: That's the iceberg below the surface where all the real heavy lifting has taken place, and that People who learn to tap into the subconscious can learn to use that information in very meaningful ways, and I think that's What what you're describing.[1:14:02] Chris Voss: He's been on with you before. Right?[1:14:04] Andrew Huberman: He has to talk about trauma in particular, and he was on Lex Friedman's podcast as well. The series that we're doing with him is not about Trauma per se, it's really about the subconscious and the self. I I think you'll find this series really interesting. Oh, yeah. And it has a number of very practical questions that one can ask themselves about They're subconscious and and kinda work the process of psychiatry.[1:14:21] Andrew Huberman: We're excited to release that series, but it, because I don't know of anything like it that's been put out there into the public. But But I was so, pleasantly surprised to hear him say, you know, we all hear that the the forebrain is the supercomputer. It's what drove our evolution. He's like, no. No.[1:14:37] Andrew Huberman: No. No. It's the it's the subconscious. That's where our real wisdom resides, and the forebrain is just the implementation device. So it's, you know,[1:14:47] Chris Voss: it we can I've convinced ourselves that that we're in charge. Right?[1:14:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, I can't think of a time that my gut told me a, and it turned out to be b. More often than not, though, I've suppressed my response[1:14:57] Chris Voss: from[1:14:57] Andrew Huberman: the gut. I override it thinking, I think I made the mistake that you guys train your Negotiators to avoid, which is I thought, well, this is making me anxious, and the anxiety must be, like, me. Like, this must be my fault, Or I'm not able to calm myself in this situation, not sleeping well, etcetera, and, and therefore, like, this much Must represent some deficiency on my part.[1:15:21] Chris Voss: Right.[1:15:22] Andrew Huberman: And then, and lord knows, as your shirt points out, I'm I'm a Very flawed person. I have many flaws. I always have 3,000 pet peeves and at least as many flaws to match those pet peeves. The one to 1 at least relationship. But, The point being that I I think our bodies really do know.[1:15:39] Andrew Huberman: They know. Yeah. You know? Yeah.[1:15:41] Chris Voss: Yeah. I would agree.[1:15:42] Andrew Huberman: So when you're doing negotiations and you're hearing somebody's voice on the phone, there are a lot of cues. When you're face to face, there are additional cues. There's their face. And then, of course, if negotiations are being done by text over a computer or a phone, it's a very diminished environment for information. So maybe we could talk about each of those because we live in those landscapes.[1:16:05] Andrew Huberman: If we're face to face and we're negotiating, you're listening, of course, to what I want, what I'm insisting on. You're working that process from your your side. What are you paying attention to[1:16:20] Chris Voss: visually? It's more, are things in alignment? There's layman's data. You know, the words, the way it's said and look on people's face, and how are they weighed and how they play out, there's a ratio out there that Very unscientific. 73855, 7% words, 38% delivery, 55% body language.[1:16:42] Chris Voss: People won't argue about it all the time whether or not that's Accurate. As a rule of thumb, we throw that out there, but I tell people the most important issue is, do they line up? So I'm not gonna look for, like, when do you raise your eyebrow or when do you look up into the left. I'm really just gonna try to get a gut feeling whether or not I think these things are lining up, whether they're in alignment or whether they're out of line. And then I'm gonna be real careful about what meaning I assign to that.[1:17:14] Chris Voss: You know, affective cues, Changes in your tone of voice, changes in your movement. And that's one of the reasons why we don't teach Reading people's body language because it's completely contextual to you in the moment. So I if I convince myself that, you know, a raise of the eyebrow means this, it's out of context. I was in a negotiation once where I threw out a a figure to somebody, and I some kinda look off to the side and look back and accepted my offer. And I made the mistake of not saying to them the proper thing for me to say at the time would have been, seems like something just crossed your mind.[1:17:59] Chris Voss: Because the only completely true observation, if they look to the side and look back, something crossed their mind. Now I read it at the moment of saying that they had more money, and I found out after the fact that was wrong. They were Stretched to the limit. The look of hesitation didn't mean that they were holding stuff. They were holding stuff back, but I read it wrong, And I didn't bother to check on the affective cue that I saw.[1:18:32] Chris Voss: So what am I babbling about? What I'm babbling about is If we're in a negotiation and whether or not I'm listening to your tone of voice or watching your body language or your words, If I see you shift at all, I should pay attention that there was a shift in your affective behavior, But I need to find out what was behind it as opposed to making an assumption as to what it meant. So, yeah, I'm gonna watch. I'm gonna get my gut feeling, And I'm gonna say, sounds like there's some hesitation, or it looks like something just crossed your mind. Or even if I can't attribute it to specific affective move, I might say, It feels like there's something in the way.[1:19:19] Chris Voss: That's me listening to my gut. I'll throw out an observation on whatever any of those might be Just to go back over the ground a little bit and double check. Because the other thing about negotiating in person is you're gonna give me more information physically than I can actually process. And if you say something that's thought provoking, I'll stop and think about it. And while I'm stopping and thinking about what you just said, I'm missing all your cues.[1:19:51] Chris Voss: So all the skills that we teach, the labels, the mirrors, the opening of questions, which seem like we're going back and plowing the ground again, We are because I didn't pick up all the information the first time. There's just more than that I can get. And so I need to go back over it a couple of times with you Just so I get it right without making you feel interrogated, you actually feel heard. And you actually get to go back over it again, so it becomes what seems to be an inefficient process, but it's actually me just double checking my information. So if we're face to face, I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you to repeat, but I'm not gonna say, would you please repeat that?[1:20:34] Chris Voss: I'm gonna get you to repeat without asking you to repeat.[1:20:37] Andrew Huberman: Is the same true in, online or text communications?[1:20:41] Chris Voss: The same thing is true. The the the problem with online and text is people try to bundle everything into 1 communication. Best analogy I can think of is if you're playing chess by text, would you put 7 moves in your in your text? No. You'd only put 1 move in, so only try to get 1 point across in a text.[1:21:01] Chris Voss: Don't explain. Don't throw a whole bunch of stuff in, text or emails. They're all almost always too long, and it's going to come off as cold. So do what you can to soften Soften it. There's a documentary film that's been done on my company called Tactical Empathy.[1:21:21] Chris Voss: Nick Nanton, 122, 23 Emmys, the filmmaker d n f DNA Films. It was finished last year. It's not out yet. For a variety of reasons, we haven't put it out. So the we screened the thing in Vegas last year.[1:21:38] Chris Voss: I see it. I love it. I'm not a good judge of a film about me. I'm gonna love it no matter what. It's about me.[1:21:45] Chris Voss: But I tell Nick that night, oh, man. I love it. This is great. 2 days later, I find out I realized there's a huge problem. I've already told them it's okay.[1:21:58] Chris Voss: So I gotta get him I gotta I'm gonna text him, and then I'm gonna call him, and we gotta fix it now. It's a Sunday. Text message. I sent him a two line text. Is now a bad time to talk?[1:22:14] Chris Voss: I got something you don't wanna hear. Two lines. Now what were my other options? I coulda called them. Nick and I got a great relationship.[1:22:23] Chris Voss: I call him. If he's in a position to pick up the phone, doesn't matter what he's doing, he's gonna answer the phone. He was in the middle of a Zoom call. If I'd have called, he'd have picked up during the Zoom call, and both conversations would have been bad. He immediately fires back to me, I'm in the middle of a Zoom call.[1:22:42] Chris Voss: I'll call you in a half an hour. He already knows He ain't gonna like what he's gonna hear. I'm prepping him for bad news. Get him on the phone. Like, look.[1:22:53] Chris Voss: I know what I said. We got a problem. We gotta get Derek on camera. Derek is a guy in my in my team, and I I'm shocked that I haven't made him part of the documentary. This is gonna be incomplete without Derek, we gotta get Derek on on film.[1:23:06] Chris Voss: We can't show this to anybody else till we get him on film and make a part of it. Immediately, he's in problem solving mode. He goes, okay. Gotta get a crew to Derek or get Derek to a crew. I need to know when we can do that.[1:23:18] Chris Voss: I need to we got a we got another showing of the films Scheduled in LA less than a month away. He says, I I gotta get Derek on camera, and we gotta edit it. It's gonna take 3 weeks of editing. So to get you access to Derek's camera, he goes done or Derek Derek's calendar. He says done.[1:23:34] Chris Voss: It's done. We go through this whole conversation in less than 10 minutes. Now think of the normal negotiation. Hey, Nick. How are you?[1:23:45] Chris Voss: What's going on today? Are you in a good mood? Hey. Hey. Hey.[1:23:49] Chris Voss: How the kids doing? All this time wasting conversation. If I had set him up with that normal, He would also he he could have legitimately said, are you out of your mind? We've been working on this for a year. You didn't bring this up in a year.[1:24:05] Chris Voss: Not only that. You already told me 2 days ago at the at the showing in in Vegas that you loved it. And now, a year, year and a half into this project, bringing up all these new problems. That would have been the normal negotiation. But since I since we got a highly collaborative relationship, I 2 line text.[1:24:25] Chris Voss: We're done in 10 minutes. Now since Nick's a very generous guy, when he gets done And he says, by the way, you understand how much this is gonna cost me? It's just 3 weeks of editing. This is 3 hours of shooting and 3 weeks of editing. I go, yeah.[1:24:37] Chris Voss: He goes, but I'm happy to do it. Calls him back the next day. He's got a favorite asking me. You got it. Doesn't matter what it is because we'd gone through what would have been a very complicated negotiation that started on text, And I sent him a 2 line text on a Sunday, and we gotta solve that fast.[1:25:02] Andrew Huberman: So if I understand correctly, by setting the context in a very direct and succinct way[1:25:07] Chris Voss: Right.[1:25:08] Andrew Huberman: He goes into it in a problem solving mode with you. Whereas if you do the, the tour of all the things that are going well in life Yeah.[1:25:16] Chris Voss: Hey. How are you?[1:25:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The sort of the We'll keep this, PG. You know, the the, the mud sandwich approach. You know? You know, they teach you that.[1:25:26] Andrew Huberman: You know, when you get a laboratory you know, most scientists have no skill running a Right? You get a laboratory, all you've done is experiments, and then suddenly you're in charge of people managing budgets and all this stuff. I mean I mean, most scientists, 99% of scientists are completely unqualified to do the job they do at the level of running a laboratory. When they start, you learn it on the job. And, eventually, you end up having to let somebody go.[1:25:46] Andrew Huberman: And they and so the typical thing they teach you in these online training things is you tell somebody something nice, then you give them the bad news, and then you tell something Them something nice on exit. Right? That's kind of the the the mud, so to speak, sandwich. Right. Alright.[1:26:02] Andrew Huberman: This is not that. What you're talking about is saying, hey. This is the problem. You're not gonna like the problem. Or there is a problem, you're not gonna like it so that they show up with the context of solving a problem as opposed to giving them the tour of all the things that are going well, and then The the problem is really in contrast to that, and then it's like, you know?[1:26:22] Andrew Huberman: So so you what I love about what you're describing is it's It's just it's direct. It's honest. You're not doing the, the tour of the garden before you take them down to the, to the septic tank.[1:26:35] Chris Voss: It's what I would call the difference between being blunt and being a straight shooter. A straight shooter tells you the truth. They just tell it in a way that lands softly.[1:26:47] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about breakups, business breakups, romantic breakups. Right.[1:26:53] Chris Voss: You breaking up with me?[1:26:55] Andrew Huberman: No. No. But thanks for the hypothesis test. No. In fact in fact, I'm enjoying this conversation so much As I always do, I'm learning a ton from you that, if anything, I'd like to expand and deepen our relationship with Chris.[1:27:11] Andrew Huberman: There. You got a lot of knowledge out of me. Platonic and and professional, but expansive. What is the process of ending a relationship? And, again, this could be romantic relationship, Chip could be employer employee, could be individuals, could be telling a whole group or an entire group telling an individual.[1:27:41] Andrew Huberman: You know? The reason I raise this as a particular example is that I'm I'm assuming that both sides don't want the same thing. One side wants to continue. The other side wants to end. Right?[1:27:58] Andrew Huberman: I'll avoid the use of the word win win or the words win win. Excuse me. And just ask, Is there a way to have that conversation in any of the context I just mentioned in, as you So beautifully described at a straight shooter manner where it's direct, it's honest, but it lands soft. Because what we're talking about here is feelings of rejection. Mhmm.[1:28:21] Andrew Huberman: And nobody likes feeling rejected. Right? I don't know anybody that likes being fired. Even from jobs they don't like, People's egos suffer. Right.[1:28:32] Andrew Huberman: So is there a maybe a more specific way of asking the question is, is there a way To encourage the person getting the bad news, to get their ego out of the way, and see that if both parties don't want it, it's best for everybody involved.[1:28:49] Chris Voss: I almost wanna say no. But first, what are the caveats? Most of the time when people are struggling with this, they're not trying to save the other side. They're trying to save themselves. So who are you really trying to save by postponing it, softening it, you know, trying to act like, It's it's something that it's not.[1:29:09] Chris Voss: Like, there I don't know that anybody has ever been fired that didn't have a sense that it was coming. The person that was getting ready to fire him opens up by saying, how are you? They know how the other person is, and and a person getting ready to get fired has got some gut instinct that things are going wrong. Like you said, the gut's very powerful. So you gotta you gotta lower the boom as quickly as you can, but also as gently as you can.[1:29:40] Chris Voss: I was involved in a nonprofit a number of years ago, affiliated with a church, and we're try struggling whether or not to let the executive director go. I go to the minister of the church, Norman Vincent Peale's protege got a guy named Arthur Caliandra, one of the best human beings I've ever met in my life. Phenomenal guy. And I'm struggling with I thought firing letting this woman go was gonna be bad, and then I thought Arthur was gonna counsel me a way out. And and he looked at me and he said, You know, there's there's no gentle way to cut somebody's head off.[1:30:12] Chris Voss: And I thought, yeah, the humane thing here is how do you to to Bring it to conclusion as quickly as possible because there's no humane way to cut somebody's head off. There's no humane way, And to terminate the relationship. Now what are the caveats? Maybe there are. 1st caveat, if you're gonna fire somebody, never fire somebody on a Friday.[1:30:34] Chris Voss: Fire them on a Monday. Find them on a Monday, they got a work week to work their way out of it. You find them on a Friday, they get a weekend to be miserable and to feel horrible, and they can't do anything about it. Caught off guard or not, on a Monday, they can pick themselves up. They can start looking for a new job no matter who you are.[1:30:52] Chris Voss: Fire them on a Friday. They can't start looking for a new job on a Saturday. It's 2 days of misery. So, yeah, if you're gonna fire somebody, fire them on a Monday, not on a Friday. If you got bad news to give somebody, warn them it's coming.[1:31:04] Chris Voss: The, people are ridiculously resilient The pain if warned and then that you lower the boom. You're not gonna like what I have to say. It's gonna be heartbreaking. You're gonna hate me. Hesitate no more than 3 seconds.[1:31:24] Chris Voss: They got their guard up. Let them have the bad news. That's the humane way to cut somebody's head off. Don't make don't linger. Don't make them think that how are the kids?[1:31:36] Chris Voss: How are you? I care about you. You're a great human being. None of the stuff at the beginning. Warning bad news is coming and hit them with the bad news.[1:31:45] Chris Voss: Rip the Band Aid off. Pain is not if you try to rip the Band Aid off slowly. That's excruciating. You're trying to save yourself. So if you gotta terminate a relationship regardless of what it is, the quicker it you do it, the less painless it is, the sooner people can move on.[1:32:04] Chris Voss: Stop trying to save yourself. Realize how human beings handle pain. If anything, Human beings are incredibly resilient if given the opportunity to brace themselves first.[1:32:16] Andrew Huberman: I agree. Thank you for that. There's a concept that a lot of people haven't heard of, and I I'm confident in saying that because I hadn't heard of it until recently despite spending a lot of time in the Literature around dopamine and motivation, and it's a term from psychology that is being used a little bit more now, and it's ego depletion.[1:32:38] Chris Voss: Oh. Yeah.[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: It's an interesting concept, and I've been wanting to run this by you for a while, but I saved it for our discussion today. Turns out ego depletion is a lot like decision fatigue. You know, we've all heard the Steve Jobs thing. You know, he wore a black turtleneck every day because it you he didn't have to make that decision, so he had more energy to make other decisions. I I've been accused of doing the same because of my black long sleeve shirts, but there's a whole other reason for that that, some people might know.[1:33:03] Andrew Huberman: But, anyway, it's unimportant in the moment, but ego depletion is a little bit different than Decision fatigue or decision budget. The idea with ego depletion is pretty simple. It's that the molecule dopamine does many things in the brain, But one of the things that it absolutely does is it holds us to goal directed behavior that's associated with our sense of self. Like, I want to accomplish this. I wanna get to that.[1:33:30] Andrew Huberman: And the whole notion of ego depletion involves the the idea, And this has been a data substantiated observation that when people have to fight to be right or to defend their position For a period of time, eventually, that depletes, and it seems to be, at least in part, dopamine mediated because Defending one's position takes work. Right. You earlier, you talked about running somebody down, you know, wearing them out. And I wonder as I just throw this concept out to you, cold here, whether or not that calls to mind any, examples from your work where you felt like, okay. Like, this person could really hold, but if I just kept pressing, Eventually, they tilt.[1:34:18] Chris Voss: Right. You[1:34:18] Andrew Huberman: know? And it's different than the kind of fatigue that comes from a conversation that starts at 3 in the afternoon and ends at 2:30 in the morning. We've all been there. Right. I've been in those conversations.[1:34:27] Andrew Huberman: Usually, they're not very pleasant. And at 3 in the morning, everyone's peeling apart. You just I've learned over the years, you know, like, you clip it at 9:30, and you try and shift. Right?[1:34:37] Chris Voss: Right.[1:34:37] Andrew Huberman: You know? One of the worst pieces of advice I've ever heard, is you'd never go to sleep angry. It's like, no. Actually, actually, get sleep, wake up, and then revisit the problem if the situation allows. That's my, that's my Oh, yeah.[1:34:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Trying to stay up all night trying to work something out is just a counterbiology. So ego depletion. I have a feeling a lot of what you did in your profession was, running down their dopamine to the point where then they are operating from a different place where they're not defending the ego. They're actually thinking more practically about the whole situation.[1:35:14] Andrew Huberman: Does it does it have any kind of texture or meaning to you?[1:35:16] Chris Voss: Yeah. No. I would I I would agree, and I would draw the distinction. First of all, in hostage negotiation, there's there's 2 kind of hostage takings, if there's a demand. And there's gonna be contained and uncontained, which is just literal definition.[1:35:33] Chris Voss: Contained is bad guys in a bank, like at the Chase Bank In Brooklyn, way back when, you got them surrounded. They can't get away. And uncontained is a kidnapping. You don't know where they are. Uncontained unknown location.[1:35:46] Chris Voss: We're gonna try to get our way in a contained situation probably by ego depletion, wearing them out, Getting to the point where they just they just they're just gonna get in because they're they're tired. Because they're gonna come out. We're gonna put handcuffs on them, which means that if the ego gets recharged, They're gonna go back and they're think they're gonna think back over the deal. So wearing somebody out in a business negotiation, it's basically uncontained. You did you did you get the agreement because you warm up?[1:36:26] Chris Voss: Because they get tired, because they just gave in. At some point in time, they're gonna get recharged, and they're gonna get recharged while you're in implementation. So they're either gonna not gonna follow the terms of the deal or at the slightest opportunity, they're gonna deviate. And so, yeah, I think ego depletion is is a real thing, and it's a bad way To get a business deal that's gonna stick.[1:36:54] Andrew Huberman: Because they rest and then they come back Yeah. A different person.[1:36:58] Chris Voss: Yeah. Yeah. They're gonna be recharged. Their ego is gonna be recharged. And if you get, if you get the agreement based on a depletion of their ego, that battery's gonna get charged back up again, whether it's a business deal, whether it's personal negotiation.[1:37:13] Chris Voss: You know, you have a disagreement with your significant other who and you you follow that bad advice. Don't go to bed angry. And so you stay up till 3 in the morning, and you think you come to a resolution. Everybody gets a good night sleep. The next day, they feel completely differently about what they said the night before.[1:37:28] Andrew Huberman: I might have heard of that happening once or twice.[1:37:31] Chris Voss: Saw it in a movie. Right? Yeah.[1:37:32] Andrew Huberman: Saw it in a movie. Like, a friend explained that situation to me. Earlier, you mentioned approaching a conversation in a playful way.[1:37:40] Chris Voss: Right.[1:37:41] Andrew Huberman: Like, alright. You know, this might even be life or death, but let's play this like a game because you can see more opportunities. Now we know that when we are relaxed, we see the big picture. When we're tense, Everything narrows with vision. Tunnel vision, tunnel thinking, tunnel everything.[1:37:56] Andrew Huberman: We lose access to the full toolkit. So You obviously take really good care of yourself. You're fit. You're in shape. You always seem calm.[1:38:06] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure you have your moments like anybody else, but, What are some of the things that good negotiators do all the time so that when the bell goes off and they have to respond, They are ready. And the reason I ask this is because, you know, we've been talking about negotiations in in kind of a vacuum. Like, it's happening, and then how does one handle it? But like any athlete, like any teacher, like any parent, like any kid, everybody Has to be ready for real life circumstances, and we don't always get the warning. We don't get the memo that it's happening in 2 weeks.[1:38:46] Andrew Huberman: And, sometimes the conversations around courtroom drama or the big day, you know, it implies that we we get the warning, but more often than not, it's a phone call or a text and it comes in and boom. It just hits us. And suddenly, we are in negotiations, and we didn't get time to prepare.[1:39:02] Chris Voss: Right.[1:39:02] Andrew Huberman: So maybe we could talk about readiness, and then we could talk about again, like, Maybe this is sounds trivial to you, but for me, I'd be very curious to know whether or not you have any practices of stilling yourself, what those look like, what you've seen other people use to to be able to get themselves into the moment of of being able to show up their best self.[1:39:23] Chris Voss: Yeah. Well, readiness. Small stakes practice for high stakes results. Like, I will occasionally find myself in the middle of a negotiation that I didn't expect. Like, if I've been throwing out stuff on a regular basis on my way during the day, verbal observations, what we refer to as labels, because, the label seems like something just crossed your mind.[1:39:46] Chris Voss: Is a label in the middle of a negotiation when I see you hesitate or look to the side? How do I get ready for that? You know, I'm I'm I'm on my way over here to this interview. I'm both talking to my Lyft driver the whole way, getting him to talk, Also being careful about not tapping the gas tank out completely so that I'm fatigued when I get here. Like, I talk I talk up to Lyft drivers on a regular basis.[1:40:14] Chris Voss: I, interactions, TSA guys in the airport. I'll throw a label at them. Seems like a tough day. Tough day? Seems like you're in a good mood.[1:40:25] Chris Voss: And whether right or wrong, I'm I'm getting in I'm Trying to stay loose. I'm trying to keep the mental muscles limber, and it just becomes a bit of a habit on a regular basis. Occasionally, I'll throw something out. Now I'm talking about Lyft drivers. I I if I'm in a bad mood, I I get into a Lyft couple of weeks ago on my way home.[1:40:48] Chris Voss: Lyft driver is not helpful. I mean, I'm coming out of the airport. I'm struggling with my bags, not lifting a finger. It doesn't open up the rear. I gotta open up the rear of the vehicle myself.[1:40:57] Chris Voss: I gotta load the bags, everything. I get in, and he's just seething unhappiness. Now I know that if I say, what do you love about what you do for a living, I immediately trigger what Tony Robbins would call a state change. And I'm annoyed at this guy. And, you know, our our pheromones are combative, But I'm thinking like, I just I just don't need this.[1:41:23] Chris Voss: And so I go, what do you love about driving for Lyft? This guy Seeds to unload on me on all his personal struggles that I feel like a complete jerk for being angry at him, at everything that he's going through. And I'm just trying to get myself out of a bad out of a bad mood and to keep from sending him a really negative vibe the whole way so that he doesn't drive 45 miles an hour in a 65 mile an hour lane and make it you know, inflict me with a longer and more expensive ride because I'm so annoying as a customer. But I've got a habit of small stakes practice for high stakes results. And who do I get a practice on?[1:42:00] Chris Voss: The Lyft drivers on a regular basis. The guy behind The counter at the hotel, the TSA guy. I'm going through TSA, the grocery store clerk, the Starbucks person. The only way I'm at my best in my negotiations is just trying to keep my negotiation muscles limber by interacting with people, throughout the course of my day and then ideally, you know, leaving them better than I found them. You know, trying trying not to leave negative karma in my wake, to leave as much positive karma in my wake as possible.[1:42:31] Andrew Huberman: I love that, and I'm very familiar with the feeling of needing to conserve my voice for podcasting or energy for things, and Yeah. I'm somebody who's, I think, genuinely curious about what people's experiences are. So I I like the question, You know, how's your day going? It's pretty open ended. It's, I suppose if somebody was really upset, that would be perhaps the worst question I could possibly ask, from what you just described.[1:42:58] Andrew Huberman: But[1:42:59] Chris Voss: Well, I'll put a fine point on it too because, like, I manipulate him with what do you love about Because there there's it you watch them change in the moment to immediately to shift into this concept of love, which is more than like, What do you like about driving for Lyft? What do you love about driving for Lyft? I I can trigger a state change in you instantaneously no matter what kind of mood you're in, because this guy was in a very bad mood. Plus, additionally, the download from that typically is so quick. I'm gonna get a real clear picture on who you are really, really fast.[1:43:35] Chris Voss: I'm talking to a CEO of a company a couple of months ago. They're they're the you know, for lack of a better term, they're delivering clean water to the world. And I'm like, that's a cool mission. Like, I dig this. As an entrepreneur, an entrepreneur who want to make a dent in the universe, I dig that.[1:43:53] Chris Voss: Like, I'm trying to make a difference in the world. So I say to him, what do you love about what you do for a living? He immediately fires back at me, I love leading teams. I love leading teams, And I love giving shareholders a great return on our investment. It's really important for me to give shareholders a great return.[1:44:11] Chris Voss: And then, yeah, you know, we deliver water. And then he said a 4th thing, and I thought, this guy could be doing toilet paper. He he doesn't care about the mission of the company at all. He's a great CEO probably because you want a CEO to lead teams. You want a CEO deliver a corporate CEO To deliver a return on investment for shareholders, but that's why he's a great corporate CEO and not a great entrepreneurial CEO.[1:44:40] Chris Voss: So by him giving me that download real quick, that was blatantly honest. Like, do I think this is a great guy? Yeah. Do our core values line up? My mission is more important to me than his mission is, or his mission is Making money.[1:44:57] Chris Voss: Now I like making money, but it's not number 1. It's a strong number 2. But that question, instead of how are you today to what do you love about, You immediately put them in a better place, plus you get some ridiculously candid answers that tells you who they are real fast.[1:45:17] Andrew Huberman: What is the best way to approach our response to somebody who's asking to be heard? Perhaps they've got complaints, maybe about us, maybe about somebody else. You know, people who are venting.[1:45:31] Chris Voss: Right.[1:45:32] Andrew Huberman: People seem to vary on the Propensity to vent spectrum. Some people just you know, they vent all the time. This happened, that happened, and, you know, and they wanna complain. You know? They, The way it's sometimes described is they love to, take other people's inventories.[1:45:47] Andrew Huberman: They love to take inventories of everybody else's mistakes. They did this. They did that. Right. You know, it's it's a lot easier some often than taking our own inventories of of what we could be focused on and do better.[1:45:59] Andrew Huberman: That's that's a universal truth in my mind. But, you know, people Approach other people that they trust, and they want to vent, presumably to get over whatever it is that is bothering them. But all too often, it seems to just amplify the feelings of frustration. What do you do when somebody you care about and that cares about you comes to you to vent? Is it just you let them You let them vent, or do you, do you try and let them negotiate with themselves a little bit in a way that could help them more than if you were to just let them Vent.[1:46:36] Chris Voss: I'm really leery of letting people vent because a lot of times, it just they never see it seems to be a spiral that just spirals out of control. So how how do why is somebody venting? They don't feel hurt. They feel ignored. They feel like they've been wasting their time talking.[1:46:53] Chris Voss: They're frustrated. That's the feedback. I'm gonna give you feedback on what I'm guessing call is causing you to vent in just an observation. I it it sounds like this is is driving you crazy because nobody listens to you. Sounds like you've been struggling with us for a long time.[1:47:10] Chris Voss: Sounds like this is very frustrating for you. What's the emotion? The particular negative emotion. Frustration is about somebody being denied a goal in the future. Anger is about somebody's upset about something happened in the past.[1:47:26] Chris Voss: The type of negative emotion begins to focus you in on Where they is it forward thinking, or is it backward thinking? And frustration and anger can be 2 very different versions of the same negative emotion, but they're focused on different points in time. So I'm gonna try to intuitively if I don't If I don't know, from what you've told me, I'm gonna start taking educated guesses on making an observation on what it is that's driving you. If you need to vent, you've been talking and people have been ignoring you, or you've been taking Actions and people have been ignoring you. It's a it's you need to vent because your communication or your actions have been ignored.[1:48:08] Chris Voss: There are some clues here, and the sooner that I get at the heart of what's bothering you, The sooner you're gonna be able to let it off, so I'm gonna encourage letting the steam off without trying to correct you, without Giving you advice, without frustrating you by not listening to you, by trying to recognize Verbally, what some of the motivators are, which will deactivate the anger much more quickly. It's the whole basis for a crisis hotline to begin with. People are venting. And so how do you most effectively vent somebody so that instead of going on a rant for an hour and the rant Introduce toxins into their system where they're poisoning themselves. I think negative emotions put toxins in our system.[1:48:53] Chris Voss: You know, how do I deactivate that as quickly so that you're not hurting yourself as much? And and you you feel heard. You feel relieved. You feel listened to. So I'm a and if it involves me, if it's a close friend who's venting to you, you're involved in a situation to some degree.[1:49:10] Chris Voss: And I might even say, boy, it feels like you're probably frustrated because I haven't listened to you up to now. You know, I'm gonna tart start taking some emotionally educated guesses On what I think is driving you, and I'm gonna put in the form of a label, which is just an observation, seems like, sounds like, looks like. Then if I get it wrong and you go, that's not it at all, I can say, well, that's just the way it seems. It just seems that way. It puts you in a position to to just let somebody know you see them and you're doing your best to understand.[1:49:42] Chris Voss: I'm I'm not a fan of venting. I if if I go on a rant, personally, I always feel worse. So I wanna deactivate that negativity so I can get get my feedback under me emotionally.[1:49:58] Andrew Huberman: Very useful knowledge, you just shared with us. Do you meditate?[1:50:06] Chris Voss: Tiny little bits. I mean, I've been trying to make my day more effective. I have a gratitude exercise that, I do almost every morning. Other ways to make myself effective, actually, I'm looking at the nonsleep deep rest Practice over the because I, you know, I I like to make use of my time. So and and I'm spiritual, so, I'm I'm I'm talking to the almighty on a regular basis.[1:50:35] Chris Voss: You pray? I do.[1:50:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The morning and night, when you need to? Both. Mhmm.[1:50:40] Chris Voss: Yeah. Both. I mean, I think, You know, whether or not you believe in 1 god or or the universe or whatever it is, I think spirituality is an important component of health. Whatever your spirituality is, you should recognize it, and and you should you'll be better off if you engage in some sort of a Spiritual practice. Doesn't have to be any of the 3 major religions, you know, but spirituality is a component of who we are.[1:51:05] Chris Voss: So, yeah, I practice it on a regular basis.[1:51:07] Andrew Huberman: So sense of higher power or, to better define higher power, it could be, as you said, with aligned with conventional religion or just Align with the idea that there are things outside of us that are important to pay attention to that we Can all do better by being in recognition of or service to or or both. Is that something like that?[1:51:28] Chris Voss: Pretty pretty much like And and then leaving it as as open and as as possible because there I think there's a spiritual nature to period. I agree.[1:51:41] Andrew Huberman: What about your physical training? I I must say, you know, you're, You're in excellent shape. I imagine that went on with the FBI thing. I mean, I saw Silence of the Lambs at the beginning. She's running around, with other Quantified.[1:51:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Shooting targets and running and lifting and doing their sit ups in there, you know, that was a I think it was a 19 eighties film, so it's a little bit dated now. Probably now they're they're doing other stuff as well. But, you know, nothing nothing works like the basics. So, was the FBI the first time you got serious about fitness, or prior to that, were you an Were you an athlete and into fitness, and what are you doing nowadays to maintain your, frankly, impressive shape?[1:52:21] Chris Voss: Well, thank you for the compliments. I sports, athletics, fitness was always a part of my life. I was into sports, but not particularly good at them, football, basketball. The you know, I'm a last century guy, so what long before the conditioning is, involved as it is now with Interval training and and the rest of the stuff, which is phenomenal. You know, weight lifting was introduced in my high school, my senior year.[1:52:51] Chris Voss: You know, I I lifted weights some, Continued through college. Little bit of time in the martial arts. Ripped my knee apart in college in the martial arts. But, yeah, fitness has always been A part of my life is much for liking to be in condition and, you know, the spiritual regeneration of it, Whether I knew what it was or not. These days, you know, I'm looking for every hack there is.[1:53:16] Chris Voss: I know you don't like the term hack.[1:53:17] Andrew Huberman: No. Well[1:53:18] Chris Voss: We like we like mechanisms. Scientists like mechanisms. Yeah.[1:53:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Hack sort of implies that we're using one thing to accomplish something different. I like mechanisms. But at the end of the day, if people wanna call something a hack because it Gets them the result they want or that they're more it's more appealing to to apply the tool. That's what matters to me.[1:53:34] Andrew Huberman: You know? Tools sitting in a box don't do anything.[1:53:36] Chris Voss: So if[1:53:36] Andrew Huberman: people are using them, then I'm good with Yeah.[1:53:38] Chris Voss: Yeah. Yeah. So what these days, cold plunge sauna, principally, I'm struggling with issues with a couple of joints That I know science will eventually help me regenerate. So in the meantime, good diet. You know, the basic pillars.[1:53:51] Chris Voss: Diet, Not a, not a perfect diet, but by and large, overall, my diet's pretty good. And then, you know, the, the little little things. Spiritual keeps me in shape physically. Hitting a cold plunge, is is challenging psychologically and physically,[1:54:15] Andrew Huberman: and the sauna shifter. There that's for sure. Yeah. You don't need science to know that, 30 seconds or a minute in that cold water is gonna change your chemistry for a long while afterwards and for the better, I believe. Yeah.[1:54:28] Andrew Huberman: Once you get out. People forget this. They're like, I hate the call the whole the point is not how you feel while you're in it. You can feel proud of how you navigate that portion, but the point is how you feel afterwards.[1:54:38] Chris Voss: Well, that's the old the old saying, why do you hit yourself in a in the hand with a hammer because it feels so good when you stop?[1:54:45] Andrew Huberman: I like that. I like that. Spoken like somebody worked in New York City for a long time.[1:54:50] Chris Voss: Out[1:54:50] Andrew Huberman: here, we'd probably say something different. You know, it's like Crystals and lava lamps or something. Although there aren't many lava lamps anymore. I think that the idea that California is all hippie dippy, that that's not true anymore. I think it's been overrun by by other, and a different ethos.[1:55:03] Andrew Huberman: In any event, thanks for sharing that because I think that we can't separate the physical from the psychological. Right? I mean, we've been talking about The mental and fatigue status of the people you're negotiating with oftentimes during this conversation. Then, of course, there's how you show up to the job. I mean, if you're rundown 3 days and you've been in a fight with your spouse and that's still in the back of your mind and you're, and you're hungry, tired, sick, what you know, not connected to your higher power, all those things that you there's no way you can be as effective at any job.[1:55:38] Andrew Huberman: So it it's great to hear and not surprising to hear that you have, bedrock practices that you you implement. Yeah. It's interesting point. Almost everybody I[1:55:48] Chris Voss: knew that it was really good at anything they did for a living. They probably took pretty good care of themselves.[1:55:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I agree. You know, there's this the the language around self care get I think gets really distorted. I'm gonna editorialize for a second here. I think it, but I'm gonna editorialize in line with with what you just said.[1:56:06] Andrew Huberman: You know, I think self care sounds like navel gazing Where people think that it's all about self, but it's actually taking care of oneself so that we can show up better For everybody else, more energy, more capacity, more staying power to have those hard conversations with the people we care about and that move our life forward. So it's really refilling the the fuel tank in my mind as opposed to, The kind of, egocentric, narcissistic, you know, stance that a lot of people take towards that. They've. And and I understand why they do. You know?[1:56:42] Andrew Huberman: People scroll through Instagram and they see, people, you know, selfying every every muscle and, like, and all this stuff. And Listen. I'm not disparaging what people want to do, but but at the end of the day, self care is about being more ready to do better for the world if you're or if you're mission oriented. Agreed.[1:56:59] Chris Voss: Completely agree.[1:57:01] Andrew Huberman: Do you think there's been a change in the, FBI, over the last 3, 40 years around that, you know, I have this image in my mind of agents, like, sitting in cars for 20 hours, eating hoagie sandwiches and, you know, and, looking through binoculars and running themselves into the ground with a like, this kind of bulldog like persistence to to Solve the puzzle. I mean, put differently, I imagine there were some negotiations that were very long and fatiguing. So, Do you recall one of the longer negotiations that you had? And how do you sleep at night midway through a hostage crisis?[1:57:38] Chris Voss: So the longest one that I was I was directly involved in on almost day to day and hour to hour, one, went went about 3 ish days. Washington DC, 2003, start of the 2nd Iraq War. A guy named Dwight Watson rolled a tractor into the middle of the DC and Claimed he had 4 bombs, and he left 4 bombs scattered around the city.[1:57:59] Andrew Huberman: Had he actually done that, or he was just call he was bluffing?[1:58:02] Chris Voss: He was bluffing. He he hadn't done either. And start on Saint Patrick's Day. Kinda interesting. A cup you know?[1:58:10] Andrew Huberman: Like like the like the thing in, you said in was it in, for the Philippines? It's like national holiday.[1:58:16] Chris Voss: Yeah. Yeah. Holiday. Right? Interesting, for a whole bunch of reasons.[1:58:20] Chris Voss: Now I, I had to go home and go to sleep, when 1 night and when we're in the middle of that. And then it was just I don't remember having trouble going to sleep because I felt like I did a good job, and that We handed I handed the shift off to, another hostage negotiator from the bureau, which effectively the team leader of Vince D'Alfonso, And Vince was a brilliant negotiator. So and the team that he was with, I you know, everybody was in good hands. As a matter of fact, Vince almost kicked me out of the scene because I didn't wanna go, and he just kept saying, go home, get some sleep. Go home, get some sleep.[1:58:58] Chris Voss: And finally, the 5th time he said it to me, I went home. So I felt like I was leaving, things in really good hands. And when we're working kidnappings, we expect them to go for long periods of time. You just you just kinda gotta It if you have faith in a process and you feel like that you're doing the best that can be done, then then I think you could sleep at night, I guess to answer that question, you you have to be careful whether you're working a a a case, a siege, Or, anything in in the in the bureau that you don't run yourself into the ground. And there was Some cases I worked in the nineties where I mean, like, we we knocked ourselves out.[1:59:43] Chris Voss: Like, we would We worked hard on anybody we ever saw, but we occasionally we took time off too. You know, I worked with guys that realize that sometimes you gotta go out and have a beer and Kick back and blow some some steam. So I think everybody that I ever worked with, we're occasionally cautious enough To recharge the batteries. And then depending upon the nature of the challenge in front of you, it was a siege in Saint Martin's Parish who went 6 days. I don't think those guys got a lot of sleep, but the nature of those sieges zone that particular type of siege only last 5 or 6 days anyway.[2:00:17] Chris Voss: You just gotta gut it out.[2:00:20] Andrew Huberman: Were there ever instances where you're just trying to keep the person on the line so they can just raid?[2:00:24] Chris Voss: You know? I I never had to do that personally. You had to be prepared to do that from the very beginning of any siege that you might have to get some you you might have to orchestrate An assault of some sort. I was fortunate enough early on in my training. There's kind of a famous siege in If you know hostage negotiation history in London called the Princess Gate siege, where, a a legendary British hostage negotiator David Van Ness had the bad guys on the phone while the SAS was hidden hidden the building.[2:01:02] Chris Voss: And I remember that We were shown, like, look. There may come a time when you have to keep somebody on the phone when SWAT comes in. That goes with the territory. So expect that's a possibility from the very beginning, and it was a great siege. The bad guy, Salim, The photos of him after he was shot, the phone is within his reach.[2:01:23] Chris Voss: David kept him on the phone. I've heard the tapes. The, breaching explosions were going on, and, Selim says, I gotta go. I gotta go. There's suspicious noises.[2:01:36] Chris Voss: And David Van Ness in his classic British accent said, Salim, there are no suspicious noises. Now let's get back to talking about how many people are going on the bus to the airport. Bam. And and they went in, and and I caught up with David a number years later. I had a FBI pre I had a presidential intern from the White House interning with me in the bureau.[2:02:01] Chris Voss: We're drinking in a bar with David Van Ness. I got a lot of stories where I'm drinking in a bar with somebody, and the intern walked around everybody and tapped David on the shoulder. And He says, Chris says you kept the terrorist on the phone up to the moment that the SAS came in the door. And David says, yeah. And I'd have kept him on the phone even longer if the SAS had hadn't come in so soon.[2:02:24] Chris Voss: So Why am I telling that story? If you're gonna get into that line of business, you gotta accept all the things that go with it and realize That, it's not you that made the decision. Somebody else did. You gotta implement the strategy.[2:02:40] Andrew Huberman: Do you remember a case, in Sacramento where, I think it was a youth gang may, took over, like, an electronic Store.[2:02:51] Chris Voss: The Goodguys siege.[2:02:52] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I remember this when I was a kid.[2:02:54] Chris Voss: Yeah. There are[2:02:54] Andrew Huberman: 2 things that ring that stand out in my mind from when I was a kid. 1 was the[2:02:59] Chris Voss: Good Guys was the name of the electronics store.[2:03:01] Andrew Huberman: Right. Good Guys was the electronics store, and, Bad Guys, so to speak, went in there, took them hostage. And, I I must have been a kid. This must have been, like, late, there was a late eighties, eighties, or something like that. I remember that Case, is this 1990.[2:03:16] Chris Voss: It was either 89 or 90. I I knew one of the negotiators that was there.[2:03:20] Andrew Huberman: 15. So I was born in 75. So, and as I recall, they ended up opening fire on a bunch of hostages who were laying down on the ground. Is that right?[2:03:29] Chris Voss: They, they they knew that they were getting ready to execute the hostages because they put bags over their heads and that whenever the bad guys do anything to dehumanize a hostage, It's easier to shoot somebody with a bag over their head than it is not because you can't see their face. And so the bad guys had begun that process, and they knew they needed to assault.[2:03:55] Andrew Huberman: God forbid anyone should ever be taken hostage. I realize circumstances differ, but you just mentioned putting bags over their heads. There's this notion of sheeple that, you know, people will describe post hoc after something about how, you know, somebody Walks into a building, tells people to, you know, put zip ties on their own ankles or go into a backroom that nobody resists. And that in retrospect, had somebody caused a commotion, They might have caused enough of a commotion to either run out or be let go. And yet, of course, There's a very logical part of everybody's brain, I would hope, that thinks, listen.[2:04:36] Andrew Huberman: This person is an aggressor. There's a gun in my face. Don't be an idiot. Right? Because, we also have heard of the case in New York City that I read about this in the newspaper, so presumably it's true, where someone was held up at gunpoint, and one of the women in the group that was held up what are you gonna do?[2:04:50] Andrew Huberman: Shoot us, and the person shot them.[2:04:52] Chris Voss: Right.[2:04:52] Andrew Huberman: So that happens too. So, you know, I don't know if there's a A fair and safe answer to give people on this. But if you're told to do something by somebody and It's all happening in real time. I mean, you have to ask, do they want my money, my body, my life, or some combination of the 3 Right. In real time while under Presumably significant duress.[2:05:17] Andrew Huberman: But for hostages, like, if they if they disobey, Cause a commotion, is that extending their life, or is it shortening their life? I guess it it's very context dependent.[2:05:28] Chris Voss: Right? The only thing that I could without knowing the context, anything you could do to humanize yourself and comply with what the bad guys want, increases your chance of survival. So let's say you got ordered to go in a back room. You could look at the hostage taker and say, I'll do whatever you say. I'm Chris.[2:05:48] Chris Voss: You know, drop your name on them in a way so that you go from being a faceless person to somebody with a name. That increases the chances to your survival. Humanization, Whatever you can do to comply simultaneously, become more of a human being because it's the opposite of what I was talking about before. If you're easier to kill if you've been dehumanized, you're harder to kill if you've been humanized. You're harder to harm.[2:06:13] Chris Voss: Like, maybe they're not gonna kill you. They're just gonna they're just gonna hurt you. They're less likely to harm you if they know your first name. How do you get them as a hostage negotiator, if they if they talk about a hostage, I'll I'll say, you you you know, you mean you mean Sheila? Do you mean Rex?[2:06:32] Chris Voss: You know, I'm I'll I'll find a way to drop the person's name into the conversation. So as soon as if if you can humanize just by Getting them to know your name increases the chances of survivability. You increase the chances of being treated better and and comply. I'll do what well, I'll do whatever you say I'm Chris. It's gonna it's gonna start to move the odds in your favor.[2:06:56] Andrew Huberman: You know that what you just script described extends to, science. You know, I've talked before about my stance on animal research and, why I Choose to no longer do it. I do think it has its place in making important discoveries that cannot be made on humans, but that Eventually extend to[2:07:15] Chris Voss: But you don't wanna do it.[2:07:16] Andrew Huberman: I don't wanna do it. Personally, I don't wanna do it, and I don't wanna do primate work or large carnivore work or small carnivore work. But, the point I was going to make is that when you do primate work, they strongly discourage, Near forbid you from giving them names. Right. They give them numbers.[2:07:34] Chris Voss: Right. Right. Right. Right.[2:07:35] Andrew Huberman: Right? So it, it all falls in line with what you were what you were talking about. Because the moment something has a name, it moves from being a research animal to a a pet of sorts, and that makes it a relationship.[2:07:47] Chris Voss: Right.[2:07:47] Andrew Huberman: So interesting how a name Turn something from a you know, it elevates something to a relationship. However insignificant, it it's up a notch and into our empathy circuitry[2:07:58] Chris Voss: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[2:07:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Which is, perhaps the appropriate segue to talk about empathy. This is a topic that, you're spending a lot of time about. You you, you mentioned tactical empathy Right. This documentary.[2:08:11] Andrew Huberman: By the way, when is that going to be out, or do we have some sense?[2:08:14] Chris Voss: My guess is, we'll finish jumping through all the hoops and probably have out at the beginning of next year. We're, I'm currently working with William Morris Endeavor on a couple of different projects. They've been enormously supportive.[2:08:28] Andrew Huberman: Great.[2:08:29] Chris Voss: And we've asked for their guidance on, how to how to the best time to get the documentary out, and very happy with the people I'm dealing with there. And, actually, stroke of the universe was looking out for me, funny set of circumstances, and just really enjoy with the people that I'm working with there. So probably first part of next year.[2:08:48] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. What's your take on empathy? I think of empathy in the pop culture sense of, you know, somebody's feeling pain, and we feel their pain.[2:08:59] Chris Voss: Mhmm.[2:08:59] Andrew Huberman: But, of course, empathy extends way beyond that.[2:09:03] Chris Voss: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that was, Rob Malenka? Mhmm.[2:09:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. My colleague at Stanford. He's Yeah.[2:09:09] Chris Voss: I was I was really fascinated by the conversation that you you had with him on that recently. And so and he said a lot of people Use empathy in a lot of different ways sort of for their own meanings. So, my take on empathy, tactical empathy, Also, to keep throwing names out because people give me thoughts, and I wanna source them out. I'm I'm very close to Steven Kotler's perspective on it. As Steven would say, empathy is about the transmission of information.[2:09:38] Chris Voss: Compassion is the reaction to the transmission.[2:09:40] Andrew Huberman: I like that.[2:09:40] Chris Voss: And by[2:09:41] Andrew Huberman: the way, I'm a I'm a fan of Of Steven's work, I think he I think he's quite astute, and, boy, is he a hard worker. He writes like a beast. He's up at, like, 4 in the morning. He also has, like, 50 Chihuahuas or something crazy.[2:09:52] Chris Voss: Away in the dogs. Yeah.[2:09:53] Andrew Huberman: And Yeah. I know. I know. Well, you can fit more chihuahuas in a room than any others. Gotcha, Steven.[2:09:59] Chris Voss: But yeah. So, and and that was what when I was with the FBI, we started collaborating with Harvard because the Harvard definition, was Empathy was not liking the other side. It was just demonstrating an understanding of their perspective. Bob Mnookin's book, Beyond Winnings, Chapter, the attention between empathy and assertiveness. He says empathy is not agreeing, disagreeing, or even liking the other side, Which sort of falls into what Steven talked about.[2:10:29] Chris Voss: You know, it's about the transmission of information. Now empathy is a very compassionate thing to do, But it doesn't necessarily equate to compassion itself. If I'm if I if I let you know if I make you feel heard By me saying to you what your perspective on something is, you're gonna feel cared for. You're gonna feel understood. It's gonna land with you really well.[2:10:54] Chris Voss: I don't necessarily have to feel compassion for you. I know it's a precursor to compassion. So I would separate it From sympathy, clearly, and I would even separate it from compassion. Although I know it's a very compassionate thing to do. It's about Tactical empathy is about me actively demonstrating verbally to you that I understand where you're coming from.[2:11:20] Chris Voss: Tactic from the experience in hostage negotiators backed up by neuroscience is that people largely react negatively. So the smarter move for me instead of trying to reinforce a positive is to first deactivate the negative By simply calling it out calling the elephant a room out. Don't deny the elephant. Don't ignore the elephant. Call the elephant a room out.[2:11:45] Chris Voss: Say, everyday life. Probably gonna sound like I'm greedy if I expect that you're gonna think I'm overreaching. I'm not gonna say, I don't want you to think I'm greedy. I'm gonna say it's probably gonna seem greedy. So simply well educated emotional intelligence influence, gut instinct influence On what the other side is thinking and feeling.[2:12:07] Chris Voss: If I can define it in that way, then it becomes an unlimited skill. If it requires me for To have compassion for you. When I don't, then that limits my ability to use empathy, and I'm not interested in having that Ability to be limited. I want it to be an unlimited skill. So if you just if you just define it strictly in terms of transmission of information, Then it's not sympathy or compassion or liking or agreeing.[2:12:34] Chris Voss: It has a very Powerful effect. It at least feels like compassion to the other side. It reacts with the emotional circuitry, the neurochemicals That everybody has, to some degree, if they're alive, even if they're on this this spectrum, they have some of that going on inside. And of what I've read on even even the mental illnesses, in my last century training, I Saw people who were paranoid schizophrenic as effectively be more of a wiring problem than a chemical problem for for a layman's description. And a lot of what I've read said empathy has even affected with paranoid schizophrenics.[2:13:14] Chris Voss: People, regardless of how, Disarray of the circuitry in their head is it's, it helps them on some level to feel understood. So empathy is just about making somebody feel understood. Example, when I'm I'm working terrorism. We had a lot of Arab Muslims testify in open civilian court against a a legitimate Muslim cleric who was also a criminal, who also committed crimes. And I would sit down with them, and I'd say to them right off the bat because I know where they're coming from.[2:13:53] Chris Voss: You believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that have been anti Islamic. And they'd look at me and they go like, Yeah. I never said I it was true. I never said I agreed. I never said I disagreed.[2:14:10] Chris Voss: By me simply articulating what their perspective on the interaction was, they were so startled by it. It was empathy. And and we were so good at that empathy. Frequently in that in that time frame, They would say, are are you are you Muslim? And I'd say, no.[2:14:30] Chris Voss: I respect a religion. You know, if you need to know. You know, I'm a Christian, But I respect your religion, and I I got no problem saying to you where you're coming from. That's empathy From my definition, and then it becomes an unlimited skill. I I don't have to feel it.[2:14:48] Chris Voss: I don't have to necessarily Wanna do anything about it. You know, Goleman says there's cognitive empathy, me just recognizing where your emotions are coming from. There's emotional empathy, me feeling your emotions, and there's empathic concern, me wanting to do something about your distress. My version of tactical empathy probably brings those into play in sequence on a continuum of sorts, But none of them are precursors. It's just me showing to you that I understand where you're coming from, and it has a phenomenally favorable impact on the interaction.[2:15:26] Andrew Huberman: Tell me about mirroring as a tool.[2:15:29] Chris Voss: Yeah. Mirroring is, one of the simplest, Easiest, and most effective of the skill set takes the least amount of brainpower. It's just repeating 1 to 3 ish words of what somebody has just said, can be 1. It's you should never usually be more than 5. Hostage negotiators learn it by repeating the last 1 to 3 words that somebody's just said.[2:15:53] Chris Voss: It doesn't have to be the last 1 to 3 words, and a mirroring is not the body language mirror. It's not Mimicking anybody physically, and it's not mimicking their tone of voice or their affect or anything about them. It's Just repeating 1 to 3 ish words. We found that accesses for whatever part of brain you, that you gotta energize to do it. It's It's a different part of the brain than labeling.[2:16:17] Chris Voss: People are usually either good really good at labeling. Like, I I label. Almost everybody on my team labels a lot. Sounds like This is bothering you. Sounds like seems like you're just not really sure where this is going.[2:16:31] Chris Voss: And the the mirror, I gotta consciously make it a point to mirror. And what's a mirror used for? It's in place of, what did you mean by that? Or would you please go on? Or I don't understand.[2:16:45] Chris Voss: Could you repeat that again? So I'll listen for stuff that either I don't understand Or I need you to talk more about, and instead of saying, could you say some more about that, I'll just mirror the words. Now for whatever reason, it connects the thoughts in your head. The message the way that lands is I heard what you said. The words I got the words because I just repeated them, and I still don't understand.[2:17:18] Chris Voss: So I need a more in-depth explanation Without using the same words that you just used, because if you say, I think actual press actual is useless. And I might say, what do you mean by that? And you go, isopraxicism is useless. You repeat the same words only louder. You figure that saying it louder will make it penetrate my cranium.[2:17:43] Chris Voss: That doesn't work. I need you To re to explain, to go into more depth, to expand using different words. And for whatever reason, we found as hostage negotiators, and I find a business That if I mirror you, you'll expand and you'll connect. So it's I use it in that context. I might use it to get you to hear yourself out loud.[2:18:10] Chris Voss: Like, if what you just said doesn't make sense, I'll repeat it back word for word, 1 to 3 words, and I'll upward inflect. I'll say that that doesn't make sense. You know, use use my tone. Make it land with my tone so you can hear yourself out loud. Somebody else just pointed out to me the other day that If you're talking to somebody and they're in mid thought and they kinda their voice trails off because they sorta lost their train of thought, If you mirror them there, that helps them get their train of thought back and expand.[2:18:45] Chris Voss: So it's a it's a ridiculously effective communication tool to get people to expand and feel heard. Its simplicity puts some people off. There are some people that say, yeah, it sounds stupid. I don't I don't see what good that will do. I always notice if somebody's really wants to know about mirroring, my description is they're both high IQ and high EQ.[2:19:10] Chris Voss: And why does that work? A high IQ guy's gonna wanna know something that's really simple that doesn't take any effort to do, and that's what Emera does. It it's really, really effective, and it's Almost no effort on your part at all. Interesting.[2:19:24] Andrew Huberman: I must say that neuroscience has a, an unfortunate dearth of knowledge about How brains interact. This is starting to change, but most of what we know about how brains work is from putting people into Functional magnetic resonance imaging machine, so called MRI, exposing them to movies or games that they have to play, etcetera, and then looking at brain state activation. There are a few laboratories starting to look at how people interact in real time with both people in separate MRI machines that hopefully will be able to parse some of this, and, I'm certain that somebody hearing this will, use this knowledge to go do Experiment. If not, I'll I'll, run it up the flagpole to some, highly qualified people at Stanford who could who could do this. Because it'd be fun to see what's happening, but I have the sense That what's happening is that there is a real merge of cognition when one hears their own words Right.[2:20:22] Andrew Huberman: Spoken back to them that, well, it's you know, you get now you got 2 brains processing the same information, and that has to lead new places. So, I don't have any, insights as to where what exactly is happening, but, certainly, that something is happening there[2:20:39] Chris Voss: Right. Right.[2:20:40] Andrew Huberman: Evidenced by the real world that you're getting.[2:20:42] Chris Voss: We don't need no[2:20:43] Andrew Huberman: experiments to tell us that. But it'd be interesting to to see and learn a bit of what's happening. If there's a fusion, for instance, of A coactivation of emotional centers, coactivation of Right. You know, there's something about hearing our own voice It's very different than hearing other people's voices. Most people cringe when they hear their own voice on recording.[2:21:02] Andrew Huberman: Right. Most, not all. Some people are in love with their own voice. We know these people, but we know that our auditory system cancels out The hearing of our own voice. Did you know that?[2:21:16] Andrew Huberman: As we're talking now, our auditory system is suppressing our own voice. We don't really hear ourselves speak the same way that when you speak, I hear you speak. Yeah. So, it's an active neurochemical inhibition of the response, and it's amazing too because as we grow up, our voice changes, Puberty and so forth and other ways too that the vocal cords change in thickness, etcetera. And our voice changes, but we always know self from other in terms of voice, and we cancel out our actual auditory perception[2:21:46] Chris Voss: of our own That's fascinating.[2:21:48] Andrew Huberman: And breathing and heartbeat. We shut down our response to self actively within the brain. That's fascinating. So maybe hearing back some of what we just said allows us to Actually hear what we just said.[2:22:01] Chris Voss: Yeah. Well, true. And and that's why people sometimes all somebody needs is a sounding board So they can they can somebody else can hear hear they can hear themselves out and get it repeated back to them, and then they go like, wait a minute. Did I just say that? Yeah.[2:22:15] Chris Voss: Interesting. Interesting.[2:22:18] Andrew Huberman: Useful. Indeed. Proactive listening. Tell us about proactive listening. We're all told that we need to be better listeners.[2:22:28] Andrew Huberman: You know, the other day, someone said we got 2 ears and 1 mouth as if that's supposed to remind us. Most people have 2 ears and 1 mouth. But I get the point. They were saying, hey. There's value in listening, and more often than not, we default to broadcast, but no reception.[2:22:44] Andrew Huberman: We're mostly broadcast, less reception.[2:22:46] Chris Voss: Right.[2:22:48] Andrew Huberman: Hence, the, the call for nasal breathing. It's useful in a lot of Circumstances, because it keeps us it keeps our mouth shut. What is proactive listening? How do we do it? What's it good for?[2:23:02] Chris Voss: I'm really trying to get people out of the notion of active listening just because active listening has been so overused that People have lost track of it, and it, most of it is taught poorly. And it's interactive versus proactive, and so we learned as Hostage negotiators, first of all, just to label the presenting emotion, and we just assume that and the presenting emotion was always anger of some form, anger upset, on certain rare instances, the guy was under control, but there were almost always negative emotions. So we just assumed that it was, defined to what was, confined to what was driving hostage takers was negativity. Now if I may, because I I feel like an an imposter talking about neuroscience to you.[2:23:46] Andrew Huberman: Well, your knowledge of neuroscience is is is spot on, Voss. I I wanna say numerous times, you've you've asked me about things in neuroscience, and you've you've never been off the mark.[2:23:56] Chris Voss: So, yeah, you you[2:23:57] Andrew Huberman: you've clearly done your homework too.[2:23:58] Chris Voss: Now we keep trying to learn about it, But, layman's terminology, the survival brain is largely negative. Ballpark, I would say 75% negative. Your reactions are gonna be negative. So number 1, I believe that's Principally backed up by the experiments of neuroscience, EFMRIs, have have have you negotiation, we were taught to basically label the presenting emotion. And then I've seen Experimentation or reporting of experiments, I think the first time I read about it was in a book called The Upward Spiral, And that book is a good 10 years old, I think, which means, you know, the neuroscience is evolving.[2:24:44] Chris Voss: But, primarily, the experiment there that I remember reading about and Read about in other places that if people were, undergoing, a negative emotion in my, layman's Paraphrase of the experiment is they they're showing a picture that induced a negative emotion in their head. And then they asked people to simply call out what the emotion was, And when they self labeled, then the emotion diminished. Now the degree of diminishment varies, But the percentage of time that it diminishes by simply by calling it out is just darn near all the time. So for largely 75% negative, and we can deactivate the negativity by calling it out, Well, let's be proactive. If you're a human being and we're engaged in in a negotiation, there's gonna be certain very predictable negativity that's going to be there, and I should be proactive in calling it out.[2:25:43] Chris Voss: Anticipating the negativity is gonna be there Based on a circumstances highly predictable and your gut instinct before that you're referring to when you wanna say, look. I don't want you to think I'm being greedy. Your gut's telling you it's highly predictable. You're gonna come off as greedy. So let me be proactive and say it's probably gonna seem like I'm being greedy, And that's the dialing over to what is eminently predictable in the interaction and just being proactive to Deactivate the negative emotions that either are taking place or what our experiences found, and I haven't seen any Science that is yet that has had the opportunity to back this up, it inoculates.[2:26:28] Chris Voss: I can Create a barrier. If I call out a negative that's not there, it doesn't plant it. It actually inoculates you from it. If, And I've done this in practice. I've, I was given a lecture a couple of years ago.[2:26:42] Chris Voss: Anybody asks a question, I try to find the value in the question no matter how bad the This poor guy asked me a question that I just cannot find a single component in his question That demonstrates that he was listening or paying attention. There was nothing about it that I can congratulate him on. And so I said, This is gonna sound harsh because I know the answer I'm getting ready to give him is gonna make it sound like to the group that I think he's stupid. I just I can't think of a way to respond to this without saying effectively, like, what are you thinking about? That's got nothing to do with what we're talking about.[2:27:20] Chris Voss: So I go, this is gonna sound harsh, and I answer the question. And he just kinda goes, okay. And I start answering somebody else's question, and he goes, That wasn't harsh. Now if I hadn't said this is gonna sound harsh and answered the question, I guarantee you my answer would have embarrassed him, and embarrassment is one of the worst negative emotions you can inflict on anybody, And he would hate me to this day for embarrassing him. So I got a moment coming at me that is predictably negative, And I can let it I can let that train run me down, or I can call it out in advance and get a reaction where the guy says, It wasn't that bad, and that's what being proactive about the emotions is about.[2:28:10] Andrew Huberman: I love it. And I'm Recalling an instance during graduate school where my graduate advisor, who sadly has passed away, but was a phenomenal scientist. I mean, just so pure. Insist on getting the answers could emotionally detach from the answers. I mean, she's just was a was a ninja.[2:28:28] Andrew Huberman: She used to come into the laboratory when we were working on a paper, And she'd sit down, and she'd say, you're gonna hate me for what I'm about to ask you to do. And I think, oh, no. Like, I'm gonna have to redo all the analysis or I'm gonna like, some, you know, monumental thing, and then she'd say, You gotta change the, like, fonts in figure 2. My my godly.[2:28:52] Chris Voss: What do you mean[2:28:53] Andrew Huberman: I don't hate you? But It would but It was a relief. But but I wanted nothing more than to make her happy with my work because I I respected the standard that she held so so greatly. I mean, she could have asked me to, you know, stand on my head and do do the experiments 50 times. I would probably would have done it I thought they would make the the project better, and as a consequence, she would have been pleased, because she was the standard for me and in many ways still is.[2:29:18] Andrew Huberman: But I'm wondering if she read your book because, she used to prestige these requests with, like, you're gonna hate me. And then she'd asked me for something. I'm like, oh, I hate you. Like, that's nothing. But now I I wonder if, if I would have been taken aback if she had just said, You know?[2:29:34] Andrew Huberman: Hey. By the way, figure 2 needs redoing. I might have been kind of bristled by that. So, Maybe she read your book, Chris. These are great tools mirroring and proactive listening, and thank you for sharing these.[2:29:47] Chris Voss: Of course.[2:29:48] Andrew Huberman: Did you ever employ the family members of kidnappers, friends of kidnappers as a means to[2:29:53] Chris Voss: kind of,[2:29:54] Andrew Huberman: tap into a different aspect of their psyche? You know, because I think that we are all, as human beings, very context driven. So I can imagine that the person who kidnapped somebody or who's trying to steal somebody's resources is in a particular groove of the of person. And and I I do think there are people in the world who are just evil, but I also know because I've read about it and I trust the sources that are people who have done horrendous things who love their dog Mhmm. And genuinely love their dog and wouldn't harm an animal.[2:30:28] Andrew Huberman: But I'm not trying to give these people a pass, but I could imagine that, those other facets to somebody represent really good entry points for allowing them to see the kind of incongruence in their behavior. Or is it the case that when these are high stress situations that you just have to basically you know, you have to attack the You know, disarm the aggressor, and you're just focusing on the person as the bad actor, not considering the other context of their lives.[2:30:57] Chris Voss: Alright. So let let's draw a distinction between, hostage takers in a contained situation and, Kidnappers, uncontained, unknown location. So you're probably asking about somebody in a contained situation. Bad guys in a bank, Dwight Watson in in his tractor in Washington DC. So very counterintuitively, if they're in a contained situation, there's a saying out there that says the system that you're employing is perfectly designed to give you the outcome that you have.[2:31:30] Chris Voss: So bad guy, Dwight Watson, is on his Tractor in DC, the family's part of the system that put them there. The blunt harsh reality of that is Now at that siege that went on long enough and it was so high profile, some of his family members showed up. Now we can we could and and did try to use them. I'm I'm walking I'm walking from one place to another, From the negotiation operation, cell component on the way to command post, hostage negotiator, stostomy, couple of people with them. It's Watson's family, and they see I'm in a hurry and that I'm not interested in being stopped.[2:32:16] Chris Voss: And they gotta say to me something to stop me and get my, attention. And they go, look. Our brother's just hurting in his heart. He's just hurting. You know, things have gone bad for our whole family, and he's just hurting his heart.[2:32:31] Chris Voss: Don't kill him over that. I looked at the negotiator, and I said, get that on tape, and we'll play that for him. Because if we can get that on tape exactly the way they said it, that'll land. But if we put them on a phone with them, they're gonna try to reason with them, And they're gonna say stuff to him that didn't help, which they don't very well intention, but it's gonna be counterintuitive, And it's probably gonna make it worse. So you have to understand family can be extremely important if you can get them to say exactly the right thing, And it's probably gonna need to be highly orchestrated because you know how it's gonna land.[2:33:17] Chris Voss: And, unfortunately, I think if you get them in a direct conversation, it'll probably renew an old wound. You know, family members have hurt each other in ways that they have no idea even happened. And so the other you know, a family member my son to this day remembers when I told him Santa Claus wasn't real. And I have no What? You're right.[2:33:37] Chris Voss: You're done. I have no memory of that conversation. I'm sorry. I blew it for you.[2:33:41] Andrew Huberman: Right? Wait. We got oh my goodness.[2:33:42] Chris Voss: Well, family members have heard each other over the years have no idea which comes up in these live conversations, and you don't know what what wound you don't even know what wounds are there that you caused. Right. And so in in a contained situation, a family member can be extremely helpful, but it has to be It's it's a surgical shot that you have to be really, really, really careful with. Otherwise, it can go the other way because wounds and people don't even know are there.[2:34:09] Andrew Huberman: Gosh. That's such a psychologically astute way of viewing it because I'm a big fan of the so called family systems model of psychology. I mean, you can't look at any human being psychology, p positive, meaning adaptive or maladaptive psychology and not look at the family system at which that evolved, which is not to say that some probably healthy families occasionally don't have issues with a child having mental illness, and and, I mean, that happens. But I'm told that 99.9% of the time, you can identify a family System organization or a lineage, a genetic tie, etcetera, that that makes things start to make sense when somebody's really Right.[2:34:51] Chris Voss: Right.[2:34:51] Andrew Huberman: Right. And and as you pointed out, sadly, oftentimes that that involves, pains of past. Wow. Well, thanks for sharing that because I I think that, in my mind, the movie version of it is, you know, they bring the mother in, and it's like, Billy, don't do it. You know?[2:35:08] Andrew Huberman: But then as you said, Billy might like, that might be the time when Billy's really gonna let His mother know, you know, childhood sucked for Billy. Right? And that's not what you want. Yeah. Goodness.[2:35:22] Andrew Huberman: What a complex job. What a complex, high stakes, high consequence job. What did you do to unload some of the heaviness? I don't I'm not just talking about getting a good night sleep or having a a beer with your coworkers after although those things serve, You know, important roles for, for people I realize. You know, do you think we can dump The hard stuff in our head, in our hearts in a way that, you know, allows us to be functional.[2:35:54] Andrew Huberman: Because, you know, people in your line of work, and I think just anyone in the world, you you live long enough, you're gonna you're gonna experience loss.[2:36:01] Chris Voss: Yeah. You're gonna get kicked in the in the gut. Yeah.[2:36:03] Andrew Huberman: And you're gonna see people you care about get kicked in the gut.[2:36:05] Chris Voss: That[2:36:06] Andrew Huberman: that's there's so much beauty to life as well, but but that's the reality. So, Did you do you have tools, processes that you use to kinda dump the baggage that you can lean into your relationships and your relationship to yourself, with with re restored sense of optimism.[2:36:29] Chris Voss: Yeah. I think Mostly, most of the people that I've always worked around, we've been very reinforcing of one another, Comedically, emotionally, friendship wise, you know, being able to laugh with each other, Taking it easy on each other, getting people you you know, laughter, and genuine understanding with with, without, You know, somebody trying to tell you that you you did wrong. I've been lucky enough to either find myself in those groups most of the time, or We we just evolved it. That's just the way that we were. We were attracted to one another, emotionally, psychologically because of that.[2:37:15] Chris Voss: That's probably it mostly. I mean, I've tried to parse some of these emotions out recently. Like, I'm not particularly proud of anything I've ever dead done, But I always felt like it was a privilege. Like, you must be proud of your accomplishments. I don't know that it's pride, but there's, there's other satisfaction that I get out of it.[2:37:33] Chris Voss: And so thinking about what drives me also now, you know, that I'm running a company and, and and I got people, also Entrepreneurs that are trying to do the best for their employees. You know, what do we encourage in one another so that Whatever we're doing, people feel good about it. And I've tried to take a lot of that from what I learned as an FBI agent and a hostage negotiator and the people that I was around. And, you know, we did joke with each other a lot, and we did, play tricks on each other. You know, good good natured humor.[2:38:08] Chris Voss: Avoid the people that are running you down, but be able to, you know, take Take, some good natured ribbing every now and then, and I and I think humor is is, one way or another combined with hard work and an appreciation for what you're doing, it's probably been most of the the the mental health along the way. Occasional bourbon.[2:38:31] Andrew Huberman: Love it. We did a whole episode on alcohol, and so people are gonna hear me say, love it, and think, oh, wait. Here, I'm supporting out listen. The data say as long as you're not an alcoholic, As long as you are of age, probably 2 drinks a week is or less is safe. Make them make them good high quality drinks if you're gonna have them.[2:38:51] Andrew Huberman: Consume them in the right context or don't consume them at all, but, but that's why I said love it. I I I support your your love of bourbon. I'm not a bourbon drinker, but Tell me a little bit more about what you're up to lately. You alluded to it a moment ago that you're running teams that are doing a lot. So you're you're in charge of a lot of people now, helping people help people, providing a lot of service in the world through a lot of different channels.[2:39:17] Andrew Huberman: First of all, I wanna say that your book, Never Split the Difference, one of my favorite books.[2:39:22] Chris Voss: Thank you.[2:39:23] Andrew Huberman: I don't say that lightly. I don't endorse Books very often, but the books I do endorse, I love, love, love. I also have to say that it's a toss-up between your book, Never Split the Dis Difference, and The Body Keeps the Score for the award for best titles of any book. Those are just, like, amazing titles. Amazing, amazing titles.[2:39:44] Chris Voss: Paul Roaz, Our, cowriter came up with the title. Yeah.[2:39:47] Andrew Huberman: It's a phenomenal title. That and the body keep this keeps the score. Just like because it's there's so much contained in in the title, And then the book, exceeds expectations. So, really amazing book. People should listen to it, Read it if they haven't already.[2:40:02] Andrew Huberman: We are doing a lot more right now than, than just writing, although I wanna hear about your other book projects as well. But before you list off the number of things you're doing, tell me first about fireside because this sounds like a really interesting, Endeavor that, frankly, I haven't heard of before. What's Fireside?[2:40:22] Chris Voss: A brand new social media platform. It's Essentially, an interactive podcast. It's a subscription service founded by Fallon Fademy and Mark Cuban. Fallon and I have been friends a number of years, she was Google's youngest employee. She's an entrepreneur, dynamic, smart, hard charging person, And it's sort of grew out of what's inadequate in some of the social media apps that are out there.[2:40:51] Chris Voss: Trying to combine the best ideas of a a few different things. And Fallon suggested it to me, and I thought I'll jump in because she's a visionary. And what it's turned out to be is is effectively weekly interactive group coaching, and you You get the app off your iPhone or your Android, whatever platform your phone is on, and then you log in. We do an hour once a week, and it's you're getting group coaching, and then you get asked questions. And it's got a video component to it, so if you wanna ask Question, we we're gonna bring you up on, quote, stage, and I get to see you and talk directly to you, and you get to See me and talk directly to me or and I interviewed Mark Cuban a couple of weeks ago when people got to come on and ask Mark questions or ask me questions.[2:41:40] Chris Voss: And what it has turned out to be is just one of sort of, the the next level of how to get better at negotiations After you've read the book and probably taken a masterclass, you know, where do you go next? One of the people that came on The podcast the other day, the the the fireside, episode, they said, well, I don't have enough money yet to go to your In person training events because those are expensive, and this is how I'm gonna get better in the in the meantime and and work my way in that direction. And so the monthly coaching if you were to sign up for group coaching from us on a regular basis on a monthly basis, It would probably easily cost you for what we're providing 25, $30,000 a month, and this is 1,000 a year. So at scale, it's an opportunity to interact directly with me and the members on my team once a week and get group coaching, and it's And it's just kinda fun. We're getting a kick out of it and people that really, really care about interacting well with people.[2:42:47] Chris Voss: Guy comes on the 1st episode I did, and he said, besides the fact that you helped me make a lot more money, you helped me save my marriage. And he just needed to know how to talk more genuinely and honestly with his wife In a way that Mel Mater felt heard, and he didn't really have a a good way to do that beforehand. And I I was just like, That's a lot. I don't I don't I don't know how to respond to that other than just be grateful that people can say stuff like that to us. So the fireside thing is kinda cool.[2:43:24] Chris Voss: We're still experimenting with it. It's an interactive podcast group coaching. It's fun.[2:43:32] Andrew Huberman: Great. I mean, I would say, you're changing lives there. I mean, the saving of marriage is no is no small deal. And I think that the ability to Communicate, directly with people. Also, I imagine, gives them the opportunity to implement the the tools that you're providing in real time.[2:43:47] Chris Voss: Right.[2:43:47] Andrew Huberman: It's one thing to hear about something and and try it, but then, you can give feedback in real time. Are you on these these fireside Chats directly or members of your team?[2:43:56] Chris Voss: No. I I do we do 1 every week, and I'm once a month. And the other thing too, like, I can explain something one way. And if for whatever reason, it doesn't land in your context, you can't quite get it, so that's what we found About the interactive nature of it, somebody comes on and asks a question in their context, and then I'll answer it. And then I'll go like, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.[2:44:20] Chris Voss: Alright. That helped. So you get you get to hear people like you who are struggling with it the way you are, but I haven't put it in your context yet. And that's the other thing that's great about a q and a, a live q and a.[2:44:33] Andrew Huberman: We had a guest on here who told me that there are Amazing data supporting the fact that people follow the medical and health advice of doctors that they can relate to Far more than they follow the medical and health advice of the physicians that they feel aren't like them. And, oftentimes, this can include the physician or health care provider being someone that they would aspire to be like, but, oftentimes, just some common rapport. Like, they both like baseball, or they both like to cook or to garden, and that sets a bridge Right. Where then the patient is willing to do all these things that ordinarily they would be resistant to.[2:45:13] Chris Voss: Right.[2:45:13] Andrew Huberman: And and there are really good data to support this, and I I that that really stuck with me because it says that it's it's not just about the information or the the delivery route of the information that the context and the rapport is even along something as like, you you're a by the way, I'm not a major, you know, a a major sports fan on most things, but, you know, like, oh, you're a Bills fan or something like me too. Like, that can be the difference between Somebody doing all the things to lower their blood pressure, the day in, changing their diet, all the all those things versus not making the changes at all.[2:45:46] Chris Voss: Rapport is a magic yeah. It's kind of a magic component that changes Mhmm. Changes everything.[2:45:52] Andrew Huberman: Well, Fireside sounds like a great opportunity for people to not just ask questions, but to build rapport with you and members of your team. So,[2:46:00] Chris Voss: I'm[2:46:00] Andrew Huberman: gonna check it out. Lord knows I, I I need help improve my communications in certain certain domains of life. Believe me, I get the memos. Fact. What other writing projects are you involved in, if any.[2:46:19] Chris Voss: We're we've been toying with this, companion, operations manual For tactical empathy, which getting it right is important, so it's sort of a companion book to never split the difference. That's probably at least a year and a half out from being done. So in the meantime, we just do we do a lot of online training. You know, we got a we got a newsletter we put out weekly For for people to get our latest cutting edge application thoughts as much as possible, we're putting information out that we charge for a lot, and we put out a lot of free stuff. You know?[2:46:58] Chris Voss: I'm, I I'm throwing out ideas on Instagram, But we're constantly trying to put information out there so that so that people can collaborate better. So specific we just finished a book for residential real estate agents. Friend of mine, Steve Scholl, we put that out last November. That's sort of niched, but it's mostly the black swan method for real estate agents because every conversation they're in is a difficult emotional conversation. Sell of a house is one of the most stressful moments of anybody's life, selling or buying, so we just put that out.[2:47:33] Chris Voss: In the meantime, you know, we're Spread the gospel as much as possible.[2:47:38] Andrew Huberman: We'll certainly point out the various places people can find you and and the Different venues for for learning more. I want to say that, numerous times throughout today's conversation, You threw out the words sounds like[2:47:53] Chris Voss: Mhmm. Yeah.[2:47:53] Andrew Huberman: As an opener. And I have to say, I have this kinda crazy idea in the back of my mind. You know, I I believe that, Simple, field tested tools are immensely powerful, not just for resolving negotiations, but really for changing the way that people interact with each other and themselves. And, you know, if if I have one wish, for the world, on the basis of our conversation, How amazing would it be if kids learned early on to talk to one another from that sounds like perspective? Because I think that would naturally, orient them toward listening[2:48:31] Chris Voss: Right.[2:48:31] Andrew Huberman: Or at least offering a hypothesis of what they heard and how poorly They might be listening and then getting a defensive stance response that informs them about the accuracy or lack of accuracy, and on and on. I feel like the the sounds like, question, sounds like you feel blank or sounds like you believe blank just seems to me like the, like one of the one of the most potent tools in the universe, and I sure wish that all adults Would implement it, but that kids would learn about it too.[2:49:06] Chris Voss: Yeah. That's that yeah. That's a that's a great thought. You know? How how do how do we Teach them at a younger age that that listening is actually an effective thing to do.[2:49:14] Chris Voss: It's actually a way to think things through also. So I yeah. I agree. I mean, wave a magic wand. Right?[2:49:24] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Well, Chris, I wanna thank you so much For your time today, I mean, you've joined us on this tour of so many different facets of your work prior and present, And you've let us, get a little glimpse into the the portal of your future work too, which I'm eagerly awaiting.

You're constantly Putting knowledge into the world on Instagram, your book, Fireside, and, courses, and on and on, Glean from your experience in very, very intense circumstances, but really with an eye toward people getting the most out of that for their their daily lives, which Hopefully, don't involve hostage negotiations, unless they're a hostage negotiator.[2:50:14] Andrew Huberman: So I just wanna say, Thank you ever so much for what you do and for being such a phenomenal, communicator, and, also, thank you for doing into that late night FM DJ voice.[2:50:28] Chris Voss: Yeah. I've you know, I've been I've wanted to be, here sitting with you being interviewed on your podcast, since I first discovered it, you[2:50:37] Andrew Huberman: Thank you.[2:50:38] Chris Voss: Several years ago, and it's a privilege to be here.
