I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing doctor Matthew Doctor Johnson is a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where he also directs the Center For Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. As many of you know, there's extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics for the treatment of various disorders of the mind. Doctor Johnson's laboratory Is among the premier laboratories in the world understanding how these compounds work, how things like psilocybin and LSD and related compounds Allow neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and changed such that people can combat diseases like depression or trauma or other disorders of the mind that cause tremendous suffering.[0:00:55] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Johnson is also an expert in understanding how different types of drugs Impact different types of human behaviors such as sexual behavior, risk taking, and crime. Doctor Johnson and his work have also been featured prominently in the popular such as articles in The New York Times, in Michael Pollan's book How to Change Your Mind, and in a feature in 60 Minutes about psychedelics and the new Emerging science of psychedelic therapies for treating mental disorders. During the course of today's conversation, doctor Johnson and I talk about psychedelics at the typical macrodosing, what those macrodoses entail. And he walks us through what an experiment of a patient taking psychedelics for the treatment of depression looks like in his laboratory from start to finish. The conversation was an absolutely fascinating one for me to partake in.[0:01:51] Andrew Huberman: I learned so much About the past, present, and future of psychedelic treatments and compounds. And indeed, I hope to have doctor Johnson on this Podcast again in the not too distant future so that we can talk about other compounds that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior and perhaps can also be used to treat various diseases. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to Thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:02:27] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day every day is because it covers my foundational nutritional needs. It has the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, And the probiotics are important to me because there is now so much data about the importance of the so called gut microbiome, Maintaining healthy gut bacteria and the ways in which those gut bacteria impact things like inflammation and keeping inflammation down in the brain and body, as well as supporting things like quality mood, endocrine function, metabolic function, just so many factors.[0:03:11] Andrew Huberman: The great thing about Athletic Greens is that it also tastes very good. I mix mine Water, a little bit of lemon juice. And as I mentioned, I drink that once or twice a day. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com Slash Huberman. And if you do that, you get the athletic greens plus you'll get 5 free travel packs.[0:03:29] Andrew Huberman: The travel packs make it very easy to mix up athletic greens when you're on the road, in the car, on Plain, etcetera. And you'll get a year supply of vitamin d three k two. There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin d three and k two are important for various aspects of metabolic health, cardiac health, and so forth. So once again, that's athletic greens.com/huberman to get Athletic Greens, the 5 free travel packs and your year's supply of vitamin d three and k two. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.[0:03:58] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done. And now with the advent of quality DNA tests, you can get a lot of information about your genetics and how That also impacts your immediate and long term health. The reason I'm such a fan of getting blood work done is that it is really the only way to understand what's going on in your System at a level that can really inform your decisions about your immediate and long term health. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however, is that you get numbers back about your hormones and your metabolic factors, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information.[0:04:39] Andrew Huberman: With InsideTracker, they have a very easy to use dashboard That gives you that information and then gives you some suggestions and directives about things you could change about your nutrition, about your exercise, and other lifestyle factors that can help you move those numbers in the direction that's best for you and for your health. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com /huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Belcampo. Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California that raises organic, grass fed, and finished certified humane meats.[0:05:16] Andrew Huberman: I eat meat about once a day. In general, my lunch or my breakfast consists of some meat, and that meat has to be a very high quality. And generally, I'll eat some vegetable as well. And then I tend to eat pastas and rice and things of that sort later in the day or in the evening in order to facilitate the transition to sleep. So I'm eating meat about once a day, and I always insist that the meat that I eat be of the very highest quality and that the animals were raised and maintained humanely.[0:05:42] Andrew Huberman: While conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots and eat a diet of inflammatory grains, Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures and seasonal grasses resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients and healthy fats. In addition, they raise their animals in a way that's not just better for our health, but also has a positive impact on the environment. They practice regenerative agriculture, which means the meat is climate positive and carbon negative, so you can feel good about what you're eating at the environmental level and for sake of your health. You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats to be delivered to you by using my code huberman@bellcampo.com/huberman and entering my code day, I might have a New York steak. I also really like the meatballs.[0:06:29] Andrew Huberman: I'm a particular fan of the meatballs. So again, that's belcampo.com/huberman And enter the code Huberman at checkout to get 20% off your order. And now my conversation with doctor Matthew Johnson. Well, Matthew, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'm a huge fan of your scientific work, and I'm here to learn from you.[0:06:50] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Likewise. Big fan and happy to do this with you.[0:06:53] Andrew Huberman: Alright. Well, thank you. My first question is a very basic one, which is, What is a psychedelic? We hear this term all the time, but what qualifies a substance to as a psychedelic?[0:07:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Nomenclature is a real challenge in this area of psychedelics. So starting with the word psychedelic, it just If if you're a pharmacologist, it's it's not very satisfying because that term really spans different Pharmacological classes. In other words, if you're really concerned about receptor effects and the basic effects of a compound, it spans several classes of compounds. But overall so it's really more of a a cultural term or It does have a relationship to drug effects, but it's at the at at a very high level. So all of the so called psychedelics across these Distinct, classes that I can talk more about.[0:07:54] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The way I put it is they all had the ability to profoundly alter One sense of reality, and that can mean many things. Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self, acutely. So when someone's on The psychedelic. So the different classes that can be the specific pharmacological classes that Can be called a psychedelic are one that what are called the classic psychedelics. So in the literature, you'll see that term, and Hallucigen and psychedelic are all have traditionally been used synonymously.[0:08:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I think there was a little bit tendency to stay away from psychedelics of the baggage, There's been a return to that in the last several years, but the classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens are things like LSD, Psilocybin, which is in so called magic mushrooms. It's in over 200 species that we know of so far of mushrooms. Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, which is in dozens and dozens of plants. Glenn, which is in the peyote cacti and some other cacti, like San Pedro. And even amongst these classic psychedelics, there are 2 structural structural classes.[0:09:10] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So that's the chemistry. There's the tryptamine based compounds like psilocybin and DMT, And then there's the Phenethylamine based compounds. So these are the basic 2 basically building blocks that that you're starting from, either a tryptamine structure Or a phenethylamine structure. But that's just the chemistry, the all of the what's more important, or at least to to someone like me, are the receptor effects, and then ultimately, that's gonna have a relationship to the behavioral and subjective effects. So all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonist or partial agonist at the serotonin two way receptor, so some type of serotonin receptor.[0:09:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Then you had these other classes of of of that you compounds that you could call psychedelic. Another bit big one would be the NMDA antagonist. So this would include Ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan, something I've done some research with, which Folks might recognize from, like, robo tripping, guzzling, like, you know, call syrup, which is something kind of like high school kids are known to do, and they can't get ahold of real drugs, that type of thing. So, a large overlap the types of subjective effects that you get from those compounds compared to the two a agonist classic psychedelics. But then you have and by the way, this description, this framework I'm describing, not everyone will agree.[0:10:35] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Some people will say, no. Psychedelic only means classic psychedelic. So there's different opinions here. But you have, Gosh. Salvinorin a, which is a kappa opioid agonist, which, again does that come from?[0:10:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Salvia divinorum, it's a plant that became 20 years ago. It sort of popped onto the legal high scene. And there's a, you know, long history of this. You Predating the Internet, going back to, like, the stuff Juan Guldora in the back of High Times Magazine, and most of this stuff, like, never worked. You know?[0:11:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Or it's like, just smoking off of anything, maybe get a little bit light headed. But this is one of those things that popped around 20 years ago when it quickly got the reputation. Like, holy shit. This stuff actually works and works really strongly. In these smoked extracts, particularly, people have these Reality altering experiences on par with smoked DMT, the classic psychedelic.[0:11:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So often and that we did the first Blinded controlled human research with Salvator and a, so lots of entity contact. So feeling that you in the experience of Experience of 1 is actually interacting with autonomous beings, that type of thing. And then you have another big one I probably should have mentioned even before the, You know, salvin or nay, but you have MDMA, which really stands in a class by itself. So it's been called an intactogen and and, What does that mean? It means, like, touching within.[0:12:01] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It sort of eludes the idea that it can really put someone in touch with their emotions. It's also been called an pathogen, meaning can can afford empathy. But I think intactogen is probably that's the the term that I I tend to focus on and I know I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but the for the for the, viewers, the the primary mechanism of MDMA is serotonin release, and to a degree, other monoamine released, dopamine, serotonin. And so, structurally, that's also in the Phenethylamine class, which contains mescaline, the classic psychedelic, but also amphetamine. So just, you know, like Adderall is is is in that phenethylamine class.[0:12:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And so this is another example where chemistry doesn't dictate. I mean, you can tweak a molecule. It might have that same basic structure, but now you've profoundly changed the way it interacts with The receptor. So in MDMA does not, you know, exert its actions by, I like to say by by by, you know, mimicking the baseball entering the glove of the post, synaptic receptor side, You know, acting as an agonist, so mimicking the the the the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin, like the classic psychedelics do. MDMA works on the pitcher side of just basically throwing out more of the natural the the endogenous Dumping[0:13:31] Andrew Huberman: more serotonin.[0:13:32] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Dumping more serotonin, flooding Yeah. The synapse.[0:13:36] Andrew Huberman: So I get the impression that this psychedelic space is a enormous cloud of partially overlapping compounds.[0:13:43] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[0:13:44] Andrew Huberman: Meaning, some are impacting the serotonin system more than the dopamine system. Others are impacting the dopamine system more the than the serotonin system. Given that the definition of a psychedelic is that it profoundly alters sense of self, at least That's included as a partial definition. Mhmm. Can we break that down into a couple of subcategories?[0:14:06] Andrew Huberman: So for instance, hallucinating, Either auditory or visual, synesthesia, perceptual blending, the sense that, you know, you can hear colors, and see sounds, for instance, a common, report of people that take psychedelics, in sufficiently high doses. So hallucinating, synesthesia, and then in terms of sense of self, you know, as a neuroscientist, I think, okay, what does it mean Alter a sense of reality. Really, what the brain does, in a very coarse way, is to try and figure out What's happening in space, physical space, and that physical space could be within us or outside us, and what's happening in time. Right. And, as a vision scientist, the simplest explanation is when I move my hand from one location to another location, it's measuring the Space, the location of my hand in space over time, and then you get a rate and a, you know, speed and all that kind of stuff.[0:15:04] Andrew Huberman: Right? Yeah. That gets more complicated as you get into the emotional, realm. But is it fair to say that psychedelics are impacting The space time analysis that the brain is performing and thereby creating hallucinations and thereby altering, You know, the blending of senses, is it fair to say that?[0:15:28] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I think it's it's fair to floor that area. And here here's what I'm thinking. The the clearly, there is a changed relationship, certainly at the right dose of Orientation in space time. I think as a as a you know, I'm primarily a a behaviorist. And in terms of Human behavioral pharmacology, I'm I always go to comparative pharmacology.[0:15:51] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Okay. What can we say that is it truly unique about the classic psychedelics or psychedelics In general so with that description, I'm thinking, okay. Alcohol can really screw up your, you know, time, space,[0:16:04] Andrew Huberman: Orientation reception. Your balance Troprioception. Cellular.[0:16:07] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yep. You know? And in many ways and and so in those gross motorways, like far worse, know, of course, everything's dose dependent, but in the classics like daloxetine, obviously, the Benzodiazepines being very similar to alcohol, same thing. So, You know, I'd wanna, you know, dig in a little more in terms of, like maybe there's something more specific we could say about that relationship to time and space that the the psychedelics are tinkering with. But I I'm not sure.[0:16:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's an interesting hypothesis that the idea that that's a mediator, that that that's something That there's something fundamental about changing that the representation in time and and space. There might be something to that. I mean, I think of of these as as psychedelics as profoundly altering Models. You know you know, we're all you know, we're prediction machines, and that's so much of that is is top down And, and and psychedelics have a good way of, you know, loosely speaking, dissolving those Models. And and one of at the at the reality[0:17:13] Andrew Huberman: give us an example of 1 of like, a model? Like, a like, I know that when, I throw a ball in the air, it falls down, not up. That's a that's a prediction that I learned as a child. I I did not come into the world with a brain that, Knew that relationship between objects and gravity, but one of the first things that a child learns is the relationship Between objects and gravity and their trajectory. So[0:17:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And with a 4 year old, I mean, I saw that at earlier ages, like, that experimentation of, like, Oh, yeah. That's what happens. You know? Right.[0:17:48] Andrew Huberman: So if if he were to throw a ball if your child were to throw a ball and it went up into the sky, that would be absolutely Mind blowing. It would be for an adult too.[0:17:58] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It'd be a pre psychedelic experience, probably.[0:18:01] Andrew Huberman: Right. And so there's a there's a there's a rule there. You're saying there's a kind of a a prediction there's a rule that that underlies a prediction that when that rule is violated, All of a sudden, the circuit presumably for that prediction go like, it doesn't have a mind, but it's in, but somehow it it creates a surprise element or a or[0:18:21] Dr. Matthew Johnson: a Yeah. Recognition element. And it's not filtered out. You know? The and this might sound extreme, but there are these cases.[0:18:30] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It was over Overblown in sort of the propaganda, the late sixties, early seventies, but there are credible cases of people. I think it's very atypical of Sounds like they really thought they could fly and, you know, jump out of a a a a of a window. Now Far more people every year fall I mean, who knows? You know? They they they they fall and die out of you know, from height Because they're drunk.[0:18:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You know? So this is extremely rare. But, you know, there are some, like, pretty convincing, Case, there was 1 research volunteer in our studies, that, it she looked like she was in one of our studies, like, was trying to dive through a painting on the wall. She was fine, but she reviewing the video, it looked like She really thought that she was gonna go through that painting, and who knows? He said she was the other dimension.[0:19:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So they're violating these predictions. Yeah. I the reason I ask it the the question the way I did is because, given the enormous cloud of different substances and given the range of previous experiences that people show up to a psychedelic experience with, I feel like the ability to extract some universal themes is is useful, especially for people who haven't done them before. Right?[0:19:52] Andrew Huberman: Who might, not have an understanding of what their effects are like. Can we just briefly touch on the serotonin system? Mhmm. And the dopamine system, I I want to acknowledge it as you already know that there are many neuromodulator systems in the body, And, you know, the opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. But there's something so profound about the serotonin system and the dopamine system because the way I define a neuromodulator Is it's a modulator.[0:20:20] Andrew Huberman: It changes the way that other circuits behave. And, essentially, it up it increases the probability that certain circuits will be active and decreases the probability that other will be active in in a Mhmm. In a general sense. So compounds like LSD, lysergic acid, diethylamide, and psilocybin, My understanding is that they primarily target this serotonin system. How do they do that at a kind of general level.[0:20:48] Andrew Huberman: And why would increasing the activity of a particular serotonin receptor or batch of serotonin receptors lead to these Profoundly different experiences that we're calling, model challenges, challenging preexisting models and predictions. I mean, At the end of the day, it's a chemical, and these receptors are scattered around the brain with billions of other receptors. Yeah. What do we think is going on in in a general sense?[0:21:17] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. And this is really the area of active exploration, and we don't have great answers. We know A good amount about the receptor level pharmacology, some things about post receptor signaling pathways. In other words, just fitting into the receptor.[0:21:32] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Clearly, you know, serotonin itself is not psychedelic, you know, or else we'd be tripping all of us all the time.[0:21:38] Andrew Huberman: Because when I eat a bagel, I get serotonin release. Right. Uh-huh. I mean, there's, and Or turkey. I mean, there's a trip to the van.[0:21:44] Andrew Huberman: Right? Mhmm. My understanding of serotonin is is that in very broad strokes that it It generally leads to a state of being fairly it pushes the mind and body towards a state of contentment within the immediate Experience. Whereas the dopamine system really places us into an external view of what's out there in the world and what's possible. Yeah.[0:22:07] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Need to do something. I mean, that's consistent with my understanding, and, and and and I'll certainly not in terms of I don't primarily identify Why is it a neuroscientist? Definitely tell the, you know, the viewers that we're far more in your domain here than mine, but in terms of how psychedelics and other drugs, You know, interface at the at the neuroscience level.[0:22:28] Andrew Huberman: Well, feel free to to explain it at the experiential level.[0:22:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. I mean,[0:22:31] Andrew Huberman: it doesn't have I I think There probably are some audience members that are interested in is it the 5 h two c? Is it the layer 5 neurons in cortex? That conversation we could hold, and that's an interesting conversation. But just in terms Of the experience of serotonergic versus dopaminergic drugs[0:22:48] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[0:22:49] Andrew Huberman: They they do seem to create distinct Classes of experience. So I think that's that's the the appropriate level for us to discuss them.[0:22:58] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And in terms of how they and and I like I'd like to the biology a little bit here and tell you, like, sort of what's known and what some of the I ideas are.[0:23:05] Andrew Huberman: Please.[0:23:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You know, have this pat you know, as as you know, like, You know, these are levels of analysis, and it's not which one is going on. It's almost like for the particular question, which level of analysis is most appropriate? Is it, You know, is a question best addressed by the biology, the the the chemistry, or the or the physics? That that's how I think of, like, receptor level, post receptor signaling, Downstream effects on other, other neurotransmitters and then, in activation level effects and then, Coordination of activation. So you've got the clearly, the with the classic psychedelics, the two way, activation, We we do know that there are downstream effects in terms of, increasing glutamate transmission, so this is likely a commonality why, You know, Ketamine is very psychedelic in slightly different way,[0:23:54] Andrew Huberman: but Do people hallucinate on Ketamine?[0:23:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yes. Yes. And it's more dissociative, so someone is more likely to sort of, Be less behaviorally active. If they have a really high dose, they go into a k hole. And and if they go in a really high dose, like, you get in surgery, you get in a k hole.[0:24:08] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Conscious. Yeah. Ketamine a[0:24:10] Andrew Huberman: hole, but a k hole.[0:24:10] Dr. Matthew Johnson: A k hole. Yeah. It's very different. The k hole and ketamine's interesting because people can take kinda bumps and kinda dance on it with the sort of an alcohol level strength of a effect, and that's sort of the classic kind of raving, you know, use of it. But then Those folks wanna titrate their dose because, if they do more of, like, a line, you get up to, like, 75, 100 milligrams, then you're talking about, you know, if you're on the dance floor, you're on on the floor, and your friends are trying to make sure people aren't stepping on you.[0:24:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So that's, like, Why would somebody want[0:24:44] Andrew Huberman: to take a dissociative anesthetic? Like, to me, it's completely mysterious as to why someone will want to dissociate from their body.[0:24:53] Dr. Matthew Johnson: People claim that these these the in these NMDA antagonist psychedelics are extremely insightful, you know, in a very similar way to the experiences with the classic psychedelics.[0:25:04] Andrew Huberman: So And Ketamine is now legal for therapeutic use.[0:25:07] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Right. SPRAVATO, the the The the intranasal form, marketed by Janssen, which is esketamine. It's one of the yeah. It's prescription and, So[0:25:18] Andrew Huberman: people are taking in the nasal spray.[0:25:20] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[0:25:21] Andrew Huberman: And then are they undergoing talk therapy while they're doing this?[0:25:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Typically not. So it's this is very interesting, and there's so much work needs to be done. It's not treated as psychedelic therapy. And by that, psychedelic therapy, I mean, You tell the person they're gonna have an altered experience. You tell them to pay attention to that experience, that they might learn something from that experience.[0:25:43] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And afterwards, you discussed that experience. With SPRAVATO, the model is[0:25:49] Andrew Huberman: SPRAVATO is[0:25:50] Dr. Matthew Johnson: is esketamine.[0:25:50] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:25:51] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's the the yeah. The the spray form of Ketamine that's it's been FDA approved for treatment resistant depression, but it's you'll you'll probably feel different. Ignore that. That's a side effect. That's an adverse effect.[0:26:05] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Just ignore it. We don't think that has anything to do with the way it works, but just get this thing. It's a it's a direct, you know, sort of chemotherapeutic effect in a sense. It's it's it's not Facilitating a learning process. Now there's older work.[0:26:21] Dr. Matthew Johnson: There was a guy Kropitsky in Russia that did extensive work with Higher doses of Ketamine, I should say, SPRAVATO at the prescribed doses isn't very psy it's a pretty low dose. It's in this Mild psychedelic range, but it's not very strong. But this older work that happened in the nineties and early 2000 in in Russia, they were using very high doses and treating it like a psychedelic you know, treating it as if it was a psychedelic therapy. In other words, telling people, You're gonna have this experience. It's gonna you know, we're hoping you learn something from it.[0:26:54] Dr. Matthew Johnson: We're gonna help you through it. We're gonna discuss it afterwards. And they found incredibly high rates of success and some pretty well controlled trials for both heroin addiction and alcohol addiction. So I think a whole lot of work needs to be done now. And you see some of the ketamine clinics that are using ketamine off label, a lot of them are treating it like psychedelic therapy.[0:27:13] Dr. Matthew Johnson: There's essentially no research at this point on that. Do you get better results? Straight abusive, there's There's some good variability, but its antidepressant effects last about a week, but they kick in immediately. Now A week is a long time for, like, most most psychiatric drugs. Like, you take it every day.[0:27:34] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:27:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You know? So that's amazing, but it's still just a week. We're seeing effects, Yeah. A year or more later with with with Psilocybin and and some of the classic psychedelics, that could be a pharmacological difference, or it could be That they get a lot more mileage out of Ketamine if they treated it like psychedelic therapy. And so that's some[0:27:54] Andrew Huberman: so that's that's what that means.[0:27:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Really just like our our psilocybin, you know, sessions, which I know I haven't described, but briefly, you have anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of Preparation, getting to know the people who are gonna be the guides or the therapists in the room with you.[0:28:08] Andrew Huberman: You could walk us through this. So Let's say I were to come to one of your clinical trials, because these are clinical trials. Right? And in your at your lab at Hopkins. Yeah.[0:28:18] Andrew Huberman: And, would I need to be depressed, or could I just Pressed or could I just be somebody who want to explore psychedelics?[0:28:22] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It we've had studies for all of these Okay. And and a number of other disorders. So healthy normal Studies, the the code for not a problem to fix, but we're all here. That's what's amazing about psychedelics though because you if you administer them under this model you develop a relationship and give a high dose of a psychedelic. You could be a healthy normal without a a diagnosable issue, but, man, we're all human and the issues Seem to come to the surface.[0:28:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[0:28:47] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So but we've done work with, smoking cessation, so people trying to quit tobacco and haven't been successful.[0:28:53] Andrew Huberman: Variety of reasons. So Right. Maybe I'll just ask some very simple questions that that would kinda step us through the process. So let's say I were to sign up for one of these trials and and I qualified One of these trials, I'd show up. You said I would do several hours in advance of getting to know the team that would Mhmm.[0:29:08] Andrew Huberman: That would be present during this Psychedelic journey.[0:29:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: 1st, there's screening. So it's kind of like a a couple of days of both psychiatric, like, structured Psychiatric interviews about your whole your your your past and symptoms across the the the DSM, the psychiatric bible to see if you might have Various disorders that that could, disqualify you. Like, the the main ones being the psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, and also including, Bipolar. So the manic side of of bipolar. So so after that's and also cardiovascular screening heart disease.[0:29:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: After that screening, then the preparation where you get you're both you get you develop a therapeutic rapport with the people who are gonna be in the room with you, your guides, but you're also then didactically sort of explained about what the psychedelic could be like. And that's kind of a laundry list because they're more known by their variability Mhmm. Than, you know, it's gonna it's not like cocaine. Like, you're gonna feel stimulated. You're gonna feel like, you know, you can do any it's like you know, or alcohol.[0:30:09] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You're gonna probably gonna feel more relaxed. It's like, I call them uppers, downers, and all arounder, and the psychedelics are all arounder. It's like, yeah, you could be you could have the most Beautiful experience of your life or the most terrifying experience of your life? So it's just kind of laundry list of, like, the things that could happen so there's No surprises. Mhmm.[0:30:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I[0:30:29] Andrew Huberman: think it's so important for people to hear because, the all a rounders, they the You really can't predict how somebody is going to react internally. Right. I wanna just briefly touch on something, Because we we left that topic, but it occurred to me that a lot of these effects of psychedelics and how they function, etcetera, is Still very mysterious, but then I recall to mind that how most prescription antidepressants work is also very mysterious. They increase Serotonin or dopamine or epinephrine, etcetera, but why they take weeks on and, you know, several weeks to kick in, etcetera, is also mysterious. But going back to the the The experience of of coming to your laboratory.[0:31:11] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So let's say that somebody passes all the prerequisites, and the And it's the day Yeah. Comes comes the day that they're going to have, this experience. Are they, eating mushrooms like, You hear about, or are they taking it in capsule form? And how what sorts of doses are you prescribing?[0:31:32] Andrew Huberman: Is there a dose response curve? Yeah. And then secondary to that, I'd like to talk about microdose versus macrodose. So how do they get this stuff into how do People, receive it, and how do they get it into their body?[0:31:46] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So they receive pure psilocybin. So the mushroom and there are Many species, the most pride people have taken mushrooms in the United States. It's it's most likely so Psilocybe cubensis. So they're easy to grow. They grow in cow patties.[0:31:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's easy for anybody to grow them in their closet. It doesn't take a a 1000 watt light like cannabis. It takes, like, a little, You know, 10 watt light bulb and a Tupperware bin. So those are what those are the types of mushrooms that people typically tape. We're not administering those.[0:32:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Psilocybin is the compound. You could draw a molecule, psilocybin, again, based on the tryptamine structure. Like, that's a single molecular entity. So it's a white powder.[0:32:26] Andrew Huberman: Does it look like serotonin molecularly? Yes.[0:32:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yes. Yes.[0:32:29] Andrew Huberman: Which is So if I looked at if I were to show people the chemical structure of serotonin, the Chemical structure of psilocybin, it would look quite similar.[0:32:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Right.[0:32:37] Andrew Huberman: And there's basically taking serotonin.[0:32:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: A modified version of serotonin, which makes sense. But then, again, this repeated theme of the chemistry doesn't always neatly line up because, like, Mescaline looks more, like, like dopamine than it does like serotonin, but yet it At the receptor activation level, the pharmacologic neuro pharmacological effect, it's those are similar. But but yeah. I mean and What it does at the receptor is an alternate it's it's it's hitting the same switch, but then having an alternate response at the receptor. Well[0:33:14] Andrew Huberman: So for people that don't necessarily understand the relationship between what we call ligand, the thing that parks in the receptor, and the receptor is the parking spot, One of the reasons that you can get such a variety of effects from different compounds is, for instance, serotonin might Affect a certain pathway at a particular rate, and, psilocybin might trigger activation of different components of that pathway at different rates since you get vastly different experiences from 2 things that look chemically similar. Right. This is also a good, reason why people shouldn't Just assume that they can cowboy their own chemistry. Right? That what you see on paper and what you can mix up in a vial is often vastly different, than what you predict.[0:33:58] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:33:58] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. And there's a dose effect curve that's really interesting. Some of our early work with psilocybin, in healthy normals, looked at, a true placebo plus 4 active doses, 5, 10, 20, and 30 milligrams of psilocybin. Body weight adjusted. So, you know, those milligrams per 70 kilograms of body weight.[0:34:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: We've recently published a paper in our newer trials. We're We're dropping the body weight adjustment because our going across hundreds of volunteers, we've kinda figured out that that you shouldn't really be you don't need to be adjusting by body weight. Interesting.[0:34:32] Andrew Huberman: So yeah. Well, brain size doesn't vary that much between individuals. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the end, This is a brain effect, mostly.[0:34:42] Andrew Huberman: Probably body as well. Okay. So the person ingests the the powder or capsule. Okay.[0:34:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And and as long as 30 milligrams is a small he could fit it into a tiny little capsule, and and it'll take about a half hour, but anywhere from 15 minutes To an hour to kick in.[0:35:00] Andrew Huberman: And you said your dose range was?[0:35:03] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Most of our studies, are looking at Where we we want a psychedelic effect are in the 20 to 30 milligram range. Again, because we have adjusted by body weight and The average American is over 70 kilograms, about a 150 pounds. Like, people and in fact, have gotten more, like, you know, 40, 45 in a lot of cases. But, it's still a small pill. There the session day itself is not full of For most of our studies, it's not full of task.[0:35:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: We really wanna look at the therapeutic response. Obviously, if it's a therapeutic study, we want it to be a meaningful experience, and, research has found, not surprisingly, that you get a less meaningful experience when you're in an fMRI Right. Or when you're doing a lot of cognitive tasks. We've done some research on on, you know, of of that type for sure and plenty of colleagues have, But when you're in a therapeutic study or if you're trying to understand the therapeutic effects, you you have to recognize there's this this this trade off of of what you can do. So our typical Therapeutic model, which again isn't just limited necessarily to the therapeutic studies where we're trying to treat a specific disorder, It it is is to, you know, have that preparation so you the person feels very comfortable with their guides.[0:36:22] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I mean, all ultimately, what I tell people is, like, Any emotional response, it's all welcome. I mean, you could you could be crying like a baby hysterically. Like, that's what you should be doing if that's what you feel like. And so in a lot of ways, sometimes people with psychedelic experience, on their own, It can be harder to train them in this model because in the real world, people with psychedelic experience, a lot of times the rule is, you know, hold your shit. So You know, several friends go to a party.[0:36:51] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They split a bag of mushrooms. It's like, you know, there's a social pressure for good reason not to be the guy, You know, in the corner of the room where everyone's trying to just have a good time, relax, like crying about your mother, Your other friends are they're having an experience too, and you're being a drama king and blah blah blah. And so, like, yeah, compose yourself. Hold your You're doing[0:37:12] Andrew Huberman: I mean, you're doing therapy For people, this is it's not just about the experience.[0:37:17] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. And the experience itself is very much shaped by by that that container, by the environment, And let's agree to which one allows it to happen. Like, one should let go of control. Yeah. Let's talk about[0:37:30] Andrew Huberman: the the letting go of control, and then As we march through this, hypothetical experience that does take place in your lab, but so we're using a sort of generic case example[0:37:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[0:37:41] Andrew Huberman: If you will. The letting go of control is an interesting feature, actually, because, one of the common themes of of good psychoanalysis is or psychotherapy of any kind is that There's a trust built between the patient and the analyst, and that relationship becomes a template for trust more generally And trust in oneself. It's actually the the end goal of good psychoanalysis is that the patient actually one of the end goals is that they develop an empathy for themselves, which almost sounds Like an oxymoron, but Mhmm.[0:38:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: If you[0:38:12] Andrew Huberman: spend a little time with that statement, it it actually pans out. So The psychedelic experience is one in which, chemically, you're under a new new set of conditions. Right? Yeah. Let's coarsely, Space and time are are altered in some way, sense of self.[0:38:31] Andrew Huberman: For instance, I might be going to a strongly interoceptive mode where I'm focusing on Everything within the confines of my skin, whereas, normally, we're sort of interacting in space and pens and conversation, and I'm sort of if I had occasionally, I'll pay attention to my breathing, but I'm sort of dilating my and contracting my focus for different things all the time. The letting go of control, It seems to me could be sort of the expansion of 1 perceptual bubble to the point where you're not Actually, worried that that perceptual bubble is gonna pop or that meaning, you're not worried about what people think of you. Yeah. You're not worried whether or not your, brain is gonna explode even though a thought could feel enormous.[0:39:12] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[0:39:13] Andrew Huberman: If I keep going like this, it almost sounds psychedelic, but that's the idea here. Or if I'm paying attention, for instance, to some somatic experience, like, the the coursing of waves of heat through my body Mhmm. That I'm not suddenly saying, you know, is that weird? I'm actually just going deeper and deeper into it. So it's essentially expanding a perceptual phenomenon.[0:39:36] Andrew Huberman: How do you convince people to go further and further down that path? What do you think allows them to do that? Because I think that that to me is one of the more unusual, aspects to psychedelics is that normally, the the social pressure, but also just our internal pressure from our own brain is Pay attention to many things at once, not just 1. Is that Especially these days. Yeah.[0:40:00] Andrew Huberman: Multitask. Yeah. Multitask, and The more that we focus on one thing, the more bizarre that thing actually can appear to us. Right? Right.[0:40:08] Andrew Huberman: I mean, even if it's the tip of your finger and you're not taking any psychedelic, you spend a long enough looking at the tip of your finger, you will notice some very weird things. Right?[0:40:16] Dr. Matthew Johnson: That's I think that is the classic psychedelic effect or or One classic effect and and one I've used many times of this example of why people shouldn't necessarily, you know, these aren't These one should be judicious in putting themselves in these circumstances. Someone could be, you know, Having a a very strong psilocybin experience, and they're trying to navigate their way in Manhattan crossing the street, and they might Be staring into the hand and real like, that's their hand is the most amazing miracle. Like, the entire universe has Essentially conspired to come to this one point to make this absolutely breathtaking it's almost like, I think, of the simplest form of of of Well, we know that the simplest form of learning is habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, and there's less response. Like, this is what organisms do.[0:41:07] Dr. Matthew Johnson: This is what we have to do, and it's like there's this this Habituation component that, like habituation. Yes. Like, we wouldn't be able to get through life if we wouldn't be able to cross that street if we were like, Oh, like, this is a miracle. Like I'm so glad[0:41:20] Andrew Huberman: you no. I'm so glad you brought this up. I mean, here, I'm reflecting my bias as a vision scientist, but people don't realize this, but if you look at something long enough, it eventually disappears. To it it doesn't actually disappear, but perceptually, it disappears. You have these little microsaccades that ensure that it doesn't Right.[0:41:36] Andrew Huberman: But most of us don't look at any one thing for very long.[0:41:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[0:41:39] Andrew Huberman: The the brain's default is to Perceptually jump around like crazy with the visual system, with the auditory system. We all ADD, people talk about ADD a lot, It's sort of baked into our underlying networks at some level, and then we we can force attention. But it sounds like in psychedelics, the one of the primary goals therapeutically is to really drill into one of these perceptual bubbles and expand that bubble. And the safety, it seems, Is the safety it's sort of like a permission to to do that without worrying that something's gonna happen.[0:42:14] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Because, you know, I've had people there on the couch. Yeah. I remember 1 lady said this is probably, 13, 14 years ago, said, Matt, Tell me again, I can't die. Like, I feel like my heart is gonna rip through my chest.[0:42:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I mean, she was feeling our and I should say, Typically, cardiovascular response is is modest. The the, pulse and blood pressure go up somewhat. It can be dangerous for people if at severe heart risk, and we do Are[0:42:41] Andrew Huberman: we monitoring this? We do, you know, we do monitor into a variety of devices.[0:42:45] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. So every half hour or so, we we take their on protocol and we, You know, space it out a little further further into the time course, but we take their blood pressure and their pulse. And if it goes over a certain level, we have a protocol, and we've had to do this only a few times. But Physician comes in, gives them a little nitroglycerin under the tongue, and, you know, knocks the blood pressure down a little bit, doesn't affect the experience. So have it all in place even though they'd probably be fine out of an abundance of caution.[0:43:09] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Sure. But but yeah. But someone can feel That my god. I'm gonna die. Like, I I have never felt my heart beat like this before.[0:43:21] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And, like, the experience of the breath can be just, you know, absolutely fantastic. And this sort of and the breath is obviously interesting because it's this Automatic, you know, control, but it could also be voluntary. So people can get into a sense of, like,[0:43:37] Andrew Huberman: my god. What if I[0:43:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It sounds silly, like, it's not for me[0:43:40] Andrew Huberman: to breathe. Exactly. Yeah.[0:43:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: But people could that can be so compelling. And so one of the get back to one of your questions. It's like, what do we do to kind of allow them to go further into these bubbles? It's like, one is is wearing the eye shades. We don't call them, blindfolds because that has a negative connotation like peak in that.[0:44:00] Andrew Huberman: Well, and they're probably seeing a lot in there anyway, so blind isn't the appropriate.[0:44:04] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Right. That's I've never thought of it. This should be, like, inner sight shades.[0:44:09] Andrew Huberman: But when you close the eyes, the the levels of activity in the retina actually are maintained. It's it's just spontaneous activity.[0:44:16] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And it seems and I'd be curious about your thoughts on this. I mean, the but The way I describe it is that the, you know, the mind's eye, being this kind of loose term we use, can be on rocket boosters. So a lot of times, For some people, like a compound like psilocybin, for some people, there's no perceptual effect. Like, if they're looking at this room, it would pre pretty much look the same. Sometimes folks say, yeah, things seem a little bit brighter.[0:44:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Now some people will say, oh my god. There's waves that Wall is waving in these curtains that you know? On these compounds, people don't typically see pink elephants. You do actually get that in another class. I didn't mention the the anticholinergics, sort of like atropine and scopolamine, those drugs.[0:44:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Those are the those are the true hallucinations where you thought you were having a conversation with someone who was never there.[0:45:05] Andrew Huberman: It was that, we will we will definitely get to those, but when the reason I kind of cringe and said, oh my, when you talked about those is that, knowing a little bit about the pharmacology of Acetylcholine, the the idea of manipulating that system to me sounds very uncomfortable. Because, like the whole idea of of, well, witches and flying, there was a whole history there, you know, 100 of years ago, so called witches Taking these agents and then thinking they were flying around on broomsticks and things of that sort, and and there's a lot of mythology around the broomsticks. It's complicated, but But that sounds very unpleasant. One thing I I about the the serotonergic, let's just for with psilocybin, So there's a an expansion of a particular fairly narrow percept. It could be sound, could be an emotion, could be sadness, could be historical event or a fear of the future.[0:46:00] Andrew Huberman: And you've mentioned before that there's something to be learned in that experience. Yeah. There's something about going into that experience in it in an un, in an in an undeterred way that allows somebody to bring something back into more standard reality. Yeah. Given the huge variety of experiences that people have on psychedelics, given the huge variety of humans that are out there, But what are now very clear therapeutic effects in the realm of depression, what do you think is the value of going into this Fairly restricted perceptual bubble, what we are calling letting go or giving up control.[0:46:45] Andrew Huberman: Because if the experiences are many, But the value of what one exports from that experience is kind of similar across individuals. That raises all sorts of interesting questions, and this is not a a philosophy discussion. We're talking about biology and psychology here.[0:47:01] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[0:47:02] Andrew Huberman: So let's say I decide I'm gonna focus on the tip of my pen. I mean, in the psychedelic state, I could fall in love with this Penn, I do happen to like these pilot v fives and v sevens very much, but I could feel real love Yeah. For the Penn. Yeah. Right?[0:47:16] Andrew Huberman: That's not an unreasonable thing to expect on a psych in a psychedelic journey. Right. And then the context of your laboratory model, which I think is a great one, That experience would be just as valid as me going into the experience of some of the deep friction that I might have with a family member over my entire lifespan.[0:47:33] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[0:47:34] Andrew Huberman: And yet the export from that those 2 vastly different experiences is one of feeling A better relationship to the world and to oneself. Right. So what does this tell[0:47:44] Dr. Matthew Johnson: us about? Pen and the processing your childhood trauma both lead to[0:47:49] Andrew Huberman: Right. Yeah. So what does this I mean, at at that level, it raises this question, like, first of all, how, why? I mean or just what are your thoughts on that?[0:48:00] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So this is definitely in the this is in the terrain we're figuring out. You know? So there's no the educated speculation is the best I can provide, but I I think the best the the the the I think the common denominator are Persisting changes in self representation.[0:48:20] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Tell me more about self representation.[0:48:23] Dr. Matthew Johnson: That's, the way one holds the the sense of self. The relate the fundamental relationship of a person in the world. I mentioned earlier that these experience Seems to alter the models we hold of reality, and I think that the self is the biggest model, that I am a thing that's separate from other things, and That's I am defined by certain I have a certain personality, and I I'm a smoker that's having a hard time quitting or I'm a depressed person that, You know, views myself as a failure and all of these things, those are models too. And and I think I think that change in self Representation may be an endpoint for these different experiences. I mean, maybe the falling in love with the pen, the whole idea that you're, Especially in contemplation afterwards, and, obviously, I'm speculating here, but the whole idea that you could have such a a deep connection with this random, obviously, Random aspect of of the universe could potentially lead to this, you know, transformed understanding of the self and, like, The pen may be a proxy for the the miracle of reality in a way that relies nothing on, on no supernatural thinking.[0:49:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You know, you could be a hard atheist and take this you know, ultimately, oh my god. Like, that just like the pen, this is, you know, the This is amazing, the fact that we exist until you there could be an extrapolation chair. And you use the pen, but I think it sounds to Aldous Huxley's classic description in the doors of perception of the chair and the drapes. Like, he took, 500 milligrams of mescaline. When he was just like Is[0:50:00] Andrew Huberman: that a high dose of muscle?[0:50:01] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. And and that's, and, you know, that's a heroic dose for sure. And he just going off on the of the Chair. Like, this chair is exuding the quality of being a chair.[0:50:13] Andrew Huberman: So this is this expansion of the perceptual bubble. A narrow A narrow, percept that then grows within the confines of that narrow percept.[0:50:23] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[0:50:23] Andrew Huberman: The you so sense of self is a very interesting, Jing, phenomenon, and if we could dissect it a little bit, there's the somatic sense of self. So the ability to literally feel the self, into this process we call interoception. And then there's the the the title of the self, the I am blank. Yeah. And I noticed you said that several times, and it's intriguing to me I have a a good friend.[0:50:44] Andrew Huberman: I don't think I I I can or should mention his name, but he had a very long and successful career, Within one of the more elite teams in within the seal teams, and he, he's a fairly philosophical guy, also very practical guy, but he has said many times, to me that the most powerful words in any language Or I am, because whatever follows that tends if you repeat it enough, tends to have this, kind of feedback effect on the on how you are in the world. Mhmm. And it the 1st pass, it it all it sounded to me a little bit like, you know, kind of like Internet psychology type thing, like, oh, the secret or something you say, which frankly, I I'm just not particularly I'm yeah. You know? So if you you kinda like the whole fake it till you make it, like, I I don't you subscribe to any of that.[0:51:33] Andrew Huberman: Uh-huh. But in dissecting that a little bit further with him, I I came to realize that, that these words I am are very powerful. I don't think you reprogram your brain just by saying them, but how one defines themselves Internally, not just to other people, but how we want psychologically and by default in, Defines themselves, I think, is a very powerful, like[0:51:57] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[0:51:58] Andrew Huberman: And depressed people, as well as happy people seem to define themselves in terms of these categories of emotional states. So I think it's it's so interesting that letting go and going into this perceptual bubble, which is facilitated by, Obviously, a really wonderful team of of therapists, but also the serotonergic agent Yeah. Allows us to, potentially reshape The perception of self, that's that's a tremendous feat of neuroplasticity.[0:52:26] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. And I think, certainly, more work needs to be done. And this is the the the the horizon. And I and I should credit, Chris Letheby, a philosopher, in Australia who, has a forthcoming book. It might be out right about now or or soon within the coming months.[0:52:44] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelics and philosophy.[0:52:47] Andrew Huberman: That's the title of the book.[0:52:48] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's is it it might be psychedelic philosophy. It's really close.[0:52:51] Andrew Huberman: Chris Latherby. We'll we'll put a link to it.[0:52:53] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. And and And so his conclusion in this it's a really great book, and he really plays with the idea. It's like psychedelic experiences come along with a lot of supernatural Stuff, experience. It can certainly go along with that, but the idea is, like, can it can these experiences and including those therapeutic effects be explained from a naturalist Point of of view, and and his conclusion is that that changes in self representation may be the commonality. Now that could go along with Plant spirits and the Buddha and chakras and whatever your model, you know, system in Jesus, all of that, But it could also, be completely devoid of any supernatural, any religious, and we do in fact see All, you know, all of these varieties.[0:53:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So I I I think there's something about this change in in sense of self. There is it seems to be something on the identity level both with I think of the the work we did with cancer patients who had substantial depression and anxiety because of their cancer, and also our work with people trying to quit cigarette smoking. I mean, there's this Real there seems to be when it really works, this change in how people view themselves, like, smoking, like Mhmm. Really stepping out of this model, like, I'm a smoker. It's tough to quit smoking cigarettes.[0:54:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I can't do it. I failed a bunch of times. I remember 1 participant during the session, but he held on to this afterwards said, my god. It's like, I can really just decide, Like flicking off a bike. I can decide not to smoke.[0:54:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And it's I call these duh experiences with psychedelics because people often like in the cancer, say, you say, I'm causing most of my own suffering. Like, I can I can follow my appointments? I can do everything, but I can still plan for the I'm not getting outside, You know, in the sunshine, I'm not playing with my grandkids. I'm choosing to do that. And it's like they told themselves that before, and the smoker has told themselves a 1000000 times, I can and it so it sounds when it comes out of their mouths, and folks will say this is part of the ineffability of a psychedelic experience.[0:54:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Folks say, I know this sounds like bullshit and this sounds like but my god. I could just sigh. Like, they're feeling this gravity of agency, and which I think is interesting thing is regardless of the the the the, you know, debates on the reality of free will, I think the philosophy of that, whether there's it's ultimately free Free will, like, pure agency if that exists, which I'm skeptical of, or just the idea that clearly we have a sense of agency. There's something there, whether it's the sense of agency even, that is the human being has, and That seems to be, at times, fundamentally, like, supercharged from a psychedelic experience. This idea, like, I'm just gonna make a decision.[0:55:46] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Like, normally, like, you tell a depressed person, like, don't don't think of yourself that way. You're not a failure. Look at all the it's just yeah. It's like and but you can actually, in one of these states, Have an experience where you realize, like, my god. Just like using MDMA to treat PTSD, and we're gonna be starting work with psilocybin to treat PTSD.[0:56:03] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Someone could really reprocess their trauma in a way that, like, has lasting effects and clearly is Probably something you know, reconsolidation of those memories. They're they are they are altered, you know, very consistent with what the Our understanding of the way memory works. So the whole idea people can actually, in in a few hours, have a such a profound experience that they They decide to make these changes in who they are, and it sticks. Mhmm. There seems to be something like that.[0:56:34] Andrew Huberman: And that's profound. I mean, I I think A few moments ago, I was I made some semi disparaging statements about things like the secret and affirmations, and And the reason I I do that with with a with a nod to the fact that the people in, who are putting those ideas forward are are well intentioned people is that The neural networks of the brain put language last. We we tell stories, you know, and stories are very powerful, but I think one of the, most cruel aspects of the whole self help, literature and Popular psychology is this idea that everything you say, your brain and body hear it. That's actually a very, unkind or even cruel thing for people who are Pressed or anxious to hear, because if they hear that and believe that, and I wanna be clear, I don't think it's true, that They think that it's very hard to control thoughts. It's very hard to control thoughts.[0:57:32] Andrew Huberman: So if somebody, says, you know, I Can't, and then somebody says, well, no, every time you say you can't, your brain hears that and it reinforces it. That's a very treacherous place to live. And language is powerful, but neural networks, the brain, And the networks that underlie emotionality and perception and sense of self, they don't change in response to language. They change in response to experience. Yeah.[0:57:59] Andrew Huberman: And it just fundamentally, you need there's some prerequisites. You need certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin Or dopamine. You need them to be at sufficient levels. You don't need your drug necessarily do it. You could, you know, you give a kid a kitten or a puppy, their first Getting our puppy and the levels of dopamine and serotonin, I've never measured them, but we can be pretty sure that they are higher than baseline.[0:58:21] Andrew Huberman: Uh-huh. And that experience will reshape them.[0:58:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right?[0:58:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Likewise, with an adult in a certain circumstances. So I think I I'm fascinated by this idea that a A somatic and a perceptual experience, but a real experience of the sort that you're describing Yeah. Yeah. Is what allows us to reshape our neural circuitry and to feel differently about ourselves.[0:58:43] Andrew Huberman: And, I know there's been, really tremendous success In many individuals of alleviating depression[0:58:52] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[0:58:52] Andrew Huberman: Of treating trauma with these different compounds, I wanted to step from the The experience under the effects of the psychedelic. So the person there with your team, they go into this expanded perceptual bubble. If if things go well, They're able to do that to a really deep degree. Maybe it's the the relive trauma. Maybe it's the beauty of the their ability to connect to things in the world.[0:59:16] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And I wanna talk about the transition out of that state and then the export into life, because this is really where the power of psychedelic seems to be in the therapeutic sense.[0:59:26] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[0:59:26] Andrew Huberman: It's the ability to learn truly learn from that experience so that the learning becomes the default. That one doesn't have to remind themselves, oh, I am You know, they have to do an affirmation. I am a happy person. I am a you know, I was thinking of Bart Simpson, like, writing on the chalkboard. Right?[0:59:40] Andrew Huberman: Didn't work for him. Doesn't work for this other stuff too. But So as they transition out of this state, I know that there's a kind of a heightened there's a a so called peak, where everything seems to be kinda cascading in at such a level that, the person just they can't really turn it off at that point. It would be challenging. And then They start to exit the effects of the drug.[1:00:05] Andrew Huberman: Are those transition zones? Are those valuable? Much like Is the transition between a dream and the waking state valuable? Because you're in a sort of mishmash of altered reality and new reality.[1:00:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[1:00:18] Andrew Huberman: What do you what do you do to guide people through the, out out the tunnel as they exit the tunnel?[1:00:25] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And I have to say, like, this is where we need More experimentation. Really, the clinical model goes back to literally the 9 late 19 fifties, And there's been virtually no experimentation on, let's say, you know, randomized people to we're gonna talk more during the latter half of the of the session versus not, versus we have them, you know, write an essay after their session versus not, versus we have this amount of integration.[1:00:52] Andrew Huberman: What's the follow-up in your studies? Are they are they writing or talking as they're doing it?[1:00:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And it's called, you know, very loosey goosey, you know, term integration, but For us means, as they're coming back from the experience, so sort of 5, 6 hours in. You know? So this is the afternoon. They've been dosed around 9 o'clock, so this is, like, 4 o'clock or so. Just some initial tell us about the experience.[1:01:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Do you wanna not unpacking it totally, but kind of initially just have a little bit discussion before they go home, so there's a little bit of that. But then that night, their homework is to write Something. So it could be, you know, a few bullet points. It could be, you know, 20 pages, and we we get everything, you know, in that range. But, You know, try not to be self critical.[1:01:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's not graded. Like, this is just to process and for a point of discussion the next day. So they write something that come in the next day For a a 1 to 2 hour, depending on the study, integration session. Basically, just let's discuss your experience and Depending on what study it's in, like, what, you know, what might that mean for you're dealing with cancer. What might that mean for your your smoking, you know, or becoming a non Smoker.[1:02:02] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So you encourage them to simply take it seriously, and I think this is, again, a sort of one of the points that could be the antithesis of what some Just some social users, use. I mean, this was written about by, Houston, Smith, the scholar of religion in terms of These mystical experiences that can happen from psychedelics and how a lot of times, the attribution to a drug effect is dismissed. Like, the net even the if one has this, You know, this sense of being one with the universe and it totally, like, shakes their soul, so to speak. You know, but the next day, their friends are like, dude. You were screwed up.[1:02:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Too much acid for you. Whoo. You know? Like, man, next time you needed to have a few more beers to, like, bring that down you know, like, This sort of, like, you know, social, you know, reinforcement for dismissing the experience. Oh, you're talking out of your head, man.[1:02:55] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Like, you know, even if it's, you know, good natured, but it's this dismissal. It's not like You know, what you wanna do, you know, is, like, tell me more about that. You know, you were crying at one point, like, in talking about your mom. Let's talk about that. What was that like?[1:03:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Do you remember that?[1:03:11] Andrew Huberman: Like So you are you doing that follow-up, or are you they're encouraged to do that in their own life with the various people in their life?[1:03:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Both. So we do that explicitly in in the follow-up where we have these discussions. And I depending on what the situation is, you you might Encourage the person to kinda follow-up. It's it's really the the basics of it is is supportive, therapy. It's nonstructured.[1:03:37] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's you know, use all the, you know, reflective listening and the sort of the humanistic psychology that, you know, unconditional positive regard for person. But but, you know, I I think if, you know, if someone feels inclined to, you know, apologize to their To their, you know, to to their sibling about something, it's like, yeah. Go ahead and call them up. When it when it's something big like a relationship change, it'd be like, Sit on that 2 weeks. Don't make any big.[1:04:05] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Don't end any relationship. Don't quit your job. Don't make any big Did[1:04:08] Andrew Huberman: you also tell them not to start any relationships?[1:04:13] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I don't remember that ever coming up.[1:04:15] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. But if if if I'm not Joey. I was just wondering, you know, it's yeah, makes sense why you want[1:04:20] Dr. Matthew Johnson: they're dating and they're thinking, like, might be time to take it to the next level. Should I ask this girl to marry me? If it did come up, I would say there too. Why don't you sit on that a week or two?[1:04:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Don't get a puppy.[1:04:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Your sober mind.[1:04:32] Andrew Huberman: Don't don't get a puppy. Certainly, don't get 4 puppies until you're I have a question about, flashbacks. Uh-huh. You know, one of one of the kind of things you hear is, you know, flashbacks, And that Yeah. That people do people get flashbacks?[1:04:47] Andrew Huberman: And if so, what is the basis of flashbacks? The, the on the street lore about this is that somehow some of the compound gets stored in body fat tissues and then released later like a Is that complete nonsense?[1:05:03] Dr. Matthew Johnson: No evidence for that. So probably complete nonsense.[1:05:06] Andrew Huberman: Flashbacks are nonsense or the storage in body fat is complete nonsense?[1:05:09] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The storage in body fat. So to answer whether flashbacks are complete nonsense, we have to define it. So I really think these are multiple constructs that are going. It's not the same thing that fall under That term. There is a phenomenon that that appears real that's called hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder.[1:05:28] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's in the DSM. A certain number of people very small number of people, you know, percentage wise who have used psychedelics We'll have these persisting perceptual disorders, like they'll see halos around things. They'll see some trails, like, you know, like the After images following an object in motion, they'll see distortions in color, and it'll be like anything else that's a Disorder in the DSM, it has to be clinically distressing, and it has to be persisting over some, number of of months. And And so very rare, very mysterious. Some of the keys to that are, amazingly, it's never been seen in the thousands of participants either from the older era, from the late fifties to the early seventies.[1:06:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The people in psychedelic with LSD, psilocybin, and it's never been seen in the modern era. Again, now with thousands of participants at a number of centers like ours, throughout the world. So it seems to be something that is, for some reason, happening in illicit use. So that that brings in okay. Is there polypharmacology?[1:06:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. You know? Like, because you're drinking during any day.[1:06:40] Andrew Huberman: What you thought you did?[1:06:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. What's the dose is what's the purity? But then also what I think is actually even more so than that, what's likely going on is some sort of very rare neurological susceptibility. There is one paper That, is a case series of individuals reporting these symptoms, and they didn't limit it to the to just people who had had, Hallucinogen history. And the amazing thing about this is that, a number of people Seem to have straight up HPPD diagnosis.[1:07:10] Andrew Huberman: What is HPPD?[1:07:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder who have never taken a psychedelic. So it's often prompted by, alcohol, Benzodiazepines, cannabis, even tobacco. And and I believe in 1 individual, no lifetime history of any it wasn't preceded by any of those, you know, substance, use is so I think it's I think of it like the precipitation exacerbation of psychotic disorders. We it seems pretty clear through observation that some people with with either predisposition or active psychotic disease that this can destabilize them. A cycle like the same way that a life experience can destabilize this person more easily.[1:07:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I think of it like that there's probably some Pretty rare neurological susceptibility. We have tended going this goes back to the eighties, you know, clinical practice. It ended up in the DSM focus on hallucinogen because I I relate it to the the psychology of xenophobia. It's always the weird Other thing that gets the attribution, you don't attribute to the thing, like, oh, yeah. Did you smoke cigarettes?[1:08:20] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Did you drink? It's like, well, Yeah. But I see lots of people drinking and not ending up with this. Like, you take a a crazy, like, drug and you can get pea People to believe all sorts of crazy stuff. The biggest example of that is the the the cathinone derivatives, so called bath salts.[1:08:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And if you remember several years back,[1:08:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, we'll[1:08:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: see you with that. Florida that that ate the other guy's face. There's a homeless guy that, like, literally ate part of someone's face off. Like, yeah.[1:08:47] Andrew Huberman: While the person was alive.[1:08:48] Dr. Matthew Johnson: While the person was alive and all it took was 1 sheriff's deputy to say, well, I don't know, but I bet it was Some of that bath salt stuff that's been going on. The only thing[1:08:59] Andrew Huberman: What what was it? Was it I[1:09:00] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The only thing in his system[1:09:01] Andrew Huberman: we could set the record straight for people. What what was this? Why would he say bath salts, and was it bath salts?[1:09:08] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It wasn't. And and so the only thing in his talks was cannabis, which we all know, Typically, people don't eat people's faces off after they get stuck.[1:09:17] Andrew Huberman: Gets you hungrier, but not that[1:09:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: hungry. Right. Yeah. Right. So it's just an example of the xenophobia.[1:09:22] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Like, Today, if you get on Google images and look up, you know, bath salts, one of the most common, you know, images you'll see is this poor guy's face being kneaded and all. So We're just so ready to latch on just like the people of another culture that we don't know of. It's it's it's very easy to assign Attribution to a class that you're very unfamiliar with. So I think they the psychedelics got that attribution with this very rare neurological Susceptibility, the way that alcohol didn't. So I think it's not specific to psychedelics, but we don't really know.[1:09:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: We need but We we'd look at it, and our research have never seen an example of it. But flashbacks can mean a number of other things. I think the most common thing people experience is What we call state dependent learning. It's it's it's it's returning yourself to a similar context can bring back the same thoughts and emotions As the experience so, you know, someone used mushrooms a week ago, now they do something like they smoke some cannabis or they, Or they're they take a warm bath, or they're simply, like, relaxed, and it seems to come out of the blue, and all of a sudden these Or or they follow a a thought trail that takes them that reminds them of their in and they find themselves in that same experience again. I think that's more state dependent learning.[1:10:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's not the distressing component that is in, and it's typically not perceptual. And then another class are just sort of, perceptual anomalies within a day or two following the experience, which is not HPPD. Most people have, you know, joked that this is a free trip. Like, you might see a few trails or halos the day afterwards. It doesn't last Longer than that, and it's doesn't screw you up.[1:11:09] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's kind of fun, like, oh, yeah. I'm still seeing some trip most people will say. So it could mean any of those things. Got it. Flashback is[1:11:16] Andrew Huberman: yeah. Interesting. No. I appreciate you you clarifying that. I mean, One very common misconception about neuroplasticity is that it's an event, and it's not an event.[1:11:27] Andrew Huberman: It's a process. And we have No understanding of the duration of that process. However, the experience of any drug or any life experience, Right? Even if, trauma or a wonderful experience or a psychedelic experience, it doesn't matter. Sets in motion a series of dominoes that fall, And it's the falling of those dominoes that we call neuroplasticity.[1:11:50] Andrew Huberman: I mean, the the reshaping of neural circuits could take years. We don't know. It's the The trigger and then there's the actual change. And so I think that some of what you described could be literally the reordering of circuitry that in some individuals might Spend longer than others. And there is one phenomenon that, I've been told, people experience, and I'm wondering whether or not any of you the patients you've worked with or, people in your trials have ever reported this.[1:12:21] Andrew Huberman: I've never done Ayahuasca, which I'm assuming has some overlap with the serotonin system. Probably hits a Right. So it's the DMT system. Right. It's orally.[1:12:30] Andrew Huberman: I That's right.[1:12:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: MAO inhibitors that allow the DMT to be orally.[1:12:34] Andrew Huberman: Right. I should've I should've, recalled that. Absolutely. Well, I've never done it, but a number of people I know that have done Ayahuasca, as well as people I know who've done MDMA, A report, an increased sense of what, sometimes called ASMR or these autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, which is And it's interesting. A lot of people, have these naturally, and they hide these.[1:12:57] Andrew Huberman: These are it's actually, something that many people keep hidden to themselves. I'll just ask you if you can do it. So, some people are able to pass a like, a shiver down their spine or up their spine consciously. You know, like, you can kind of, Like, I'm able to actually pass a shiver up my spine. I actually learned how to do this when I was a kid on a hot day.[1:13:16] Andrew Huberman: I was standing on a field in sports camp, and I was like, it's really hot here, and I could actually create, like, a cooling, percept cooled perception. Some people I told someone this once, and then it this led to a discussion of, oh, I can do it, but I always hid that from people because it's actually, somewhat pleasurable. And this is a well known phenomenon, ASMR. And some people I know who have taken MDMA therapeutically or Ayahuasca, will report that they, feel great relief from this, they can generate these autonomic reflexes through their body more readily. Probably, I'm guessing because they were able to tune in to a kind of deeper sense of somatic self.[1:13:55] Andrew Huberman: Now on the Internet, ASMR, if you look it up, It's a little bit like the basalt thing, but in the other direction, like, there were people that pay, let me let's just say there are accounts on YouTube that have Many, many millions of viewers of, people that will whisper to them about like, for instance, there's a a people that will go listen to, it seems to be women in particular whispering about, like, car mechanics or something or about or scratching. So there Certain sounds will do this, whispering, tapping, finger tapping, and people experience immense pleasure from it. It's not really sexual pleasure, but it's this kind of deep Core of[1:14:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: the body.[1:14:32] Andrew Huberman: The it's the autonomic nervous system down the Probably[1:14:35] Dr. Matthew Johnson: what a certain number of people would call Kundalini, which is another one Scientifically, who Yeah.[1:14:40] Andrew Huberman: That's right. And people who do long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many of them will report later feeling as if they Their perception of self is outside of their head. That they're right that they're literally walk it's very uncomfortable for them. That they feel like they're walking around with their sense of self Extended beyond the body. And this is a neural this is a clinically described neurologic phenomenon.[1:15:02] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Have any studies been done? I would imagine that person might actually, like Would they duck? Oh, what Is there like, that would be an interesting experience in my lab.[1:15:10] Andrew Huberman: Would wanna dig into. That's right.[1:15:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Their body could clear, but their[1:15:13] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:15:13] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Projection Yeah. Wouldn't.[1:15:15] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The sense of self I mean, there's a there's a well known phenomenon. It's it's very, in a few individuals, very sad where people actually Avidly seek out imputation of their limbs because their limbs they feel don't belong to their body.[1:15:27] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Oh, yeah.[1:15:28] Andrew Huberman: This is very sad and, Fortunately, very rare, but also very sad condition. Anyway, I think that the the the core of this conversation that we're we're drilling into is This notion of of of reordering the self, and it's and it's a relief to me to know that flashbacks are not something that is kind of, Forgive the term. Baked in to the, to the psychedelic experience. And I suppose that's a good segue to ask about other sorts of drugs. I Having said baked in, the temptation is to go to, marijuana or cannabis.[1:16:00] Andrew Huberman: But but if we if we could, I'd like to just ask about some of the more Dopaminergic compounds.[1:16:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Uh-huh.[1:16:06] Andrew Huberman: In particular, MDMA. Yeah. My understanding is that MDMA is a purely Synthetic compound that you're not gonna find MDMA in nature.[1:16:17] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So far. So far? DMT was first synthesized in the lab, and then we Thought it didn't exist in nature, and then, like, Richard Schulte's found it, like, everywhere in South America. So who knows a plan out there might be making MDMA, but As far as we know now, no.[1:16:32] Andrew Huberman: Right. And we'll talk about DMT and its sources within the body. But MDMA, Could exist in elsewhere, but has been synthesized. And my understanding is that MDMA leads to very robust Increases in both dopamine and serotonin simultaneously, which from an from a neural network's perspective is a very unusual situation. Mhmm.[1:16:57] Andrew Huberman: Right? Normally, because dopamine puts us in this exteroceptives looking outside ourselves, seeking things in the world beyond the skin, Our own skin and dopamine excuse me, serotonin tends to focus us inward. Those are almost mutually exclusive kind of neurochemical states, but they're always at different levels. So why would it be that having this, increased dopamine and increased serotonin would provide an experience that is beneficial. And how do you to the extent that you can how do you think that experience differs from the sorts of experiences that people have on psilocybin or more serotonergic agents?[1:17:36] Andrew Huberman: Just broadly speaking.[1:17:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. In terms of that that bal in terms of the the the effects generally on serotonin and dopamine, I can only, you know, speculate, you know, like, sort of is that dopaminergic component Necessary for let's say, we know that the amygdala is less reactive during you know, under acute effects, and that may play a role in, there's less sort of, control from the from the amygdala in terms of, like, One's experience of memory. So it may be part of this sort of reprocessing, this reconsolidation of these memories in a different way where the amygdala is not, like, Going crazy saying freak out, like, you know, fight or flight.[1:18:20] Andrew Huberman: Well, no. I should have said, it seems like MDMA is being used clinically anyway mainly for trauma, Not just for depression.[1:18:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Sorry. Although part of that we really don't know. It may be that MDMA is great for and some of these other and it may be that and I'm gonna be looking at this soon that psilocybin is great for treating PTSD. A lot of underground therapists, say that underground psychedelic therapist. So we don't really know yet.[1:18:47] Andrew Huberman: By underground. Oh, because they're doing it. Illegal,[1:18:50] Dr. Matthew Johnson: you know, but more like, You know, a professional therapist would. It's just illegal, and this is a kind of a growing, thing. So we don't really know which it It speculating, but it may be that MDMA for a broader number of people It's better for for trauma because the chances of having an extremely challenging experience, what I call the bad trip, Like, really freaking out is much lower with MDMA. People can have bad trips, but they're of a different nature. It's not it's not sort of, like, Freaking out because all of reality is sort of shattering, and it's less of this it can take so many forms with the classic psychedelics, but, like, Typically, you'll you'll hear something like, I didn't know it was gonna be like this.[1:19:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: No matter how hard you tried to prepare them that, like, this is, like, get me off this You're talking about LSD or psilocybin? Psilocybin, eye wash. Yeah. Yeah. And and just the sense of, like, I'm going insane.[1:19:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: This is so far beyond anything I've ever experienced, and it's scaring the shit out of me. How I I I don't have a toehold on anything Yeah. Even that I exist as a as as as an entity, and that can be really I think, frankly, experientially, that's kind of the gateway to both The transcendental mystical experiences, the the the sense of unity with all things, which we know our data suggest is Related, to long term positive outcomes[1:20:27] Andrew Huberman: Wait. I wanna make sure I understand. So you're saying the bad trip can be related to the transcendental experience?[1:20:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. I think those are both Speculating, but you you have to pass through this sort of, like, you know, reality shattering, including your sense of self, And one can handle that in 1 of 2 ways. You can either completely surrender to it or you can try to hang on. And if you try to hang on, it's gonna be more like a a Bad trip. So, again, I wish there was more, and hopefully, there will be more experimentation.[1:20:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: There's a lot going on here in the black box in terms of the operant Behavior of how you are, you know, within yourself choosing to handle, like, letting go. We're not there yet, but I think it's a good through clinical observation, seems pretty clear that something like that is going on. And certain drugs like DMT, smoke DMT can be so strong. The reason I I think that can be so extraordinary you can compare to the others because it, like, forces people. Like, there is no choice to hang out with it.[1:21:35] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I was[1:21:35] Andrew Huberman: told that DMT is like a high speed locomotive into the psychedelic experience and out of the psychedelic Brands.[1:21:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[1:21:43] Andrew Huberman: And there's no ability to hold on to the self while you're in the the kind of peak phase. Is that correct?[1:21:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: A lot of people say that, but Some Terrence McKenna, who is kind of the classic bard on DMT effects, he would say the sense of self was intact, But everything else, the sensorium and what you navigated, what you oriented towards, everything else changed, basically. But it's hard to when everything's changing, it's hard to say, like, what is the self that's changing, what is the rest of the world.[1:22:12] Andrew Huberman: Well and language is is totally deficient to describe experience anyway, Much less on a psychedelic. What is McKenna's background? Like, what is his qualification for being this, as you referred, this bard of DMT and stuff.[1:22:27] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And and we're talking about Terrence, and there's also the brother, Dennis, whom I know who's who's[1:22:33] Andrew Huberman: Can only imagine what this[1:22:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: is like if you're now. Passed away, years couple decades ago now, but, he's sort of the one who's known as being a bard, and you can Find hundreds, if not thousands of hours of him on the lecture circuit in the eighties nineties on YouTube. But his background was really oh, gosh. I I don't recall what his college degree was in, but he basically, when he was, like, 19, he traveled to South America And, and actually, on the initial trip with his his brother who was even, younger than him with some other friends and just, in search for a DMT snuff that they had read about from in the Harvard archives from the work of Schulties, from a generation before, but they had, discovered all of these mushrooms growing That down there, the psilocybin mushrooms, what they recognize and just took a lot of mushrooms and and, And talked about it. Talked about it.[1:23:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And Terrence was basically a very intelligent, very well read, in in literature and culture person that could he was sort of the The next generation's, Tim Leary, someone who could really speak, get a little closer to the magnitude of what the psychedelic experience was like for people. And he serves, like Leary, somewhat of a of an advocate. I mean, he would tell tell people, Folks, you could see, you know, the equivalent of a UFO landing on on the White House lawn. Like, it's right there. It'll take 5 minutes.[1:24:04] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It'll Shake everything in your reality. You know? He would sort of goad people into doing it.[1:24:08] Andrew Huberman: Well, certainly, science and clinical medicine is are are just but 2 lenses with which to These things in life, but what part of the reason I ask is I feel like, you know, in the world of health and fitness, you have this very extreme condition of, like, Arnold Schwarzenegger's and bodybuilders who have, like, 2% body fat, and they look like, To most people, they look kind of freakish[1:24:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[1:24:36] Andrew Huberman: Especially now.[1:24:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right? Oh, especially now. Especially now. Yeah. And yeah.[1:24:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Made Arnold look Yeah. Like Yeah. Regular Exactly. Back in his day.[1:24:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. And you have contortionists who can put themselves into a small box and wrap themselves into a pretzel. But From those 2 very extreme subculture practices, that I don't know anything about contortionism really, but except that they get really bendy. The but it's a community that included a lifestyle practices and nutritional practices and then drug practices.[1:25:06] Andrew Huberman: From those very extreme subcultures, there's been an export, which is that, you know, weight training is healthy. Right? The general public has done that or that yoga is healthy. So contortionism to yoga, etcetera. Mhmm.[1:25:20] Andrew Huberman: And I feel like a similar thing is happening in the realm of psychedelics, where it was Leary and Huxley. I mean, I I like, I'm from the Bay Area. I'm not Far from the Menlo Park VA where 1 flew over the cuckoo's is basically Oh, yeah. Bason. Right?[1:25:35] Andrew Huberman: Ken Kesey and those guys. And the, you know, the There has been an attempt at creating this movement toward, openness about psychedelics and their positive effects. This has happened before. The difference is that now there are people like you inside the walls of the university or publishing peer reviewed studies and things of that sort. The reason I asked about McKenna was, You know, it seems like McKenna and his brother, are but, you know, just 2 of many people, Michael Paul and etcetera, who have no real formal training in biology or psychology.[1:26:12] Andrew Huberman: The other guys who were at universities Lost their jobs. They were actually removed from places like Harvard and other universities for their kind of cavalier explorations. Right? Mhmm. And now things are kind of returning.[1:26:25] Andrew Huberman: So in the same way that bodybuilding led to weight training in every corner gym Yeah. Men, women, and children, and contortionism is one extreme, but people generally think that yoga is a pretty healthy practice. Right? There these are Matter of degrees. Right?[1:26:40] Andrew Huberman: And now here you are inside the the the, the walls of a very Highly respected university, Johns Hopkins. You're on the medical school side in the undergrad. So I'm in the med school, which Mhmm. Is, you know, a Serious health institution. You know, the question is to me, You know, what are the what are the valuable exports?[1:27:06] Andrew Huberman: Right? And where does the extreme lie? I mean, clearly, there's a there's a problem with tinkering with reality through pharmacology. And there's a benefit, it sounds like to tinkering with reality through pharmacology. And what's so striking to me is this is the elements of Atypical experience, atypical representation of the self.[1:27:32] Andrew Huberman: So for the For the average person, right, or for kids that are hearing this, kids that are in their teens. Right?[1:27:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[1:27:41] Andrew Huberman: What are the, I wanna talk about what are the the dangers of psychedelics.[1:27:44] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[1:27:44] Andrew Huberman: This is something you don't hear a lot about these days, and it's not because I'm anti psychedelic at all, but what are the dangers? Right? If a if a if a kid or adult has a predisposition toward, let's say, Psychotic thinking, right, or, auditory hallucinations or Yeah. Whereas on the, Asperger's side of the autism spectrum. Is there an increased risk of of bringing the mind into these states?[1:28:11] Andrew Huberman: Because it sounds like a very lay bile situation. So could we talk a little bit about that? And are there classes of these different drugs, whether or not it be MDMA, LSD, or DMT that are, that you think are particularly sharp blades and therefore need to be wielded particularly carefully.[1:28:28] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. So these can be profoundly Destabilizing experiences and ones that, you know, ideally, are are had in a safe container, you know, sort of where where someone you know, What are the relevant dangers, and what can we do to mitigate those? So there's 2 biggies. 1, and I've already mentioned, it's people with very severe psychiatric illness. Not not depression, not anxiety.[1:29:02] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I'm talking about Psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or, you know, mania as part of bipolar disorder. So And and, diagnostically, this has shifted. So it's a little hard to say how many people today with bipolar would have been labeled as schizophrenia back in the sixties when some of this, early research or just clinical observation was done. So it seems very clear that folks with a predisposition or active disease, they could be stabilized. And so some of the cases that we know of, I always think of Sid Barrett, the 1st singer of Pink Floyd, Seems pretty clear, although I think the family what happened there.[1:29:40] Andrew Huberman: So No. I I should be sorry, Pink Floyd fans. I've I've never those songs are just really long.[1:29:45] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. You're more of a punk guy. Right? Yeah. I've so I'm I I've got my foot in a lot of worlds, definitely in part in in the Floyd world, but, But he basically went crazy early on.[1:29:57] Dr. Matthew Johnson: He he dev it seemed I don't think his family ever admitted it, but he developed schizophrenia. Classic pattern. And and and he was doing a lot of LSD. But, you know, like a lot of these cases, it looked like he was showing all of the signs of, you know, some some some hints of of of, that he had that susceptibility before. And often this is hard to disentangle what causes what because when do people Typically, not always, but develop when's the modal period for 1st break?[1:30:32] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah. And when do people start playing with drugs? Same exact Time period. So it can be hard to to disentangle, but it seems pretty clear.[1:30:43] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Now I should also say, there are cases of folks with schizophrenia that say psychedelics have helped them. There's anecdotes for everything, though. Do the[1:30:50] Andrew Huberman: people around the schizophrenics say it's helped them? I don't know. Because when schizophrenics say things you have to. I mean, with all with all due compassion and respect for schizophrenia, it's a disorder of thinking. So if they're saying it helped them.[1:31:03] Dr. Matthew Johnson: How yeah. Can you trust them? Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some kernel of truth in some cases, but they're just so It it seems very clear that the other side is there too and that that there ever is a therapeutic potential there for those disorders that That shouldn't be the first thing on our list. We need to learn a lot more because of the level of risk before we start, you know, doing research to see if, You know, psilocybin can can help with schizophrenia.[1:31:29] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Like, I don't think that that may never be the case, but even if it is, you'd have to be even more cautious and Figure some more things out first with some of these other disorders. Is it some[1:31:40] Andrew Huberman: Bipolar disorder? Can it be exacerbated by these,[1:31:44] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. And and it's it it may be that that that sort of the manifestation of people having prolonged psychiatric issues after A a a a a psychedelic experience as as atypical as that is, when that happens, it it it may be that's that might be more like a manic Episode than a psychotic episode, and that can be a blurry line. And it's it's the folklore is that, you know, people go on a trip and they never come back. That's clearly not the case because, you know, the drug is metabolized, like, for anyone else, and the next day, there's not you know, there's virtually nothing in[1:32:20] Andrew Huberman: the system. Circuitry. I mean.[1:32:21] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. And there's still and I I really do think, you know, much like the positive, ex you know, long term effects that, you know, this class of problems is related to, like, the the, to the experience and and the destabilization that can happen from that From that experience, if it's not in that in the right container. And, again, like, these people are susceptible to you know, some people with that psychotic predisposition. They lucky to be born to a a great family, stable environment. They maybe never have a full break or or the one that they have is not nearly as bad as what, you know, someone that that who's who's homeless and is coming from all kinds of early childhood trauma.[1:33:05] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Like, The disease is probably gonna be far worse. You know? So, you know, the the psych having a psychedelic experience is is like one of those destabilizing experiences. You know, so exclude now fortunately, it's really easy to identify those people, and we even, you know, like, air on the side of extreme caution by eliminating people with, like, say, a first relative. In some states, even a 2nd degree relative.[1:33:28] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Given the heritability, there's some increased chance if your brother or your yeah. So so in an abundance of caution, even eliminating the I think eventually if it's approved for use, FDA use that We could dial back on that as we learn more. I think it's, again, over overly cautious, which is But you're doing early stage clinical trials. Appropriate place to start at this point in time. But, you know, if you, you know, give a skid or or another structured psychiatric interview with a clinician sitting down with this person for a few hours to delve into their 3.[1:34:02] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And and, like, you can very reliably determine if this person has either, you know, a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder or a strong predisposition. So that's you know, that you can screen for that, and that's how you address that. The far more likely danger is the bad trip. Anyone can have this. The most psychologically healthy person in the world probably.[1:34:23] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You jack the dose high enough, and especially in in In in a less than an ideal environment, you can have a bad trip. You you even get it in an ideal environment like ours at at a high dose of around 30 milligrams Psilocybin, after, you know, the best preparation we can provide, about a third of people will say, essentially, at some point, they have a bad trip.[1:34:44] Andrew Huberman: You know, we At some point within the the entire journey.[1:34:47] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Now they could have one of the most beautiful experiences of their life sometimes, like, A couple minutes later Right. But at some point, they had a sense of strong anxiety, fear, losing their mind, feeling trapped, something like That now typically when people have that in the you know, when they're just taking on their own, like a lot of things, they're fine. They get through it. You know?[1:35:09] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They're more likely to be Better off if they're not having to navigate the streets of Manhattan that you know? Or and if they're with, you know, other peep with friends, Better that those friends aren't also dealing with their own psychedelic experience, but probably having some friend of any type. But whether they're on there is better than having nothing. So Very dependent on context. And so the tough thing here that that in in in conveying to the public is that A lot of folks will say, man, I've taken psychedelics hundreds of times, and this is, like, your fear mongering, And, you know, there's no you know, you're exaggerating the danger there.[1:35:48] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So I wanna say it is atypical, But sometimes and I have a file folder that grows larger every year of these cases, Either in the medical literature or from the news of people that freak out on a psychedelic, and they they get hurt or they die. They run into traffic. They they they fall from a height, whether they thought they could fly or whether they just fell like they you can do when you're drunk or in you're intoxicated on any substance. Sometimes that's that's unclear, or gosh. One of the craziest cases was a, a kid, like, an 18 year old or so, in Oregon, several years back, that just he even wrote about, I wanna take the biggest he had done mushroom before.[1:36:30] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I wanna take a a Heroic dose, the biggest dose I've ever taken. He ended up just totally out of it, ended up in a neighbor's house. He was just totally disoriented, disconnected from reality, and the cops ended up killing him. And it was just tragic. Obviously, an overuse of force in that case because he was actually naked at the time.[1:36:46] Dr. Matthew Johnson: This naked, like, 120 pound, I think, as a recall kid that Ended up dying.[1:36:51] Andrew Huberman: But Well, it's analogous to the, you know, the reason I use the examples of, like, bodybuilding culture. I mean, people there have taken excesses of amounts of anabolics and diuretics and died. Then the contortionist culture, people would put themselves in a little plexiglass boxes to do you know, at the extremes, You you're gonna get deaths. And at the extremes, and as and one of the extremes is the sheer number of people with different biological makeups Taking the same drug, and so you can create extremes through numbers, you can take extreme you create extremes through dosage. Right?[1:37:24] Andrew Huberman: It seems. Well, this is why I'm such a fan of of the fact that people like yourself are doing clinical trials inside, the walls of universities, not because, I think that psychedelics, only have utility in those environments, but because it's so important toward creating their transition To legality and to understand what legality means for a compound like this.[1:37:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right? Right. What model Right.[1:37:51] Andrew Huberman: I mean, again, I'll we'll stay with the anabolic Steroids, there's now testosterone and estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy is a common medically approved practice, but that's vastly different than people Taking their own stuff or die or deciding how much they need to take. Right? Like we said, there's there's yoga, and then there's contortionism in a plexiglass Blocks and, you know, thinking of Houdini or something. So there these are a matter of degrees.[1:38:16] Andrew Huberman: Speaking of dosage, I definitely wanna ask you about Microdose versus standard or macrodose. Tell me tell me that I'm wrong, but I'm always a little bit, I sort of a little, I'm microcynical, if you will, about this term microdose. And the reason is that many people that I know who talk about microdosing Are taking dosages of compounds that work at might that are very powerful at microgram levels. So the word micro, I think, can be a little bit confusing to people because microdose implies less than something. It's a mini dose.[1:38:59] Andrew Huberman: Right? And yet some of these compounds were are tremendously powerful at microgram concentrations. So What it constitutes a microdose, and what is the value of so called microdosing, if any? And How does it differ from standard or what I can normally assume is called macrodosing?[1:39:20] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And so LSD would be the the the prototypical example of that[1:39:24] Andrew Huberman: super Potent. How much might what what size dosage of of LSD will lead to hallucinations and kind of standards?[1:39:32] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So, sir, the entry point for Psychedelic type effects, which may not involve hallucination. Actually, most classic psychedelics don't lead to true hallucinations as defined in psychiatry of, Again, see thinking you're talking to the person that's out there, seeing the pink elephant No.[1:39:48] Andrew Huberman: It's more like tracers and things like that. And and Perceptual one day.[1:39:52] Dr. Matthew Johnson: People never get that even at a very high dose. So I think more broadly in terms of the psychedelic effects, Which isn't just perceptual. Unless we get into the level of, as you were alluding to earlier, a broader definition of perception like One's models of the world, the model of the self, you can you can consider all of that perception in terms of, you know, truly not Sensation, but the perception, the construction of of putting together reality. So, yeah. Yeah.[1:40:21] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And so the psychedelic effects are are are typically considered to start for LSD around a 100 micrograms. So a a a tenth of a milligram is a 100 micrograms. Right.[1:40:31] Andrew Huberman: And so someone taking a 100 micrograms of LSD, they on this nowadays, people might mistakenly refer to that as a microdose because it's micrograms, but that's actually a macrodose of LSD.[1:40:43] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. They might and that's one of the most common mistakes or Situations that people get into with microdosing is they intended to be a microdose, but it ends up being a full blown, you know, dose. Now people do when they're working with LSD and they're microdosing, they'll shoot for something like, say, 10, milligrams. You know, something in that range, Ten, 20 milligrams of LSD. So, you know, a 10th, a 5th, something of kind of your entry level psychedelic dose.[1:41:12] Dr. Matthew Johnson: People's ability on the street to do this you know, I say the street as if they're on the corner. But, anyway, like, outside of the medical profession to do this, like, it varies as you[1:41:20] Andrew Huberman: And they're not measuring purity or molarity or things like that, typically.[1:41:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And there's ways to do it. So even if you don't ultimately know the dose that's in, like, the blotter paper of acid, One could at least get a sense of, like, yeah, having one of those tabs is, one of those hits is is a psychedelic experience. They could do something like Put it in water. It's a 100% aqueous soluble. You could vol you know, make sure it all gets into solution and then volumetrically measure.[1:41:46] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's gonna be homogeneously distributed, you can you take 1 tenth of that volume of water after it's fully dissolved. You know, that whatever you started with, you're gonna have a tenth of that dose. So the people that are more sophisticated We'll do things like that. And when they're working with mushrooms, they'll they'll grow a bunch of mushrooms, and then they'll, say, put it in a coffee grinder. I'm not Telling people to do this, by the way, I'm just describing, so don't do this at home, but, like, grind it all up so it's homogeneous because you can have, like, you know, sort of taking, you know, Two caps and a stem.[1:42:14] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Hey. This 2 caps in the stem that this buddy takes is has a different potency than this 2 caps in the stem that the other buddy takes. So People that are kind of in the know will will grind it all up into a homogeneous powder, and they'll pack it into whatever size capsule, and they'll know that and, again, even if they don't have Sometimes they might have a buddy that'll sneak it into the HPLC at their at their job or whatever if they have[1:42:36] Andrew Huberman: Not your lab. Necklace.[1:42:37] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Not my lab. That's never happened. Yeah. Seriously, never happened. But but, But they'll at least know that, hey.[1:42:43] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I've got a sense of what 2 capsules do. I've got a sense of what 5 capsules do. And so but in reality, Like, that's not what people do. They they'll they'll they'll take a piece of blotter paper, and they get a tiny little pair of scissors, a Swiss army knife pair of scissors, and they'll cut up The tab of acid, which is, like, you know, a quarter inch square or something, and and and they'll cut it up in 10 little pieces. And it's like, Right.[1:43:08] Andrew Huberman: I got[1:43:08] Dr. Matthew Johnson: you have no idea, like, if it's equally distributed in that media.[1:43:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And we can chuckle about it. And, but to me, One of the reasons why this experiment around psychedelics, this cultural experiment, and this legal experiment, we're seeing this now, but this was All attempted once before in the sixties seventies. The difference was it was all out in the street. The people in universities who were dabbling with this stuff Lost most of them lost their jobs or were asked to leave through, you know[1:43:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They lost their funding for this research minimally, and they had to move on to other topics. Sense to have a[1:43:44] Andrew Huberman: So these are precarious times. I mean, we're at a we're at a we're at a key moment where everyone assumes That this is all gonna be legal in a few years, but I think that that's a premature assumption[1:43:55] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[1:43:55] Andrew Huberman: Frankly. But And I'm and that let's touch on the legality and some of the things that are happening now, but what is microdosing psilocybin versus, the sorts of dosages that you described before in the 10 to to 40 milligram range. I've heard of people taking 1 or 2 milligrams of psilocybin every day as a way to quote, unquote, and for those listening, I'm just making air quotes with my fingers, Increased plasticity, which is a which is a term that I personally loathe because what does that mean? I mean, you don't really want your brain to be plastic because You need to make predict you need to maintain your ability to make predictions.[1:44:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. I mean Or learning chaos, like prediction. You're You need models of the world. Yep. You need heuristics.[1:44:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Like[1:44:41] Andrew Huberman: Plasticity is never the goal, or be it plasticity is never the goal. The goal directed plasticity is the goal. Right? Learning a language, reshaping your experience to a trauma, Altering the perception of self, but plasticity is a process. Like[1:44:58] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Schizophrenia is A lot of plasticity.[1:45:01] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Right. Right. It may it might even be there's one theory that it's extreme ongoing plasticity, and that's why people never create stable representations of anything. That's a a kind of a a minority view out there, but, so what's the business with microdosing, and is there any Clinical evidence or peer reviewed published evidence that it works, quote, unquote, to make people feel better about anything.[1:45:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So microdosing is is Is the aim of taking against something around a tenth of what would be sort of an entry level psychedelic dose for whatever compound. So, so so, like, yeah, with psilocybin, usually people almost never peep do people have, like, pure psilocybin. Like, 1 milligram of psilocybin would be in the range of a microdose. More likely, people are gonna have, You know, mushrooms, a little like, something like a a half of a of of a gram of mushroom.[1:45:53] Andrew Huberman: I know people that are doing this every day. They're doing this every day. It's, again, they're like, the same way that I take, like, I'm I'm personally, I'm not recommending other people do this, but I take Some I'm a fan of LCL carnitine lately. I've been kind of experimenting with that a little bit, which is not a psychedelic compound. I take it every day, And that they're taking their[1:46:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: That's their supplement.[1:46:12] Andrew Huberman: Every day. That's their supplement. Yeah. So[1:46:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So, yeah, the the claims are and there are a number of them. There's 2 general ones. 1 is is sort of acting, in in place of the ADHD treating drugs, so the psychomotor stimulus. So, like, A better version of Adderall. The other claims are essentially a better version of of the traditional antidepressants, a better version of Prozac.[1:46:37] Andrew Huberman: So people are taking both for attention deficit and for depression.[1:46:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And the aspects of those disorders that, You know, we all have a a degree of just like amphetamine is gonna increase the focus of at the right dose of anyone who takes amphetamine pretty much, you know, whether you're ADHD Diagnosed or not, the idea is that, you know, that there may not be a necessarily a a clear divide between the Therapeutic need and, you know, positive psychology, you know, even improving mood and focus, you know, You know? So it's not necessarily correcting, you know, ADHD, but improving focus to supercharge, you know, your your life. And so those are the claims. I am so so none of the peer reviewed studies that are have much credibility, None of them have shown a benefit, and they've tried now there or there's only at this point 4 or 5 studies that and I think for Things like this, you really need double blind research because the effects I mean, there was 1 study done in Amsterdam where people Knew they were taking psyllium truffles, basically, same as mushrooms and more like the roots of mycelia.[1:47:50] Andrew Huberman: Microdosing them?[1:47:52] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Well, taking a a what would be considered A, a a microdose and then doing some some cognitive measures before and after. And these types of thing that, you know, like, a lot of cognitive measures are Measured on the order of reaction time in milliseconds. I mean, in the types of effects you get as you could imagine are are ones that, like, would be You would totally expect could be there from either a practice effect or or, an ex expectancy effect, a placebo effect. So, You know, for something like these claimed, you know, you can imagine a a sort of an increased focus, you know, enhancement of cognition. These are, like, gonna be more subtle effects that you really need a a a a good placebo control for.[1:48:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The handful of studies that have done that have shown they've ranged from finding no effect whatsoever to just a little bit of impairment, Like, impairing someone's ability to do, time estimation and production tasks. So you want an accurate sense of time, at least if you're navigating in the real world. It's different if you're on the couch on a hero, those for therapeutic reasons where you're safe. But if you're crossing the street, if you're get you know? Yeah.[1:49:02] Andrew Huberman: You have to follow-up with that.[1:49:03] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Which is why the way people are claiming to, you know, use that helps them be a better CEO. Like, you want an accurate sense of time. So if anything, the data suggest that it makes it a little bit Less accurate. And and there's evidence that someone feels a a a little bit impaired, and they feel a little bit high.[1:49:22] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So In terms of you know, you call that abuse liability in research. Not surprising, you take a little bit of a of a drug that can result in a Some type of a high, and you take a little tiny bit of it, you'll feel a little bit high. So, you know, none of the, So far, no studies have have shown, you know, any increase in creativity, enhancement of any form of cognition, or or or a sustained improvement in mood. Now no studies have actually looked at the the the The system of microdosing that the aficionados are claiming. And there's a couple of models out there, but but Folks like, Paul Stamets and others, they'll have particular formulas.[1:50:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They're like, you need to take it one day and then take so many days off and take it every 4 days, and I don't wanna get into whose model is what, but it's always something like that, some pattern of use, usually not every day. And and the claim is that It's not just you know, sometimes people get benefit that 1st time when they take it, but they really say you need to be on it for a while. Like, a few weeks in, you may start to notice through this pattern of of of using it. And you you're you're feeling the benefits on those off days, like the 3 or or 2 days in between your active Doses. So those are the claims.[1:50:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Again, we don't know that there's any truth to that working, but studies have not been done to model that. So that's a big caveat. We as a field I say we as the as the the scientific field have not done the studies To really model, you know, what the real aficionados are claiming, you know, you know, where the therapeutic benefits come from. That said, it's it's It's almost assuredly there's a good amount of placebo there, but but the caveat to that is, like, almost everything in medicine or therapeutics, there's and Is gonna have some degree of placebo there.[1:51:16] Andrew Huberman: Belief effects are are I have a colleague at Stanford, Aliyah Crum, who has published really beautiful work on belief effects, that show that essentially you give the same milkshake to 2 people, you are 2 groups of people, you tell them that 1 contains a lot of nutrients. The other is a low calorie shake there. There the insulin response Amazing. Varies dramatically between the 2 or 2 b 2 groups rather doing equivalent Amounts of, physical movement, and you tell 1 group that it's gonna be good for them and help them lose weight, and they lose on average 8 to 12 pounds more doing the exact same Patterns of moving.[1:51:52] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Moving.[1:51:53] Andrew Huberman: So and I think that these belief effects boil down to all sorts of kind of network wide neuromodulation, things of that sort[1:51:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: of play. The work at Harvard Suggesting that even if you don't have deception, you give a placebo and say, this is a sugar pill.[1:52:05] Andrew Huberman: Right. You know, and tell them that. Right.[1:52:08] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They could still treat things. I think irritable bowel was the first thing they looked at.[1:52:11] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:52:12] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And so there's a huge so there's a reality there.[1:52:15] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:52:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: There's a necessity in developing drugs to make sure it's not only that, but but in the actual practice of medicine, hopefully, what you're always getting is some underlying Direct efficacy plus the placebo that enhances that. Now it could be that this is the real question is, is the microdosing are those claims A 100% placebo, or are they only part placebo and part real, you know, quote, unquote effect? My bet is, and this is totally based on anecdotes, that I think there is probably a reality to the antidepressant effect. I find that more intriguing Well, so because of the suffering with depression.[1:52:53] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:52:53] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Even if it's an it it wouldn't be as interesting as, I think, what we're doing with high dose Psilocybin or psyche likes to treat, depression. It would be if this is developed and there's a reality, it would be more like a better you know, perhaps a better SSRI, a better Prozac, which are similar more tools than fewer tools in the toolbox. Right. And it shouldn't be that surprised, like, even before the as going back to the tricyclics and the MAO in inhibitors going back to the fifties, like, augmenting Extracellular serotonin in one way or another for many people leads to a reduction in depressive symptoms. It wouldn't be that Crazy for chronically stimulating a subtype of serotonin receptor that you have an antidepressant effect.[1:53:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So I think if I have put my bets on it That there's if there's anything real, it is in that category. Although I'm very open to, like, maybe there is something to the creativity, to the, you know, improved cognition, which covers many domains in and of itself, but, my my greatest hopes are on the, on the antidepressant effect. That said, in the big picture, I think all of the most interesting thing about psychedelics are the heroic doses. I mean, the idea that you can give something 1, 2, 3 times, and you see improvements in depression months later[1:54:12] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:54:13] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And in addiction, you know, over a year later and with these, You know, people dealing with potentially terminal illness. I mean, it's I mean, I'm interested in big effects.[1:54:23] Andrew Huberman: Right. And I[1:54:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: don't think you're ever gonna get the really big effects. There's also some concern that almost all of these common psych the the more common psychedelics, even county MDMA, They have serotonin 2 b agonist effects, and agonizing serotonin 2 b, has been shown to lead To heart valve, formation problems, morphology issues, so, valvulopathy. So this is why Fen Phen was pulled from the market. The diet drug.[1:54:54] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Very effective diet drug.[1:54:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Right. And it was the The portion of that combination that had the the the serotonin two b activity that was was the problem. And so We don't know. So all of the the the toxicologists I've ever spoken to about this would, you know, say and cardiologists say, like, look.[1:55:13] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Hey. If there was some concern there, it's not applicable to the whole idea of you taking something a few times therapeutically within a lifetime. But The idea of taking something, like, you know, twice a week for years I mean, even the the hippies back in the sixties weren't doing that. Right? Like, there's not even these natural and even if they even if there was some heart valve disease problem, I I that stemmed from psychedelic use, Who's connecting those dots?[1:55:44] Dr. Matthew Johnson: That's not showing up in the clinical charts for anyone to figure out. So there and and and just theoretically, there is more of a concern. If if something's gonna happen with with heart valves, it's more likely that that those issues would arise when someone's taking these things, like, yeah, let's say, twice a week for the next 5 years. And so I do wanna throw that out to people to really consider.[1:56:07] Andrew Huberman: Right. Yeah. It's something I hadn't heard before that in in micro sound safer, Microdosing as opposed to heroic or macrodosing, and yet unless, and in the context of your lab and and other labs doing similar work, you've got this people checking blood pressure. You've got people that are really monitoring your psychological and physical safety. When people are out there microdosing, it sounds like there's a potential either through this serotonin 5 h to to be, receptor or other mechanism that There could be some kind of cumulative negative effects.[1:56:40] Andrew Huberman: They and I think that's an a really important consideration, so I'm glad you brought it up. What about kids? So the brain is very plastic early in life. It becomes less plastic as we age Yeah. Although it maintains some Degree of plasticity throughout the lifespan.[1:56:57] Andrew Huberman: The the year 25, it not, the year 25, but rather the age 25 years, it's sort of an inflection point where, the rigidity of the nervous system seems to really take off. Of course, people don't Wake up on their 25th birthday and find they have no neuroplasticity, whereas the day before they had a lot. These are you know, it's plus or minus, whatever it is, a year or 2, but, depends on the individual. However, the big the young brain is very plastic.[1:57:30] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Mhmm.[1:57:30] Andrew Huberman: And I could imagine there could be great risks. Who knows? Maybe even benefits, but I'm certainly not, thinking about those, I'm mainly thinking about the risks, for young people taking psychedelics. Are there any trials looking at people, in clinical trials, this would be under the age of 18. Has anyone explored this in a rigorous way?[1:57:54] Andrew Huberman: Given the potential to exacerbate Psychotic symptoms and bipolar symptoms in some people, is there a heightened risk of that? What's the story with age Of use in psychedelics for therapeutic purposes.[1:58:07] Dr. Matthew Johnson: There's no formal research. Although I there's a very high chance that there will be. So this is one of the very interesting things folks may not realize or appreciate about the FDA approval process. So the FDA already in multiple instances has signaled That they're they wanna see those studies. Before Well, not not before it's approved as necessarily as, You know, for for adults, but they're gonna eventually wanna see, in fact so the the maps group that's developing MDMA for PTSD, they've Already signaled that that's kind of a on on list of interest, and there's even some incentives in that in the FDA, Pathways for, for incentivizing folks to explore that that use in young people.[1:58:55] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I know in some of the work that I helped with in pushing, psilocybin into phase, Phase 2 b clinical research, the FDA, you know, said, well, why why can't you give this to kids? It's like, Are are you aware that depression is a problem with with with adolescents? Like, you know, like and it's really interesting because this, FDA is very concerned about pseudospecificity.[1:59:23] Andrew Huberman: The idea that define pseudospecificity.[1:59:25] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You put out a drug and say, oh, this is good for men, but not women. This is good for black folks, but not white folks. And now sometimes there's a very good rationale for that, like, when we're talking about hormones and for a specific, You know, for for for for men versus women, and there's certain, you know, issues, you know, you know, certain disease states, like, maybe sickle Cell anemia, that's more relevant[1:59:48] Andrew Huberman: Tay Sachs, things like that.[1:59:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Exactly. You know? But absent of something that they're very concerned about saying, oh, this is for this type of person, But not that type of person. So age is one of those things, and also this recognition, you know, much like the emphasis at at NIH with, You know, with, you know, with rodent studies and human studies that, like, you can't just say you're studying men or just went went you need a rationale if you're only step[2:00:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. To be clear to people, there's, It's a recent switch, but there's a stipulation in every federally funded grant that both sexes we we don't refer to gender in scientific studies unless it's a study of gender per se. We refer to sex, meaning biological sex, so That there's a stipulation that in order to receive and continue to receive funding, you have to do studies on both males and females of that species, including humans.[2:00:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And at least even if you're not powered for it, at least looking at that in exploratory analysis. Like, as a grant reviewer, I'm charged with looking at, you know, did they address, like, sex as a biologically relevant variable? Right. Anyway, this is in there.[2:00:53] Andrew Huberman: Does the same drug have different effects In males versus females.[2:00:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[2:00:57] Andrew Huberman: And you could at[2:00:57] Dr. Matthew Johnson: least look at the trends even again if you're underpowered to look at those between subject type effects.[2:01:02] Andrew Huberman: Which is a great shift that didn't exist in, you know, 10 years ago. Sounds like we're both on grants panels. As study section members, you didn't To do that now, it's a it's an important biological variable. If you don't, look at that, you essentially won't get your your funding.[2:01:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And age is a similar thing. So it's the whole idea, like, man, if something that could help kids. Like, what's the rationale? So I think there's gonna be now, obviously, you're gonna have in those studies at least just as much, probably more. It should be more, you know, of a cautionary approach.[2:01:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's probably gonna be you know, it would certainly whatever disease states are like, they're gonna be probably treatment resistant, at least as a first step. You know? Hey. Suicidal depression. Yeah.[2:01:44] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And and so all of that in the mix, but, hey, You know, if this stuff really helps people, you know, that are 25 or 30, like, what's the rationale that it Won't help a younger person. You know? And there's cons these generic kinda concerns about the developing nervous system is more susceptible to Pro I mean, it cuts both ways because it's also more, you know, plastic generally and adaptable, maybe resilient to injury in certain ways, But, you know, you hear the rhetoric about kids, their brains, and drugs, and it's like the developing brain is a special concern. So yeah.[2:02:21] Dr. Matthew Johnson: But I think we're gonna be seeing research eventually.[2:02:23] Andrew Huberman: That's it's interesting. I went to the high school, that is infamous, sadly, Gunn High School, for having it the highest degree, at least at one point of suicide suicide rate. Wow. And a lot very large number of suicides. This was written up in the in the times and elsewhere.[2:02:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Is it a very academically Successful school. It's a very academically high pressure[2:02:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Very academically demanding school to a point where they've restricted. The kids will meet often at 6:30 AM or 6 AM before school for study groups and things of that sort. So some of it may relate to that. But I have to say that even prior to all that Academic pressure.[2:03:03] Andrew Huberman: When I went there, it wasn't the pressure wasn't like that. That you know, we had a an unusual number of Suicides for whatever reason, and, you know, and so the idea of kids being prescribed and I wanna be emphasized prescribed, not just using, but Prescribed psychedelics for therapeutic purposes, I think, might make some people bulk, but the idea of kids, killing themselves should also make people balk, and so I'm I'm relieved to hear that there's going to be a rational, scientific, safe, Clinical trial based exploration of this. I wanna ask you about the current status of these drugs and compounds. I'm, pretty active on social media, more so on Instagram than on Twitter. But as I have Been on Twitter a little bit more recently.[2:03:57] Andrew Huberman: I've noticed that there's a lot of dialogue around your account and other people's accounts around a couple of themes related to psych First of all, what is the status of of the transition to legality for for prescription purposes? So Medical doctors, MDs, prescribing it legally for therapeutic purposes. Mhmm. That's the first question. The second question is what is the status as it relates to possession and criminal charges.[2:04:25] Andrew Huberman: So, for a long time, I lived in Oakland where we were one day told not too long ago, it is now, quote, unquote, decriminalized is what I was told. Double check, people. Right. But what does that mean? And then the other issue and the third question, and we can parse these 1 by 1, is this issue of, Let's just say I'm aware of a lot of investor dollars going into companies that are essentially companies focused on Psychedelics as therapeutics or psychedelics generally, I have to assume that they are investing in anticipation of a shift in the legal status.[2:05:05] Andrew Huberman: And there's a lot of interest now, like, will psilocybin become a taxable thing just like marijuana? So let's start with Other question, like, what is going on in the US legally? Is it illegal to possess And, sell and use these compounds. My understanding is you can still go to jail for having These compounds in your possession or for selling?[2:05:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. So even though it's a the the legal landscape is very different than with cannabis, there are some similarities. So one of the similarities is that regardless of what local, municipal, you know, with city or state is decriminalized, and that that word itself can mean many things. So the devil some some forms of decriminalization is close to what folks would call Legalization and others are, like, pretty weak. You know?[2:05:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Just saying, we suggest that the police make it their lowest law enforcement Priority[2:06:03] Andrew Huberman: that type[2:06:04] Dr. Matthew Johnson: of thing.[2:06:04] Andrew Huberman: Turn the[2:06:05] Dr. Matthew Johnson: other shoes[2:06:05] Andrew Huberman: kind of thing.[2:06:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. But even the the cops can still choose to.[2:06:09] Andrew Huberman: But someone could get could get Pulled over for 1 thing, searched, and then by definition, if it's illegal and they find it[2:06:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[2:06:15] Andrew Huberman: Then they have they have to do something about it.[2:06:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And that'll probably be determined by, You know, like, both judicial precedent, is it gonna be thrown out? And and just the local prosecutor, you know, even before like, are they gonna choose even at post arrest are gonna pursue To really, you know, go after those charges, make those charges stick. So I think that's still in play and is gonna depend on the municipality. But like cannabis, Federally, these are all schedule 1 compound.[2:06:40] Andrew Huberman: Which means they're illegal.[2:06:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The which means they're illegal. The caveat to that just as has always been the case since Prop 215 in California with cannabis in 96 is that, hey. 99% of of drug enforcement is done at the local and state level. The DEA, which is the federal law level of law enforcement is a tiny fraction of the arrests They got I mean, most people that arrested for any drug are done by local or state level, authorities, But it's still technically, you know, illegal, and so you can and they could potentially and depending on the ambiguity of the local law, They even those local officials could charge you with a a federal crime, and theoretically, The feds could always come in. Now although you'll you know, again, a similar, you know, case with the whole cannabis history, it was the The feds came in in the early days with the folks that were basically highly visible.[2:07:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They went after Tommy Chong for selling bongs, But, you know, I remember him being on the tonight show one time, and I think it was back in the Jay Leno days. He says, but all along the Santa Monica boardwalk and, like, every shop sells bongs. Pongs, how did you go to prison for a half year for Pongs? It's because he was and there because he was famous. Because he was, you know, Tommy Chong, and and There were some high profile cannabis groups of you know, that were distributing it and were very vocal.[2:08:04] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Those were the ones rated by the DEA in the early days, not the ones kinda Keeping to themselves, keeping it quiet, and just doing their thing. So there's always the potential for selective enforcement, and so, you know, in, like, this initiative in Oregon, which is a state level legalization of psilocybin therapy, Which is really interesting. You know, part of their plan for 2 years is to figure out how to integrate with the federal level. And I don't know how that's gonna go because, like, unless you rewrite the controlled substances act, it seems like the best you're gonna get is a A tolerance from the federal government, and, you know, and that could be very, You know, hey. You change administrations.[2:08:48] Andrew Huberman: And this is psilocybin by prescription from a medical doctor, or you're talking about therapists In who have master's degrees or PhDs or self appointed coaches or something like that, Administering psilocybin be but without any oversight.[2:09:06] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So this is all getting figured out in the Oregon case. And, again, there's 2 year period of, like, basically, we're gonna figure this out. And and so What[2:09:13] Andrew Huberman: is it with Oregon?[2:09:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: They're ahead of the lot of, you know, euthanasia. I I[2:09:18] Andrew Huberman: love I love the state of Oregon. Very it's interesting how you have these pockets. Oregon, Vermont seems to be one. You know, you got these kind of pockets where people are Environmental with plant compounds. They seem to be green woodsy areas for in at least in my mind.[2:09:34] Andrew Huberman: But there there's sort of a culture around plants And the use of plants as therapeutics.[2:09:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And combine that with the west, just just more geographically of more of the the anti, You know, federalism, the anti I mean, the Oregon ranchers from several years ago that held up the, you know, the the whatever Wild life place, you know, and that was a big showdown with the feds, you know, and the cut you know, just kind of the west is kind of known for, You know, more of those issues. So you combine the 2, the hippie dippy California Oregon vibe with the pandemic.[2:10:07] Andrew Huberman: Becoming less hippie dippy the, than Although it was, there's always been a tradition, not just in the culture around drugs, but, certainly in academia and in tech, etcetera, that the west It has been a place where people have tried to throw off traditionalism and kind of lineage, And, like, who your parents are, what school you went to, and, and the past as a determinant of what's next and exciting about the future. Whereas, and here we are, an East Coast institution guy and a West Coast institution guy. I think that it's this idea of kind of Innovation and the future versus do we stay grounded in history and tradition? Right. And, of course, there are great institutions on both sides.[2:10:53] Andrew Huberman: What's interesting is that, Hopkins Johns Hopkins, Medical School, I think of as a a real, like, East Coast academic institution. It is on the East Coast, but Here you are, doing these very pioneering and important and exploratory And studies in a certainly not a hippie dippy environment. Right. Oh,[2:11:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: yeah. Very conservative psychiatry department. Even amongst psychiatry departments. And as a psychologist the psychiatry department, psychiatry is certainly more conservative than psychology even within academics. But even amongst psychiatry departments, it's a very conservative Department.[2:11:30] Andrew Huberman: So we've got the law at the federal level. We've got the law at the state and local level, and then we've got This question of whether or not it's gonna be physicians, so MDs, people with PhDs or master's degrees, or whether or not it will be kind of a free for all[2:11:46] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[2:11:47] Andrew Huberman: For for consumption. And we can't coaches. The life coaches and and and the general public. I mean, cannabis Yeah. I'm not a pot smoker.[2:11:54] Andrew Huberman: I I just it It's never appealed to me. That's just me and my my pharmacology. But, you know, you can buy cannabis Most places in the US without a ton of risk, it seems. Right? Are we going to see a time in which You can essentially go into a a shop on, Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, California.[2:12:19] Andrew Huberman: And And right now, you can go buy marijuana if you have a marijuana card, and it's my understanding. I see a lot of people going in and out of these stores. The police certainly have no problem with it. Is there gonna come a time where people can just go buy psilocybin? Do[2:12:32] Dr. Matthew Johnson: you think Like they do in Amsterdam and have[2:12:34] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that time is coming?[2:12:39] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I think so at at at a certain point, and, I don't know how long. It's hard to imagine our current level of Drug criminalization holding up for and I'm thinking, like, large spans of time. Like, really, in a 100 years, are we gonna be doing this 500 years? How could that it's not gonna be sustain sustainable.[2:13:04] Andrew Huberman: But in 5 years,[2:13:05] Dr. Matthew Johnson: for instance. So I don't think so in the United States. I I I do think, eventually, You're gonna see something like that because there's gonna be no way and I and I think we're gonna I hope that we're gonna eventually come so strongly. We're gonna move on from this model of criminalizing drugs that we're really gonna focus on regulating drugs at the right level for that drug. And I I like the word regulation better than legalization.[2:13:33] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So, I mean, I could imagine what one day regulation smart regulation might mean for psychedelics. Maybe it could mean that there will be you know, whether or not you have a a diagnosis of a problem, it it may be that even for personal exploration, you can do this legally, But you first have to maybe take it to court, get a drive, and this has been I'm not the 1st to say this, but get equivalent of a driver's license. You have to go to, Get some sort of training. Maybe your first number of experiences need to be with, with trained guides who can facilitate it, and then the the Public health information for anyone using this that this is what riskier use is. All use is gonna have risk.[2:14:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: This is what riskier use is. This is less risky use. These are the factors. So I think eventually, we're gonna be get for any but I would see the same thing for, like, methamphetamine and and and, You know, heroin and cocaine, like, all of these drugs, it's hard to imagine the current approach of just feeding a black market And really exacerbating a lot of the harms from drugs, you know, you know, that happens under the current model. It's hard to imagine that Maintaining that isn't to say, I think it should be in all of the 7 Elevens, you know, sold to kids at at the other extreme.[2:14:45] Dr. Matthew Johnson: But but I do think it's probably not gonna be soon in the United States. I do wanna make the major point that that even if psychedelics had never been made illegal, I think the exact the trajectory of the medical research right now would still need to happen. If it's effective as An antidepressant, like, we need it to be you know, there's all the evidence suggesting that whatever disorder we're talking about, the efficacy is gonna be increased, And the risks are gonna be mitigated drastically in the types of models we're talking about with the screening, with the preparation, With the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy or what have you depending on the disorder you're treating with the integration afterwards with the professionals. So, it it It we would be doing it anyway. So it's not like this versus that.[2:15:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So I don't see it as a race between the decriminalization or legalization of these compounds versus their medical development. Some people who are cellulic fans get get all into a bunch About the medical development, they say, you guys wanna, like you wanna you wanna keep it only for, you know, for your medical research and ivory tower, and you wanna be, Yeah. In control of it as academics, and my take is I didn't make it illegal for anyone. We're only moving the needle in one direction. And, again, even if it was already illegal and and because and I've done plenty of survey research of people reporting they took mushrooms for fun or for personal exploration, and They said, my god.[2:16:13] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Why am I smoking? And they quit smoking 20 years because of it, or it's helped with their depression, or it's helped with them overcoming alcoholism, or these Sometimes that happens out of the blue when people use psychedelics. Nonetheless, obviously, the efficacy rates are gonna be higher when you bring it into these medical models, it's gonna be Sure. Safer. So we're gonna you know, so we need to be pushing that, and my best guess is that MDMA is gonna be approved Within the next 3 years and[2:16:40] Andrew Huberman: For prescription by a physician.[2:16:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yes. In and not just, you know, take 2 and call me in the morning Right. But in the clinics, the way that those Those PTSD trials are being run. So the MDMA would be approved for PTSD, and every disorder needs to be looked at separately, and it's gonna only be approved for those things. Now There's[2:16:58] Andrew Huberman: gonna be a question now. Legalized and regulated or, you know, now we're getting into the nuance. I think when people hear it's going to be approved in 2 years, they think That they'll be able to buy and sell and use MDMA without legal consequences, and I do not think that's going[2:17:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: to be[2:17:11] Andrew Huberman: the situation. That's not the way it is. And I I will say that, I think the quote, unquote psychedelic community I mean, they they've been doing what they want to and will carry on doing what they want to anyway. Right? It's not like the the legal status has, has prevented them from doing what they're doing.[2:17:30] Andrew Huberman: In fact, Unlike Leary and, Timothy Leary and Huxley and and, you know, and and some of the others that were very vocal and lost their jobs and some who even went jail, etcetera. I mean, you got a lot of public figures now like McKenna and others who are just basically out there talking about psychedelics. Michael Pollan, who is more of a writer, foodie guy gone psychedelic dabbler, writer guy. Uh-huh. I know he's a he's kind of a polymath, but, You know, the league the legal status didn't seem to hinder their, at least online careers.[2:18:02] Andrew Huberman: I I don't know, and I don't know. I haven't looked at their bank accounts, but I'm imagining they're doing just fine. Right? So the fact that work is happening inside of, big institutions, I think it's important that you point out, and I'm just trying to underscore, that that's that's in in no way antagonistic to what people are doing. It's In support of a different sort of mission, which is to explore the validity in different contexts in a really controlled way, which I really you know, it's It's I think it's a really important mission.[2:18:34] Andrew Huberman: I wanna make sure that I ask you about the other really important mission that you're involved in with to psychedelics, which is not about depression per se, but is about neurological a neurologic injury or head injury. Mhmm. I realize it's early days for this, but I think, there's a lot of concussion out there, sadly. There's a lot of TBI, traumatic brain injury. Yeah.[2:18:57] Andrew Huberman: Not just from sports. I think people sometimes forget that it's not the the major source of traumatic head injury is not football. It's not hockey. It's not Boxing, it's not any of that stuff. It's construction workers, and it's peep I mean, if you've ever seen the helmets that construction workers wear I mean, The jackhammer.[2:19:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Oh my god.[2:19:15] Dr. Matthew Johnson: The jackhammer. That not be just like[2:19:17] Andrew Huberman: I have a colleague that works on this in bioengineering, and when you look at the you know, we always think sports, But there are many people who make a living in a way that is, over time is detrimental their brain and they don't have the option of just not being a professional athlete or something of that sort.[2:19:34] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And if they're not doing the construction, someone else needs to do it. Else has to do it.[2:19:38] Andrew Huberman: Right? And we for some reason, and I too, it didn't occur to me until I heard it, like, the the people who are doing construction, and then, of course, Bike accidents and falls and things like that as well. Military. Military. Absolutely.[2:19:52] Andrew Huberman: So What do you think is the potential for these compounds, particular psilocybin, but other compounds as well for the, treatment and possible even reversal of neurological injuries, and what it what sorts of things are you excited to do in that realm?[2:20:10] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. So this is definitely on the more exploratory end. So it's based upon so, you know, this is sort of beyond the improvement of psychiatric disorders like depression, you know, or depression and anxiety associated with the terminal illness, or a substance use disorder, the addiction. So those are sort of psychiatric, you know, disorders. So this is, you know, these you know, There are anecdotes of of people saying, that that psychedelics have helped heal their brain.[2:20:47] Dr. Matthew Johnson: You know, they've been in one of these situations like in sports, a sport where there's repetitive head impact, and they're claiming that, You know, using psychedelics has actually improved their cognitive function. For example, improved their memory, including improved their Their their mood, but but it's kind of more of the, you know, the cognitive function, things like memory Are now the caveat is if you successfully improve someone's depression, you can get some cognitive improvement too, but that's a more of a A weaker, more indirect effect. But if you take these anecdotes and you combine it way across orders of analysis to the rodent research from, several labs like David Olson, Brian, Roth, these folks that have shown different forms of neuroplasticity unfolding, after, like, sort of postacutely, so after in the days following the administration of psychedelic compounds, a a a variety of psychedelic compounds And even some nonpsychedelic structural analogs, that you see these different forms of neuroplasticity, so, the growth of dendrites and new, connections being formed with with with different neurons. So that those effects Maybe at play and they improve in the psychiatric treatments that we're dealing with. That we don't know that.[2:22:14] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It seems like a decent guess, and we're gonna be figuring out whether that's the case. But another potential that that sets up is that maybe that's what's going on with, with with with these claims of improvements from neuro neurological issues that there's actually, You know, a a repair of the brain, from injuries underlying, You know, things that you know, situations where those repetitive head impact, perhaps there's a potential for for helping folks recover from stroke, and disorders like that. It there's a wide variety of disorders. Now the it's a bit of magic and a bit of, like, It's it's something that the enthusiast kind of can do some hand waving and claim that this is already known. It is more exploratory, But what I'm hoping to do is some work with retired athletes, who have been exposed, but by the nature of their or, for example, in NA athletes in the UFC who have been exposed to, repetitive head impacts like a lot of sports, a lot of, you know, sports expose people to and and and who are retired from the sport and are suffering from, say, depression, Which can, impart result from those types of of of that history of head impact.[2:23:37] Dr. Matthew Johnson: See if we can fix the depression, but then also as a cherry on top in a more exploratory aim, See if we can have evidence of of improvement in cognitive function and associate like, using MRI, see if it affects gray matter over time, These types of things to see if there actually some evidence of this improved, like, this more direct repair of the brain. But it again, it is very sort of, like, we've got some rodent data. We've got some human anecdotes.[2:24:07] Andrew Huberman: We we we will Acknowledged its early days, and we look forward to seeing the data. I I appreciate how cautious you are, intentative you are. You're not drawing any conclusions. I think, from a purely, logical, and somewhat mechanistic perspective, I mean, If we assume that lack of ability to focus or degradation in mood is the reflection of Neurons in the brain, I think we can agree on that. Some dialogue between neurons of the brain, and that what needs to be changed is the nature of that dialogue, a k neuroplasticity.[2:24:45] Andrew Huberman: We know that reordering of neural circuitry require in the adult requires these things like Intense focus followed by rest, etcetera. But the basis for that like, beneath focus is the mechanism is a mechanism rather Beneath the the bin that we call deep rest is a mechanism, and those mechanisms are neuromodulator driven. So to me, you're, I'm not reviewing your grant, but but, from a rational perspective, it seems that drugs that increase Certain neuromodulators, like serotonin or dopamine, in a in a controlled way, and then coupling that with Learning of some sort, sensory input of some sort Mhmm. It makes sense that that would lead to could I should say lead to reordering of circuitry that would allow for better thinking, better mood, many of the same things that you've observed in the clinical trials for, for depression. So the rationale is really strong.[2:25:44] Andrew Huberman: I think that's a very exciting area. You know, I I get asked all the time about TBI and traumatic brain injury, and Right now, you know, it's kind of, there isn't a whole lot that people can do, and people are dabbling in the Base of, you know, hyperbaric chambers, and people will do sauna and breath work, and, you know, and people are kind of, you know, clipping at the margins of what really is a problem that resides deep to the skull. So I think, I I just wanna applaud the the exploration. I think it's great provided that exploration is being done in a controlled way. It sounds Like, that's what you're doing, with the UFC?[2:26:18] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. So that's that you know, we we they they were really gracious and had myself And and a few of my colleagues out to their headquarters in Vegas Impressive place. Right? It it's in process. You know, there's a dialogue going on there.[2:26:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I'm hopeful that there's gonna be, some some work with them, but it it's it's in process now in terms of exploring it. There's a real interest, and I'm I'm just really impressed by the organization and their commitment to athlete health and, we'll see.[2:26:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I am too. We We have a a colleague out there. We're doing a little bit of work with them, Duncan French, who's a serious academic in his own right. And I think when people hear UFC, they just think about The octagon and fighting and, you know, pay per view fights and things.[2:27:00] Andrew Huberman: But in talking with them, and I'm sure you've had these discussions as well, They are very much interested in the health and longevity of their fighters. They are also interested in the health and longevity of their fighters being a template for how to treat of Of the UFC that is commonly comes to mind because they haven't been, you know, particularly, verbal about it in the press, but I think it's great they're bringing in academics. I mean, geeks like us going to the out to the UFC Performance Center I mean, you do MMA, but I'm basically just a geek walking through the place. But the fact that they're interested in talking to scientists is really, I'm biased here, but a point in their favor. Along the lines of other groups and individuals that have impacted the space that you're working in in this Pioneering of of the psychedelic space.[2:27:53] Andrew Huberman: You know, a few years ago, I think if someone submitted a grant saying, I want to Study how Psilocybin impacts human depression. I'm guessing, having worked on these panels before that, The the response might have been closer to, well, we need to do a lot of studies in rodents and a lot of studies in primates, and then maybe, just maybe, we could explore These drugs because the National Institutes of Health actually has a, a whole institute devoted to addiction, right, of Exploring compounds only in terms of their negative effects, right, which is a very[2:28:27] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Which is where I've gotten all of my NIH funding[2:28:30] Andrew Huberman: Which is so interesting. Right? And it's a super important institute. I wanna be clear. There are amazing people there, but philanthropy and foundations have been very important in supporting pioneering research.[2:28:44] Andrew Huberman: And so maybe we just talk a little bit about about that. So your lab receives funding from taxpayer dollars through the National Institutes of Health, is that mainly where your sore where your funding comes from?[2:28:56] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So our group has gotten some funding from, I say, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, for some, a small subset of the psychedelic work, but only for some work, Geared towards understanding these things as drugs of abuse. Of course, when you do a study though, you can Show us how they're explore how they're bad. Right. Right. But when you're doing that, you can explore, like, And and, you know, the good stuff too, you know, but but the the large majority of the work the most interesting work has been funded by philanthropy.[2:29:30] Andrew Huberman: Private philanthropy.[2:29:31] Dr. Matthew Johnson: No. I I still have some grant, support from NIDA outside of psychedelics. I'm Shifting more and more of my, my time towards, you know, focusing only on psychedelics, and in fact, Us getting the the the center level funding from, some really, you know, big picture philanthropists, like, helped me to start to make that transition. But groups like the Hefter Research Organization, Dennis McKenna, which is one of the founding members, the brother of Terence McKenna, is, by the way, an ethnobotanist? That's what his PhD is in.[2:30:04] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Ethnobotan? Studying the the, essentially, the anthropology of of of of psychoactive plant use. So[2:30:12] Andrew Huberman: You can get a degree in that?[2:30:14] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, hanging out with cultures and Studying their use of these compounds in the traditional ways[2:30:20] Andrew Huberman: At Hopkins? There's a that degree exists at Johns Hopkins.[2:30:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I don't think that degree exists at Hopkins, but, I mean, the the kind of the most and, you know, as as you'll as you know from academia, I'm not I'm not you know, sometimes folks I'm not sure how many people's PhD is actually in, ethnobotany or Yeah.[2:30:38] Andrew Huberman: I've never heard of it before.[2:30:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Something else, but the real focus is, like, My degree is general experimental psychology, but[2:30:45] Andrew Huberman: that's the thing. Just decided they're gonna major in ethnobotany, but, you know, the[2:30:49] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I mean, one of the pioneers of the psychedelic era before Leary and before and, actually, he was late even for the human researchers, like folks like Humphrey Osmond and Abraham Hoffer and Sydney Cohen were earlier, but even before those folks, Richard Schulte is at Harvard. He was I mentioned him earlier in the conversation, Discovered all of this now. There's these various tribes using Ayahuasca or Yage, a different name for the same thing, throughout South America and these DMT containing snuffs and all of this. So, you know, that was, you know, ethnobotany, this kind of The this kind of intersection of anthropology and these psychoactive plant, compounds. So so The Hefter Research Institute, which Dennis is a is a is a founding an active, a member of, a board member, They have funded a lot of our early work.[2:31:41] Dr. Matthew Johnson: There's also an organization called the the, the Beckley Institute, based in England that a lady Amanda Fielding is has been the head of that has, they provided the first Funding for our, psilocybin, smoking cessation research, and Hefter came in and provided subsequent funding. But It's and then there are other groups, a council on spiritual practices. A great guy named Bob Jesse, funded some of the original work looking at the nature of mystical experience outside of treating disease states or disorders, but just understanding these, like like, People take these compounds and astonishingly, you know, frequently will say that was the most important thing I've ever Experience. It's like, what the hell is that? Yeah.[2:32:27] Andrew Huberman: I had someone mentioned recently. I think this might surprise me a little bit. Certainly surprised me. I had a friend who, Adores his children. He's got 3 children.[2:32:36] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. He adores his children. He's a happy marriage and great Great father. They're both great parents. And he told me that as part of a clinical trial, he had a DMT experience That he claims he said, I'd love to tell you that it that the birth of my children was as profound, but that was a more profound experience than the birth of my children.[2:32:57] Andrew Huberman: Any one of them and all of them combined. And I was like, wow. No. I've never done DMT, but I was like, wow. That's a pretty strong statement.[2:33:03] Andrew Huberman: Now he did it in the context of one of these, you know, clinical explorations. I assume that was part of a legal clinical trial, but the I mean, that's saying something. Yeah. It's saying something. I mean, he's a very rational, very Grounded guy, otherwise.[2:33:19] Andrew Huberman: But so philanthropy, foundations, and then in[2:33:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Most recently, And so I just I can't because I can't skip it. Our center line funding which came a year and a half[2:33:29] Andrew Huberman: I see.[2:33:30] Dr. Matthew Johnson: That's like we I mean, The Hefter group, the Beckley group, I mean, these are wonderful. I mean, these are people that have been holding the flame alive during the darkest hours like the same thing with m d with the maps organization on more on the MDMA side, like, holding that candle during the darkest years that, you know so we've but, you know, smaller organizations connected to smaller, But growing over time, you know, pockets of wealth. But, you know, we basically limped limped along on a wing and a prayer Until recently when we got the $17,000,000 gift so that we could create a nominal center. And as you know, basically, to the university, that means you get number of dollars and a lot of them, you can call yourself a center. You know, it's a capital investment, you know, staff, you know, equipment, Salary support, which has always been the huge thing for us.[2:34:20] Dr. Matthew Johnson: But the $70,000,000 gift gift, which was split between the The the the Cohen Foundation, so Steven and Alexander Cohen, and they covered half of it. And the other half, the Tim Ferris collaborative, basically, Tim a few, friends ponied up that that you know, divided the rest of that half of that $17,000,000 gift and came together to just I mean, it just it's completely transformed our the work that we've done and our ability to, you know, like, to fully Delve into this area and not worry that, like, oh, if I focus on this rather than putting another 3 NIDA grants on some other topic That may or may not get funded. Like, if I focus too much on the psychedelics, am I putting my career at jeopardy? But, like, so[2:35:06] Andrew Huberman: But you're now not only a tenured professor, you're also a full Endowed you.[2:35:11] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. So that came[2:35:12] Andrew Huberman: By the way, when you say somebody is a fully endowed professor, I wanna be very clear what that means. That means that there's[2:35:17] Dr. Matthew Johnson: funding mean all of the above, but no.[2:35:20] Andrew Huberman: I have no knowledge of your particular situation, but, you you probably do. This is Katie. But sure. The, and then these, what we're essentially saying is that funding, which does not change somebody's salary level I just wanna be clear because I think the general public isn't, there's no reason why they would, understand all the the nuts and bolts of how this works.[2:35:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Academia is weird. Yeah.[2:35:42] Andrew Huberman: Academia is weird because we're not talking about increasing we're not talking about an endowment that or philanthropy that went to increase, Matt's salary. That that's something that's set at the university level. It's always been said, and it is at least is still true now, which is that, you know, nobody goes into science for the money, at least not at the Academic level. Mhmm. Not at, in academia, but, allows people to devote More of their time and energy to these, exploratory, realms like psychedelic research or, in case of my lab, the work that we're doing with David Spiegel's lab on on respiration, breath work, and hypnosis for modulating brain states, These are not typically areas that the National Institutes of Health and other major organizations have institutions Set up to support.[2:36:33] Andrew Huberman: Now there is an exciting initiative, which is the NCCIH, which is complimentary health.[2:36:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right. Used to be IN CAM Yep. Yeah. N I n. Their name.[2:36:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[2:36:42] Andrew Huberman: And now we're not just throwing out acronyms just to, you know, to bat back and forth acronyms, but I think what we're looking what we're seeing now is a movement toward science and scientists and clinicians and the general public And philanthropy, being engaged in this dialogue, which says, okay. There are problems in the world. Depression, head trauma, Psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD, these problems clearly exist. The solutions are going to involve behaviors that are going to involve nutrition, supplementation, social connection. However, there are drugs.[2:37:21] Andrew Huberman: There are Compounds that can change the brain and allow the brain to change its circuitry through experience, and psychedelics are one of of Several others, but one of the, you know, powerful levers, it sounds like. And and I just wanna say that I think The reason I reached out to you and I'm I'm so excited to sit down and chat with you is because I see very few people inside the halls of academia who have thrown their arms around this issue of psychedelics in a way and gone through the trouble of trying to find the funding to get it done, gone through the trouble of trying to set up clinical trials. I know what's involved in doing this. It's so complicated. So time consuming and painstaking, and you've made real progress.[2:38:08] Andrew Huberman: I mean, you guys are publishing papers. There's A new dialogue emerging that isn't just books on bookshelves and, and, you know, psych psychedelic psychonaut gurus on the Internet, who also Play an important role, but you're really moving this field forward. And I know there are others as well. There are colleagues in England and others as well. We'll we'll we acknowledge them.[2:38:29] Andrew Huberman: But I just wanna say personally that I'm, like, inspired and impressed by the way that you've gone about this and the level of rigor. I mean, when I ask you a question about serotonin, most people just kinda kick back to me. Well, yeah, you got receptors and you got a ligand, but, I mean, it's clear to me That you care about the details and that you care about the future of this area, and you also really care about these patients and these individuals. So I know I'm speaking on behalf of a ton of people now and in the future that don't even know what they're gonna receive as a consequence of this. I just Wanna voice a real sincere thank you for for that effort.[2:39:11] Andrew Huberman: It's like your lab and your work matters, and that's A really special and unique thing.[2:39:17] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I appreciate that. I had a a good colleague, in fact, shared some grand support Under the multi PI system years ago, and and she she actually took a job at in at at NIH as a as a as a review officer. And I remember her telling me, You know, and she actually left when she had multiple r o ones, so it's like she didn't[2:39:35] Andrew Huberman: The r o ones are kind of the the bread and butter, big big grants that every, every card carrying, it's a mark of respect in our community to have a 1 or several of these. Yeah.[2:39:47] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. And and, you know, and it's like you you eat what you kill an academia. It gets to what we're talking about later. It's like, you don't make more money by pulling more grants, but you're able to pay the salary that, like, the university doesn't pay you Right.[2:39:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Your salary, your your it goes through them. Right.[2:40:02] Andrew Huberman: You're just able to do more work.[2:40:04] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And then you're able to, like and if you don't Pull in the grants to cover your salary, your job can come to an end. Even if you're tenured at a place like Hopkins, they can do tricks like slowly lower your salary over these. So you Or they[2:40:16] Andrew Huberman: just let You know, store you or they just take away your space.[2:40:19] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. They put you in a closet and give you no support for trainees and basically make life hell for you. So you can drive a CAB in Baltimore and call yourself a full professor at Hopkins, truthfully, but you may not have no ability to Sure. Get everything done. But, but, yeah, I remember one of the things this colleague said who is is successful, but left on top said, I really don't know that I'm making a difference in the world.[2:40:42] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And she did some great memory Research and and and and connected to drugs, also connected to aging, but she she said, I don't, you know, I don't I don't feel the impact of what I'm doing in the real world. And it's, you know, unfortunately, there for a lot of academia. What we do, it stays in the ivory tower. You know, the world is a You know?[2:41:01] Andrew Huberman: Not an anymore. A whole[2:41:02] Dr. Matthew Johnson: but messed up place, and, like, a lot of this doesn't disseminate. And and and because of the various structures, the way the world is set up, and, Thankfully, this I mean, because the work that that our group as well as a a a few others around the the world over the last 20 years, it's like, You do have an emerging psychedelic start up industry now with 1,000,000,000 of dollars of investment. And, yeah, that's gonna turn into both good and bad. Like, you know, it's upping the ante. Like, there's gonna be a lot of good and bad that comes from that, but any new technology is gonna result in that.[2:41:35] Dr. Matthew Johnson: But we get psilocybin designated For 2 separate entities as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA, and people may not realize and MDMA is designated as a breakthrough therapy for for PTSD. This is a really big deal. That's a very high I mean, pharma companies would pay 1,000,000 of dollars To get their new drug, a designation like that and what it means is it early research is showing saying it shows a high potential For treating disorders that don't have very good treatments. So we're and we're probably, you know, again, a few years away from both MDMA and Probably a year or 2 after that, psilocybin being treated for PTSD and depression respectively, this is you know, we have to wait for the phase three studies, but If the results hold up any even if the effect size is, like, halved of what we're seeing now, it's still gonna be a lot larger than what you're seeing with the traditional medication. So it's gonna be approved if the data hold up, and it probably will from my judgment.[2:42:36] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So I feel like what I'm doing is actually having a Positive impact in in the world in a way that and I feel I feel lucky that I got interested in an area that happens to plug into a place in the world where There is that opportunity where some, you know, great colleagues and friends are focused on areas where I wish they had the opportunity for their work to be disseminated. I wish I mean, I was lucky to be interviewed on on 60 minutes because of this work. And I was like, oh my god. I know so many there's A bit of, you know, impostor syndrome. Like, oh my god.[2:43:09] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I know so many scientists that deserve, you know, more so than me to be had that level of exposure. But if you happen to be in that place where it's You gotta do your best to to to make it work, to take advantage of that luck and that intersection of the world and to to push it. And, you know, I've been lucky, but also did take a bit of a leap Of of faith early on, I did have some, you know, advisers that told me, like, you've got a really promising pedigree early on. Like, are you sure you wanna focus Next time on the psychedelics. Yeah.[2:43:43] Andrew Huberman: You've been you've embraced risk. I mean, I think that, I mean, the world's changed, in since, in 2020, certainly, but, You know, channels like social media, podcasts, and things of that sort, you know, your exposure is is because people are interested in these topics, and that's why people like Myself are are interested in talking to you. I mean, you know, at Stanford, there are now a few labs starting to explore psychedelics more at the mechanistic level. But, so in animal models, some excellent labs, but also I can imagine in because of the pioneering work that you've done at Hopkins, it'll start to become more Common. I'm certain that people are gonna have questions about how to get in contact with you and learn more, If people have trauma, PTSD, depression, you know, you it's likely that they're going to start seeking ways in which they can Potentially, participate in clinical trials.[2:44:39] Andrew Huberman: You're very active on Twitter. Active, I should say. You've got other obligations, but where you are active on social media, you're active on Twitter. It's it's drug it's at drug downscore researcher.[2:44:50] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Right.[2:44:50] Andrew Huberman: Right.[2:44:51] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. Right.[2:44:51] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Drug[2:44:52] Dr. Matthew Johnson: underscore For a researcher, that's how to find me.[2:44:56] Andrew Huberman: Great account, by the way. Matthew and I recently got into a dialogue there about of the deeper effects of psychedelics in the literature versus how they're being discussed in the general public, and, I follow his account. It's a really wonderful account for Whether or not you have a science background or not, if people are in and I'm gonna try and persuade you to be more active on Instagram, but I don't know I'll succeed in that[2:45:19] Dr. Matthew Johnson: try to get my interest in[2:45:20] Andrew Huberman: the day, and I I get it. I'm running a lab too. I get it. You're busy, but but, we drug down For a researcher there as well Same handle. The same handle.[2:45:30] Andrew Huberman: Your lab at Hopkins is pretty straightforward to find through a Google search of your name, Matthew Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. Are there portals for people to, to explore clinical trials, participation in clinical trials of various[2:45:45] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah. And so in our group so you go to Hopkins psychedelic .org. That's the website. And if you can't remember that, just John Hopkins psychedelic. Yeah.[2:45:54] Dr. Matthew Johnson: We will go by the way. And you're gonna find us. It'll be the first thing that pops up, And we have trust me. If we have a study on something, it's gonna be on that website.[2:46:04] Andrew Huberman: That means, he's they're being very polite, so I I will be a little bit more aggressive and say, don't email him directly. He won't see that email. Wait until there's a posting for a study, and then sign up through the correct portal.[2:46:16] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And I try to get back those emails, but frankly and it's a it's because, you know, I'm lucky the area has taken off so much, but there are many days where I simply get So many You have to do research.[2:46:26] Andrew Huberman: That I can't do the research.[2:46:28] Dr. Matthew Johnson: My day. Yeah. If I answer all the so so yeah. Trust me if there and and something that a lot of folks Don't get in being in academia like we are. It's easy to forget how people don't, understandably, don't not realize this.[2:46:40] Dr. Matthew Johnson: This is experimental research. It's FDA approved As an experiment, you know, so we're working towards formal FDA approval for straight up clinical use. But right now, someone can't bring me a case of Some idiosyncratic thing and and say I'm suffering from this complex constellation[2:46:58] Andrew Huberman: You're not a clinician.[2:46:59] Dr. Matthew Johnson: And yeah. I'm not a and even if I was, I wouldn't be able to treat them with psilocybin or or to send them anywhere that was legal to to to to to take it. You know? So If if if we're gonna be treating you, it's it has to be or anyone else in the United States or most other countries for that matter, It's gonna have to be under the guise of a very specific protocol. This number of milligrams to treat PTSD, to treat major depressive disorder, to treat, you know, treatment resistant, tobacco use disorders of nicotine addiction.[2:47:35] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Very specific studies. This is not one off treatment, And folks say, like, oh, I can pay to go out to Baltimore if you see my oh, my son has this, you know, complex like, in And they're tragic cases, but you you so if you're interested in the study, go to our website. If it's not on their website, You know, we don't have a study on it. There are gonna be forthcoming studies, so I'm gonna be starting studies on opioid addiction and PTSD and an LSD study for chronic pain. The day that those are open for recruitment, they're gonna be up on our website.[2:48:07] Dr. Matthew Johnson: So that's where you look, to see everything. And in fact, I would just recently, couple days ago, put up Well, survey say is also where we, post links to our survey study. So if you've if you've had psychedelics and you've taken them for therapeutic intent intent for PTSD Or for depression or anxiety, you can find a link. And, also, if you've done breath work for those reasons, we have a link for a study of that type up there now, which is a A holotropic style, very psychedelic type of[2:48:31] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[2:48:32] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Of of of of breathing technique that can lead to some of these similar Experiences. So it's up there more broadly outside of our group because there's a growing number of of groups in the US doing this re and in Europe doing this research. But you can go to to clinical trials .gov, and if you look in for the the the main search term of of psilocybin or MDMA or psychedelic plug in those terms. You can get a list of the growing number. I mean, I think there's I think there's over 40, maybe.[2:49:03] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's been a while. There might be over 50 now. I don't know. But, studies with just psilocybin going on right now on clinical trials .gov. So check out clinical trials.gov to see what's going on, but it's gonna be if you're gonna do anything legal, it's gonna be in the context of a very specific study.[2:49:20] Dr. Matthew Johnson: It's not gonna be One off treatment.[2:49:22] Andrew Huberman: Right.[2:49:22] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Yeah.[2:49:23] Andrew Huberman: And I should say just and not just legal, but also supported in the right framework That you described of having a team, etcetera, obviously, people will do what they will do, and Listen, if Oh, yeah. Go ahead.[2:49:38] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I I will say if people I I never encourage people to take drugs of any I don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug has its risk.[2:49:44] Andrew Huberman: I encourage my own caffeine mix, but nobody else's.[2:49:47] Dr. Matthew Johnson: I'm drinking up right now. This is great.[2:49:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This is very strong. Mate is what we're drinking. It does not led to a, Alteration in my perception of of self to the extent that we talked about earlier. However, this conversation wasn't a a good example of how we can enter a perceptual bubble.[2:50:04] Andrew Huberman: I learned so much about psychedelics and the future of this for sake of mental health and other aspects of health. Matt, thank you so much for your time, for your knowledge, and I think you put it best earlier for, holding the candle In a very dark time, and then now there's light.[2:50:24] Dr. Matthew Johnson: Thank you.
