I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Wendy Suzuki. Doctor Suzuki is a professor of neuroscience and psychology at New York University and one of the leading researchers in the area of learning and memory. Her laboratory has contributed fundamental textbook understanding of how brain areas such as the hippocampus, which you will learn about today, How the hippocampus and related brain circuits allow us to take certain experiences and commit them to memory so that we can use that information in the future.[0:00:41] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Suzuki is also an expert public educator in the realm of science. A few years back, she had a TED Talk that essentially went viral. If you haven't seen it already, you should absolutely check it out, in which she describes her experience using exercise as a way to enhance learning and memory. And on the basis of that personal experience, she reshaped her laboratory to explore how things like meditation, exercise, And other things that we can do with our physiology and our psychology can allow us to learn faster, to commit things to memory longer, and indeed, to reshape our cognitive performance in a variety of settings. As such, I am delighted to announce that doctor Suzuki is now only running a laboratory at New York University, but she is the incoming dean of arts and science at New York University.[0:01:30] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, she was selected for that role for her many talents, But one of the important aspects of her program, she tells me, is going to be to incorporate the incredible power of meditation and other behavioral practices for enhancing learning, for improving stress management, and other things to optimize student performance. Today, you are going to get access to much of that information so that you can apply those tools in your daily life as well. Doctor Suzuki is also an author of several important books. The most recent one is entitled Good Anxiety, Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion, And a previous book entitled Healthy Brain, Happy Life, a Personal Program to Activate Your Brain and Do Everything Better. And while that is admittedly a very pop science type title, I will remind you that she is one of the preeminent memory researchers in the world and has been for quite a while.[0:02:26] Andrew Huberman: So the information that you'll glean from those books is both rich in-depth and breadth and is highly applicable. By the end of today's discussion, you will have learned from doctor Suzuki a large amount of knowledge about how memories are formed, how they are lost, and you will have a much larger kit of tools to apply for your efforts to learn better, to remember better, and to apply that information in the ways that best serve you. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort To bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:03:07] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it meets all my foundational vitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs. In fact, whenever people ask me, if I were to only take 1 supplement, which supplement should I take?[0:03:32] Andrew Huberman: I tell them Athletic Greens for the simple reason that it covers your base of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. It also has important adaptogens, digestive enzymes for gut health. All this is very important because we now know that gut health and the so called gut brain axis is very important for things like mood and brain function and also contributes to immune system function. With athletic greens, you're covering all those bases, and, of course, you need to eat a nutrition and healthy diet that's right for you. But by taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day, you can be sure that there are going to be no gaps or deficiencies in your vitamin, mineral, or pro To athletic greens.com/huberman to claim a special offer.[0:04:20] Andrew Huberman: They'll give you 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin Then d three k two, both of which are also vital for immediate and long term health. So once again, if you go to athletic greens.com/huberman, You can get a special offer of 5 free travel packs to make it easy to mix up athletic greens while you're in the car or otherwise traveling. Plus, they'll give you the year supply of vitamin d three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.[0:04:53] Andrew Huberman: I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health Can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can also get insight into, for instance, What your biological age is and compare that to your chronological age, and, of course, your biological age is the the number that really matters. With InsideTracker, there's a distinct advantage. And the advantage is that while there are many blood tests and DNA tests out there, InsideTracker's blood and DNA tests come Also, with a platform, meaning a website platform, that allows you to see exactly what you could or should do in order to adjust the numbers on things like Hormone levels, metabolic factors, and lipids, and so on. It's a little pop up window.[0:05:39] Andrew Huberman: It points to nutritional, supplementation, and behavioral regimens that you can take in order to put those numbers in the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/ Huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books, each condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways for those books.[0:06:07] Andrew Huberman: I love reading books from front to back. I like the actual physical book. I'm sort of old fashioned in that way, and I do also listen to audiobooks. It's very rare that I don't finish a book that I've started. Nonetheless, I like to revisit some of my favorite books.[0:06:20] Andrew Huberman: I also like to write down key takeaways from those books, sometimes even before I listen to the full length book. So I don't mind spoiling the the takeaways because when I read nonfiction, generally, I'm trying to extract the most valuable knowledge from them. So I'll often listen to A Blinkist 15 minute version, then the full length book or sometimes the full length book, and then the Blinkist 15 minute version. Either way, Blinkist is a great way to get through any book and to extract the best from those books. I've used it for, for instance, Matt Walker's Why We Sleep, an excellent book on why we sleep as well as Tim Ferriss's The 4 Hour Body, Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan, and so on and so on.[0:06:59] Andrew Huberman: With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to read or listen to a massive library of nonfiction books. It really is a treasure trove of information. Right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners. If you go to blinkist.com/huberman, you can get a free 7 day trial And 25% off a Blinkist premium membership. Once again, go to blinkist.com/huberman to get a 7 day free trial and 25% off.[0:07:24] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Wendy Suzuki. Wendy, great to see you again and to have you here. It's been a little while.[0:07:31] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: It's been a while. So great to be here, Andrew. Thank you so much for having me.[0:07:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Delighted. I'd like to start off by talking about memory generally. And then I'd love to chat about your incredible work discovering how exercise and memory Interface and what people can do to improve their memory and brain function generally.[0:07:51] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[0:07:51] Andrew Huberman: But for those that are not familiar, Maybe you could just step us through the basic elements of memory. A few brain structures, perhaps. Or You know, what happens when I for instance, this Mug of, tea, is pretty unremarkable. Mhmm. But the fact that now I've talked about it, I don't know that I'll ever forget about it.[0:08:11] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I will, maybe I won't. What happens when I look at this mug and decide that it's something special for whatever reason?[0:08:20] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Well, I like to say there are 4 things that make things memorable. Number 1 is novelty. If it's something new, the very first thing, the very first time we've seen something or experienced something, our brains are drawn to that. Our attentional systems draw us to that.[0:08:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And when you are paying attention to something that's that's part of what makes things memorable. Second is repetition. If you see that cup of tea every single day and every single time you do an interview, you talk about your cup of tea, you're gonna remember it. That's Just, how how our brains work, repetition works. 3rd is association.[0:09:00] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So if you meet somebody new that knows lots of people that you know so you and I share many, many, many, many people that we both know. It's easy to remember it's easier to remember you, especially if you were somebody new that I hadn't met before, we have met before. So association. And then the 4th one is emotional resonance. So We remember the happiest and the saddest moments of our lives, and that also includes, you know, funny, surprising things.[0:09:33] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That is the interaction between 2 key brain structures, the amygdala, which is important for processing, lots of emotional, particularly threatening kinds of situations. But, those threatening, surprising kinds of situations, the amygdala takes that information And makes another key structure called the hippocampus work better to put new long term memories in your brain. So that, in fact, is the key structure for long term memory, the structure called the hippocampus.[0:10:08] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. So novelty, repetition, association, and emotional resonance.[0:10:13] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[0:10:14] Andrew Huberman: You can tell us a bit more about the hippocampus. I think, at least for my generation, well, I'm a neuroscientist, but for most people in my generation, I think they first heard about the hippocampus from the movie Memento[0:10:24] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Oh, yeah.[0:10:25] Andrew Huberman: Where the guy says hippocampus. Yeah. And if and for those of you who haven't seen that movie, it's a bizarrely constructed movie, but an interesting one nonetheless, about memory. But Even as a neuroscientist, sometimes I'm perplexed at how, the hippocampus works. Now maybe you could if you wouldn't if you would, Now step us through kinda what this structure is, what it looks like, maybe a few of its subregions because, you know, unlike vision, the topic that I've worked most of Yeah.[0:10:56] Andrew Huberman: My career on where we know, okay, the eye does this part, and the thalamus does this part, and the cortex does that part. I've always been a little perplexed about the hippocampus, frankly. Okay. And I've read the textbooks, and I've heard the lectures, but I'd love to get the update. You know, what are the general themes of the hippocampus as a structure Sure.[0:11:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And its function. Yeah. What do you think everyone, including neuroscientists Mhmm. Should know about the hippocampus?[0:11:18] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Absolutely. So let's start with the basics. The word hippocampus means seahorse. It is shaped the structure is shaped like a kind of Curly q sea seahorse. That is accurate.[0:11:31] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Everybody, including neuroscientists, should know it's a beautiful structure. It is Visually, anatomically beautiful with these kind of intertwining twirly subregions Within it. And I think that's one of the reasons why early anatomists, who were the very first neuroscientists, got attracted to it because it's this Interesting kind of twirly structure deep in the heart of the brain. So that's anatomically. Functionally, what does it do?[0:12:01] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Well, It's easiest to understand what it does when you, look at what happens when you don't have a hippocampus anymore. What if you What if by some, you know, disease or or you have your hippocampus removed by accident, what happens? Well, we know this from the most famous neurological pace patient of all time. His initials were h m, so all Psychology neuroscientists neuroscience students know him. He was operated in 1950 4 and, the paper was published in 1957.[0:12:40] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: They removed both this hippocampi because He had very terrible epilepsy, and, they knew that the hippocampus was the genesis of of epilepsy, and this was experimental. His Epilepsy was so bad that they decided not just to remove 1 hippocampus, but both. And what happened was immediate, Immediate loss of all ability to form new memories for facts and events. Think about that for a second. All facts or events you're not able to remember.[0:13:13] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I can't remember this interaction between us. I can't remember any of the facts that we were just chatting about in our neuroscience lives. None of that can move into Our long term memory. So this hippocampus does something with all of these perceptions that are coming at us every single day, every minute of the day, And not for all of them, but for some of them that have these features that we just talked about. Maybe they're novel.[0:13:41] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Maybe they have associations. Maybe they're they're emotionally relevant. Maybe, maybe they've been repeated. Some of those things, in the realm of facts or events get, encoded in our long term memory. And, that's that's the textbook of of why the hippocampus is so important.[0:14:01] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I like to always add, and, I mean, this is why I studied it for so many years. The hippocampus and what it does really defines Our own personal histories. It means it defines who we are. Because if we can't remember what we've done, the information we've learned, And and the events of our lives, it it changes us. That that's what really defines us.[0:14:24] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That's why I wanted to study the hippocampus. And I think that exciting new new ideas about the hippocampus was, is that it's it's you know, hippocampus is important for memory. So if you say that, you'll be impressed all your people at your, at your cocktail party. But What people have started to realize that it's not just memory. It's not just putting together Associations for what, where, and when of of events that happened in our past, but it's putting together information that is in our long term memory banks in interesting new ways.[0:15:04] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I'm talking about imagination. So without the hippocampus, yes, you can't remember things. But, actually, you're not able to imagine, Varianced before. So what that says is the hippocampus is important for memory is a too simple a way to think about it. What the hippocampus is important for is what we've already talked about, associating things together writ large.[0:15:30] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Anytime you need to associate something together, Either for your past, your present, or your future, you are using your hippocampus. And it takes on this much more important Role in our cognitive lives when we think about it like that, that is kind of the new the new hippocampus that that neuroscientists are studying these days.[0:15:52] Andrew Huberman: That's fantastic. So it sounds like it really sets context, but it can do that with elements from the past, the present, or the future.[0:15:59] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[0:16:00] Andrew Huberman: And, the well, for neuroscientists, the the phrase is domain. We say the time domain Yeah. Meaning as opposed to just evaluating things in space. It sounds like the time domain of hippocampal functioning is incredibly interesting.[0:16:13] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: It is.[0:16:13] Andrew Huberman: And and even the fact that we can have short term, medium term, and long term memories. And we could go down any of these rabbit holes. I'll ask you a true or false mostly because Okay. I just really want to know the answer.[0:16:23] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Okay.[0:16:24] Andrew Huberman: A few years ago, the theme in various high profile reviews seemed to be that The hippocampus was involved in encoding, in creating memories, but not in storing memories, and that the memory storage was in the neocortex or the Other overlying areas of the brain, is that too general a statement?[0:16:43] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That's a that's a tricky statement Because I think that, ultimately, yes, that long term memories are stored in the cortex. But those memories are stored in the hippocampus sometimes for a very, very long time. So how long is Too long where you say, oh, it's not the hippocampus anymore. If it's 4 years, is that does that mean that it's, you know, it it's not stored in the hippocampus? I think that's a that's a tricky question.[0:17:12] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And, yes, it was coming up a lot because people were debating it, and and some people did think that you shouldn't think about the hippocampus as a storage area. But I think it's a long, long, long term kind of intermediate storage area. Maybe not the long term storage area. That's why it's hard to answer that question.[0:17:30] Andrew Huberman: Great. As I recall, could remember facts from before For his surgery[0:17:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[0:17:37] Andrew Huberman: He couldn't form new memories.[0:17:38] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Correct.[0:17:39] Andrew Huberman: And given that he had no hippocampus, it would at least partially support the idea that Some of memories are retained outside the hippocampus.[0:17:47] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: However, he did have part of his posterior hippocampus intact. So that's the tricky thing. I think initially, in fact, Scoville, the the, neurosurgeon, Overestimated the number of millimeters he had want he intended to remove at the hippocampus. And then when they did this, the the the very historic MRI of later in his life, they showed that, in fact, He did have that posterior hippocampus part of the posterior hippocampus intact. So now it makes makes it a little bit More complicated to interpret what's going on.[0:18:25] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Not that it was never uncomplicated. Any interpretation of a lesion in in a patient, as you know, is complicated. But, you know, had this mythical role in in neuroscience and neurology, and now it was It was it was complicated because he he does have more of the hippocampus intact.[0:18:45] Andrew Huberman: Got it. I did not know that. There are some memories that can be formed very quickly, so called one trial learning. Yeah. And I'm just looking at this list get novelty repetition association and emotional resonance, it seems like some experiences can bypass the need for multiple repetitions.[0:19:06] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Absolutely.[0:19:07] Andrew Huberman: So, but and, unfortunately, it seems that our nervous system is skewed toward Creating one trial memories Yeah. For negative events Right. Which has a survival adaptive mechanism. Yeah. What is the Neural connection that allows that to happen.[0:19:23] Andrew Huberman: Is it the amygdala to hippocampus connection? I mean, as you and I know, the seems like every brain area ultimately is connected to everything else. It's just a question of, through how many nodes? Just like every city is connected to another city. It's just a question of how many flights and roads do you have to, traverse before you, get there.[0:19:40] Andrew Huberman: What is it about one trial learning? I mean, at at a kind of top contour level, how do we how can we learn certain things so fast? Yeah. And other things are are tricky, and now every time I look at this white mug, it's queuing up something special that Yeah. Simply by virtue of saying it.[0:19:56] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. So[0:19:56] Andrew Huberman: is that one trial memory? But, you know, what is what is it about very emotionally salient events that allow memories to get stamped in?[0:20:06] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. I mean, I think you you you've already alluded to it. That is there is this protective function, of our brains that has evolved over the last 2,500,000 years that you need to pay attention and remember certain things for your survival. So some things that get stamped in, you know, the they're memories, but they're they're fear memories. You know, if I get mugged on the Subway or you know, there are terrible things that could happen on the subway as we as we just learned.[0:20:38] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But if something terrible happens, if something very scary happens, You remember that, and that that fear and that memory of all those things. I mean, I I have one. When I lived in Washington DC, I went to work at NIH on a Sunday afternoon, and I came back. And when I rounded the corner To my door of my apartment, it was Crow Boy Bard Inn. Somebody had taken a crowbar, opened up my door, and stole all of my All of my the nicest things in my apartment, which wasn't that nice because I wasn't making that much money.[0:21:13] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But ever since, Ever since then, whenever I rounded that corner, I still had that memory. It was terrible because, you know, it put me in a terrible state when I was just coming home. And that that's a survival mechanism. Do you want to, be alert to possible danger? Absolutely, yes.[0:21:32] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So part of those one trial memories, I think, is often taking advantage of this evolutionarily developed system To camp in things that could be potentially dangerous to you into your memory so you forever will Remember this particular corner or this this hallway because that is where something really bad happened to you.[0:21:56] Andrew Huberman: It seems like, location. We talk about conditioned place aversion, which is just a geeks speak for wanting to avoid the place where something bad happened or condition place Preference, wanting to go back to a place where something positive happened. We're even looking at a photograph of where Yeah. You had a wonderful time with somebody, and that can evoke all sorts of, Positive sensations. It seems like at some level, the as complex as the brain is, the basic elements of, feeling good or feeling lousy are are states within the brain and body.[0:22:26] Andrew Huberman: And linking those to places seems like it it's a pretty straightforward formula. You know, Link place to state. Uh-huh. Link state to place, etcetera, as your description just provided. When we learn more complex information,[0:22:39] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: you[0:22:39] Andrew Huberman: know, a poem, a a concept, or we have to ratchet through a set of ideas, that also involves memory. Yeah. I'm sure that we'll talk more about this, but is there any way that, you're you're aware of that State bodily state can be leveraged to enhance the speed or the the quality of the of memories and memory formation. Because, you know, that so to be clear about it, it seems there's something very important about this fourth, you know, this emotional resonance Mhmm. Component.[0:23:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right? Novelty. The crowbar into the doors Mhmm. Thank goodness, is a sounds like it was novel.[0:23:24] Andrew Huberman: It wasn't repeated through you. Thank goodness. So repetition is out, and the association is very, very strong.[0:23:29] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[0:23:30] Andrew Huberman: But For people trying to learn information that they're not that excited about[0:23:34] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Right.[0:23:35] Andrew Huberman: Or that, repetition is hard Mhmm. Or the The novelty is simply that it's painful. Yes.[0:23:43] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I've been there. Yeah. Absolutely.[0:23:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. As as have I. Is there something that we can do to to leverage knowledge of how the memory system works naturally to to make that a a more straightforward process?[0:23:57] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So I I immediately turn to, the things that I've studied that you talk about so beautifully on your podcast, Which are, strategies generally to make your brain work better. I was just reminding myself of your podcast about cold, because I use that Good morning.[0:24:21] Andrew Huberman: Oh, you do cold?[0:24:22] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I do. I do.[0:24:23] Andrew Huberman: Just take a a moment and and just tell us what is your cold exposure protocol, and then I'll take you back to what you're saying.[0:24:27] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So my cold exposure protocol is, At the end of every morning shower that I that I take, you know, you the shower is is warm, but I give myself a big blast of cold at the at the end of that, and it makes me feel so good. And because I've been doing it for several years, It's so much less painful. Okay. I admit. It was really painful at at at the beginning, but it's much less painful.[0:24:55] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I could I could handle the cold water, and my pipes are give nice, really cold water. And it just I could Feel I could feel the the awakeness kind of come come up in me after that. And so, and I miss it if I forget to do it. Sometimes I run back in and give myself that cold blast because it is it is upping you know, I think you've talked about this on your podcast. What's happening in the brain?[0:25:23] Andrew Huberman: Basically, the cold stimulus, that shock Yeah. That, you know, catching your breath, etcetera, is Adrenaline from the adrenals, but also from what we understand now, some new neuroimaging. There's epinephrine and norepinephrine released from locus ceruleus, which, again, is a brain structure in the back of the brain, got sprinklers the the rest of the brain with with a kind of a wake up chemical, and there's a long arc On dopamine release, this paper back in 2000 showed that it's a steady increase up to about 2.5 x of circulating dopamine. So they weren't looking directly in the brain, admittedly, But it goes on for 4 or 5 hours. Wow.[0:25:59] Andrew Huberman: So the improved mood and the feeling of alertness is a real thing.[0:26:03] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so I use the I mean So, basically, I use my morning routine. What is my morning routine?[0:26:10] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I get up. I do a, 45 minute tea meditation, so meditating over the brewing and drinking of tea that I learned from a monk, Who has a institute in Taiwan where he teaches tea meditation. Love it. I've learned all about tea, different kinds of tea. And then I do a 30 minute cardio, cardio weights workout, Then I take my shower with the with the hot cold contrast.[0:26:40] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And, oh, and before that, Key thing, if I wanna learn something and and I want to be able to, get over the the The difficulty of repeating things or just just push myself to do stuff, sleep. So good, good sleep. I've learned that over the pandemic, I did sleep experiments on myself, and I learned that I was sleeping an hour less than I really needed. So I really need 7 and a half to 8 hours of sleep, and I was getting 6a half. And so now, you know, I get get that 7a half to 8 hours every single night.[0:27:17] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And Guess what? I come to different difficult tasks, and I am more willing to give it a try, to try longer, to try harder, And my brain works better. And so I think probably if you go back to all of your podcasts, you'll learn exactly why each one of those things that I do, Which I would bet that you probably do too is helping my brain.[0:27:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I guarantee they are, and I'm I'm impressed that you do all these things, although not surprised. And I should say that the extra hour of sleep is really impressive, and extremely beneficial. I'm curious. Do you get that, in the early part of the night by going to bed earlier?[0:27:54] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Or you[0:27:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Terrific. And and I should just mention, because you're too humble to do it, but I'll say it again that, yes, not only Are you a full professor running a, tenured full professor and running a laboratory? You teach undergraduates. You have an important role in public education, multiple books, and you're now dean of the The the College of Arts and Sciences at NYU.[0:28:14] Andrew Huberman: So the extra hour of sleep is benefiting you and inter and as a consequence, benefiting everybody else as well. Thanks for sharing with us your protocol. I took you off the trajectory of what one can do, but I I think that people and and I, appreciate knowing you know, tell me what the practical steps are. Yeah. Yeah.[0:28:33] Andrew Huberman: Because knowing the science is important. Mechanism, I do believe, is is important for embedding, protocols in people's minds and why they might want to do them, but really hearing that the the mechanics of it is useful. It sounds like everything together takes about an hour. It's not in excessive amount of time, but it probably gives you an outsized positive effect on on your day.[0:28:51] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Absolutely. I definitely notice it, if I'm not able to do it, and and when I don't so I I do this 7 days a week. It's also not just, you know, 5 days, 7 days a week. And, when I can't do it, it's usually early morning flights or things like that. And and, and I get over it, but it's Critical critical for the working of my brain.[0:29:16] Andrew Huberman: I love it. And I'll just highlight one thing that you said, before we move on, which is that you said when sometimes if you Get out of the shower before the cold. You'll get back in. Yeah. That's, to me, a a really beautiful example of condition place preference.[0:29:28] Andrew Huberman: You know, there's some Now the cold shower has become something that you sort of look forward to. I should say that nobody is immune from the adrenaline increase of cold. No matter how Cold this is what's interesting about cold. It's one of the reasons why it's such an important part of the screening for special operations, you know, so so our seal teams, but other other branches of military too, which is that there are fair very few stimuli Mhmm. That you can give anyone Uh-huh.[0:29:52] Andrew Huberman: And consistently get an adrenaline[0:29:55] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Oh, interesting.[0:29:56] Andrew Huberman: Release from that without harming them. You know, with heat, eventually, you need to use so much heat that you damage tissue. Yeah. Or with exercise, you have to use so much exercise that you can damage joints. Yeah.[0:30:05] Andrew Huberman: You know? And it's this very kind of, brilliant I I don't know if it was intentional or not. Sort of unintentional genius that they that special operations has figured out that by sending people back into the cold over and over, it never really gets easier. Uh-huh. But over time, people actually start to Crave it.[0:30:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And it provides this reduction in inflammation, etcetera. Yeah. So anyway, beautiful practice. Thank you.[0:30:28] Andrew Huberman: I wanna learn more about your tea meditation later in the episode. But, any event, returning to ways that we can improve memory formation Yeah. Maybe if you would, Tell us your story around this. I know you've told it before, but Mhmm. Like a lot of members of the audience and I, I'd love to hear, you know, you came to this?[0:30:49] Andrew Huberman: Because Yeah. Growing up in neuroscience, I knew you as one of the I would say one of the 3 or 4, and they're all alongside one another, not, this isn't a hierarchical statement at 3 or 4 top memory researchers in the world. Right? Textbook materials, Suzuki, in the My textbooks are filled with the Suzuki, your last name, according to the information on memory and memory formation. So you were doing that Mhmm.[0:31:17] Andrew Huberman: And doing the things that academics do. And then you're still doing that, but Yes. There and still at a very high level, but then things took a different direction. Yeah. Maybe we could talk about your story and how, you came to the place You are at now Yeah.[0:31:32] Andrew Huberman: Because I think it provides a number of tools that people could, implement themselves.[0:31:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Yeah. So this story happened, As I was working to get tenure at NYU, and and as you know, it's a it's a stress filled process. They give you 6 years to, you know, show your stuff, and you are judged in front of all your colleagues. And either they say, okay.[0:31:55] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: You can join the club, or they say, sorry. You are, You know, humiliated in front of everybody. This was They they actually[0:32:02] Andrew Huberman: tell people to leave. Yeah. If you don't get tenure, you're gone.[0:32:04] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: You you have to leave. You're an institution. And so, so, you know, you work really, really hard. And so my strategy was, I'm just gonna not do anything but work. And I'm just gonna work, and I'm I'm going to, just work as hard as I can for the 6 years.[0:32:20] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And, what happens when you work And you don't have any sort of life outside of work, and, you live in New York where there's all sorts of really good takeout, you gained £25, which is exactly what I did, and you get really, really stressed. And you start to ask yourself, how come I'm living in New York City and I love Broadway, And I've never I haven't gone to a Broadway show in 2 years, and so I I so I I 25 pounds overweight. I, I decided to go on vacation, and, I went by myself because I had no friends. And I went to, I I did a adventure, river rafting trip in Peru. And so I go by myself and, you know, Meet other interesting people, and, I I was the weakest person on this whole trip.[0:33:10] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Like, I was I they were So much in better shape. It was embarrassing. And they won't say this. They won't admit this to me, but it was true. And I kinda came back, and I said, okay.[0:33:22] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I cannot be the weakest person. I'm in my late thirties. I have to do something. So I went to the gym, and, I said, oh my god. I'm 25 pounds overweight.[0:33:31] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Let's let's try at least to, lose this weight. And so I go to the gym. I notice How much better I feel when I go to just a single class. I remember the very first class I went to was a hip hop dance class. I'm a terrible hip hop dancer, but I still felt good after after that class.[0:33:48] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And then fast forward year and a half, I've lost the £25. So proud of myself, So much happier. And I'm sitting in my office doing what you and I do a lot, which is writing an NIH grant, which is our lifeblood. Right? And, writing, writing, writing, and this thought goes through my mind that had never gone through my mind before, which what during this 6 years of grant of frantic grant writing when I was trying to get tenure, and that thought was, grant writing went well today.[0:34:20] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: You know? That That that felt good. I was like, I've never had that thought before. What what's going on here? This is really weird.[0:34:27] Andrew Huberman: I don't know that anyone has had that thought before.[0:34:29] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: No. I'm sure people have had that thought, but, I thought maybe I'm just having a good day. But when I thought about it, I thought it's it's not just today. My grant writing seems to have been getting smoother. Like, I'm able to focus longer.[0:34:46] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: It the the sessions feel feel better to me. And, you know, at that point, the only thing that I changed in my life, it was a huge thing, but I had become a gym rat rather than a workaholic. And that's when my, you know, spidey sense for neuroscientists popped up. And I said, what do we know about the effects of exercise on your brain? Because if I think about it, what was better about my writing is I could focus longer and deeper, very important, and I could remember those little details that you try and pull together for your $1,000,000 NIH grant from, you know, 30 different articles that you have open on your Green all at the same time.[0:35:27] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That's the hippocampal memory. I was studying that. I was writing the grants on on hippocampal memory. And, so that's When I got really interested in the effects of exercise on both prefrontal focus and attention function and hippocampal function Because of my own observation and this kind of I still remember where where I was sitting, which office I was in when I had this revelation. But the thing that really sealed it for me that made me think not just, oh, this is interesting, but I I wanna study this, is right around that time, I got a phone call from my mom, who said that my dad wasn't feeling well and that he had, told her that he got lost driving back from the 711, which is literally Seven blocks from our house that I grew up in, and, I knew that was that was hippocampal function.[0:36:23] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I suspected dementia. I suspected, though didn't wanna admit, Alzheimer's dementia, which he which he had. And, it was funny because I mean, it wasn't funny, but, my mom and dad are two sides of a very different coin. My dad is the the, The engineer, not so active all his life, but would love to sit sit and read books all day. My mom was the athlete.[0:36:50] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: She she played tennis team tennis Into her eighties, and, and it it started to show at at that point. And, So then I had then I had even a a more pressing reason to think about what the effects of exercise were because I noticed That all the things that were improving in my brain suddenly went away in my my dad's brain. Really, really smart guy. Engineer in, you know, Silicon Valley helped Help that push in Silicon Valley in the seventies happen. He had no more memory.[0:37:24] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: He couldn't focus his attention. His mood was rock bottom. He's a very happy guy, and everything was the opposite in me. And I started thinking, this isn't just something to help, You know, somebody who wants to get tenure, this is something that could help millions and millions of people, most importantly, Our aging population, what if you know, what's happening? And so the thing that makes me wake up in the morning is when I realized that Every single time you move your body, you are, releasing a whole bunch of neurochemicals.[0:38:02] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And some of them, we've talked about that the good mood comes from dopamine and serotonin noradrenaline. But the thing that gets released also, particularly with aerobic exercise, is a growth factor called, brain derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF. And that is so important because what it does is it goes Directly to your hippocampus, and it helps brand new brain cells grow in your hippocampus. We all have that. Even if you're a couch potato, you can get new brain cells in your hippocampus to grow.[0:38:31] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But it's like giving your hippocampus a, a boost with this regular BDNF if you are exercising, Which means that we all have the capacity to grow a bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus. And so what I like to give people is this image of every single time you move your body, it's like giving your brain this wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals. What's going on? I I need my bubble bath of noradrenaline and dopamine and serotonin and growth factors. And with regular bubble baths, what am I doing?[0:39:05] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I'm growing a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus, and I'm not gonna cure my father's Dementia, Alzheimer's, dementia. But you know what? If I go into my seventies with a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus, Even if I have that in my genes and it starts to, kick in, it's gonna take longer for that disease to start to affect My ability to form and retain you long term memories for facts and events, which is my motivation for getting up and doing my 30 to 45 minutes of of aerobic exercise every day.[0:39:36] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. Quick question about your protocol just because, and then I'll we'll Discuss a few mechanistic things related to what signals the body might be sending the brain and a little bit more detail on, BDNF and some circuitry. So you 30 to 45 minutes of it sounds like cardiovascular exercise might be Special.[0:40:01] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[0:40:01] Andrew Huberman: But as I say that, I and I think about the literature that I'm aware of in mice and some in monkeys and certainly in humans, Looking at the effects of exercise on brain function, and, typically, the outcome is improvement almost always. I I don't think I've ever seen a paper showing that when Animals or humans exercise more that their brain gets worse.[0:40:21] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: No.[0:40:22] Andrew Huberman: I just can't think of a single paper. It doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Sure someone will put 1 in the comment section. They'll find that 1, and and thank you for if you can find that. But, but it seems like it's always cardiovascular exercise.[0:40:34] Andrew Huberman: And mentally in a lab. It's a lot easier to get a mouse to run on a treadmill Yeah. Than it is to get a mouse to lift weights. Although people have put little ankle weights on mice and done Yes. The and the ways of getting mice to do resistance work is actually a little bit barbaric because oftentimes, they'll they'll incapacitate a limb to overload another limb.[0:40:50] Andrew Huberman: So it's an asymmetric thing. It's not the same as sending them in to do squats Right. Or deadlifts or something. Yeah. So, but cardiovascular exercise might be Special.[0:41:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. What are your thoughts on that? And please, first, though, tell us your routine. Your routine is 30 to 45 minutes of, Are you a Peloton cycler?[0:41:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Does it matter?[0:41:13] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I think that, the data suggests that as long as your heart rate is getting up For these long term effects on your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, you you also, get better at Shifting and focusing your attention. For that, you need cardiovascular. And what I use is a video workout that I started even before the pandemic. It's called daily burn, And it's just, you know, thousands of different workouts. But I love they are 30 minutes that I sometimes add on a 10 to 15 minute stretch At the beginning or at the end, but, I love the variety.[0:41:47] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Sometimes I do it with weights. Sometimes I do it without weights. I love kickboxing, so they have a lot of kickboxing in there. It just fits my, fits my fits my routine, and it's always there. And I don't have to get All dressed up to go to the gym to, and to to work out.[0:42:04] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So that's that's what I do.[0:42:05] Andrew Huberman: And that's a daily thing. 7 days a week. Yeah. 7 days a week. Fantastic.[0:42:10] Andrew Huberman: So in terms of the the way that some of these changes are are being conveyed from the body to the brain Yeah. That that fascinates me. You know what I mean? As you and I know, and I'm I'm sort of a repeating record on the, podcast always saying, you know, you it you got a brain, but you also have a spinal cord, and then your nervous system connects everything. Yeah.[0:42:27] Andrew Huberman: Every organ in your body is Basically, signal to by the nervous system and back to the nervous system, your spleen, everything. But so let's imagine your morning routine, you you do your cardiovascular exercise. Okay. So you're you're pumping more blood. Mhmm.[0:42:41] Andrew Huberman: That's the definition of a higher heart rate. Stroke volume of the of the of the heart goes up over time. You're getting fitter. So blood flow of the brain is increasing. Do we know how that gets translated to a signal to release more BDNF?[0:42:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You know? And then it raises this other question, which is, does it matter where your mind is when you exercise? Yeah. Because, ultimately, the brain of course, you can anchor your attention to the exercise, or you can be listening to a podcast or something else.[0:43:07] Andrew Huberman: I've always wondered about this. Yeah. Yeah. Can we enhance the effects of exercise by combining the enhanced blood flow With cognitive work during exercise Yeah. Or is it simply a matter of just getting more blood flow up to the hippocampus?[0:43:19] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. I wish I had the answer to that question too. My instinct is, yes. It matters, partially because of the work of your colleague Aliyah Crum on on mindset and the power of that to Change how physiologically our body is responding. So how could it not work in her experiments and or work in her experiments and not work for my my morning or our morning exercise routine.[0:43:47] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So but but Are there studies point to a study? I don't know of 1. So exercise, neuroscientists out there, I'd love to see, you know, that that that study done. So, yes, it works. Before I go into the aerobic thing, I always like to start with The least amount of exercise to get something really useful because I don't want people to say, oh god.[0:44:12] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I hate, you know, Sweating. I don't wanna listen anymore. So so I always like to start with, studies have shown that just 10 minutes of walking outside can shift your mood. That is part of that neurochemical bubble bath that you're getting, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline. And 10 and anybody can walk for 10 minutes.[0:44:34] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And so that is, for all of you thinking that out there, what is the minimum that I could get some of these brain effects? 10 minutes of walking, anybody can do it.[0:44:43] Andrew Huberman: Is outside important? I'm a big believer in getting photons[0:44:46] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[0:44:46] Andrew Huberman: Into the eyes.[0:44:47] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: It, I think that that study was done Indoors on a treadmill. So and and the comparison wasn't done. But moving your which is great. I, You know, some in the middle of the pandemic, I walked around my apartment for 30 minutes sometimes just for some variety. Felt like a rat on a running wheel, but but, yes.[0:45:09] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So so that that minimum amount of movement in your body Can get you the those mood effects. But what about the big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? What about the better performing prefrontal cortex? That's where you start to need the the cardio cardio workout. And from my reading of the literature, there haven't been enough studies, you know, Directly comparing, contrasting kickboxing with running, with, whatever whatever other cardio that you need to do.[0:45:42] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But any cardio workout that is done has these positive effects. So I'm gonna say my interpretation of that Is that whatever way you get your heart rate up, including a power walk, a power walk can get your heart rate up, that that is beneficial. And what is happening, there are 2 pathways that have been studied about how you go from moving your body to more BDNF, that that neurotrophin that's, that's, increasing the growth of new hippocampal brain cells. The 2 pathways are the following. 1 is a myokine, which is Protein released by the muscles.[0:46:17] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So and not your heart. These are striated muscles, in your body. And so by running these these were studies done in rats On running wheels, they showed that the running rats had, more of this myokine released the myokine Past the blood brain barrier, so got into the the, rarified, very protected bloodstream of inside the brain, And that myel kind stimulated the release of BDNF in the brain. That's pathway number 1. Pathway number 2 comes through the liver, because exercise is a stress on generally.[0:46:56] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: How do we know that? Well, Cortisol's released whenever we exercise. It we we need we need, that sugar, in our blood, and so so that's how the physiological, Mechanisms work. And so, there is a, ketone, beta hydroxybutyrate that We've known for a very long time that it gets released by the liver during exercise, and we also know that that particular ketone passes that blood brain barrier, and it's another stimulant for BDNF. So kind of the final common pathway seems to be, BDNF stimulation in the hippocampus.[0:47:34] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Is it the only one? Probably not, but that's the one that has been studied most most clearly. So it's you know, it comes from all of our physiological systems, our muscles working, our liver, responding to the stress of of exercise. And what is it doing? It is making our, you know, giving more BDNF precursors to get into our brain to cause the up Spike of BDNF, which is part of your bubble bath that you're getting every time you move.[0:48:02] Andrew Huberman: I love that description of a factor from muscle and a factor from liver because Anytime we're thinking about movement of the body and translating that to the brain, as you so clearly pointed out, that needs to be True. It needs to traverse the blood brain barrier. Not everything that happens in the body is communicated to the brain. Yeah. And these seem like really important signals.[0:48:25] Andrew Huberman: Beta hydroxybutyrate, you mentioned is a ketone. I just wanna underscore it. That doesn't mean, folks, that you need to be on a ketogenic diet. Think people hear ketone, and they think it you know, I know some people are, most people are not, I imagine. Ketones that are released in your brain and body that can function even if you're, ingesting carbohydrates and not ketogenic.[0:48:46] Andrew Huberman: Just for a point of clarification. This issue of new neurons is one that you hear a lot. Mhmm. You know, neurogenesis. You're gonna grow new neurons, new neurons.[0:48:56] Andrew Huberman: And In my understanding is that the rodent literature is very clear Mhmm. That animals that run on wheels more often, it turns out rodents love to run on wheels. Do you know these studies by Hoppy, Hofstra, which are pretty funny? They're very cool. By the way, Hoppy, Howard Hughes investigator.[0:49:11] Andrew Huberman: I'm not I'm not making light of them. Yeah. They put running wheels in a field Uh-huh. And rote wild rodents will run to the running wheel and run on that running wheel. So there's some they really enjoy it[0:49:24] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[0:49:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Which I find amusing for reasons that probably only a neuroscientist would find amusing. In any case, In rodents, it seems that, running more on a wheel can trigger neurogenesis that literally, the The the birth of new neurons and the addition of new neurons to the hippocampus. In monkeys, this has been controversial. It seems it does happen in the hippocampus and in the olfactory bulb.[0:49:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Probably not in the neocortex. Right. Thinking back to the decades or more of controversy between Liz Gould and Poshko Rakesh, I hope they settled their their differences there. Neuroscientists love to argue.[0:50:00] Andrew Huberman: It's kinda what we do. And In humans, I think it's been a bit controversial. Some people say absolutely yes. Other people say absolutely no. There are new neurons added to the adult brain.[0:50:13] Andrew Huberman: I haven't followed that literature down to the detail. Yeah. But I do remember one study that I don't think is contested, which is the Work of Rusty Gage at the Salk Institute, where they actually injected a a sort of dye type marker into the brains of terminally ill humans Yeah. Who very graciously offered to have their brains removed and dissected after death.[0:50:36] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[0:50:36] Andrew Huberman: And in these in some cases, very old,[0:50:40] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[0:50:40] Andrew Huberman: Terminally ill humans, they did see evidence for new neurons Yes. Being born in the hippocampus.[0:50:46] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Right.[0:50:46] Andrew Huberman: Can I Trust that idea still? Is that, generally accepted?[0:50:50] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Well, so after that study, which was quite a while ago, there are more recent studies, still controversial, but, showing and demonstrating using even new And better techniques than were used in that that original Rusty Gage study, which was groundbreaking at the time, that, that Suggest and, I think, show that there are new neurons born in adult human brains into the 9th decade of life. So they not only did this I think those those patients were in their sixties, then they they died of cancer. But but these new studies, looking across the timeline, can we see because the other thing was, yeah, maybe you have some when you're 20, but by the time you're older and you might need these new neurons, You have no new neuron growth, and so these studies seem to, suggest that, yes, yes, you did. Yes. You do.[0:51:45] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And we all do even into old Age. So yeah.[0:51:49] Andrew Huberman: Great. And, I'll just take a moment to say that I am personally not aware of any studies looking at Other forms of exercise besides cardiovascular exercise for sake of brain health. And this, I think, is an important, gap in the literature that ought to be filled, whether or not, For instance, high intensity interval training or whether or not weight training, which has other effects on the musculature. So you can imagine, perhaps, myokine to BDNF pathway, the pathway one that you mentioned might be signaled, but maybe not the liver pathway. Maybe yes.[0:52:19] Andrew Huberman: I'm speculating here. Those studies need to be done. To my knowledge, they just haven't been done yet. Yeah. And but they should be done.[0:52:27] Andrew Huberman: If you would, could you tell us about some of the more specific effects of exercise on memory. You know, when memory's a broad category of of of effects and phenomena. So things like what comes to mind is short term, medium, and long term memory, reaction time. Mhmm. Learning math, At least for me, it's quite a bit different than, learning history.[0:52:50] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[0:52:50] Andrew Huberman: Although there's certainly overlap in the neural neural underpinnings. What has been demonstrated in the laboratory Yeah. In animal models, but but especially in humans? Yeah. Sure.[0:53:00] Andrew Huberman: And and if you want to Share with us any results from your your lab, published or unpublished, and I'm sure that the audience will be delighted to learn about them.[0:53:07] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Absolutely. Let me start with, kind of the immediate facts, Acute effects, as they're called, of exercise on the brain. So this is asking, what does a one off exercise session do for your brain? And there, there are 3 major effects that have been reproduced. I've seen it in my lab.[0:53:28] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Many labs have reproduced this. So what do you get with a one off? This is usually an aerobic type type exercise session, 30:30 to 45 minutes. What you get is that mood boost, Very, very consistent. You get, you get, improved prefrontal function, typically, tested with a Stroop, test, which is a test that, asks you to shift and focus your attention in specific ways.[0:53:56] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Dependent on the prefrontal cortex largely and, significant improvements in reaction time. So Your your speed at responding, often a motor kind of, but cognitive motor response is is improved. Over the pandemic, one of the unpublished studies that I did looking at the effects of 30 minutes of age appropriate workout, in subjects ranging in age from their twenties all the way up to their nineties. So what are the, The things that I saw most consistently, irrespective of your age, everybody got a decreased anxiety and depression and, hostility score, which is very important. You know?[0:54:41] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So it's it's not just decreasing your anxiety and depression, but decreasing your hostility levels. The world[0:54:47] Andrew Huberman: a better place.[0:54:48] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Making the world a better better place. Energy. The feeling of energy went up. And, what we found is in the older population, even more than in the younger population, we saw improved performance on both Stroop And, Erikson flanker task, which are which is another task dependent on, really focusing in on different Letters and paying attention to what letter is being shown. So so these are consistent effects.[0:55:19] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: How long do they last? One of the studies that I did publish in my lab showed that the immediate effects of exercise lasted up to 2 hours. Unfortunately, that was the longest that we last. They were still there at 2 hours. So that's, you know, that's That's a pretty big bang for your buck.[0:55:35] Andrew Huberman: That is.[0:55:36] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: 1:30 minute.[0:55:37] Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt. I just wanna make sure I understand. So if if when you say the effects lasted up to 2 hours, does that mean Up to 2 hours after you finished exercise or up to 2 hours of memory challenging, Work. But yeah. Just to just to be clear.[0:55:54] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. That's a great question. So, my study looked at, 2 hours after you finish your workout, we gave you these cognitive tests. During that 2 hour period, you were free to do anything except exercise or eat. And so there was no no, extra load on people.[0:56:14] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But 2 hours later, you did do significantly better on these, focused attention tasks, compared to a a a group that, watched videos for for the exercise period. This was an hour of, cycling that they did, these were young young subjects in their twenties.[0:56:31] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So, if I finish my exercise at 9 AM Mhmm. Even if I start this cognitive work, this mental work at 11, I'll still see benefits.[0:56:42] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes. At least by 11 because I didn't go farther than 2 hours, so it could last even longer than that. But but I have evidence that it lasts for 2 hours.[0:56:51] Andrew Huberman: And and perhaps If I had started the cognitive work in 45 minutes after my exercise ended, it would also be helpful. Yes. So there's no reason to think that there's The you have to wait before starting cognitive work.[0:57:02] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: No reason at all.[0:57:03] Andrew Huberman: I'm asking questions of the sort that I get in the comments that we are going to get in the comment section. We always strive for clarity here. So what this tells me is that, exercising early in the day Mhmm. May have a special effect.[0:57:17] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Right.[0:57:17] Andrew Huberman: I realize that some people cannot exercise until later in the evening. Mhmm. But you mentioned something earlier that I wanna cue people to it's very, very important. I don't think I've ever mentioned this on a podcast, which is any kind of physical activity will increase cortisol Mhmm. To varying degrees.[0:57:33] Andrew Huberman: Yes. And so sometimes it's a healthy increase. Sometimes it's an unhealthy increase if you do 2 hours of really intense exercise and you're not prepared for it. Yeah. That's a big spike in cortisol.[0:57:42] Andrew Huberman: Probably not a good thing Yeah. For most people. But if you are going to do your cardiovascular or weight training later in the day Mhmm. That increase in cortisol can promote too much wakefulness for sleep, etcetera. Shifting that cortisol spike early in the day is associated with a number of things related to mood, etcetera.[0:58:02] Andrew Huberman: But more and more, what I'm thinking and hearing is that exercise early in the day is key. Our former dean of the medical School Phil Pizzo[0:58:09] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Uh-huh.[0:58:09] Andrew Huberman: What was and is kind of famous still for, jogging between the hours of, like, 4 and 5 AM or 5 and 6, And then running the medical school. So, and you're up early doing your exercise and cold shower and meditation. We'll talk about meditation. But this is more and more of a push. I I feel like or or a, a stimulus for us to think about moving our exercise earlier in the day.[0:58:33] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. I mean, I like to say that you know, I I know there there are moms and dads out there, and they just say, look. I have a Kid the the kid's more important than my doing my exercise. So you will get benefits if you if you do it whenever whenever you can. So that's great.[0:58:50] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: More power to you. But what all the neuroscience data suggests is the best time to do your exercise is right before for you need to use your brain in the most important way that you need to use it every day. And so that is why the morning, for most of us, is beneficial. That's why I do it in the morning. I'm lucky enough to be able to do that.[0:59:12] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But, yeah, it it it makes sense with all Everything we know about how how this works and how it benefits our brain.[0:59:20] Andrew Huberman: I think about our colleague, Eric Kendall, Not incidentally has a Nobel Prize and studies memory. And Yep. And, rumor has it that he's been a, A swimmer for a lot of years that he put in I think nowadays, he's in his nineties. Now, he'll put in half a mile, but he used to Swim a mile a day or something of that sort?[0:59:41] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I I heard that too, that he was a swimmer, and he does it very, very religiously.[0:59:44] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So there there are a few other neuroscientists that do that. Can think of a lot of neuroscientists that probably should exercise more, and I don't say that to poke at them. I just would love to see them doing their incredible work for many more decades. Yes.[0:59:54] Andrew Huberman: And everything that we're talking about today indicates that if one doesn't Yeah. Unless you have incredible genetics Yeah. We all experience age related dementia. Mhmm. Right?[1:00:05] Andrew Huberman: I mean, the story of your father is a is a a salient one, and we should remember that as we go forward. But also wanna emphasize, I'd love to get your thoughts on just memory and memory loss in general.[1:00:17] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:00:17] Andrew Huberman: It seems we all get worse at remembering and learning things. Mhmm. Even if we don't get Alzheimer's[1:00:23] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:00:24] Andrew Huberman: When does that typically start for for humans?[1:00:27] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: You know, I think there's so much variability, Not only because we are individuals, but because our stress levels are different. And, well, everybody's anxiety level has gone up, in the last in the last couple of years, but that also has an effect. We we don't remember as much in highly stressful, highly anxious situations. So so, you know, As you know, it's hard to answer that question. People say, okay.[1:00:56] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Just tell me how much exercise I have to do. Okay. Just give me[1:00:59] Andrew Huberman: 40 miles per day. But But I love that per day. You know, I've been doing this whole thing of telling people, oh, the data say a 150 to 200 minutes or Of zone 2 cardio, which is kind of, you know, moderately hard, but not excessively hard. But I love this everyday Theme. Yeah.[1:01:16] Andrew Huberman: Because what whenever I do that, the questions that come back are, well, what if I take a long hike on the weekends? Mhmm. And so people start negotiating. There's something that's very powerful about nonnegotiable every day. Yes.[1:01:25] Andrew Huberman: Sun in your eyes every day even through cloud cover. Exercise for 34 Yeah. 45 minutes. Cold shower every day.[1:01:30] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Every day. Yeah.[1:01:33] Andrew Huberman: You know, my understanding of the literature is that somewhere in our fifties or sixties, we start noticing little hiccups in memory. Yeah. For some people, younger. For some people, later. Yeah.[1:01:46] Andrew Huberman: But I have to imagine that doing the exercise throughout one's entire life is going to help offset some of this because you're of the BDNF and other other downstream effects.[1:01:56] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's that's what it suggests. One of my favorite studies. Then I wanna get back to, you wanted you invited me to share some of my unpublished data on the effects of long term exercise.[1:02:08] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But first, I wanna share, one of my favorite studies, which is a longitudinal study, done in Swedish women, And this was published in 2018. And, what they did was back in the 19 sixties, they found, Swedish women 300 sweet Swedish women in their forties, and they characterized them as low fit, mid fit, high fit. Okay? And then 40 years later, they came back and found these women. They let them do live their lives.[1:02:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And they asked what happened to these women as a function of Whether they were low fit, mid fit, high fit in their forties. They're now in their eighties. And what they found was That, relative to the low fit or mid fit women, the women that were high fit Gained 9 more years of good cognition later in life. Now this is not a randomized controlled study. This is a correlational study.[1:03:08] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But does it agree with everything that we've been talking about today? Yes. Does it agree with this idea that, you know, the women that were high fit were giving their brains this this bubble bath? You know, Maybe not every day, but very, very regularly for that entire 40 years, and that built up their big, fat, beautiful hippocampi. Yes.[1:03:28] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: It does. So, it's one of my favorite studies.[1:03:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Another cause for getting the exercise in consistently.[1:03:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[1:03:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And there's those, I am impressed by this 10 minute walk, and the improvements in mood from just a 10 minute walk. Yeah. But, again, I I think that Daily repetition, also, I have to imagine, has effects on the very pathways that allow plasticity. This is something we'd in the realm of neuroplasticity, we don't often hear about or think about even as neuroscientists, which is that the pathways for engaging plasticity probably Can be probably I'm speculating here.[1:04:07] Andrew Huberman: Can be made better by engaging in the sorts of behavior that stimulate In other words, if one gets better calming themselves down under stress, those circuits get better at doing that. Right? There's a neural circuits gain proficiency. Yeah. And so Because blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow in the brain, you can imagine that more pumping of blood to the brain, delivery of These, various muscle and liver factors would also establish larger or more efficient portals to getting that stuff there.[1:04:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So you could imagine a a kind of an amplifying effect of of exercise. And, again, I'm speculating here, but I I've seen this over and over again in colleagues. The ones who exercise consistently Yeah.[1:04:49] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:04:50] Andrew Huberman: Seem to be really, really smart and doing amazing work well into their eighties and nineties.[1:04:54] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Uh-huh.[1:04:55] Andrew Huberman: And the ones who aren't, Some of whom actually pride themselves on how little they exercise. Yeah. They get worse over time. Mhmm. You see them each Meeting each decade, and I'm not poking fun at them at all.[1:05:06] Andrew Huberman: It's actually quite quite hard to see. Yeah. And they're kind of a fading light. They're starting to flicker. Yeah.[1:05:12] Andrew Huberman: So there is this incredible relationship between body vitality and brain vitality. Yeah. That is, of course, is not an excuse for spending all day in the gym. Right. Right?[1:05:20] Andrew Huberman: The gym rats, you know, I'll enjoy working out, so I could imagine doing that. But, but that doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately. You actually have to do the cognitive work also. Right? It's not just exercise.[1:05:32] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Right. Right.[1:05:33] Andrew Huberman: So I'd love to hear about some of these new unpublished data.[1:05:36] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So when I jumped into the exercise work, everybody was studying people 65 or older because that's when cognitive decline begins. And if the idea is exercise can help you with your cognition, then makes sense.[1:05:52] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: However, I thought, well, you know, that it's great. There's lots of work there. I wanted to know what happens in People in their forties and their fifties, maybe even their their thirties and their twenties. Why? Because that's when We as humans are able ready, will willing and able to increase our exercise and, gets us set set up To, you know, build our brains as we go into our sixties.[1:06:20] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And so, the 1st study that I did looked at Low fit participants from their thirties to mid fifties. And we wanted to ask this question, you know, How much exercise you really need to start seeing benefits? Do you see benefits? Or maybe you have to wait until you start seeing cognitive decline To get benefits, that was one of the the theories out there. And so that's what I wanted to do.[1:06:46] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And so what we did was 3 months of 2 to 3 times a week, cardio. It was a spin spin class, so spin classes are great for cardio. And the the comparison group was 2 to 3 times a week of competitive video scrabble. So no heart rate, change, but but they had to come into my lab and And being a group just like they were in a group for the for the, spin class, we tested them cognitively cognitively at the beginning of the end of the session. What we found was 2 to 3 times a week of cardio in these people.[1:07:22] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: They're a low fit, which means, Specifically, that they were exercising less than 30 minutes a week for the 3 months previous to the experiment. So they went from that To 2 to 3 times a week of spin class. And what we found was, changes in baseline rates of their positive mood states went up relative to the video Scrabble group. Their, body image Got more positive because they were exercising, which is great. And really important, their motivation to exercise went up Significantly compared to the video scrabble group, which is which is great.[1:07:59] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So the more you exercise, the more motivated you are to exercise. What about cognition? What changed in the cognitive circuits of their brain? Number 1, we got improved performance on the Stroop task, but, we're headed towards my favorite structure, which is the hippocampus. What we found was improved performance on both A recognition memory task, which was a, a memory encoding task, and, that is, can you can you differentiate, similar items that we're asking you to remember and an spatial episodic memory task where we Had them play one of those doom like games when they went into this spatial maze, and they had to do things in a virtual city.[1:08:45] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Their performance there got better, which is Very, very classically dependent on the hippocampus. So so this I it was so satisfying to To do this study because, I've been wanting to answer this question. What is a minimum amount or doable amount of exercise that will get you these cognitive benefits. And now I can say, in 30 to 50 year olds that are low fit, 2 to 3 times a week. Is that doable?[1:09:15] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Absolutely. Will it be hard if you're low fit? Yeah. It's it's gonna be challenging, but absolutely doable. And so, you know, that that is, it makes sense with all of the all of the, mechanisms that we are I didn't study the mechanisms, just to be clear.[1:09:31] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But with all the mechanisms we are imagining are playing a role here, that absolutely makes sense, and and it is doable. This is not like You have to become marathon runner to get any of these benefits. This is you have to start moving your body on a regular basis 2 to 3 times a week. And I so I I love that for its realness.[1:09:54] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. How long are those sessions again? 45 minutes. 45 minutes.[1:09:58] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: 45 minutes. It's a typical spin, spin kind of class. There's a warm up for 5 minutes and a cool down for 5 minutes, so it's really, 30:35 minutes 35 minutes of you know? And they they're really pushing you. Yeah.[1:10:12] Andrew Huberman: So and so they're breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate heart rate is up.[1:10:16] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Heart rate is definitely up. Yeah.[1:10:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I find that the, all of those results are really interesting. The the result showing improvement in Motivation to exercise Yeah. Is interesting because it gets back to this issue of kind of a self amplifying effect.[1:10:31] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Right.[1:10:32] Andrew Huberman: And, the neuroscientist in me wants to, Think about kind of premotor circuits and the fact that, you know, we have a motor system that can obviously do things like lift cups and walk and run if we want to or need to. But that, it's possible to create a kind of anticipatory activity in our nervous system where Right. Our body craves a certain Stimulus. Mhmm. You mentioned the cold and how you gotta crave the cold.[1:10:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Now whether or not that's the adrenaline and the dopamine Mhmm. Etcetera, or whether or not, somebody who exercises It started going from 0, less than 30 minutes per week to 2 to 3 times a week, 45 minutes as you're you described for this study. I've had that experience before of if I'm the the cardio that's I tend to battle the most, and I my I love lifting heavy objects. Uh-huh.[1:11:22] Andrew Huberman: At least heavy for me. I I'm happy to go to the gym every other day Mhmm. And just lift heavy objects for an hour. It just makes me happy. I like the way it feels.[1:11:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And, I've been doing it since I was in my teens, so 30 years. Cardio is a little bit trickier. I like to run. Mhmm.[1:11:35] Andrew Huberman: But if I stop running for a little while, I find it very hard to get back into. But if I start running 3 times a week for 30 to 45 minutes, and I do this pretty consistently on the days I don't weight train, I find that I start to crave it. It's almost as if my body needs that in order to I always say clear out the cobwebs, but it's like if my mind doesn't function as well Clearly, now I understand why, and why exercise helps. But also my physically, I almost feel like my body needs to engage in that movement. Like, the pre motor circuits Or or kinda revving.[1:12:06] Andrew Huberman: Kinda like revving the engine on your car while it's in park.[1:12:09] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Yeah.[1:12:10] Andrew Huberman: So the motivation to exercise obviously could be Multifaceted. It could be purely psychological. But do you think there's any reason to speculate at least or believe that We can build an anticipatory re reverberatory activity into our nervous system.[1:12:26] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I I agree with that because I also have those same kinds of thoughts, and and I do have Anticipatory exercise when I I can't do it. So I just got back from a week and week and a half in Paris where I got to do a book launch of of my last book, Good Anxiety. And, I I I really I walked around a lot, but I did not do my exercise for that Whole week and a half.[1:12:58] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And, but there was a lot of stress because I had to do all these interviews in French, so I gave myself a break.[1:13:03] Andrew Huberman: You speak French?[1:13:04] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I speak French.[1:13:04] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Say otherwise, it'd be really stressful.[1:13:06] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That would be really stressful.[1:13:07] Andrew Huberman: Then I'd be really impressed. Then then I would definitely start exercising. I would,[1:13:19] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: You know, coming back this direction from from Paris, I I live in New York, is, is much easier, and so I was able to get get up at a normal time the next day. And that exercise session that 1st day is like, okay. I'm back in my home. I'm back in my environment, and it felt so good. It's like I wanted to come back.[1:13:38] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And, and I know it's because I I worked up over years. Now I could truthfully say 7 days a week, But it was you know, first, it was 4 to 5, then it was 5 to 6. And, yeah, 7, But that includes a yoga day or sometimes I have to do it for 10 minutes instead of 30 because I have to leave. But but that habit of you do that Even for 5 minutes, you do either the the the wait 10 minute thing or a 5 minute thing or or a stretch. That is a, tiny habit.[1:14:13] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Who is that somebody at Stanford that invented this idea of tiny habits? I thought it was[1:14:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, we've got a number of people there. There's, and I'm I apologize in advance to all the people I neglect in this statement, but I'm happy to Put it in the comments, folks. BJ Fogg is there. He's done[1:14:30] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes. And That's who I[1:14:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. BJ's done really, great work. And then, James Clear wrote a book about habits and has has a very popular newsletter about habits. We've done an episode about habits that covers some of their, Work and and some of the the more laboratory ish Yeah.[1:14:47] Andrew Huberman: Not ish, laboratory science peer reviewed work on it. Yes. Daily behaviors also, daily behaviors performed Formed at roughly the same time of day. Yeah. I mean, one thing we know for sure is that the circadian system is part of our nervous system's Way of anticipating when things will happen, not just what will happen.[1:15:05] Andrew Huberman: I'm telling you things you obviously Yep. Know already. But for the audience, performing Your exercise at roughly the same time each day Mhmm. Will make it easier Yes. As opposed to just saying, I'm gonna do it 7 days a week sometime today.[1:15:17] Andrew Huberman: Of course, getting it done sometime is better than not getting it done.[1:15:20] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.[1:15:22] Andrew Huberman: Well, those are impressive effects, Jackson, I love that you're starting to look in populations that are a bit younger, not because some of these, older populations aren't important, but I think that Building good habits in across one's entire life is really what it's about.[1:15:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Right.[1:15:37] Andrew Huberman: You as I always say, with anything related to longevity or offsetting an age related decline. Mhmm. We don't know it's hard to know if things work because Right. There's no within subject control. Mhmm.[1:15:50] Andrew Huberman: But what we also know for sure is that you don't want to be the control experiment. Right? Exactly. You absolutely don't wanna be the control experiment, Especially for something that's purely behavioral. I mean, you're not talking about ingesting a particular supplement.[1:16:03] Andrew Huberman: You're not talking about changing your diet in any way, but I am curious. Mhmm. Do you know, diet is a very barbed wire topic on the on the Internet. Which diets, whether or not they work, etcetera. But in general, did in the any of these studies, do they evaluate whether or not people change their eating habits when they start to exercise more?[1:16:23] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. I think I've seen 1 study that that controlled for that, but I feel for them because it's hard enough to get people To exercise at the level and at the time and, you know, that you you need for your study. If you also ask them, okay. Fill out this survey to tell us exactly what you ate all day, they're gonna say forget forget you. I'm not joining your study.[1:16:48] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So, it's a critical question, and, again, there's only been one that I've seen. And and the evidence was that That diets got better when they you know, less processed foods when when they did adhere to this exercise, but lot more information needs to be gathered in that in that realm. The 2nd study that I wanted to share, unpublished, we're we're writing it up right now, is, part 2 of that study that I just described, which was the low fit people. Next, we move to mid fit people. Like, what about us?[1:17:21] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: You know, we're already exercising. How how am I gonna benefit from increasing my exercise? So here again, we collaborated with a great, Spin studio that had a whole bunch of mid fit people that that, by our definition, were exercising, 2 to 3 times a week on a regular basis, that's great. All you people out there that are doing that, you should know you're already benefiting your brain. But our question was, what if we invited them To exercise as much as they wanted at the spin studio for 3 months from, you know, 2 to 3 times all the way up to 7 times a week.[1:17:56] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And let's just see what happened. And the control group, we asked them not to change their exercise. And so what we ended up with was a nice big array of starting with mid fit people That exercise between staying at 2 to 3 times a week all the way up to 7 times a week. And the bottom line from that study is Every drop of sweat counted. That is the more you change and you increase your workout up to 7 times a week, The better your mood was, you had lower, lower amounts of depression and anxiety, higher amounts of good, good affect.[1:18:39] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And the better your hippocampal memory was with the more you worked out. Again, this was for 3 months. So I love that too because it gives power to to those of us that are, you know, regularly exercising and wondering, Do I really need to I mean, is it really gonna help me? And the answer is yes. I mean, not all of us can exercise, go go to a spin class 7 times a week.[1:19:03] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But, I love the message that our body is responsive to that, and and you can get better hippocampal function, better overall Baseline mood affect with with a higher level. So it works for, the mid fit, people as well.[1:19:20] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. The the more I I learn from you, the more I'm starting to conceptualize the brain as an organ that is privileged in so many ways, you know, has this need blood brain barrier, has this incredible quality of being able to predict things, and its job mainly is, of course, to predict things among among other functions, of course. But that our brain isn't necessarily going to stay stable or get better over time, that it needs a signal. Yeah. It that it isn't sufficient to just say that we can't take it for granted, that that our brain is actually an organ that requires a signal in order to maintain its own function.[1:20:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And it sounds like enhanced blood flow and these Pathways that you described earlier, these 2 pathways, are at least, among the more critical signals. I'm Tempted now to move my frequency of cardiovascular exercise from, I confess it's about 3 days 35 minutes lately, and it should be more, to daily. There's something really, again, really special about daily because it's nonnegotiable. Right.[1:20:25] Andrew Huberman: You just do it. Right. And it sounds like if one were to do higher intensity exercise you know, in a spin class, I've never taken a spin class, but I've seen there are times when they're standing up on the bike and pedaling very hard.[1:20:37] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:20:37] Andrew Huberman: That is included in these kinds of workouts. Right? Yeah. Okay.[1:20:40] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I mean, that's what the instructor is doing. I cannot control. Right. We did monitor heart rate, you know, of all the subjects, and it was clearly you know, compared to the video scrabble, it was Hi, Lisa. I would[1:20:54] Andrew Huberman: hope so. Yes. I guess it depends on how intense that game of scrabble is. But, could we just briefly talk about, mindset and affirmations. Yeah.[1:21:04] Andrew Huberman: You've talked a bit, before about, affirmations. And As you mentioned, the the beautiful work of my colleague at Stanford, Aliyah Crum Mhmm. And who we can summarize her work pretty simply, although we won't do it complete justice by already been on the podcast that Yeah. Just to say that one's beliefs about a behavior also impact the outcomes of that behavior. If you learn a lot of True facts about stress being good for you, then you will experience stress as better for you than if you only focus on or learn about negative effects of stress.[1:21:38] Andrew Huberman: If you learn about the positive effects of exercise, you actually derive greater benefit from exercise. Yeah. Believe it or not. It's incredible incredible effects, but they make sense when you understand what the brain is doing, which is a lot of this predictive coding, and mindsets don't seem as mysterious and woo anymore once you understand what the brain is really doing. But what is, if any, the value of Affirmation of telling yourself something positive about yourself or of exercise on not the exercise itself Mhmm.[1:22:10] Andrew Huberman: But on mood, Self image[1:22:12] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:22:12] Andrew Huberman: Memory and brain function.[1:22:14] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. So, you know, I, I I looked into this because I am also a certified exercise instructor, and the form of exercise that I teach is called Intensati. That It's a form of exercise that was developed by this amazing, fitness instructor, Patricia Moreno, and she combined Physical movements from kickbox and dance and yoga and martial arts with positive spoken affirmations. So each move, if you're punching back and forth as you would do in a kickbox Class, you don't just punch. You say something like, I am strong now, which every punch is associated with a word.[1:22:52] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And, you know, you you can, create your own series of affirmations with the moves that you put together. And, the 1st time I did it, I just wandered into her class. I didn't know what it was, and it I felt idiotic. It's like, what I came into the wrong class. I clear I don't wanna come into this class.[1:23:11] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: But then, I saw they didn't care whether I thought they were They look silly saying these not saying yelling these affirmations out loud while doing the choreography at the same time. And then I tried it. You know? Okay. I didn't yell out.[1:23:27] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I kinda whispered it at first. And then but by the end, I was really yelling it out. There's something about the declaration using your own voice of saying things that you, you know, don't often say to yourself. Like, I'm strong. I'm inspired.[1:23:42] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Fired, I believe I will succeed, are all the kinds of affirmations you say. And you walk out of that class or I walked out of that class thinking, I feel really good now. Man, I I can't wait to come back to this class, which is why I ultimately, you know, Took teacher training to to be able to teach that class. And so, I, I started to look into what was known about affirmations, and They were never combined with with physical activity, but it was clear that there was a a literature showing that that, positive affirmations, saying them or reading them, could change mood in the same ways we're talking about, you know, Aaliyah Crum's Work. If you if you have this this it's a belief.[1:24:29] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Once you start saying these things, these are not, you know, difficult things to believe, But it's amazing how much you you don't say these kinds of things to yourself or with your own voice. You might say them about somebody else. Oh, you're you're strong. You you're so smart. Do you say that about yourself?[1:24:47] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And that's the thing about the the self affirmations. It really gets you into a habit of of saying good things about yourself, and then you start to remember, start to realize, oh my god. I'm so mean to myself. I I have lots of negative thoughts going on about about myself in my head, And which is part of the other reason why I loved this this particular form of exercise. So what you get in Intensate is the mood boost from the positive spoken affirmations together with all the other brain and, affect boosts that we've been talking about for this whole, podcast from the exercise because it's a sweaty workout as well.[1:25:32] Andrew Huberman: So Interesting. There's a book. I confess I haven't read it, but I have had the pleasure of having a discussion with a psychologist from I believe he's at University of Michigan. In Ann Arbor, Ethan Cross wrote a book called Chatter, which focuses on, the fact that So much of our inner dialogue, it is indeed negative. He certainly wasn't the 1st to to, point that out, but that Explicit statements to counter that negative chatter, I believe, is one of the hallmarks of of readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually, self image, generally.[1:26:06] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:26:07] Andrew Huberman: And it's a fascinating and and, I think, a very, important area of psychology and neuroscience because, And I and I acknowledge this. We're talking about this 2 laboratory neuroscientists who record from neurons and label neurons and look at stuff down the microscope. We are now deep in the territory, in the deep water of what some of our colleagues and and, people who think about neuroscience would consider, like, really out there on the Kind of subjective edges. Yeah. And yet, I think it's worth pointing out that, you know, the brain does all these things.[1:26:39] Andrew Huberman: Responsible for simple reflexes and motor behaviors, but also high level conceptual, ideas about the universe[1:26:46] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: and[1:26:46] Andrew Huberman: what it might look like in 10 years or a 100 years or a 1000 years, But also high level conceptual understanding of what who we are and what we are about.[1:26:54] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:26:55] Andrew Huberman: And so even though it might seem a little Out on the on the fringes, dare I say, I think that these are some of the more important untried landscapes of neuroscience.[1:27:04] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:27:04] Andrew Huberman: And I I just Wanna acknowledge my appreciation for the fact that I'm gonna connect the dots here and say, you went from somebody who didn't exercise, so went on this rafting trip[1:27:15] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:27:15] Andrew Huberman: That discovered exercise and its benefits for your grant writing, and then and then on and on and on, and then became a certified Yeah. Exercise instructor. Instructor. So so, you don't do anything halfway either as it's clear. I'd like to touch on, something you mentioned earlier, but we haven't, dove into it all in any depth, which is meditation.[1:27:38] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:27:40] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned this tea meditation. You had a a a publication recently on a 10 minute med meditation. Yes. Right? Maybe you could tell us about this 10 minute meditation.[1:27:50] Andrew Huberman: It seems like such a tractable amount of time. Right. And then if you would maybe tell us a little bit about the tea meditation, but Sounds like you've discovered a minimum a close to minimum threshold of meditation that could really benefit us. So Yeah. So maybe you could tell us about that That study?[1:28:07] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So the study was, as you as you, very astutely pointed out, very practical study. Just 10 minutes. Not 30 minutes. Not an hour meditation. That's too hard.[1:28:19] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: 10 minutes guided meditation. They logged into a site, so we can tell that they logged in, and they listened to a, it's a body scan, very basic, but easy to follow kind of meditation. And we asked them to do it how often? Daily, 7 days a week, you know, just 10 minutes a day. And the shock the most shocking thing about this study is that we got more adhesion adherence to the 10 minute daily meditation Then the 10 minute daily podcast listening, which was our control.[1:28:52] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So the highest retention rate I've ever gotten in any, This kind of study that I've done, exercise or meditation, they wanted to do it. 10 minutes a day, it was it was great.[1:29:02] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna just start leading meditations. Yeah. For 3 hours as opposed to doing 3 hour podcast.[1:29:08] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: So, so, we looked at cognitive effects, before and after this, it was 8 weeks of daily it was actually 12 minute meditation, 12 minutes of body scan meditation. And, what we found was significant decreases in stress response. We did the Stryer Stress test to see how how you responded to a unexpected stressful situation. The meditators did much better. Their mood was better, and their, their cognitive performance was also better.[1:29:43] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And this was my first little foray Into meditation after I had started my my personal tea meditation, that That really shifted my relationship with with meditation. And, but but It is consistent with many other studies showing the beneficial effects of, meditation. And but the unique thing was we tried to make it Doable that many, many people out there could actually follow this this typical regimen. And, and so we're we're continuing that. In fact, my my research in my lab right now is all about those doable, short Things that NYU College students will do, not just at the beginning of the semester, but at the end of the semester When the stress and anxiety levels are now at record breaking high levels, and they need something to bring that level down so that they could Show their professors what their brains can actually do.[1:30:49] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: And so it includes very short meditations, sound sound meditations, visual meditations, Walking, things that any college student, but we're obviously focused on NYU students, will do To, and, you know, I wanna get at graduation rates. I wanna get at class performance with these kinds of, interventions. But it started with that study that I just described, meditation.[1:31:17] Andrew Huberman: If you would, and here's where We can highlight this again as some, educated spec highly educated speculation. Yeah. It's coming from you. What do you think is going on during meditation? Yeah.[1:31:29] Andrew Huberman: I mean, so a body scan involves a kind of a interoceptive awareness. Like, you know, interoception, of course, being an attention to what's going on On the surface of and within the confines of our skin as opposed to the outside world. Drawing our attention to anything Inside us or outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex, presumably, and and other things. Typically, eyes are closed. Mhmm.[1:31:52] Andrew Huberman: Typically, it's relaxing. Yeah. So there are a lot of variables that could be feeding into Right. A number of different effects. Yeah.[1:31:58] Andrew Huberman: But but as a neuroscientist[1:32:00] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[1:32:01] Andrew Huberman: What do you think is going on that just that this period of kind of an self induced somewhat unusual state[1:32:09] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[1:32:11] Andrew Huberman: What do you think is going on in terms of network behavior and, networks within the brain that it can have these long term effects? Because we got to some of the ones relate downstream of Mhmm. And I I think there's so much evidence. I know there's so much evidence that meditation is beneficial.[1:32:28] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[1:32:29] Andrew Huberman: How do you think it's working, or what what do you think it's doing?[1:32:32] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. I think that one of the most important things that gets, worked when we are doing a simple 10 minute or 12 minute body scan, meditation regularly, this 10 minutes a day, 12 minutes a day, is, the habit building and the practice of focusing on the present moment. I think that is very hard for us modern humans to do because I'm worrying about the thing that's due, at the end of the week that that I need I need to do and how many hours am I gonna have to be able to do that, or I'm worried about, you know, Whatever the email that wasn't as polite as it should be that I sent, and what were the repercussions for that. Instead of Focusing on this moment, which is fun. I get to talk to you.[1:33:26] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: It's a beautiful day outside. It's, I'm feeling good right at this moment, and I think that those all of the meditative practices, that I've that I've done, And this one also, whether you know it or not, is getting you to focus on on this moment. And I think it's even more important in this day and age where anxiety levels and the next variant Might come out, and what what are the repercussions there? And I have a mother who's older, and she's more susceptible to it, and there's a war, and and what's gonna happen there. Those are all future possibilities, and and we should be worried about that.[1:34:11] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That that is a possibility you need to plan for that, But you also need to focus on this moment right now. I'm I'm healthy. I can breathe. I get to have this interesting conversation right in this moment. If I start thinking about other things, then it takes away from this moment.[1:34:30] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Do I know what circuits are being are involved? Not exactly. That is not my area. I think there are some studies that have have focused on that that Present moment kind of, activity. But that is what I think is most important about about the practice of meditation or one of the important things that calms us down.[1:34:52] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Because if you know how to do that, that gives you this powerful tool For the rest of your day, you're not locked into that fearful future thinking that so many of us have or that that that, just reliving of a terrible past, but you could enjoy enjoy the present moment.[1:35:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I that really resonates. I think that, going back to the earlier part of our conversation, you know, this the hippocampus has this incredible storage capacity And ability to set context about past, present, and future. Yeah. And that's a beautiful thing because as much as I like to think he had some semblance of a healthy life, None of us wanna be Right.[1:35:33] Andrew Huberman: None of us wanna be in the position of not being able to form new memories and have no context to the past or or the present. Yeah. So we're grateful that We should all be grateful that our hippocampus, can draw from past, present, and future in various combinations, and we should support it through the Mhmm. Daily exercise and other, Habits. Let's call them habits so that people make them habits that you've highlighted.[1:35:55] Andrew Huberman: But if we are not deliberately anchoring within past, present, and future according to To what we need Mhmm. And we're just shuffling between past, present, and future, that is not a good way to live. No. It's not effective. No.[1:36:10] Andrew Huberman: It sounds like meditation can really help us, go to the right stacks. I guess people don't go to libraries in anymore. But in in the old days, you would go you need to go to the right location in the library. You actually can't get distracted by the the books that you're interested in if you need to go, just reflexively, if you need to go study a particular topic. That's kind of how I think about it.[1:36:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It makes us more linear perhaps in our Yeah. In our way of being.[1:36:33] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I think so. And it actually counteracts You know, not that I'm against technology, but having our phones and being connected to every Good and bad thing going along going on in the world today is incredibly distracting and and takes you away from the present moment Virtually 24 hours a day, and so we have to work extra hard right now compared to in the forties when we didn't have all this technology or at the same level. So, yeah, it becomes, even more important practice, I think, for for everyday life.[1:37:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Or even 10, 15 years ago, it felt like smartphones weren't as intrusive. Yeah. One final question, and and maybe a, a request.[1:37:18] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Okay.[1:37:19] Andrew Huberman: As the new incoming dean of College of Letters and Sciences. And I must say I'm delighted thrilled, actually, to hear that A lot of the practices that we've been discussing today and that you've pioneered are going to be incorporated into undergraduate education. I I predict and I'd be willing to wager that That will become a template for how universities and non university systems Yeah. Should function. Because if indeed and it it is true that there's this Incredible relationship between physical movement and mental deliberate practices and performance.[1:37:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Any corporation, school, Household would be crazy Yeah. Would be self, you know, self limiting and even self destructive to not incorporate those. So I'm so happy that you're gonna do this and collect data. Please please, we'll have to touch back with you and and hear, what what comes to that.[1:38:09] Andrew Huberman: But one of the the main things that I hear so much about today are issues with attention. Mhmm. And we haven't talked about attention. We've mainly been talking about memory and cognition.[1:38:18] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yes.[1:38:18] Andrew Huberman: But you know a lot about attention.[1:38:20] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[1:38:21] Andrew Huberman: And and here, I'm not being disparaging. I think people have done what I'm about to say as a As a consequence of need and lack of other resources, there's an immense amount of Adderall use, Ritalin use, modafinil use, And caffeine abuse. Now I happen to like caffeine. Mhmm. I I don't use the other compounds I described, but it's just incredible to me How the the data on this, our a colleague of mine at Stanford claims that, you know, something like 2 thirds or more of college students use these Without prescription for ADHD.[1:38:52] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah.[1:38:54] Andrew Huberman: What can we expect In terms of the effects of regular exercise on attention, and are there any other things besides exercise and meditation that you would like to see people do in terms of Trying to increase their powers of attention, because I think the ability to to focus and attend Yeah. Is really the distinguishing feature between those That will succeed in any endeavor and those that won't.[1:39:17] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Mhmm.[1:39:17] Andrew Huberman: And that's a scary thing for a lot of people to hear because a lot of people think they have ADHD. They may, they may not. But I bet that a number of students at both Stanford and NYU feel challenged with holding their attention to the thing that they need to hold their attention to.[1:39:33] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Yeah. So I would say the top 3, tools that everybody, right this minute Today can use to up their capacity to attend where they want to, include exercise, the reasons we've talked about, it has a direct effect on functioning of the prefrontal cortex. Meditation, also clear clinical studies showing improved Ability to to focus and and particularly focus on the present moment. And the third has to be sleep. So sleep is you you can't it's out of the 3, it is the most physiological.[1:40:10] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: I mean, I could I could live my whole life without meditating 1 minute. Could I could I survive without sleep? No. None of us Good. So it's it's it's more basic physiological, but it is so important for all Core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity, including, just, You know, just good good basic brain brain function.[1:40:41] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: That is why it's, you know, it's So critical to get that information, that basic neuroscience information into the heads of these students that are trying their best to Show us how their brain work, but but being hampered because they're not moving enough. They're not Meditating, and, there's all these distracting things that they include in their lives, some of which a little bit is is good, but, You know, 24 hours a day on your phone and and LinkedIn, not LinkedIn, but but linked to your phone, is Damaging to your attention. So exercise, meditation, sleep can help you learn, retain, And perform better than if you do not have these 3 things in your life.[1:41:33] Andrew Huberman: Wonderful. Music to my ears, and also, Either very low cost or zero cost considering that the exercise doesn't require a class. Right. One could do use the, Freely available resource of gravity Right. To, to do jumping jacks or burpees or push ups or whatever Yeah.[1:41:52] Andrew Huberman: Or sit ups or all those information.[1:41:54] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: YouTube, the Really accessible millions of YouTube videos if you don't wanna do your jumping jacks by yourself. I always say this. You know? I I talk about breath meditation in, for my book, Good Anxiety. And, you know, if if you don't like the one that I suggest, there's only about a 1000000 more on YouTube with with ratings from One star to 5 stars, so, use that resource.[1:42:18] Andrew Huberman: It is a wonderful resource. And you're an amazing resource. Wendy, thank you so much for coming here today to have this discussion and share your knowledge about not just existing data, But new data coming coming out soon. And for your leadership in the university system, for your leadership in public education, for the Decades of important work on memory and neural circuitry, which, we've got to learn about today as well. Thank you ever so much.[1:42:48] Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Thank you, Andrew. Fun conversation.[1:42:51] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me today for my discussion about learning and memory and how to get better at learning and remembering with doctor Wendy Suzuki. If you'd like to learn more about doctor Suzuki's work, you can go to wendysizuki.com. There, you will also find titles and links to her popular books as well as our social media handles. We've also placed those in the show note captions.

If you have suggestions about guests or topics that you'd like us to cover on the Huberman Lab Podcast, Or you'd like to give us feedback of any kind, please leave that in the comment section on YouTube. That's the best place to give us feedback.[1:43:37] Andrew Huberman: Please also check out the sponsors mentioned at beginning of today's episode. That's the best way to support this podcast. We also have a Patreon. It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman. And there, you can support the podcast at any level that you like.[1:43:50] Andrew Huberman: On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements. While supplements are certainly not necessary for everybody, Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like accelerating the transition into sleep and getting better, deeper sleep, as well as enhancing focus and learning, and other aspects of human performance and health. We're excited to announce that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements. The reason we partnered with Momentous is several fold. First of all, we wanted to have one location where Huberman Lab Podcast listeners could go in order to find all the supplements that we talk about And to find those in a form where they could systematically try 1 or the other.[1:44:28] Andrew Huberman: This is a real issue in the supplement industry. A lot of supplement brands out there combine different ingredients in ways They don't really allow you to pinpoint exactly what you need and what you don't need. So getting supplements that have Low doses or just the minimal effective dose of particular ingredients and being able to mix and match those ingredients yourself and really establish what's best for you is is really key. In addition, we came to realize that a lot of our listeners want supplements, but they reside outside of the United States. So we're pleased to tell you that Momenta ships both within the US and internationally.[1:45:01] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, Momenta supplements are of the very highest quality ingredients, and the precision of the Cision of the amounts of those ingredients is tightly regulated. If you're interested in momentous supplements, the catalog of supplements related to the Huberman Lab Podcast We're growing all the time. A good number of them are already there. You can go to livemomentous.com/huberman in order to find them, And there will be additional supplements added to that site as we go forward. If you're not already following Huberman Lab on Twitter and Instagram, I post neuroscience and other science related information and tools on a regular basis.[1:45:35] Andrew Huberman: Some of that information overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast, But a lot of it is distinct from the information contained on the Huberman Lab Podcast. So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram and Huberman Lab on Twitter. We also have a neural network newsletter. What that is is a monthly newsletter in which I distill critical points from different podcast episodes, Provide links to useful resources. If you wanna sign up for that newsletter, I should mention it is zero cost, and we do not share your email with anybody.[1:46:02] Andrew Huberman: And we have a very clear privacy policy posted lab.com. Just go to lab.com. Click on the menu. You'll see the neural network newsletter. You can also look at examples of newsletters without having to sign up to make sure You actually do wanna sign up.[1:46:17] Andrew Huberman: But if you are interested, the sign up is there, very easy, and you can receive our monthly newsletter. So once again, thank you for joining me today for our voyage into the neuroscience of learning and memory and tools to get better at learning and memory. And as always, thank you for your interest in
