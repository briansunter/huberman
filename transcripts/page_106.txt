I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Lex Fridman. Doctor Lex Fridman is an expert in electrical and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. He is also the host of the Lex Fridman podcast, initially started as a podcast focused on technology and science of various kinds, including computer science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include Guests and other topics as a matter of focus, including sport.[0:00:40] Andrew Huberman: For instance, doctor Lex Fridman is a black belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu, he's had numerous guests on who come from the fields of Brazilian jiu jitsu, both from the coaching side and from the competitor side. He also has shown an active interest in topics such as chess and essentially anything that involves intense Activation and engagement of the mind and or body. In fact, the Lex Freeman podcast has evolved to take on very difficult topics Such as mental health, he's had various psychiatrists and other guests on that relate to mental health and mental illness, as well as guests focused on geopolitics and some of the more controversial issues that face our times. He's had comedians. He's had scientists.[0:01:22] Andrew Huberman: He's had Friends, he's had enemies on his podcast. Lex has a phenomenal, I would say, a 1 in an 8,000,000,000 ability to find these people, Make them comfortable. And in that comfort, both try to understand them and to confront them and to push them so that we all learn. All of which is to say that Lex Fridman is no longer just an accomplished scientist. He certainly is that, but he has also become one of the more preeminent thought Leaders on the planet.[0:01:51] Andrew Huberman: And if there's anything that really captures the essence of Lex Fridman, it's his love of learning, his desire to share with us the human experience, and to broaden that experience so that we all may benefit. In many ways, our discussion during today's episode captures the many facets of Lex Friedman, although no conversation, of course, Could capture them all. We sit down to the conversation just days after Lex returned from Ukraine where he deliberately placed himself into the tension of that environment In order to understand the geopolitics of the region and to understand exactly what was happening at the level of the ground and the people there, You may notice that he carries quite a lot of both emotion and knowledge and understanding. And yet, in a very classic Lex Fridman way, You'll notice that he's able to zoom out of his own experience around any number of different topics and view them through a variety of lenses So that, first of all, everyone feel included, but most of all, so that everyone learns something new, that is to gain New perspective. Our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media and how that landscape is changing the way that science and technology are communicated.[0:03:00] Andrew Huberman: We also get into the topics of motivation, drive, and purpose, both finding it and executing on that drive and purpose. I should mention that this is episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, and I would be remiss if I did not tell you that there would be no Huberman Lab Podcast were it not for Lex Fridman. I was a fan of the Lex Friedman podcast long before I was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest. And after our 1st recording, Lex was the one that suggested that I start a podcast. He only gave me 2 pieces of advice.[0:03:30] Andrew Huberman: The 1st piece of advice was start a podcast, and the 2nd piece of advice was that I not just make it me blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera. So I can safely say that I at least followed half of his advice And that I am ever grateful for Lex, both as a friend, a colleague in science, and now fellow podcaster for making the suggestion that we start this podcast. I already mentioned a few of the topics covered on today's podcast, but I can assure you that there is far more to the person that many of us know as Lex Fridman. You are somebody interested in artificial intelligence engineering or robotics, today's discussion is most certainly for you. And if you are not, but you are somebody who's interested in world politics, more importantly, the human experience, both the individual and the collective human experience, Leck shares what can only be described as incredible insights into what he views as the human experience and what is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet.[0:04:29] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't.[0:04:52] Andrew Huberman: That means the electrolytes, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are in element in the correct ratios, but it has no sugar. As I mentioned before on the podcast, Electrolytes are critical to the function of every cell in the body and especially the cells in your brain, meaning the neurons or nerve cells. Indeed, the ability for nerve cells to be active and communicate with one another critically depends on sodium, potassium, and magnesium. You can get electrolytes from a variety of sources, But it's often hard to get them in the proper ratios even from food. So if you're somebody who's exercising a lot and sweating or if you're somebody falling, for since a low carbohydrate or even a semi low carbohydrate diet, that will cause you to excrete electrolytes.[0:05:32] Andrew Huberman: I tend to have my element first thing in the morning when I wake up Or within the 1st few hours of waking, anytime while or after I'm exercising or I've sweat a lot, such as exiting the sauna. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink That's l m n t.com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element, l m n t.com/huberman, to claim my free Sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.[0:06:04] Andrew Huberman: Now blood glucose or blood sugar is a critical aspect of your immediate and long term health and indeed Your feelings of vigor and mental clarity and well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know how different foods and food combinations and timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels, you're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels, and what it taught me, for instance, was that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day, but if I eat them at other times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me, for instance, how to space my Exercise and my food intake.[0:06:38] Andrew Huberman: Turns out for me, exercising fasted is far more beneficial. That's something I learned using Levels, and it's completely transformed not just The spacing and timing of my diet and exercise, but also use of things like the sauna and other activities. It's been a tremendous learning for me That's really shaped an enormous number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous with far more mental focus and Slash huberman. Again, that's levels.link/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.[0:07:15] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between Sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely, when we wake up in the morning, that is in large part because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different core body temperatures, and they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night.[0:07:45] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night sleep. I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover about 8 months ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper. I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all, and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have even after the same amount of sleep. If you wanna try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman to save up to $400 off their sleep fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 cover.[0:08:16] Andrew Huberman: 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with doctor Lex Fridman. Welcome back.[0:08:30] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's good to be back in a bedroom. This feels like a porn set. I apologize to open that way. I've never been in a porn set, so I should admit this.[0:08:39] Andrew Huberman: Our studio is being renovated. So here we are for the monumental recording of episode 100 Episode 100. Of the Huberman Lab Podcast, which was inspired by the Lex Freeman podcast. Some people already know this story, but I'll repeat it again. For those that don't, There would not be a Huberman Lab podcast were not for Lex Fridman because after recording, as a guest on his podcast A few years ago, he made the suggestion that I start a podcast, and he explained to me how it works.[0:09:10] Andrew Huberman: And he said, you should start a podcast, but just make that it's not you blabbing the whole time, Andrew, and I only sort of followed the advice.[0:09:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Well, you surprised surprised me, surprised the world that you're able to Talk for hours and cite some of the best signs going on and be able to give people advice without many interruptions or edits or any of that. I mean, that takes an Credible amount of skill that you're probably born with and some of it is developed. I mean, the the whole science community is is proud of you, man. Stanford is proud of you.[0:09:43] Dr. Lex Fridman: So, yeah, it's it's a beautiful thing. It was really surprising because it's unclear how a scientist can do a great podcast That's not just shooting the shit about random stuff, but really is giving very structured good advice that's, Boiling down the state of the art science into something that's actually useful for people. So that that was impressive. It's like, holy shit. He actually pulled this off.[0:10:06] Dr. Lex Fridman: And doing it Every week on a different topic. That I mean, you know, I'm usually positive, especially for people I love and support. But, Damn. I thought there's no way he's gonna be able to pull this all week after week, and it's been only getting better and better and better. I had a whole rant on a recent podcast.[0:10:25] Dr. Lex Fridman: I forget with who of how awesome you are with, Rana El Khalubi. She's emotion recognition person, AI person, and then she didn't know, who you were. And I was like, what the hell do you mean you're and I just wanted this whole rant of how awesome you are. It was it was hilarious. Oh, well.[0:10:43] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm very gratified to hear this. It's a little uncomfortable for me to hear, but listen. I'm I'm just really Happy if people are getting information they like and can make actionable, and it was inspired by you. And look right back at you. I, I've followed a number of your structural formats, attire.[0:11:05] Andrew Huberman: I don't wear a tie. I'm constantly reminded about this by my father who says what he my podcast, and I was like, why don't you dress properly like your friend, Lex? He literally said that, and, to debate that goes back forth, but nonetheless, how[0:11:19] Dr. Lex Fridman: does it feel? Episode 100. How does it feel?[0:11:22] Andrew Huberman: You know, I think Can you[0:11:23] Dr. Lex Fridman: imagine you're you're here? You hear after so many episodes and done so much. I mean, the number of hours is just insane. The amount of passion, the amount of work you put into this, What's it feel like?[0:11:36] Andrew Huberman: It feels great, and it feels very much like the the horizon is Still at the same distance in front of me. You know, every episode, I just try and get information there. And the process we talked about in your podcast, we won't go into it of, collecting information, distilling it down to some simple notes, walking around, listening to music, trying to, you know, figure out what the motifs are. And then As just like you, I don't use a teleprompter or anything like that. There's very minimal notes.[0:12:02] Andrew Huberman: So it feels great, and I love it. And, again, I'm just grateful to you, for inspiring it, and I just wanna keep going and do more of it. And I should say, I am also relieved That we're sitting here because you recently went overseas to a very, intense War zone, literally, to Ukraine. And, the entire time that you were there, I was genuinely concerned. You know, the world's a Unpredictable place in general, and, we don't always get the only vote in what happens to us.[0:12:36] Andrew Huberman: So first of all, welcome back Safely, 1 piece, 1 alive piece. And, what was that like? I mean, at a at a broad level, at a specific level, What drew you there? What surprised you? And, how do you think it changed you in in coming back here?[0:12:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think there's a lot to say, but first, it is really good to be back. One of the things that when you go to a difficult part of the world or a part of the world that's going through something difficult, You really appreciate how great it is to be an American. Everything. The easy access to food. Despite what people think, the, stable, reliable rule of law, the lack of corruption in that You can trust that if you start a business or if you take on various pursuits in life, that there's not going to be at Scale, manipulation of your efforts such that you can't succeed so that this kinda, you know, capitalism in its in its, the ideal of capitalism is really still burning bright in this country, and it really makes you appreciate those aspects.[0:13:48] Dr. Lex Fridman: And also just the, ability to have a Home for generations across generations. So you can have, your grandfather live in, I don't know, Kentucky in a certain city, and then, his children live there, and you live there, and then you it just continues on and on. That's the kind of thing you can have when you don't have war because war destroys entire communities. It it destroys the history's generations, like, life stories that stretch Across the generations.[0:14:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. I didn't even think about that until you said just now, but photographs, hard drives get destroyed or just abandoned. Right? Libraries.[0:14:30] Andrew Huberman: I mean, nowadays, things exist in the cloud, but there's still a lot of[0:14:33] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[0:14:34] Andrew Huberman: Material goods that have, you know, are irreplaceable. Right?[0:14:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, Even, you know, in in rural parts of the United States, they don't exist in the cloud. Right? A lot of people still well, even in towns, they still love The physical photo album of your family. A lot of people still store their photographs of families in the store the, VHS tapes and all that kind of stuff. Yeah.[0:14:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: But I think there's so many things I've learned and really felt the lessons. One of which is nobody gives a damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of stuff. Your house is gone. The thing time and time again I saw for people that lost everything is how happy they are for the people They love the the friends, the family that are still alive. That's the only thing they talk about that, in fact, They don't mention, actually, with much dramatic, sort of vigor about the trauma of losing your home.[0:15:36] Dr. Lex Fridman: They're just nonstop saying how How lucky they are that person x, person y is still here, and that makes you realize that when you lose everything, it's still it makes you realize what really matters, which is the people in your life. I mean, a lot of people kinda realize that later in life when you're facing mortality, when when you're facing your death, Or, you know, you get a cancer diagnosis, that kind of stuff. I think people here in America, in California was with the with the fires, You, you could still lose your home. You realize, like, nah. It doesn't really matter.[0:16:08] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's a pain in the ass, but what matters is still, the The family, the people, and so on. I I think the most intense thing I talked to several 100 people, some of which is recorded. I've really been struggling to put that out because I have to edit it myself. And so it's you're talking about 30, 40 hours of footage[0:16:30] Andrew Huberman: And it is emotionally struggling. Yes.[0:16:32] Dr. Lex Fridman: Is extremely struggle. Is extremely difficult. So I talked to a lot of politicians, the number 2 in the country, number 3. I'll be back there to talk to the president, to do a 3 hour conversation. Those are easy to edit.[0:16:43] Dr. Lex Fridman: You know? They're, they're really heartfelt and thoughtful folks From different perspectives on the geopolitics of the war, but the ones that's really hard to edit is like grandmas that are, like, in the middle of nowhere. They lost everything. They still have hope. They still have love.[0:16:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: And some of them have some of them many of them, unfortunately, have now hate in their heart. So in February when, Russia invaded Ukraine, this is the thing I realized about war. One of the most painful one lessons is that war creates generational hate. It you know, we sometimes think about war as a thing that kills people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, Injures people, but we don't directly think about the, the secondary and tertiary effects of that which last Decades, which is anyone who's lost a father or a mother or a daughter or a son, They now hate the not just the individual soldiers or the leaders that invaded their country, But the entirety of the people. So it's not that they hate, Vladimir Putin or hate The Russian military, they hate Russian people.[0:18:04] Dr. Lex Fridman: So that tears the fabric of a thing that, For me, you know, my my half my family is from Ukraine, half of my family is from Russia. But there's a I remember The pain, the triumph of World War 2 still resonates through my entire family tree. And so you remember when the Russians and Ukrainians fought together against this Nazi invasion, you you remember a lot of that. And now to see the fabric of this, peoples torn apart completely with hate is very really, really difficult for me just to Realize that things will just never be the same on this particular cultural historical aspect, but also There's so many painful ways in which things will never be the same, which is we've seen that it's possible to have a major hot war in the 21st century. I think a lot of people are watching this.[0:19:02] Dr. Lex Fridman: China is watching this. India is watching this. United States is watching this and thinking We can actually have a large scale war, and I think the lessons learned from that might be The kind that lead to a major World War 3 in the 21st century. So, like, one of the things I realized watching the whole scene is that we don't know shit about what's gonna happen in the 21st century, and it might we kinda have this intuition. Like, surely, there's not gonna be another war.[0:19:33] Andrew Huberman: It will just coast.[0:19:34] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pandemic. Yeah.[0:19:37] Andrew Huberman: Back to normal.[0:19:38] Dr. Lex Fridman: Back to normal. That is. But you have to remember, At the end of World War one, you know, as, Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars, nobody in a, Ironically, in a dark way, it was also the the roaring twenties when people believed this. There will never be another World War. And 20 years after that, the the rise of Nazi Germany, the a charismatic leader that captivated the minds of 1,000,000 build up a military that can take on the the whole world.[0:20:11] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so it makes you realize that this is still possible. This is still possible. And then the the tension, you you see the this, the media machine, the propaganda machine that I've gotten to see every aspect of, It's still fueling that division between America and China, between Russia and India. And then Africa has a complicated thing that's trying to figure out who are they with, who are they against, and just this tension is building and building. And, like, he makes you realize, like, we might the thing that might shake Human civilization may not be so far off.[0:20:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: That that's a realization you get to really feel. I mean, there's all kinds of other lessons, and one of which is propaganda. As I got to, I get a lot of letters, emails, and, some of them are full of really intense language, full of hate from every side toward me. What well, the hate is towards me as representing side x, And x stands as a variable for every side. So either I'm a Zelensky show or I'm a Putin show Or I'm a NATO show or I'm an America, America show American Empire show Or I'm a a democrat or a republican because it's already been in this country politicized.[0:21:44] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think There's a sense of Ukraine is this place that's full of corruption. Why are we sending money there? I think that's kind of the messaging on the on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, I'm not even keeping, track of the actual messaging and the conspiracy theories and and the narratives, but they are The tension is there, and I get to feel it directly. And what you get to really experience is there's a large number of narratives that all are extremely confident themselves that they know the truth.[0:22:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: People are convinced, First of all, that they're not being lied to, people in Russia think there's no propaganda. They think that, yes, yes, there is, like, State sponsored propaganda, but we're all smart enough to ignore the the, the sort of Lame propaganda that's everywhere. They know that we can think on our own. We we know the truth. And everybody kinda speaks in this way.[0:22:42] Dr. Lex Fridman: Everybody in the United says, well, yes, there's mainstream media. They're full of messaging and propaganda, but we we're smart. We can think on our own. Of course, we see through that. Everybody says this, and then the conclusion of their thought is often hatred towards some group, whatever that group is.[0:23:00] Dr. Lex Fridman: And the more you've lost, the more intense the the feeling of hatred. It's a really difficult Field to walk through calmly and with an open mind and and try to understand what's really going on.[0:23:16] Andrew Huberman: So it's Super intense. That's the only words that come to mind, as I hear this. You mentioned something that it seems that hate generalizes. You know? It's against An entire group or an entire country, why do you think it is that hate generalizes and that love May or may not generalize.[0:23:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: I've had so one of the as you can imagine, The kind of question I asked is, do you have love or hate in your heart? It's a question I ask almost everybody, And then I would dig into this exact question that you're asking. I think some of the most beautiful things I've heard, which is People that are full of hate are able to self introspect about it. They they know they shouldn't feel it, but they can't help it. It's not they know that, ultimately, the thing that helps them and helps everyone is to feel love for fellow man, But they're they've they can't help it.[0:24:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: They know it's like a drug. They say, like, hate, escalates. It's like a vicious spiral. You just can't help it. And the question I also asked is, do you think you'll ever be able to forgive Russia?[0:24:33] Dr. Lex Fridman: And After much thought, almost it's, it's split, but most people will say no. I will never be able to forgive.[0:24:46] Andrew Huberman: And because of the generalization you talked about earlier, that could even include all right all Russians. They mean all Russians.[0:24:52] Dr. Lex Fridman: Because because if you do nothing That's as bad or worse than, than than being part of the army that invades. So the the people that are just sitting there, the good Germans, the people that are just quietly going on with their lives, you're just as bad, if not worse, is their perspective.[0:25:18] Andrew Huberman: Earlier, you said that, going over to the Ukraine is now allowed you to realize just So many of the positives of being here in the United States. I have a good friend. We both know him. I won't name him by name, but we've Communicate the 3 of us from tier one special operations. He spent years doing deployments, really, amazing individual.[0:25:41] Andrew Huberman: And I remember when the pandemic hit, He said on a text thread, you know, Americans aren't used to the government interfering with their plans. You know, around the world, many people are dramatically interfering with their plans, sometimes what even in a seemingly random way. Here, we were not Braced for that. There I mean, you know, there there we get speeding tickets and there's, you know, lines to vote and things like that. But, I think the pandemic was one of the first times, at least in my life, that I can remember where it really seemed like the government was impeding what people naturally wanted to do, and that was a shock for people here and, I have a, what might seem like a somewhat mundane question, but it's something that I saw on social media.[0:26:26] Andrew Huberman: A lot of people were asking me to ask you, And, and I was curious about too, what was a typical day like over there? Were you sleeping in a bed? Were you sleeping on the ground? Everyone seems to wanna know what were you eating. Were you eating once a day?[0:26:40] Andrew Huberman: Were you eating your steak? Or were you were you in fairly deprived conditions over there? I saw a couple Photos that you posted with, out of doors, in front of rubble, with pit helmet on in one case, you know,[0:26:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: What what was[0:26:57] Andrew Huberman: a typical day like over there?[0:27:00] Dr. Lex Fridman: So there's there's 2 modes. One of them, I spend a lot of time in Kyiv, Which is much safer than, it may be obvious to state, but for people who don't know, it's in the middle of the country, And it's much safer than the actual front that the where the battle is happening. So the much, much safer than Kyiv even is Lviv, which is the western part of the country. So the times I spent in Kia were fundamentally different than the time I spent at the front. And I went to the Kherson region, Which is where a lot of really heated battle was happening.[0:27:36] Dr. Lex Fridman: There's several areas. So there's Kharkiv. It's in the northeast of the country. And then there's Donbas region, which is east of the country. And then there's Kherson region, which, by the way, I'm not good at geography.[0:27:48] Dr. Lex Fridman: So, is the southeast of the country, and that's where at least when I was there, it was a lot of really heated fighting happening. So when I was in the Kherson region, there's You know, it's what you would imagine. The place I I stayed at a hotel where all the lights have to sit stay off to the entire town. All the lights are off. You have to kinda navigate through the darkness and then use your phone to shine and so on.[0:28:16] Andrew Huberman: This is terrible for the circadian system.[0:28:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. That's exactly how is this. How can I do this? Where's my element in the flooded greens? How can I function?[0:28:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: No. There's, I think it was balanced by the deep appreciation of being alive.[0:28:32] Andrew Huberman: Right. No. I had I mean, this is the reason I asked. This is the reason I asked is, you know, we We get used to all these creature comforts.[0:28:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes.[0:28:40] Andrew Huberman: And, we don't need them, but we often come to depend on them in a way that makes us feel like we need them.[0:28:47] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. But very quickly, there's something about the intensity of life that you see in people's eyes because they're living through war that makes you forget all those creature comforts. And it's it was actually, you know, I'm somebody who hates traveling and so on. I love the creature habits. I love I love, the comfort of the ritual.[0:29:09] Dr. Lex Fridman: Right? But All of that was forgotten very quickly. Just the the intensity of feeling, the intensity of love that people have for each other, that was that was obvious. In terms of food, so there's a curfew. So depends on what part of the country, but, usually, you basically have to scammer home at, like, 9 PM.[0:29:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: So the hard curfew in a lot of places is 11 PM at night, but by then, you, like, You have to be home. So, in some places, it's 10. So you at 9 PM, you start, going home, which for me was was kind of wonderful Also, because I get to spend, I get to be, forced to spend time alone and think for many hours In, wherever I'm staying, which which is really nice. And, everybody, there's a calmness and a quietness to the whole thing. In terms of food, once a day, just, the food is incredibly cheap and incredibly delicious.[0:30:10] Dr. Lex Fridman: People are still one of the things they can still take pride in is Making the best possible food they can. So meat but they do admire American meat, so the meat is not as great as it could be in that country. But I ate borscht everyday, you know, all that kind of stuff. Mostly meat. So spend the entire day, wake up in the morning with Coffee, spend the entire day talking to people, which for for me is very difficult because of the intensity of the stories, one after the other after the other.[0:30:42] Dr. Lex Fridman: We just Talk to regular people, talk to soldiers, talk to politicians, all kinds of soldiers. I talked to People there who are doing rescue missions, so Americans. I I hung out with, Tim Kennedy.[0:30:58] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I'm great, Tim Kennedy.[0:31:00] Dr. Lex Fridman: The great Tim Kennedy who, also him and many others revealed to me One of the many reasons I'm proud to be an American is how trained and skilled and, Effective American soldiers are.[0:31:19] Andrew Huberman: I guess for for listeners to this podcast, maybe we should familiarize them with who Tim Kennedy is because I realized that a number of them will know.[0:31:25] Dr. Lex Fridman: How do you do that? How do you try to summarize a man?[0:31:28] Andrew Huberman: Right. In in, let's we can be accurate, but not exhaustive as as any good, good data are Accurate but not exhausted. Very skilled and accomplished MMA fighter, very skilled and accomplished former special operations. Remember, American patriot and, podcaster too. Right?[0:31:47] Andrew Huberman: Does he have his own podcast?[0:31:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: Maybe. Okay. Maybe.[0:31:51] Andrew Huberman: We know Andy Stumpf has his own podcast.[0:31:53] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. It's an amazing podcast.[0:31:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Timmy is great. Yeah. Clearing hot podcast with Andy Stoneman.[0:31:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: But also Tim Kennedy is, like, the embodiment of America into the the most beautiful and the most ridiculous degree. So he's like, would you imagine, what is it? Team America? That, Like, I just imagine him, like, shirtless on a tank rolling into anime territory, just screaming at the top of his lungs. That's Just his personality.[0:32:21] Andrew Huberman: But not posturing. That's it. He actually he actually does the work as they say. So this[0:32:25] Dr. Lex Fridman: is the thing. He really embodies that. Mhmm. Now Some of that is just his personality and humor. I'd like to sort of comment on the humor of things, not just with him.[0:32:34] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's very one other interesting thing I've learned. But, also, when he's actually helping people, he's extremely good at what he does, which is building teams that rescue, that go into the most dangerous areas of Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, and they get the job done. And But one of the things I heard time and time again, which what's really interesting to me that Ukrainian soldiers said that, You know, comparing Ukrainian, Russian, and American soldiers, American soldiers are the bravest, Which was very interesting for me to hear given how high the morale is for the Ukrainian soldiers, but that just reveals that training enables you to be brave. So it's not just about how well trained they are and so on. It's how intense and ferocious they are in the fighting.[0:33:23] Dr. Lex Fridman: And it makes you realize, like, this is American Army, Not just through the technology, especially the special special force guys. They still is one of the most effective and terrifying armies in the world. And I'm listen. Just for context, I'm somebody who's, for the most part, antiwar, a pacifist, but you get to see, you know, some of the realities of work kinda wake you up to what needs to get done to protect sovereignty to protect some of the values, to protect civilians in homes and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes, You know, war has to happen.[0:34:04] Dr. Lex Fridman: And I should also mention on the Russian side because, well, I haven't gotten to experience the Russian side yet. I do Fully planned to travel to Russia. As I've told everybody, I was very upfront with everybody, about this. I I would like to hear the story of Russians, But I do know from the Ukrainian side, like, the grandmas I love grandmas. They told me stories that the Russians really the ones that Enter their villages.[0:34:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: They really, really believe they're saving Ukraine from Nazis, from Nazi occupation. So they feel that there's the, Ukraine is under control of Nazi organizations, and they're They believe they're saving a country that's their brothers and sisters. So I think I think propaganda and I think, truth is a very difficult thing to arrive in in the in that war zone. I think in the 21st century, one of the things you realize that so much of war, even more so than in the past, is an information war. And, people that just use Twitter for their source of information might be surprised to to know how much misinformation there is on Twitter.[0:35:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: Like, real, narratives being sold. And so it's really hard to know who to believe. And Through all of that, you have to try to keep an open mind and ultimately ignore the powerful and listen to actual citizens, actual people. That's the other maybe obvious lesson is that, war is waged by powerful rich people, And it's the poor people that suffer, and that's just visible time[0:35:48] Andrew Huberman: and time again. You mentioned the fact that People still enjoy food or the pleasure of cooking or there's occasional humor or maybe frequent humor. You know Jocko Willink has talked about this in in warfare and the That the all the elements of the human spirit and condition still emerge at various times. Find this amazing, and you and I have had conversations about this before, but the the aperture of the mind, you know, you know, the the Classic story that comes to mind is, you know, the one of Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela. You know, you put somebody into a small box of confinement and Some people break under those conditions, and other people find, entire stories within a Centimeter of concrete that can, you know, occupy them and and real stories and richness or humor or love or Fascination and surprise, and I find this so interesting that the mind is so adaptable.[0:36:45] Andrew Huberman: You know, we talked about creature comforts and then lack of creature comforts and the way that, we can adapt and and yet humans are always striving, it seems, or one would hope for these better conditions to better their conditions. So as you've come back And you've been here now back in the in the States for how long after your trip?[0:37:03] Dr. Lex Fridman: Depends on this podcast release, but it it, felt like I've never left. So, Practically speaking, a couple months. K.[0:37:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And we won't be shy. We're recording this mid September. So, we[0:37:15] Dr. Lex Fridman: we actually recorded this several years ago, So we're we're anticipating the future.[0:37:19] Andrew Huberman: This is where we're gonna start telling you this is a simulation, you and Joe. I'm still trying to figure out what that actually means. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG One, Is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.[0:37:44] Andrew Huberman: The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are Optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, And it tastes great.[0:38:19] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman, and they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make Really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d 3 k 2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d three k two. I know I speak for many people when I say that We are very happy that you're back. We know that's not gonna be the 1st and last trip that there will be others, and that you'll be going to Russia as well and and presumably other places as well, in order to explore, and I have to say as a podcaster and as your friend, I was really inspired that your sense of adventure, and your sense of not just adventure, but thoughtful, respectful adventure, you understood what you were doing. You weren't just going there some wartime footage or something.[0:39:13] Andrew Huberman: This wasn't a kick or a thrill. This is really serious and remain serious. So thank you for doing it. And, Please, next time you go, bring Tim Kennedy, again or[0:39:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: I feel like I feel like Tim Kennedy gets you into We'll we'll take it because he really loves going to the most dangerous places Mhmm. And helping people. So I think he'd get me into more trouble than his worth. And I should mention that I I mean, there's many reasons I went, but it's definitely not something I take lightly or want to do again. Right.[0:39:45] Dr. Lex Fridman: So I'm doing things that I don't want to do. I just feel like I have to. You're compelled. So I don't think there's now I'll definitely talk about it as we all should. There's different areas of the world that are seeing a lot of Frank, Yemen, there there's so many atrocities going on in the world today, but this one is just, personal to me, so I want to I feel like I'm qualified just because of the language.[0:40:10] Dr. Lex Fridman: So most of the talking by the way, I've been I was doing it. It was in Russian. And so because of the language, because of the my history, I felt like I have to do this particular thing. I think it's in many ways stupid and dangerous, And that was made clear to me, but I do many things of this nature because the heart says pulls, Post towards that. But, also, there's a there's a freedom to not you know, I'm afraid of death, but I think there's a freedom To, it's almost like, okay.[0:40:44] Dr. Lex Fridman: If I die, I want to take full advantage of not having a family currently. I feel like when you have a family, you there's a responsibility for others, so you immediately become more conservative and careful. I feel like I I want to take full advantage of this particular moment in my life when you can be a little bit more accepting of risk. So Well,[0:41:06] Andrew Huberman: you should definitely reproduce at some point. Maybe before next time, you should just freeze some sperm. Really? Is that is that what you[0:41:14] Dr. Lex Fridman: do with the ice bath? Is that how that works?[0:41:16] Andrew Huberman: You know, it's interesting. Here's a there's always an opportunity to do some, science protocols. You know, there there are products on the Internet, and there are actually a few decent manuscripts looking at how cold exposure can increase Testosterone levels. But it doesn't happen by the cold directly. Good scientists, as the authors of those papers were and are, Realize that it's the vasoconstriction and then the, vasodilation.[0:41:42] Andrew Huberman: You know, as it as people warm up again, there's increased blood flow to the testicles. And in women, it seems there's probably increased blood flow to the reproductive organs as well after people warm back up. So that seems to cause some sort of, hyper nourishment of the Now the various cells, the, sertollian leydic cells of the testes that lead to increased output of testosterone and in women, testosterone as well. So, the cold exposure, in any case, is obviously a do do you do the ice bath? Are you into that?[0:42:11] Dr. Lex Fridman: I have not done my As[0:42:12] Andrew Huberman: a Russian, you probably consider that a hot tub.[0:42:15] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. It's it's a nice thing to, have fun with every once in a while, to warm up. No.[0:42:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: I haven't done that. I've been kinda waiting to maybe do it together with you at some point.[0:42:25] Andrew Huberman: Great. Like,[0:42:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: because we have a guide.[0:42:28] Andrew Huberman: No. We have one here. It'll be Straightforward for you. I always say that the adrenaline comes in waves. And so if you just think about it walls, like you're going through a number of walls of adrenaline as opposed to going for time, Becomes rather trivial.[0:42:38] Andrew Huberman: With your jujitsu background and whatnot, you'll immediately recognize the physiological sensation even though it it's cold. Specifically, it's the adrenaline that makes you wanna hop out of the thing.[0:42:47] Dr. Lex Fridman: And, you've seen Joe's. So Joe set up a really nice Mhmm. Man cave, Or it's it's not even a cave because it's so big. It's like, a network of man caves, but it has, ice bath and a sauna Next to each other. So[0:43:03] Andrew Huberman: And we have one of those here, ice bath and sauna. So we'll have to get you in it when, one of these days. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow. No.[0:43:10] Andrew Huberman: Although there is a A, I don't know the underlying physiological basis, but there does seem to be a trend toward truth telling in the sauna. Some people refer to them as truth barrels. Mine's a barrel sauna shaped like a barrel. Who knows why? Maybe under intense heat duress, people just, Feel compelled to share.[0:43:27] Andrew Huberman: They[0:43:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: I have a complicated relationship with saunas because of all the weight cutting. Oh, so Some of the deepest suffering, route I've done was in Asana. It's very it's I mean, I've gone to some dark places in Asana because I I mean, I wrestle my whole life, judo, jujitsu. Right. And those weight cuts, can really test the mind.[0:43:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: So you you're and truth telling. Yeah. It's a certain kind of true telling because you're sitting there and the clock moves slower than it has ever moved in your life. Yeah. So I usually, for the most part, I would try to, you know, have a bunch of sweats, garbage bags, and all that kind of stuff and run.[0:44:08] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's easier because you can distract the mind. In the sauna, you can't distract the mind. It's just you and all the excuses and all the The all the weaknesses in your mind is just coming to the surface, and you're just sitting there sweating or not sweating. That's the worst.[0:44:22] Andrew Huberman: And talk about visual aperture. You're in a small box, it also inspires some claustrophobia even if you're not claustrophobic. That's absolutely true. And the desire to just get out of the thing is where the you get a pretty serious adrenaline surge from from in the sauna as well. It, now the sauna actually Well, it won't deplete testosterone, but it kills sperm.[0:44:44] Andrew Huberman: So for people that sperm on a 60 day sperm cycle. So if you're trying to Donate sperm or because that's what got us onto this or fertilize, an egg or eggs in whatever format, dish or in vivo as we say in science. That which means, Well, you can look it up, folks. The 60 day sperm cycle so if you go into a really hot sauna, or a hot bath or a hot tub, yours in 60 days, those sperm are going to be, a significantly greater portion of them will be dead, will be nonviable. So there's a simple solution.[0:45:16] Andrew Huberman: People just put ice pack down there, or, you know, a jar, not this jar, but, a jar of cold fluid, you know, between their legs and just, you know, sit there and or they go back and forth between the ice bath and the sauna. But, yeah, you probably if you're gonna go back over there, you should Free sperm. We're gonna do a couple episodes on fertility when it's relatively inexpensive. And you're young, so you should probably do it now because there is a, association with autism is, males get older. It's not a strong one.[0:45:43] Andrew Huberman: It's significant, but it's still a small contribution to the autism phenotype.[0:45:47] Dr. Lex Fridman: As you age, don't sperm get wiser There are no. There's no science to back that.[0:45:52] Andrew Huberman: No. But, you know, men can conceive healthy children in a considerable age. But, In any case, but no. They don't get wiser.[0:45:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's like What happens is interesting age stake.[0:46:02] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's a little bit like, like the maturation of the brain in the sense that some of the sperm get Much better at swimming, and then many of them get get less good. Motility is a is a strong correlate of the DNA of the sperm.[0:46:12] Dr. Lex Fridman: This is probably a good time to announce that I'm selling my sperm as an NFTs. I wanted to see how much that Oh my goodness. Writing the,[0:46:21] Andrew Huberman: well, your children, your future children, and my future children are supposed to do Jujitsu together since I've only done the 1 jujitsu class. So, I'm strongly vested in, you having children Yes. But only in the friendly kind of way.[0:46:36] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind of way. Yeah. Dominance Right. Of the clan.[0:46:41] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yep. For sure.[0:46:45] Andrew Huberman: So moving on to science, but still with our minds in the Ukraine, Did you encounter any scientists or see any universities? Or, you know, as we know in this country and in Europe and elsewhere, you know, science takes infrastructure. You need buildings. You need laboratories. You need robots.[0:47:04] Andrew Huberman: You need a lot of equipment, and you need, Minus 80 freezers, and you need incubators, and you need money, and you need technicians. And typically, it's been the wealthier countries that have been able to do more research for sake The research and development of of and privatization. Certainly, the Ukraine had some marvelous universities and marvelous scientists. What's going on with science and science scientists over there? And, and, gosh, can we even calculate the loss of Discovery that is occurring as a consequence of this conflict.[0:47:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: So science goes on. The before the war, Ukraine had a very vibrant tech sector that which means engineering and all that kind of stuff. And Kyiv has a lot of excellent universities, and they still go on. The the biggest hit, I would say, is not the infrastructure of the science, but the fact because of the high morale, everybody is joining the military. So everybody is going to the front to fight, including, you know, you, Andrew Huberman, would be fighting, and not because you have to, but because you want to.[0:48:14] Dr. Lex Fridman: And everybody you know would be really proud that you're fighting even though everyone tries to convince, you know, Andrew Huberman, you have much Better ways to contribute. There's deep honor in fighting for your country. Yes. But there are better ways to contribute to your country than just Picking up a gun that you're not that trained with and going to the front, still, they do it. The scientists, Engineers, CEOs, professors, students Men and women.[0:48:44] Dr. Lex Fridman: Actors. Men and women. Obviously, primarily men, But men and women, like, much more than you would see in in other militaries. Women are everybody. Everybody wants to fight.[0:48:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: Everybody's proud of fighting. There's no discussion of, of kind of pacifism. Should we be fighting? Is this right? Is this you know?[0:49:06] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's everybody's really proud of fighting. So that that's a so there's this kind of black hole that pulls everything, all the resource into the war effort that's not just financial, but also, psychological. So it's like, if you're a scientist, it feels like well, It feels like, almost like you're dishonoring humanity by Continuing to do things you were doing before. There's a lot of people that converted to being soldiers. They literally watch a YouTube video, of you're gonna use that use whatever skills you got.[0:49:52] Dr. Lex Fridman: Figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them, to help the effort on the front. And so that's a big hit. But that said that, you know, I've talked to a lot of folks in Kyiv, faculty, primarily in the tech economics Space. So I didn't get a chance to interact with folks who are on the biology, chemistry, neuroscience side of things, but that that that still goes on. So one of the really impressive things about Ukraine is that they're able to maintain infrastructure, like road, food supply, All that kind of stuff, education while the war is going on, especially in Kiev.[0:50:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: The war started where nobody knew Kyiv was gonna be taken by the Russian forces. It was surrounded. And A lot of experts from outside were convinced that Russia would take Kyiv, and and they didn't. And one one of the really impressive things as a leader one One of the things I really experienced is that a lot of people criticized Zelensky before the war. He only had about, like, 30% approval rate.[0:50:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: A lot of people didn't like Zelensky, But one of the great things he did as a leader, which I'm not sure many leaders will be able to do, is when Kyiv was clearly being invaded. He chose to stay, his stay in the capital. Everybody. All the, the American military, the intelligence agencies, NATO, his own staff, advisers, all Told him to flee, and he stayed. And so that's I think that was a beacon, a symbol for the rest for the universities, for science, for For the infrastructure that we're staying to, and, that kept the whole thing going.[0:51:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: There's an interesting social experiment that happened. I think for folks who are interested in sort of gun control in this country in particular is, one of the decisions they made Early on is to give guns to everybody. Semiautomatics. Early on in the war. Right?[0:51:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: Early on in the war. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So everybody got a gun.[0:51:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: They also released a bunch of prisoners from from prison because there was no staff to to to to, to keep the prisons running. And so there's a very interesting psychological experiment of, like, how is this gonna go? Everybody has a gun. Are they gonna start robbing places? Are they going to start taking advantage of a chaotic situation?[0:52:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: And what happened Is that crime went to 0. So it turned out that this, as an experiment, worked wonderfully.[0:52:30] Andrew Huberman: Let's say a case where love generalized.[0:52:33] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes.[0:52:33] Andrew Huberman: Or at least hate did not. We don't know if it's love or it's sort of lack of initiative for self, you know, common culture directed hate.[0:52:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I don't right. It's I I I think that's very correct to say that it wasn't hate that was unifying people. It was love of country, love of community. It's the probably the same thing that will happen to humans when, like, aliens invade.[0:52:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's we're all it's, like, it's, the common effort. Everybody puts everything else, to the side. Plus, just the the sheer amount of guns similar to, like, Texas, you realize, like, well, You're there's going to be a self correcting mechanism very quickly because the rule of law was also put aside. Right? Like, Basically, the police force lost a lot of power because everybody else has guns, and they're kinda taking the law into their own hands.[0:53:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: And That system, at least in this particular case, in this particular moment in human history, worked. It's an interesting lesson. You know? Mhmm.[0:53:32] Andrew Huberman: I'd it is. I had an interesting contrast that I'll share with you. I because you mentioned Texas. So not so long ago, I I often visit you or others in Austin as you know. And, many doors that I walked past, including a school, said, no Firearms past this point, you know, as a sticker on the door.[0:53:51] Andrew Huberman: You see this on hospitals sometimes. I saw this at Baylor College of Medicine, etcetera. Relatively common to see in Texas, not so common in California. And then I flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, was walking by An elementary school in my old neighborhood and saw a similar sticker and looked at it, and it said, no peanuts Or other allergy containing foods past this point on the door of this elementary school. So quite a different contrast.[0:54:19] Andrew Huberman: Like, you know, guns and peanuts. Now peanut allergies obviously are very serious for some people. Although there's great research out of Stanford showing that early exposure to peanuts, can prevent the allergies. It's, but don't start rubbing yourself in peanut butter, folks, if you have a peanut allergy. That's not the best way to deal with it.[0:54:36] Andrew Huberman: In any case, the contrast of what's Dangerous. The contrast of, you know, the familiarity with guns versus no familiarity, you know, in Israel and elsewhere, you see machine guns in the airport. In Germany, Frankfurt, you see machine guns in the airport. Not so common in the United States. So, again, there's I feel like there's this aperture vision, there's this aperture of pleasures and creep versus creature comforts and lack of, creature comforts.[0:55:04] Andrew Huberman: Then there's this aperture of of danger. Right? People who are familiar with guns, you know, are familiar with people coming in and setting their firearm on the table and eating eating dinner. You know? But in if you're not accustomed to that, it's jarring.[0:55:17] Andrew Huberman: Right?[0:55:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: As as I mentioned, people know this throughout human history, but the human ability to Get, assimilated? No. Get used to violence is incredible. So, like, You could be living in a peaceful time like like we're here now, and there will be 1 explosion, like a 911 type of situation. That'd be a huge shock.[0:55:41] Dr. Lex Fridman: Terrifying. Everybody freaks out. The second1 is a huge drop off in how freaked out you get. And with in a matter of days, sometimes hours, it becomes the the normal. I've talked to so many people in, Kharkiv, which is one of the towns that's seen a lot of Heated battle.[0:55:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: You ask them, is it safe there? In fact, when I went to the, Closer and closer to the war zone, you ask people, is it safe? And their answer is usually, yeah. It's pretty safe.[0:56:12] Andrew Huberman: It's all signal to noise.[0:56:14] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. It like, nobody has told me, except, like, Western reporters sitting in the west side of Ukraine, it's really dangerous here. Everyone was like, yeah. You know? It's good.[0:56:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: Like, my uncle just died yesterday. Like, he was shot. It's pretty, you know, it's pretty good. Like, the the farm's still running. Like, the the they, how do I put it?[0:56:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: They focus on the positive. That's one. But it's There's a deeper truth there, which is you just get used to difficult situations. And the stuff that make you happy and the stuff that make you upset is relative to that new normal that you established.[0:56:52] Andrew Huberman: Well, I grew up in California, and there were a lot of earthquakes. I remember the 89 quake. I remember the Embarcadero Freeway called pancaking on top of People in cars, I remember. I moved to Southern California. There's a Northridge quake.[0:57:02] Andrew Huberman: Wherever I move, there seem to be earthquakes. I never worry about earthquakes ever. I just don't. In fact, I don't like the they cause, but every once in a while, an earthquake will roll through, and it's kind of exciting. It sounds like a train coming through.[0:57:13] Andrew Huberman: It's like, wow. Like, the earth is moving. You know? Again, I don't want anyone to get harmed, but I I enjoy a good rumble coming through. Nonetheless, it signal the noise.[0:57:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But if I saw a tornado, freak out, and people from the Midwest are probably comfortable with, you know, Dan Gable, the great wrestler from the Midwest that you know and I've never met, but I have great respect for. He's probably, you know, see sees tornadoes, like, oh, yeah. Maybe. You know?[0:57:35] Andrew Huberman: You know? So so I think signal to noise is is real. Before I neglect, although I won't forget, speaking of signal to noise and environment you are returning to or have gone back to one of your original, natural habitats, which is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is Georgia. Habitat. It's it's actually difficult to pronounce in full.[0:58:01] Andrew Huberman: IT. Right? So you've been, spending some time there teaching and doing other things. Tell us what you're up to with MIT recently.[0:58:08] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, it's I'm I'm really glad that you being on on the West Coast know the difference in, like, Boston, New York. I feel like a lot of people way to It's like the East Coast. No. This is very[0:58:17] Andrew Huberman: different, especially the Bostonians and New Yorkers.[0:58:20] Dr. Lex Fridman: We get very interested.[0:58:21] Andrew Huberman: Oh my goodness.[0:58:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I I love it. I get gave, lectures there in front of a in person crowd. What were you talking about? For the AI.[0:58:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: Mhmm. So different aspects of AI. Mhmm. And, you know, robotics machine learning machine learning. So for people who know the artificial intelligence field, they usually don't use the term AI, and people from outside use AIs.[0:58:43] Dr. Lex Fridman: The biggest breakthroughs in the machine learning field was some discussion of robotics, and so on. Yeah. This in person is is wonderful, and I'm a sucker for that. I really avoided teaching or any kind of interaction during COVID because, people put a lot of emphasis on, but also got comfortable with remote teaching. And I think nobody enjoyed it, except sort of There's a notion that it's much easier to do Mhmm.[0:59:14] Dr. Lex Fridman: Because you don't have to, you know, you don't have to travel. You don't have The you can do it out in your pajamas kind of thing, but when you actually get to do it, you don't get the same kind of joy that you do when you're teaching. As a student, you don't get the same kind of joy of learning. It's not as effective and all that kind of stuff. So to be in person together with people, to See their eyes, to get their excitement, to get the questions and all the interactions.[0:59:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. It was awesome. And it's I'm still, a sucker and a believer in the the ideal of MIT, of the university. I think it's an incredible place. There's something in the air, still but it really hit the pandemic hit universities hard because and I can say this.[0:59:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: This is You saying it. This is me saying it. That administrations, as in all cases, when people criticize institutions, The pandemic has given more power to the administration and taken away power from the faculty and the students. And that's a from everybody involved, including the administration, that's a concern because the university is about the teachers and the students. That should be primary.[1:00:21] Dr. Lex Fridman: And whenever you have a pandemic, there's an opportunity to increase the amount of rules. Like, one of the things that really bothered me, and I'll screen from the top of the, MIT dome, about this is They've instituted a new, TIM ticket system, which is if you're a visitor to the campus at MIT, You have to register. You have to, first of all, show that you're vaccinated. But more importantly, there's a process to visiting. You're you need to get permission to visit.[1:00:50] Dr. Lex Fridman: One of the reasons I loved MIT. Unlike some other institutions, MIT just leaves the door open to anyone. In classrooms, you can roll in the ridiculous characters. The students that are kinda, like, usually doing business stuff or economics can roll into a physics class and just you know, you're kinda not allowed, but it's a gray area. So you that you you let that happen, and that creates a flourishing of a community.[1:01:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: That was beautiful. And I think adding extra rules, puts a squeeze on and limits some of the the flourishing. And I hope some of that dissipates over time as we kinda let go of the The risk aversion that was created by the pandemic, because we kinda enter the new the normal return back, some of that flourishing can happen. But when you're actually in there With the students, yeah, it was it's magic. I love it.[1:01:45] Dr. Lex Fridman: I love it.[1:01:46] Andrew Huberman: Well, some of your earliest videos on your YouTube channel were were of you in the classroom. Right? Yeah. That's how this all started.[1:01:51] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Yeah. That's how YouTube like, putting stuff on, on YouTube is is terrifying. Right? Like Well, especially at[1:01:58] Andrew Huberman: the time when you did it again, you're A pioneer in that sense. You did that. Jordan Peterson did that. Putting up lectures, is, Yeah. I would I teach still every every winter.[1:02:11] Andrew Huberman: I teach, direct to course, and I'll I'll be doing even more teaching going forward. But, The idea of those videos being on the web is is, yeah, that spikes my cortisol a little bit.[1:02:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. It's terrifying because you get to everybody has a different experience. Like, for me being a junior, research scientist, the The kind of natural concern is like, who am I? And when I was given this lecture, it's like, I don't deserve any of this.[1:02:39] Andrew Huberman: What's your humility coming through? And I actually think that humility on on the part of an instructor is good because the those that think, you know, that they are entitled and who else who else could give this lecture? Then I worry more. I think it's, I once heard I don't know if it's still true that the, at Caltech, right, the Great California Institute of Technology not far from here, that many of the faculty are actually afraid of the students. Not physically afraid, but they're intellectually afraid because the students are so smart.[1:03:09] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[1:03:09] Andrew Huberman: And teaching there can be downright frightening, I've heard. But that's great. Keeps everybody on their toes. And, I think, and, you know, I I've been corrected in lecture before at Stanford and elsewhere. Know, when when my lab was at UC San Diego where someone will say, hey.[1:03:24] Andrew Huberman: Wait. You know, last lecture, you said this, and now you said that, and were on the podcast, you know. And and I think it's that moment where, you know, you sometimes feel that that urge to defend you. Oh, you're you're right. And I think it depends on how one was Trane, my graduate advisor, was wonderful at saying I don't know all the time.[1:03:41] Andrew Huberman: And she went to Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF and Caltech, a brilliant woman, and had no problem saying like, I don't know.[1:03:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: I don't have that problem either. So I usually have 2 guys that if somebody speaks up, Grab them, drag them out of the room, never see them again. So everybody is really supportive. I don't under you don't understand the the the amount of love and support I get is[1:04:01] Andrew Huberman: Especially when the last few students are there and everybody seems to be nodding as we're going no. I think that, I'd love to sit in on one of your lectures. I know very little about AI machine learning or robotics. But[1:04:12] Dr. Lex Fridman: Have you ever talked at MIT? Have you ever, like, given lectures?[1:04:16] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. In, when I went on the job market from as a faculty member, my final two choices were between MIT P Cowher. I had a a non paper offer. Wonderful place wonderful place to do neuroscience. And UC San Diego, which is a, wonderful neuroscience program.[1:04:31] Andrew Huberman: In the end, it made for me, beyond the West Coast for personal reasons, but, there's some amazing neuroscience going on there. Goodness. And, that's always been true and it's going to continue. It's been a long time I've been invited back there, oddly enough, when I started doing more podcasting and, I still run a lab, but I I Trunk my lab considerably when I was doing as I've done more podcasting. I've received fewer academic lecture invites, which makes sense.[1:04:57] Andrew Huberman: But now they're sort of coming back. And so when people invite now, I always say, you know, do you want me to, talk about, the ventral thalamus and its role in anxiety and aggression, or do you want me to talk about the podcast. And my big fear is I'm gonna go back to give a lecture about the retina or something, and I'll start off with an athletic greens read or something like that just reflexively. Just kidding. That wouldn't happen.[1:05:17] Andrew Huberman: But, listen. I think it's great to continue to put keep a foot in both places. I was so happy to hear that you're teaching at MIT because podcasting is one thing, Teaching is another, and there's overlap there in the Venn diagram. But, listen. The students, they get to sit in on one of your lectures, and you may see me sitting there in the audience soon when I I Creep into your class.[1:05:36] Andrew Huberman: Sunglasses. That's right. Wearing a a red shirt. You won't recognize me. Are certainly, receiving a great gift.[1:05:45] Andrew Huberman: I've I've watched your lectures on YouTube, even the early ones. And, listen, I I know you to be a phenomenal teacher.[1:05:52] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. There's something about so I'm also doing, like I stayed up pretty late last night, working for a deadline on on a paper. One of the things that I hope to do for, hopefully, the rest of my life is is to continue publishing. And I think it's really important to do that Even if, you continue the podcast because you wanna be just on your own intellectual and scientific journey As you do podcasting, because, at least for me and especially on the engineering side because I wanna build stuff. And I think that's, Like, keeps your ego in check, keeps you humble.[1:06:33] Dr. Lex Fridman: Because I think if you talk too much on the microphone, you start getting, you might lose track Of, you know, the grounding that comes from engineering and from science and the scientific process and the criticisms that you get, all that kind of stuff.[1:06:47] Andrew Huberman: And how slow and iterative it We have 2 papers right now that are in the revision stage, and it's been a very long road. And I was asked this recently because I met with my chairman. He said, do you wanna continue running a lab, or you're just gonna go on the podcast. And Stanford has been very supportive, I must say, as I know MIT has been of you of you. And I said, oh, I absolutely wanna continue to be involved in research and do research.[1:07:09] Andrew Huberman: And we start talking about these papers, and we're looking over my this was my yearly review. And looking back, my goodness. These papers have been in play for a very long time. So it's a long road, but, You know, you learn more and more. And the more time you spend, you know, myopically looking at a at a bunch of data, the the more you learn and the more you think.[1:07:24] Andrew Huberman: I I totally agree. You know, talking into these devices for podcast is wonderful because, it's fun. It relieves a certain itch that we both have, and, hopefully, it it lands some important information out there for people, but doing research is is like the I, you know, I'd I guess if you know, you know, there's like the the, You know, the unpeeling of the onion Mhmm. Knowing that there could be something there. There's just nothing like it.[1:07:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: I mean, you do especially with the pandemic. And for me, both Twitter and the podcast have made me much more impatient about the slowness of the review process Because,[1:08:01] Andrew Huberman: Twitter will do that.[1:08:03] Dr. Lex Fridman: The Twitter will do. But even with podcasts, you you have a cool you'll find something cool, and then you you have ideas and all. And you'll just say them, and they'll be out pretty quickly.[1:08:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We can do a post right now about something that we both found interesting, and it's out in the world. Yep.[1:08:16] Dr. Lex Fridman: You can write up something like, there is a culture in computer science of posting stuff on archives and, preprints that don't get in your review, and sometimes they don't even go through the review process ever. Because, like, people just start using them with its code. Mhmm. And it's like, what was what was the point of this? It works.[1:08:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: Like, the it's self Evident that it works because people are using it, and that that, I think, applies more to engineering fields because it's Actual tool that works. It doesn't matter if it you don't have to scientifically prove that it works. It works. It's using for a lot of people.[1:08:47] Andrew Huberman: Well, sorry to interrupt, but I just said, For point of reference, the famous paper describing the double helix, which earned Watson and Crick the Nobel Prize and, should have earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too, of course, but They got it, for the structure of DNA, of course. That paper was never reviewed at Nature. They published it because Its importance was self evident or whatever,[1:09:09] Dr. Lex Fridman: things So, like, the editors[1:09:11] Andrew Huberman: It was that purely editorial decision, I believe. I mean, that's what I was told by someone who's Currently, an editor at Nature, if that turns out to not be correct, someone will tell us in the comments for sure. Well, I I think That's pretty interesting. Right?[1:09:23] Dr. Lex Fridman: That's really interesting.[1:09:23] Andrew Huberman: Perhaps the most Significant discovery in biology and bioengineering that would lead into bioengineering as as well, of course, of the last century was not peer reviewed.[1:09:34] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. But so Eric Weinstein, but many others have have talked about this, which is I mean, I don't think people understand How poor the peer review process is. Just the amount of because you think peer review, it means all the best Peers get together, and they review your stuff. But it's unpaid work, and it's usually a small number of people. And it's a very they have a very select perspective, so they might not be the best person, especially if it's super novel work.[1:10:04] Andrew Huberman: And it's who has time to do it? I'm on a bunch of editorial boards still. Why? I don't know, but I enjoy The peer review process and sending papers out, oftentimes, the best scientists are very busy and don't have time to review. Yeah.[1:10:15] Andrew Huberman: And oftentimes, the more premier journals will select from a kind of a unique kit of very good scientists who are very close to the work. Sometimes, the people are Far from the work. Yeah. It really depends.[1:10:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: And both have negatives. Right? If you're very close to the work, there's jealousy and all those basic human things. Very far from the work, you might not appreciate the The Nuance contribution, all that kind of stuff.[1:10:38] Andrew Huberman: And there's psychology. Sorry to interrupt again. But, good friend of mine who's extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator, etcetera, Always told me that, they I won't even say whether or not, who they are. They select the reviewers on the basis of who has been, publishing very well recently, because they assume that that person is gonna be more benevolent because they're they've been doing well so that the, the love expands. That's a[1:11:01] Dr. Lex Fridman: good point to that, actually. But, You know, the the idea is that editors might actually be the best reviewers. So that that was the traditional that's that's the thing I I wanted to mention that Eric Weinstein talks about that back, several decades ago, editors had much more power. And there's something to be made for that because they Editors are the ones who are responsible for crafting the journal. Like, they really are invested in this.[1:11:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so and and they're also often experts. Right? So it makes sense for an editor to have a bit of power in this case. Like, usually, if an idea is truly novel, You could see it. And, so it's it makes sense for an editor to have more power in that regard.[1:11:42] Dr. Lex Fridman: Of course, for me, I I think Peer review should be done the way tweets are done, which is like, crowdsourced or Amazon reviews.[1:11:49] Andrew Huberman: Let the crowd decide.[1:11:50] Dr. Lex Fridman: Let the crowd decide. And let let the crowd add Depth and breadth in in context for the contribution. So, you know, if the paper overstates The degree of contribution, the crowd will check you on that. If there's not enough support or, like, the conclusions are not supported by the evidence, The crowd will check you on that. There should there could be, of course, a political bickering that enters the picture, especially on very controversial topics.[1:12:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: But I think I trust the intelligence of human beings to figure that out, and I think most of us are are trying to figure this whole process out. I just wish it was happening Much faster because on the important topics, the review cycle could be could be faster. And we learned that through COVID that Twitter was actually pretty effective at doing science communication. It was really interesting. Some some of the best scientists took to Twitter To communicate their own work and other people's work and always putting into sort of the caveats that it's not done peer reviewed and so on, but It's it's all out there, and the data just moves so fast.[1:13:00] Dr. Lex Fridman: And if you want stuff to move fast, Twitter is the best medium of communication for that. It's cool to see.[1:13:06] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition Form that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason That many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, Is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem And makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based interventions You might wanna take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate long term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.[1:14:00] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman To get $200 off an ultimate plan or 34% off the entire site as a special Black Friday deal now through end of November. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman, and use the code Huberman at checkout. I'm now on Twitter more regularly, and initially, it was just Instagram. And I remember we used you and I used to have these over over dinner or drink conversations where I'd say, I don't understand Twitter. You'd say, I don't understand Instagram.[1:14:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: And, of[1:14:31] Andrew Huberman: course, we understand how it worked and how to work each respective platform, but I think we were both Trying to figure out, you know, what is driving the psychology of these different venues because they are quite distinct psychologies, for whatever reason. I think I'm finally starting to understand Twitter and enjoy it a little bit. Initially, I wasn't prepared for the level of Kind of, reflexive scrutiny Yeah. That it sounds a little bit oxymoronic, but that people kinda, like, pick up on 1 small thing and then, you know, drive it down that That trajectory didn't seem to be happening quite as much on Instagram, but I love your tweets. I I do have a question about your your your Twitter Account and how you do you have sort of internal filters of what you'll put up and won't put up?[1:15:15] Andrew Huberman: Because sometimes you'll Put up things that are about life and reflections. Other times, you'll put up, things like what you're excited about in AI or, of course, you know, point to various podcasts including your own, but but others as well. You know, what do you how do you approach social media? Not not at how do you regulate your behavior on there in In terms of how much time, etcetera, I know you've talked about that before, but, you know, what's your mindset around social media when you go on there to either, Post or forage or respond information.[1:15:48] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think I try to add Some not to sound cliche, but some love out there into the world, into, as OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. I think there is this viral negativity that can take hold, and I try to find the right language To add, you know, good vibes out there. And it's actually really, really tricky because it there's something about positivity that sounds fake. And I'm not I can't quite put my finger on it, but whenever I talk about love and and positive And almost childlike in my curiosity and positivity, people are start to think like, surely, He has, like, skeletons in the closet. Like, there's dead bodies in his basement.[1:16:38] Dr. Lex Fridman: Like, this must be a fake attic. It's the attic? The attic. I keep mine in the basement. That's the details.[1:16:45] Andrew Huberman: I was referring to your attic. I don't have an attic or a basement[1:16:47] Dr. Lex Fridman: Oh.[1:16:48] Andrew Huberman: Nor dead bodies. I just wanna be very clear.[1:16:50] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I do have, an attic and, actually, I haven't been up there. Maybe there is bodies up there. But, yes, I I I prefer the basement. It's colder down there.[1:16:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: I like it. No. But there's an assumption that this is not genuine or not, is is disingenuous in some kind of way. And so I I try to find the right language for that kind of stuff, how to how to be positive. Some of it, I was really inspired by, Elon's approach to Twitter.[1:17:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: Not all of it, but the, when he just is silly. I found that, silliness. I think it's, Hermann Hesse said, something to to paraphrase, one of my favorite writers. Yeah. Say I'm thinking Steppenwolf, said, learn, what is to be taken seriously and, laugh at the rest.[1:17:45] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think I try to be silly, laugh at myself, laugh at the absurdity of life, and then in part, when I'm serious, try to just Be positive. Just see a positive perspective. But and also, as you said, people pick out certain words and so on, and they attack each other attack me over certain usage of words and in particular tweet. I think the thing I try to do is Think positively towards them. Like, do not escalate.[1:18:15] Dr. Lex Fridman: So whenever somebody's criticizing me and so on, I I just Smile. If there's a lesson to be learned, I'll I learn it, and then I just send good vibes their way. Don't respond, And just hopefully sort of, through karma and through kind of the ripple effect of positivity have, like, You know, an impact on on them and the rest of Twitter. And what you find is, like, that builds your actions create the community. So how I behave gets me surrounded by certain people.[1:18:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: But, you know, lately, especially Ukraine is one topic like this. I also thought about talking to somebody who reached out to me as Andrew Tate, who's extremely controversial, Oh, from the perspective of a lot of people as a[1:19:03] Andrew Huberman: misogynist. And I I've heard his name, and I know that there's a lot of controversy around him. Maybe you could familiarize me. I've been pretty nose down in podcast prep, and I tried to do this vacation thing for about 3, 4 weeks.[1:19:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: I've heard about that.[1:19:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And, it sort of worked. I did get some time in the Colorado wilderness by myself, which was great. I did get Some downtime, but in any event, it I meant mainly consist of reading and, nature. Reading and nature, Sauna, ice bath, working out, good food, a little extra sleep, these kinds of things.[1:19:42] Andrew Huberman: I really felt I needed it, but I am Pretty naive when it comes to the kind of current controversies, but I've heard his name, and, I think he's been deplatformed on a couple of platforms. Do I have that right?[1:19:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: It has been. So I should also admit that while I might know more than you, it's not by much. So it's like it's like a 5 year old talking to a 4 year old right now.[1:20:04] Andrew Huberman: He an athlete? A podcaster?[1:20:06] Dr. Lex Fridman: So, basic summary, he used to be a fighter, a kickboxer, I believe, was pretty successful. And then during that and after that, I think he was in a reality show, And he had all these programs that are basically, like, pick up artist advice. He has this, like, community of people where he gives advice on how to pick up women, how to how to be successful in relationships, how to make a lot of money. And there's like, You convince people to join so that they can make more money, and then they convince others to join, that kind of stuff. But that's not why I'm interested in talking to him.[1:20:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: I'm I'm interested because One of the guests maybe I shouldn't mention who, but, like, one of the female guests I had, really a big scientist, Said that her, 2 kids that are 13 and 12 really look up to Andrew. Do do do do do do do[1:21:12] Andrew Huberman: do male children?[1:21:13] Dr. Lex Fridman: Male children. Yeah. And I hear this time and time again. So, like, he is Somebody that a lot of teens, young teens, look up to. So I haven't done serious research.[1:21:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: Like, I I usually try to avoid doing research until I, like, agree to talk, and then I go deep. But there is an aspect To the way he talks about women that while I understand and I understand Certain dynamics in relationships work for people, and he's one such person. But I think Him being really disrespectful towards women is not what I, It's not how I see what it means to be a good man. So the conversation I wanna have with him is about masculinity. What does masculinity mean in the 21st century?[1:22:08] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so when I think about that kind of stuff and because we're talking about Twitter, it's like going into a war zone. I'm like a happy, go lucky person. But you're[1:22:20] Andrew Huberman: send me the Ukraine, but I don't wanna have this conversation on Twitter.[1:22:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: Because it's It's a it's a really, really, really tricky one because, also, as you know, when you sit when you do a podcast, like, everybody wants you to, To win. Like, there's not, it's everything you do is positive. Maybe you'll say the wrong thing. It's Like an inaccurate thing, and you can correct yourself. With, Andrew Tate, with Donald Trump, with folks like this, You have to I mean, it's a professional boxing.[1:22:53] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think you have to push the person. You have to be really eloquent. You have to be all sympathetic because you can't just do what journalists do, which is talk down to the person the entire time. That's easy. The hard thing is to empathize with the person, to understand them, To steel man their case, but also to make your own case.[1:23:09] Dr. Lex Fridman: So in that case, about what it means to be a man. To me, a strong man is somebody who's respectful to women, Not out of weakness, not out of social justice warrior signaling and all that kind of stuff, but out of that's what a a strong man does. Like, they they don't they don't need to be disrespectful Bethel to prove their position in life. He is often no. A lot of people say it's a character.[1:23:32] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's it's he's being misogynistic. His being a misogynist is a kinda for entertainment purposes.[1:23:37] Andrew Huberman: So like an avatar.[1:23:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Uh-huh. But to me, that avatar It has a lot of influence on young folks, so the character has has has impact.[1:23:49] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I don't think you can separate the avatar and the person, in terms of the impact. As you said, in fact, there are a number of accounts on Twitter and Instagram and elsewhere which people have only revealed their first names, or they give themselves another name, or they're using a cartoon image. And Part of that, I believe in at least from some of these individuals who actually know who they are, I understand is, a, an attempt to maintain their privacy, which is Important to many people. And in some cases, so that they can be More inflammatory and then just pop up elsewhere as something else without anyone knowing that it's the the same person.[1:24:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: Some of the this is the dark stuff. I've been reading a lot about Ukraine and Nazi Germany, so the thirties and the forties and so on. And you get to see how much the, Absurdity turns to evil quickly. One of the things I worry one of the things I really don't like to see on Twitter and the Internet is how many statements end with LOL. It's like, you think just because something is kind of Funny or is funny or is legitimately funny.[1:24:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: It also doesn't have a deep effect on society. So that's such a Difficult gray area because some of the best comedy is dark and mean, but it reveals some important truth that we need to consider. But sometimes comedy is just covering up for, destructive ideology, And you have to know the line between those 2. Hitler was seen as a joke in the late twenties and and the thirties in Nazi Germany Until the joke became very serious. You have to be careful to know the difference between the the joke and the reality and do all that.[1:25:36] Dr. Lex Fridman: I mean, in a conversation I'm just such a big believer in conversation to be able to reveal something through Conversation. But I don't know one of the big you know, you and I challenge ourselves all the time. I don't know if I I have what it takes to have A good, empathetic, but adversarial conversation.[1:25:58] Andrew Huberman: I need to, learn more about this, tape Person or not learn about it. Yeah. It sounds it sounds like maybe it's something to skip. I don't know, because, again, I'm not familiar with the content. But I was gonna ask you, whether or not you've seek doubt or whether or not you would ever consider having Donald Trump as a guest on your podcast.[1:26:15] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I I just talked to Joe a lot about this, and I I I really believe I can have a good conversation with Donald Trump. But I haven't seen many good conversations with him. So, like, Part of me thinks part of me believes it's possible, but he often effectively runs over the interviewer.[1:26:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You can sit him down, give him an element, the athletic greens.[1:26:50] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Just relax.[1:26:51] Andrew Huberman: I mean, that nice cool air conditioned, black curtain studio you've got you know, a different side might come out. Context is powerful.[1:26:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, Joe's really good at this, which is relaxing, the person. You know? Like, here. Have a drink. Right?[1:27:06] Dr. Lex Fridman: Smoke a joint or whatever it is, but some this energy of just let's relax and there's laughter and so on. I don't think, As people know, I'm just not good at that kind of stuff. So I think the way I could have a good conversation with him Is to really understand his worldview, be able to steel man his worldview and those that support him, which is, I'm sorry to say, for people who seem to hate Donald Trump is a very large percentage of the country. And so you have to really empathize With those people, you have to empathize with Donald Trump, the human being. And from that perspective, ask them hard questions.[1:27:47] Andrew Huberman: Who do you think is the is the counterpoint if you're gonna see you know, seek balance and your guess? If you're gonna have Trump on, then you have to have Who on?[1:27:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, it's interesting. It's[1:27:58] Andrew Huberman: Anthony Fauci seems to be, you know, strongly associated It's, sort of countervalues at least in in the the eye of the public. I think he's retiring soon. But,[1:28:10] Dr. Lex Fridman: I yes. He he's retiring, so that's really interesting. Anthony Fauci yeah. Definitely. But I don't think he's a counterbalance.[1:28:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: He's a he's a complicated, A fascinating figure who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust, but also love from some people. Love.[1:28:27] Andrew Huberman: Look from some people. I mean, I know people, not even necessarily scientists who have, you know, pro Fauci shirts. I've seen people with anti fallacy search shirts. Excuse me. But, certainly, but, who adore him.[1:28:40] Andrew Huberman: There are people who adore him, in the same way there are people that adore Trump. It's it's so interesting that, know, 1 species of animal, it gets such divergent neural circuitry.[1:28:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: It's almost feels like it's by design, and every single topic we find Tension and division. It's it's fascinating to watch. I mean, I got to really witness it from 0 to a100 in Ukraine where there's not Huge, significant, division. There was in certain parts of Ukraine, but across Europe, across world, there was not that much division between Russia and Ukraine, and it was just born overnight, this intense hatred. So and you see the same kind of stuff with with Fauci over the pandemic.[1:29:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: At first, we're all kind of huddled huddled in uncertainty. Kind of there is a togetherness with the pandemic. Of course, there is more difficult because you're isolated. But then you start to figure out, like, the the Probably the politicians in the media try to figure out how can I take a side here, and how can I now start reporting on this side or that side and say how the other side is wrong? And so I think Anthony Fauci in is is a part of just being used as a scapegoat for certain things as part of that kind of Narrative of of division.[1:29:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: But I think so Trump is a singular figure That to me represents something important in American history. I'm not sure what that is, but I I think you have to think you put on your historian hat, Go forward in time and think back. Like, how will he remembered be remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now? Who is the opposite of that? You have to I I I would really have to think about that because because Trump is so singular.[1:30:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think AOC c is an interesting one, but she's so young. It's unclear to know how what if she represents a legitimate, The, large scale movement or not. Bernie Sanders is an interesting option, but I wish he would be 30, 40 years younger. Like, the young Bernie would be Good.[1:30:47] Andrew Huberman: There are scientists working on that.[1:30:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I think so.[1:30:52] Andrew Huberman: Not him specifically. But[1:30:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, yeah. I It may be him. We we never know. There is a big conspiracy theory that Putin is, that his that's a body double. It's no longer,[1:31:04] Andrew Huberman: this Putin?[1:31:05] Dr. Lex Fridman: No. No. No. Gotcha. I'm having[1:31:07] Andrew Huberman: a hard time, emerging[1:31:08] Dr. Lex Fridman: that image. The conspiracy theories. No. No. No.[1:31:10] Dr. Lex Fridman: That, the Putin we see on camera today is a body double.[1:31:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, one thing that, you know, in in science and in particular in anatomy, there's a classification scheme for different types of anatomists, which they either say you're a lumper or a splitter. Yeah. Yeah. Some people like to call a whole structure something, not necessarily just for simplicity, but for a lot of reasons. And then other people like to micro divide the nucleus into multiple names.[1:31:37] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, people to be able to name different brain structures after themselves, so there'd be the the nucleus of Lex and then the, you know, and the the the Huberman fasciculus or whatever. Less of that nowadays. But, and by the way, those structures don't actually exist just, yet. We we haven't defined those yet. I was making those names up.[1:31:56] Andrew Huberman: But, what's interesting is it seems like in the last 5 years, there's been a lot of There's been a trend, excuse me, toward, a requirement for lumping. Like, you can't say it seems that it's not allowed, if you will, to say, hey. Yeah. You know, and here I'm not stating my I'm I will never reveal my preferences about pandemic related things for, Hopefully, obvious reasons. It you know, some people will say vaccines, yes, but masks, no.[1:32:26] Andrew Huberman: Or vaccines and masks, Yes. But let people work, and other people will say, no. Everyone, stay home. And then other people will say, no. You know, no vaccines, no masks.[1:32:34] Andrew Huberman: Let everybody work. No one was saying no vaccines, no masks, and and and stay home, I don't think. So there's this sort of lumping. Right? The The boundaries around, ideology really did start to defy science.[1:32:51] Andrew Huberman: I mean, it wasn't scientific. It was 1 part science Ish at times, and sometimes really hardcore science. Other times, it was politics, economics. I mean, we really saw the confluence of all these different domains of society that use Very different criteria to evaluate the world. I mean, I as a scientist, you know, I remember when the vaccines first came out and I I asked somebody you know, one of the the early concerns I had that was actually, satisfied for me was how does this thing turn off?[1:33:20] Andrew Huberman: You know, if you start generating mRNA, how does it actually get turned off? So I asked a friend, you know, they know a lot about RNA biology and said, you know, how does it turn off? They explained it to me. I was like, okay. Makes sense.[1:33:31] Andrew Huberman: I asked some other questions. So but most people aren't gonna think about it at that level of detail necessarily, But it did seem that there was a just kind of amorphous blobs of ideology that that grabbed onto things, and then there was this need for a chasm between them. Mhmm. There, It was almost felt like it became illegal in some ways to want, you know, 2 of the things from that menu. And one of the things from that menu, I really felt like I was being constrained by a kind of like bento box model where I didn't get to define what was in the bento box.[1:34:04] Andrew Huberman: Can either have Bento Box a or Bento Box z, but nothing in between.[1:34:09] Dr. Lex Fridman: And I think on on that topic and I think A lot of topics. Most people are in the middle with humility, uncertainty, and they're just kinda trying to figure it out. And I think there is just the extremes defining, the nature of this division. So I think it's the role of a lot of us in our Individualized and also if you're if you have a platform of any kind, I I think you have to try to walk in the middle, like, with the empathy and humility. And that's actually what science Zaba is the is the is the humility.[1:34:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: Still thinking about who's the opposite of Trump. I[1:34:43] Andrew Huberman: Well, maybe it is not. I mean, maybe it's Fauci is orthogonal to To Trump, I mean, not everything has an opposite. I mean, it's you know, maybe he's an end of 1. Maybe he's in the minority of 1 Because he was an outsider in from Washington who then made it there.[1:34:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: But it also I wonder You know, you have to pick your battles because every battle you fight, you should take very seriously. And just the amount of hate I get I got and I still get For having sat down with the Pfizer CEO, that was a very valuable lesson for me.[1:35:17] Andrew Huberman: Well, that one was got you a lot of heat.[1:35:19] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. It still does. Because in because you've[1:35:22] Andrew Huberman: had some some pretty controversial guests[1:35:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: on Yeah. That one that one,[1:35:27] Andrew Huberman: Is he still the Pfizer CEO?[1:35:29] Dr. Lex Fridman: I believe so.[1:35:30] Andrew Huberman: CEOs turnover like crazy.[1:35:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: This is[1:35:32] Andrew Huberman: the thing I didn't realize. You know, in in science, if somebody moves institutions like a big deal, most people don't have more than Two moves in their in their career, maybe. But they often, you know, move to the next building is a big deal. But it in biotech, It's like I I have a former colleague of mine from San Diego, and he's been CEO here. He's a CEO there.[1:35:50] Andrew Huberman: He said he went back to a company he was a CEO at before. You know, if he's probably back at the university, he worked out for it for all I know. It's amazing how much moving around there is. It is a very itinerant profession.[1:35:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I think there In certain companies, I guess, in biotech would be the case. The the CEO is more of like a a manager type, so you can someone's jumping around benefits your experience, so you get become better and better being a manager. There's some, like, leader revolutionary CEOs that stick around for longer because they're so Critical to pivoting a company like the Microsoft CEO currently, Sandeep Rachai, somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk is somebody like that that is part of pivoting a company into new domains constantly.[1:36:34] Dr. Lex Fridman: But, yeah, in biotech, there's a machine. And for you know, in the eyes of a lot of people, big pharma is like big tobacco. It's It's the epitome of everything that is wrong with capitalism. It's, it's evil. Right?[1:36:53] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so I showed up in the conversation where I thought with a pretty open mind and really asked what I thought were difficult questions of him. I don't think he's ever Sat down to a grilling of that kind. In fact, I'm pretty sure they cut the interview short because of that. And I thought, you know, Literally, it was hot in the room, and we're sweating. And I I was asking tough questions for for somebody that, like, half the country or a large percent of the country believes He's alleviate a lot of he helped through the financial resources that that Pfizer has helped alleviate a lot of suffering in the world.[1:37:29] Dr. Lex Fridman: So I thought for somebody like that, I was asking pretty hard questions. Boy, did I get to hear from the side. Usually, one of the sides is more intense in, their anger. So there's certain political Topics, like, with, with annotate, for example, I would I would hear from a very, It would probably be the left far left that would write very angrily. And so that's a group you'll hear from.[1:38:03] Dr. Lex Fridman: The Pfizer CEO, I didn't get almost any messages from people saying, why did you go so hard on on him? You know, he's a he's an incredible human, incredible leader, and CEO of a company that helped helped us with scene that nobody thought would be possible to develop so quickly.[1:38:22] Andrew Huberman: You did not get letters of letters.[1:38:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: I did not. I mean, like, here and there, but the the sea of people That said everything from me being weak that I wasn't able to call out this person. How do you sit down? How do you platform this Evil person that how do you make him look human, all that kind of stuff. And that you have to deal with that.[1:38:42] Dr. Lex Fridman: You have to, of course, it's great. It's great because I I have to do some soul searching, which is like, did I? Like, You have to ask some hard questions. I love criticism like that. You you get to, like you know, I I hit some low points.[1:38:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: There's definitely some despair, and you start to wonder, like, was I too weak? Should I have talked to him? What is true? And you sit there alone and just, Like, marinate in that. And, hopefully, over time, that makes you better, but I still don't know what the right answer with that one is.[1:39:13] Andrew Huberman: Well, I feel that, money plays a role here. You know, when people think big pharma, they think 1,000,000,000 of dollars, maybe even 1,000,000,000,000 of dollars, really. And, certainly, people who make a lot of money Get scrutiny that others don't. Part of it is that they are often not always visible, but, I think that there is a Natural and reflexive, and I'm not justifying it. I certainly don't feel this because I do I know some people who are very, wealthy.[1:39:49] Andrew Huberman: Some people who are very poor. I can't say it scales with happiness at all. People are always shocked to to hear that, but, It you know, but that's what I've observed in very wealthy people. But that people who have a lot of money are often held to a different standard because, people resent that. Some people resent that, and maybe, there are other reasons as well.[1:40:14] Andrew Huberman: I mean, among people who are very wealthy, Oftentimes, the wish is for, status, right, not money. You get a bunch of billionaires in a room, and unless one of them is Elon, who is also has immense status for his accomplishments, typically, if you put a Nobel Prize winner in a room with a bunch of billionaires, They're all talking to that person. Right? And there are many very interesting billionaires, but status is, is something that is often, but not always associated with money, but is a much rarer Form of, of uniqueness out there, a positive uniqueness if one considers status positive because there's a downside too. But, So I wonder whether or not the Pfizer CEO caught extra heat because people assume, and I probably assume also that, his salary is quite immense.[1:41:08] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. I so because I have a lot of data on this, I can answer. It's a very good hypothesis. Let's Tested scientifically.[1:41:14] Andrew Huberman: He's about to tell me it's a gray hypothesis, but it's wrong. I know the smirk. I know the smirk.[1:41:20] Dr. Lex Fridman: I honestly think it's wrong. There is that effect is there for a lot of people, But I think the distrust is not towards the CEO. The distrust is towards the company. Mhmm. One of the really difficult soul searching I had to do, which is just Having interacted with Pfizer folks at every level from junior to to the CEO, they're all really nice people.[1:41:41] Dr. Lex Fridman: They have a mission. They talk about trying to really help people because that's the best way to make money is come up with, medicine that helps a lot of people. Like, The the mission is clear. They're all good people, a lot of really brilliant people, PhDs. So you can have a system where all the people are good, including the CEO.[1:42:01] Dr. Lex Fridman: And by good, I mean people that really are trying to do everything. They dedicate their whole life to do good. And yet you have to think that that system can, deviate from a path that does good. Because you start To deceive yourself of what is good, you turn it into a game where money does come into play from a company perspective where You convince yourself the more money you make, the more good you'll be able to do, and then you start to focus more and more and more on making more money. And then you can really deviate and lose track of what is actually good.[1:42:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: I'm not saying necessarily Pfizer does that, But I think companies could do that. You can apply that criticism to social media companies, to big pharma companies that one of the big lessons for me That's I don't know what the answer is, but that all the people inside the company could be good. People you would wanna hang out with, people you'd wanna work with, But as a company, it's doing evil. And, like, that's a possibility. So, like, the the distrust, I don't think, is towards the billionaire individual, Which I do see a lot of in this case.[1:43:12] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think it's the it's like Wall Street distrust that the machinery of this particular organization Has has has gone off track.[1:43:20] Andrew Huberman: It's the generalization of hate again.[1:43:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. And then you good luck figuring out what is true. This is the this is the tough stuff. But I should say the individuals, like individual scientists at the NIH, in in, Pfizer are just incredible people. Like, they're they're really they're really brilliant people.[1:43:44] Dr. Lex Fridman: So the you know, I never trust the administration or the business people. No offense, business people. But the scientists are always a good the the they they have the right Motivator in life. But, again, with they can have blinders on to focus on the science. Nazi Germany has a history of people just to focus on the science, and then the politicians use the scientists to achieve whatever end they want.[1:44:06] Dr. Lex Fridman: But if you just look narrowly at the The journey of a scientist is is a beautiful one because they ultimately in it for the curiosity, the moment of discovery versus money. I mean, prestige probably does come into play later in later in life, but especially young scientists, they're after The the it's like the pulling at the thread of curiosity to try and discover something big. They get excited by that kind of stuff, and it's beautiful to see.[1:44:34] Andrew Huberman: It it is beautiful. See, I have a former graduate student, now a postdoc at Caltech, and I don't even know if she had a cell phone. She would come in the lab, put her cell phone into the, Desk and she's tremendously productive, but that that wasn't, why I brought it up. She was productive as a side effect of just being Absolutely committed and obsessed to discover the answers to the questions she was asking[1:44:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[1:44:55] Andrew Huberman: As best she could. And it was you could feel it. You just feel the intensity and, just incredibly low activation energy. If there was an experiment to do, you should just go do it. You're teaching at MIT.[1:45:08] Andrew Huberman: You are obviously traveling the world. You're writing the podcast a lot of Coverage of chess recently, which is interesting. I I don't play chess, but I[1:45:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: Oh, I have some scientific questions to you about that.[1:45:19] Andrew Huberman: Oh, okay. Sure. And then, let's get to those for sure. And then[1:45:23] Dr. Lex Fridman: You're not gonna like it.[1:45:24] Andrew Huberman: Oh, no. Okay. And then and then also some some very, do I have to spell Massachusetts again?[1:45:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: Of course.[1:45:32] Andrew Huberman: The the also, you still seem to have a proclivity for finding They're controversial. Right? You think about Tate. We're talking about Trump. We're talking about the Pfizer CEO.[1:45:42] Andrew Huberman: We're talking about Fauci. These are these are in, intense people. And so what we're getting folks is a, we're not doing neuroimaging here in the traditional sense of putting someone into a scanner. What we're doing here is we're using as, the great Carl Dyseroth, who was on your podcast.[1:45:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: You for that. Thank you for connecting us. He's an incredible person.[1:45:59] Andrew Huberman: He's an incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, and human being and and and writer, and your conversation with him was Phenomenal. I I listened to it twice. I actually have taken notes. We talk about it in this household. We really do.[1:46:13] Andrew Huberman: His, His description of love is, not to be missed. I'll just leave it at that. Because if I try and say it, I won't capture it well. But, you you know, we're getting a a A language based map of, at least a portion of Lex Fridman's brain here. So, what else is going on these days in that brain as it relates to robotics, AI?[1:46:37] Andrew Huberman: Our last conversation was a lot about Robots and the potential for robot human interaction, what it even what is a robot, etcetera. Are you still working on robots or focused on robots? And, you know, where where is science showing up in your life besides the things we've already talked about?[1:46:53] Dr. Lex Fridman: So I think the last time we talked was before Ukraine. Yes, Flor.[1:46:58] Andrew Huberman: You were just about to leave.[1:47:00] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. So that I mean So[1:47:02] Andrew Huberman: that's why I went on. I was like, you know, this might be the Last year, you said you wanna come out here before or after. I was like, yeah.[1:47:07] Dr. Lex Fridman: Come out there before.[1:47:08] Andrew Huberman: Don't wanna see you before you go. But here you are in the flesh.[1:47:11] Dr. Lex Fridman: I Think, so a lot of, just a lot of my mind has been occupied, obviously, with that part of the world. But the the most of the difficult struggles that I'm still going through is that I haven't launched a company that I want to launch, And the the company has to do with AI. I mean, it's a maybe a longer conversation, but the ultimate dream is to put robots in every home. But short term, I see their possibility of launching a social media company, and the It's a nontrivial explanation why that leads to robots in the home, but it's basically the algorithms that fuel Effective social robotics. So robots that you can form a deep connection with.[1:47:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so I've been really yeah. I've been building prototypes, But struggling that I don't have maybe if I were to be critical, The guts to to launch a company. Or that's fine. Well, it's combined. I think[1:48:13] Andrew Huberman: you've got the guts. I mean, it's clear if you'll do an interview with the Pfizer CEO and you're considering putting this tape fellow on your podcast and you've gone to the Ukraine, that you you have the guts. It's also a, it means not doing quite a lot of other[1:48:28] Dr. Lex Fridman: That's what I mean, but it it does takes the thing is, as many people know, When you fill your day and you're busy, that busyness becomes an excuse that You use against doing the things that scare you. A lot of people use family in this way. You know? My wife, my kids, I can't. When in reality, some of the most successful people have a wife and have kids and have families, and they still do it.[1:48:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so a lot of times, we can fill the day with busy work, with, like, the like, yeah. Of course, I have podcasts and all this kind Stuff. And they make me happy, and they're all they're wonderful, and, there's resources, teaching, and so on. But all of that can just serve as an excuse from the thing that my heart says is the right thing to do. And, that's why I don't have the guts the guts to say no to basically everything and then to focus all out.[1:49:23] Dr. Lex Fridman: Because part of it is I'm unlikely to fail at anything in my life currently because I've already found a comfortable place. With, with the start up, it's mostly going to be most likely going to be[1:49:37] Andrew Huberman: a failure. It's not an embarrassing failure. So, well, the machine learning data that I'm aware of I don't know a lot about machine learning, but the within the realm of neuroscience say that a failure rate Of about 15% is optimal for, you know, neuroplasticity and growth. Whether or not that translates to all all kinds of practices This isn't clear, but getting trials right 85% of the time seems to be optimal for language learning, seems optimal for mathematics and seems to be optimal for, physical pursuits, like, on average. Right?[1:50:11] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure I'm gonna, know, that you know, you have more, machine learning, geeks on that listen to your podcast than listen to this podcast. But it doesn't mean you have to fail on 15% of your weight sets, folks. I mean, it could be, you know, 16%. No. I'm just kidding.[1:50:24] Andrew Huberman: But the, it's, it's not exact, but it but it's a pretty good Rule of thumb.[1:50:30] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think a lot of startup founders would literally murder for 85% chance of success. I think I think, Given all the opportunities I have, the the skill set, the the funding, all that kind of stuff, my chances are Relatively high for success, but what relatively high means in the startup world is still far, far below 80 5. It's we are talking about single digit percentages. Most startups fail.[1:50:57] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think it means, you know, the decision to focus on the company and not other things means the decision to close the hatch on dopamine retrieval from all these other things that are very predictable sources of dopamine. Not that everything is dopamine, but know, dopamine is, I think, the the primary chemical driver of motivation. You know, if you know that you can get some degree of Satisfaction from scrolling social media or from, that particular cup of coffee, that's what you're gonna do. That's what you're going to consume unless, you somehow invert the algorithm, and you, and you say, you know, it's actually my denial of myself Drinking that coffee, that's gonna be the the dopamine. Right?[1:51:37] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Then you know? And and that's the beauty of having a forebrain is that you can make those decisions. You know? This is the essence I I do believe of what we see of David Goggins.[1:51:46] Andrew Huberman: There's much more there. There's a person that none of us know, and only he knows, of course. But the idea that The pain is the source of dopamine. The the limbic friction, as I sometimes like to call it, is the source of dopamine. That runs counter to how most nervous systems work, But it was a it's decision based.[1:52:06] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's not because his musculature is a certain way or his you know, he had CRISPR or something. It's because he decides that. And I I think that's amazing. It it but what it means in terms of starting a company and changing priorities This is a closing the hatch on all or many of the current sources of dopamine so that you can derive dopamine from the failures within this narrow context.[1:52:28] Andrew Huberman: And there's a very reductionist view, kind of neuro, centric view of what we're talking about, but I think about this a lot. I mean, the decision to choose 1 relationship versus another is a decision to close down other opportunities. Right? So I think that the, You know, the the decision to order 1 thing off the menu versus others is this decision to close down those other hatches. So I think that You absolutely can do it.[1:52:54] Andrew Huberman: It's just a question of, can you flip the algorithm?[1:52:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Remap the source of dopamine to something else.[1:53:01] Andrew Huberman: Right. And maybe maybe go out there not to succeed, but make the the you know, the journey is the destination type thing. But, you know, when you're Financially vested in your time. And as far as I know, we only get 1 life, at least on this planet, and, you wanna spend that wisely.[1:53:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: Right? And a lot of that the people that surround you the people are really important, and I don't have People around me that say you should do a start up. It's very difficult to find such people because[1:53:35] Andrew Huberman: Is Austin big start up culture right now?[1:53:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: It is. It is. But it doesn't make sense for me to do a start up. This is what the people that love me my whole life have been telling me it doesn't make sense what you're what you're doing right now. Just do the thing you were doing previously.[1:53:48] Andrew Huberman: Why do I get the sense that because they are saying this, you're apt to go against[1:53:51] Dr. Lex Fridman: Actually, it was never that, unfortunately. Unfortunately, I need, I've talked to people I love, my parents, family, and so on, friends. I'm one of those people that needs Unconditional support for difficult things. Like, I know myself coaching wise. It's good to I like So so here's how I get coached best.[1:54:12] Dr. Lex Fridman: Let's say wrestling. I like, a coach That says, you wanna win the Olympics. They will not first like, if I say I wanna win the gold medal at the Olympics in freestyle wrestling, I I want a coach that doesn't blink once and hears me and believes that I can do it And then is viciously intense and cruel to me on the on on that pursuit. Like, if you want to do this, let's do this. Right?[1:54:41] Dr. Lex Fridman: So but that support, that, like, that positivity, I don't I'm never, you know, I'm not energized nor do I see that as love, a person saying, like Basically, criticizing that. Like, saying, like, you're, you're too old to win the Olympic gold medal. Right. You're like, all the things you can come up with, that's not helpful to me, and I can't find a dopamine or I haven't yet a dopamine source From the the haters. Like, basically, people that are criticizing you, so just trying to prove them wrong.[1:55:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: I it doesn't It never got me off. Like, it never,[1:55:22] Andrew Huberman: where some people seem to like that. I mean, David Goggins always seems to come out. He seems driven by many sources that he has access. I do I don't know because I've never asked him, but I I If I were to venture a guess, I'd say that he probably has a lot of options inside his head as to how to push through challenge, not just Overcome pain, not but but he'll post sometimes about the fact that, you know, people will say this or people will do this and, you know, it's and and talk about the pushback approach. He'll also talk about, the pushback approach that's purely internal that doesn't involve anyone else.[1:55:57] Andrew Huberman: Great versatility there.[1:55:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. There's a there's literally, like, a voice he yells at that represents some kind of, Like, devil that wants him to fail, and he's you know, he calls him bitch and all kinds of things saying, you know, fuck you. I'm not. I'm not. He's there's always, like, an enemy, and he's going against that enemy.[1:56:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: And I wish may maybe that's something I mean, it's really interesting. Maybe you can remap it this way So so that you can construct like, that's a kind of obvious mechanism. Construct an amorphous blob that is a hater that wants you to fail. Right? That's kind of the David Goggins thing.[1:56:35] Dr. Lex Fridman: You're in a that that that blob says you're too weak. Mhmm. You're too dumb. You're you're too old. You're too fat.[1:56:43] Dr. Lex Fridman: You're too whatever in getting you to want to quit and so on. And then you start getting angry at that blob, and maybe that's a good motivator. I haven't personally really tried that.[1:56:53] Andrew Huberman: Well, I've had external, you know, challenge when I was a postdoc, very prominent laboratory. Several prominent laboratories, in fact, were working on the same thing that I was, and I was just a slowly postdoc working on a Project pretty independent from the lab I was in. And, there was competition, but there was plenty of room for everybody to win. But in my head, And frankly, I won't disclose who this is. And and because there was some legitimate competition there[1:57:20] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[1:57:20] Andrew Huberman: And a little bit of friction, not not too much healthy scientific Friction. Yeah. I might have pushed a few extra hours or more, a little bit. I have to say it felt, metabolizing. It felt catabolic.[1:57:34] Andrew Huberman: Right? It didn't, I couldn't be sustained by it. And I contrast that with the podcast or the work that my laboratory is doing now, focused on stress and human performance, etcetera. And it's pure love. I just I want it's pure curiosity and love.[1:57:49] Andrew Huberman: I mean, they're hard days, but I never there's no adversary in the picture. They're the practical, you know, workings of life that[1:57:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: But those those are the thing that Joe really inspired me on. And people do Create adversarial relationships in podcasting because you get like, YouTubers do this. They get you know, they hate seeing somebody else be successful. There's a feeling of, like, like jealousy, and some people even see that as healthy. Like, oh, this, Like, mister beast or somebody some of these popular YouTubers.[1:58:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: How how do they get a 100,000,000 views, and I only get 20 views? Like, mister b's devoted his[1:58:27] Andrew Huberman: entire according to him, his entire life, he's been focused on becoming this massive YouTube channel.[1:58:32] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. Well, that you know, he's inspiring in many ways. But, like, there's some people that get Become famous for doing much less, insane pursuit of, of greatness than mister beast. Like, this people become famous on, you know, on social media and so on, and it's easy to be jealous of them. I just one of the early things I've learned from Joe, just being a fan of his podcast, is how much he celebrated everybody.[1:58:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: And I again, I I guess maybe I ruined my whole dopamine thing, but I don't get energized by People that are they become popular. In the podcasting space, in YouTube, it doesn't it's awesome. It's all of it is is awesome, I'm I'm inspired by that. But the problem is that's not a good motivator. Inspiration is like, oh, cool.[1:59:15] Dr. Lex Fridman: Humans can do this. This is beautiful, but it's not. I'm looking I'm looking, you know, for for a forcing function. That's why I gave away the salary from MIT. I was hoping my bank account had 0.[1:59:27] Dr. Lex Fridman: That would be a forcing function to be like, oh, shit. And I would you know? And you're not allowed to have a normal job, so I wanted to launch. And then the podcast becomes, You know, a source of income is so it's like, goddamn it.[1:59:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, and here, I I have to confess my biases. You are, You are so good at what you do in the realm of podcast, and you're excellent at other things as well. I just have less, You know, experiencing those things.[1:59:57] Andrew Huberman: I know here, I'm I'm taking the liberty of speaking for many, many people and just saying I I I sure as Hell, hope you don't shut down the podcast. But as your friend and as somebody who cares very deeply about your happiness and your your deeper satisfaction, if it's in your heart's heart to do a company, well then, damn it, do the company.[2:00:21] Dr. Lex Fridman: And a lot of it, I wouldn't even care categorize as happiness. I don't know if you have things like that in your in your life, but I'm probably the happiest I'll I could possibly be right now.[2:00:32] Andrew Huberman: That's wonderful.[2:00:33] Dr. Lex Fridman: But the thing is the there's a longing for the startup that has nothing to do with happiness. It's, it's something else.[2:00:38] Andrew Huberman: That's that itch. That's that[2:00:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: is pretty sure I'll be less happy because it's a really tough process. It's it's it's I mean, to whatever degree you can extract happiness from struggle, yes. Maybe. But I don't see it. I I think I'll have some very, very low points.[2:00:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: There's a lot of people who Who found find companies, found companies, know about your and I also wanna be in a relationship. I want to Get married and sure as hell, a startup is not gonna increase the, the likelihood of that.[2:01:10] Andrew Huberman: We could start up a family and start a company.[2:01:13] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, that That's a I I'm a huge believer in that, which is getting a relationship at a low point in your life, Which is[2:01:24] Andrew Huberman: Sorry. I'm not disputing your stance, nor am I agreeing with it. I'd just, every once in a while, there's a There's a Lex Friedman ism that, that hits a particular circuit in my brain. I tend to just laugh out loud.[2:01:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: I just think that It's easy to have a relationship when everything is good. The relationships that become strong and are tested quickly are the ones when when shit is going down.[2:01:48] Andrew Huberman: Well, then there's hope for me yet. So, you know, Before we sat down, I was having a conversation with a podcast producer who is a, I wouldn't say avid, Rather, he's a rabid consumer of podcast and finds these amazing podcasts. He's, small podcasts and, you know, and and Unique episodes. Anyway, we were talking about, some stuff that he has had seen and read in the business sector. And he was talking about, The difference between, you know, job, career, and a calling.[2:02:23] Andrew Huberman: Right? And I and I think he was extracting this from conversations of of, CEOs and founders, etcetera. I forget the specific founders that, that brought this to light for him. But, You know, that this idea that if you focus on a job, you know, you can make an income, and, hopefully, you enjoy your job or not hate it too much. A career is is represents a sort of, In my mind, a kind of series of evolutions that one can go through junior professor, tenure, etcetera.[2:02:49] Andrew Huberman: But a calling has a whole other, level of of of energetic pull to it because it includes career and job, and it includes this concept of sort of like a life. It's very hard to to draw the line between a calling in career and a calling in the other parts of your life. So the question, therefore, is, Do you feel a calling to start this company, or is it, more of a compulsion that, irritates you. Is it, like, something you wish would go away, or is it something that you that you hope won't go away?[2:03:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: No. I hope it won't go away. It's a calling. It's a calling. It's like, It's like, when I see a robot when I first interacted with robots and it became even stronger, the more The robots I interacted with, I see a magic there.[2:03:42] Dr. Lex Fridman: And you're like you look around. Does anyone else see this magic? Like, it's it's kinda like maybe when you fall in love, like, that that feeling like Does does anyone else notice this person that you just walk in the room? I feel that way about robots, and I I can Elaborate what that means, but I'm not even sure I can convert it into words. I just feel like the Social integration of robots in society will create a really interesting world.[2:04:16] Dr. Lex Fridman: And, our ability to anthropomorphize we look at a robot and our ability to feel things when we look at a robot is something that most of us don't yet experience, but I think Everybody will experience in the next few decades, and I I just want to be, a part of that ex of exploring that because it hasn't been really thoroughly Explored. The best roboticists in the world are not currently working on that problem at all. They they try to avoid human beings completely. And Nobody's really working that problem in terms of when you look at the numbers. All the big tech companies that are investing money, the closest thing to that is Alexa And, basically, being a servant to help tell you the weather or play music and so on, it's not trying to form a deep connection.[2:05:02] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so I I sometimes you just notice a thing. Not not only do I notice the magic, there's a gut feeling, which I try not to speak to because there's no track record, but I feel like I can be good at bringing that magic out of the robot. And there's no data that says I would be good at that, But there's a feeling. It's just a feeling. Like, I you know, when I because I've done so many things.[2:05:32] Dr. Lex Fridman: I love doing Playing guitar, all that kind of stuff. Jiu jitsu, I've never felt that feeling. When I was doing jiu jitsu, I don't feel The the magic of the genius required to be extremely good. At guitar, I don't feel any of that. But I've noticed it in others.[2:05:48] Dr. Lex Fridman: Great musicians, They will they they notice the magic about the thing they do, and they and they rambled it. And I just always thought, I think it had a different form when I before I knew robots existed, before AI existed. The form was More about the magic between humans. The like, I I think of it as love, but, like, The smile the 2 friends have towards each other when I was really young, and people would be excited when they first know each other and see notice each other. And there's the that moment that they share that feeling together.[2:06:31] Dr. Lex Fridman: I I was like, wow. That's really interesting. It it is really interesting that these 2 separate intelligent organisms are able to connect all of a sudden on this deep emotional level. It's like, It's it's, it's just beautiful to see, and I noticed the magic of that. And then when I started, programming programming, period, but then programming AI systems, you realize, Oh, that could be that's not just between humans and humans.[2:06:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: That could be humans and other entities, dogs, cats, And robots, and that's so I for some reason, it hit me the most intensely when I saw robots. And so, yeah, it's it's like a calling, but It's a calling that I I can just enjoy the The vision of it, the vision of a future world, of an exciting future world that's full of cool stuff, or I can be Part of building that and part being part of building that means doing the hard work of capitalism, which is like raising funds from people, which for me right now is the easy part, and then hiring a lot of people. I don't know how much you know about hiring, but hiring[2:07:43] Andrew Huberman: Hiring excellent people.[2:07:44] Dr. Lex Fridman: Excellent people Yeah. That will define the trajectory of not only your company, but your whole existence as a human being. And and building it up, Not failing them because now they all depend on you, and not failing the world with an opportunity to bring something Having to work with people you never worked with, like lawyers and the human resources and supply chain and and, You know, like, because this is very comp compute heavy, the infra the compute infrastructure, the managing security, cybersecurity is because you're dealing with people's data. So now you have to understand not only the, the cybersecurity of data and the privacy, how to maintain privacy correct data, but also the psychology of people trusting you with their data. And what is how how You know, if you look at Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and those folks, they seem to be hated by a large number of people.[2:08:48] Andrew Huberman: Jack seemed I didn't, You know, I didn't Much less so. Yes. I think I always think of Jack as a as a loved individual. But,[2:08:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: like You you have a very positive[2:08:58] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I like Jack a lot, and I I like his mind. And I, someone close to him described him to me recently as He's an excellent listener. That's what they said about Jack, and that that's my experience of him too. Very private person, so we'll we'll leave it at that.[2:09:14] Andrew Huberman: But, Listen. I I think Jack Dorsey is, one of the one of the greats of our, of the last 200 years.[2:09:25] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[2:09:25] Andrew Huberman: And it's just much quieter, about his stance on things than a lot of people, but much of what we see in the world that's wonderful. I think, we owe him a debt of gratitude. I'm just voicing my stance here. But, on the person,[2:09:38] Dr. Lex Fridman: this is really important. Yeah. A wonderful person, a brilliant person, a good person, But you still have to pay the price of making any kind of mistakes as the head of a company. Mhmm. You don't get any extra bonus points Right.[2:09:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: For being a good person.[2:09:55] Andrew Huberman: But his willingness to go on Rogan and deal directly And say I don't know an answer to that in some cases, but to deal directly with some really challenging questions, to me, earned him tremendous respect.[2:10:09] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. As an individual, he was still part of him is so you you've said your and I love Jack too, and I interact with him often.[2:10:16] Andrew Huberman: Been on your podcast.[2:10:17] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. But he's also part of a system as we talked about, and, I would argue that Jack shouldn't have brought anyone else with him on that podcast. If you go[2:10:29] Andrew Huberman: That's right. He had a cadre of of[2:10:30] Dr. Lex Fridman: Oh, he had a a I I guess, the the legal the head legal, with him. And, also, it requires a tremendous amount of skill to to go on a podcast like Joe Rogan and Be able to win over the trust of people by being able to be transparent and communicate how the company really works. Because the more you reveal about how social media company works, the more You open up for security, the the vector of attacks increases. Also, there's a lot of difficult decisions in terms of censorship or not that are made, That if you make them transparent, you're gonna get an order of magnitude more hate. So you have to make all those kinds of decisions, and I think that's one of the things I have to realize is you have to take the, that avalanche of Potentially hate if you make mistakes.[2:11:23] Andrew Huberman: Well, you you have a very clear picture of this architecture of what's required in order to create a company. Of course, there's division of labor too. I mean, you don't have to do all of those things in detail, but Finding people that are excellent to do, the you know, to run the critical segments are is obviously key. I'll just say what I said earlier, which is if it's in your heart's heart to start a company, if that indeed is your calling and it sounds like it is, then, I can't wait.[2:11:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: Does the heart have a heart? I don't know. What's that expression you would mean?[2:11:59] Andrew Huberman: Probably not.[2:12:00] Dr. Lex Fridman: The romantic side part.[2:12:01] Andrew Huberman: One point, Early days, we worked on cuttlefish, and they have multiple hearts and they but they pump green blood, believe it or not. Very fascinating animal. Speaking of of hearts And, green blood, earlier today before we sat down, I solicited, 4 questions on Instagram in a brief post. So, do you wanna If[2:12:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: you'll look at some of them?[2:12:24] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Let's take these in real time. My podcast team is always teasing me that I never have any charge on my phone. I'm one of these people that likes to run-in the, Running the yellow or whatever it is. It's an iPhone?[2:12:37] Andrew Huberman: Phone.[2:12:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[2:12:37] Andrew Huberman: No. We need help.[2:12:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: What was the iPhone people are out of batteries?[2:12:41] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I just got a new one. So I mean, this one has plenty of battery. I just got a new one. So I have I have different numbers for different, things, personal and work, etcetera. I'm trying that Now, alright.[2:12:54] Andrew Huberman: Get into the,[2:12:55] Dr. Lex Fridman: I have a I have a chest thing too to mention to you.[2:12:58] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yes, please. Will I insult you if I if I look up these questions as you ask me? Okay.[2:13:03] Dr. Lex Fridman: No. No. But I will insult you by asking this question because I think it's hilarious. So there's been a controversy about cheating Okay. Or Hans Neiman, who's a 27 100 player.[2:13:13] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I saw that clip on your Clips channel. Mhmm. By the way, I love your Clips channel, but I listen to your full channel.[2:13:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: The big accusation, is that he cheated by having I mean, it's it's half joke, but it's starting to get me to wonder whether, so that you can cheat by having vibrating anal beads. So you can send messages to,[2:13:35] Andrew Huberman: let's rephrase that statement. Not you can, but 1 can.[2:13:39] Dr. Lex Fridman: 1 can. One cat.[2:13:40] Andrew Huberman: Thank you.[2:13:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: That was a personal attack. Yes. But it's it made me realize I mean[2:13:44] Andrew Huberman: I'm just gonna adjust myself[2:13:46] Dr. Lex Fridman: in my brain. Here. I use it all the time for podcasting. I send myself messages, to remind me myself of notes. Okay.[2:13:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: But it's interesting. I mean, it It,[2:13:56] Andrew Huberman: I'm not gonna call you again.[2:13:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. That's exactly where I keep my phone. The the the it It did get me down this whole rabbit hole of, well, how would you be able to send communication In order to cheat in different sports. I mean, that doesn't even have to do with, chess in particular, but it's interesting in chess and poker that there's, There's mechanisms sort of modern day where you're streaming live the competition so people can watch it on TV. If they can only send you a signal back Mhmm.[2:14:32] Dr. Lex Fridman: They you know, it's it's just like a fun little thing to think about And if it's possible to pull off. So I I wanted to get your scientific evaluation of that technique.[2:14:43] Andrew Huberman: Cheat using some sort of interoceptive device.[2:14:46] Dr. Lex Fridman: Like Yeah. Vibrating of some kind. Yeah. Well No. No.[2:14:49] Dr. Lex Fridman: That's one way to send signals is like Morse code, basically.[2:14:52] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So there's a famous I believe there's a famous real world story of physics Students I'm gonna get some of this wrong. So I'm saying this, in kind of course form so that somebody will correct this. But, I believe it was physics graduate students from UC Santa Cruz or somewhere else. Maybe it was Caltech.[2:15:14] Andrew Huberman: Bunch of universities so that no one, You know, associates are the name 1 university that went to Vegas and used some sort of tactile device kind of, card counting, I think. This was actually demonstrated also, not this particular incident, I don't think, in the movie Casino where there was they where they spotted, I remember Robert De Niro, who you you have a, not so vague resemblance to, by the way, in taxi driver.[2:15:43] Dr. Lex Fridman: God, I wish I had a a hero impression right now.[2:15:47] Andrew Huberman: Travis Bickle. Look it up, folks. Travis Bickle is, you know, if Lex ever shaved his head into a mohawk, I would Okay. So they he had a The tapping device on his ankle that was signaling someone else was counting cards and then signaling to that person. So, yeah, that could be done in the tactile way.[2:16:06] Andrew Huberman: It could be done, obviously, earpieces. If it's deep earpiece, I think that there are ways that they look for that. Certainly, any kind of vibrational device in whatever orifice, provided someone could pay attention to that while still playing the game. Yeah. I think it's it's entirely possible.[2:16:21] Andrew Huberman: Now could it be done purely neurally? You know, could there be something that was, and listen. It wouldn't have to even be below the skull. This is where whenever people hear about Neuralink or brain machine interface, they always think, oh, to drill down below the skull and put a chip below into the skull. I think there are people walking around nowadays with, glucose monitoring devices like Levels, which I've used, and It was very informative for me actually, as a kind of an experiment.[2:16:45] Andrew Huberman: It gave me a lot of interesting insights about my blood sugar regulation, how it reacts from foods, etcetera. Well, You know, you can implant a, tactile device below the skin with a simple incision. Actually, one of the neurosurgeons at Neuralink, I I know well because he came up, at some point through my laboratory and was at Stanford. And he actually has put in a radio receiver in his hand, and his wife has it too. And he can open locks and At of his house and things like that.[2:17:11] Andrew Huberman: So he's[2:17:12] Dr. Lex Fridman: Under the skin?[2:17:12] Andrew Huberman: Under the skin. Yeah. You can go[2:17:14] Dr. Lex Fridman: to How does that work? So how do you use[2:17:15] Andrew Huberman: A piercer. You go to a, you know, a a Body piercer type Yeah. Person, and they can just slide it under there. And and it's got a battery life of something and, you know, some fairly long duration.[2:17:25] Dr. Lex Fridman: How do you experience the tact the the haptics of it is[2:17:28] Andrew Huberman: That just allows him to open certain locks with just his hand, but you could easily put some sort of tactile device in there.[2:17:35] Dr. Lex Fridman: But does it have to connect to the nerves, or is it just, like, just vibration?[2:17:39] Andrew Huberman: Just vibration. And, you know You[2:17:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: can probably sense it even if it's just gonna wonder[2:17:42] Andrew Huberman: And it can be by it can be Bluetooth linked. I mean, you know, I've seen there's a engineering laboratory at the University of Illinois, Champaign, Urbana that's got an amazing device, which is about the size of a Band Aid. It goes on the clavicles, and it uses, sound waves pinned into the body to measure cavitation. I think about the this for a moment. This is being used in the military where, let's say, you're leading an operation or something, people are getting shot shot at.[2:18:08] Andrew Huberman: And on a laptop, you can see where the bullet entry points are. Are people dead? Are they bleeding out? You know, entry exit points. You can get if take it out of the battlefield scenario, you can get breathing body position 24 hours a day.[2:18:23] Andrew Huberman: There's so much that you can do looking at cavitation. So These same sorts of devices that are on 12 hour Bluetooth could be used to, send all sorts of soon. May maybe every time, you're supposed to hold your hand. I'm I'm not a good gambler, so I only play roulette when I go to Vegas because I you're just long boring and, you know, games where you get to you get some good mileage out of each out of each run usually. But the, you know, maybe every time, you're supposed to hold, the person gets sort of a like a stomach cinching because this is, you know, stimulating the Vegas a little bit, and they get a little bit of an so it doesn't have to be, Morse code.[2:18:57] Andrew Huberman: It can be yes, no, maybe.[2:18:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[2:18:59] Andrew Huberman: Right? It can maybe you know, it could be, green, red, yellow type signaling. It doesn't have to be very sophisticated to give somebody a significant advantage. Anyway, I haven't thought about this in detail, before this conversation, but oh, yeah. There's an an immense landline.[2:19:13] Dr. Lex Fridman: I don't know if you know, poker player named Phil Ivey.[2:19:16] Andrew Huberman: No. I I don't follow the the gambling.[2:19:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, he's he's considered to be one of the greatest poker players of all time. Legitimately, you know, he's just incredibly good, but he got, there's this big case where he was accused of cheating and prove and it's not really cheating, which is what's really fascinating, is it turns out, so he plays poker. Texas hold them mostly, but all kinds of poker. It turns out that the the grid on the back of the cards is often printed a little bit imperfectly. And so you can, use the asymmetry of the imperfections to Try to figure out certain cards.[2:19:56] Dr. Lex Fridman: So if you play and you remember that a certain card is like I think the 8 in that deck that he was accused of, an 8 and 9 or slightly different asymmetry wise. So he can now, ask the dealer actually to rotate it to check the Symmetry. So you would ask the dealer to rotate the card to see that there's to detect the asymmetry of the back of the card. And now he knows which cards are eights and nines And or likelier to be eights and nines, and he was using that information to play to play poker and win a lot of money, but it's just a slight advantage. And, his cases and in fact, the judge found this that he's not actually cheating, but it's not right.[2:20:40] Dr. Lex Fridman: You[2:20:48] Andrew Huberman: It's fascinating, and I think that, you know, I I did watch that clip about the potential of a cheating event in chess and and the fact that a number of chess players admit to cheating at some point in their career, very, very interesting[2:21:03] Dr. Lex Fridman: It was online. So online cheating is Easier. Right? When you're playing online cheating in a game where the machine is much better than a human, it's very difficult to prove that you're human. And that applies, by the way, another really big thing is in social media, the bots, to if you're running a social media company, you have to deal with the bots.[2:21:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: And they become one of the really exciting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence to me is the The very fast improvement of language models. So neural networks that generate text, then interpret text, that generate from text images and all that kind of stuff. But that's you're now going to create incredible bots that look awfully a lot like Humans.[2:21:45] Andrew Huberman: Well, at least they're not gonna be those crypto bots that seem to populate my comment section when I post anything on Instagram. I should delete those even though they add to the comment, roster. And, you know, if it's just they bother me so much.[2:21:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah.[2:21:58] Andrew Huberman: It is I spend, you know, at least 10, 15 minutes on each buzz just deleting those. I don't know what they need to do, but I'm not interested in, those, whatever it is they're offering. Speaking of non bots, I'm gonna assume that all the questions are are not from bots. There are a lot of questions here. More than 10,000 questions.[2:22:17] Andrew Huberman: Goodness. I'll just take a few working from top to bottom. What ideas have you been wrestling with lately? And I think about the the company as one, but as I scroll to the next, what are what are some others?[2:22:35] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, some of the things we've talked about, which is the, ideas of how to understand what is True. What is true about a human being? How to reveal that? How to reveal that through conversation? How to challenge that properly?[2:22:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: That It leads to understanding, not diversion. So that that applies to everybody from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin. Also, another idea is there's a deep distrust of science in trying to understand the growing distrust of science, trying to understand what's the role Of those of us that have a a foot in the scientific community, how to be how to regain some of that trust. Also, there's, as soon as we talked about the, how to find and how to, yeah, how to how to find and how to maintain a good relationship. I mean, that's really been I've I've never felt quite as lonely as I have this year With Ukraine, it's just like so many times I would just lay there and just feeling so deeply alone because I felt That's my home, not my home, like, literally, because I'm an American.[2:23:53] Dr. Lex Fridman: I love I'm a proud American. I I'll die an American. But my home in the sense of my generationally, my family's home is now going is now has been changed forever. There's no more being proud of being from the former Russia or Ukraine. Isn't just it's now a political message to say if If you ought to do show your pride.[2:24:18] Dr. Lex Fridman: And so it's been extremely lonely. And within that world, if with all the things I'm pursuing, how do you find a successful relationship? That's been that's been tough. Obviously and there's a huge number of technical ideas with the start up of, like, how the hell do you make this thing work?[2:24:32] Andrew Huberman: Well, the the relationship topic is 1 we talk A little bit about and last time, we we touched on I'm in a little bit more detail. We're gonna come back to that. So I've I've made a note here. What or who inspired Lex, you, to wear a suit every time you podcast? That's a good question.[2:24:51] Andrew Huberman: I don't know the answer to that.[2:24:54] Dr. Lex Fridman: So there are 2 2 answers to that question. 1 is a suit, and 2 is a black suit and black tie. Because I used to do I used to have more variety, which is like there it was always a black suit, but I would sometimes do a red tie and a blue tie. But that was mostly me trying to fit into society because, like, varieties, you're supposed to have some variety. What inspired me is, At first, was a general culture that that doesn't take itself seriously in terms of how you present yourself to the world.[2:25:30] Dr. Lex Fridman: So in academia, in the tech world, just at Google, everybody was wearing, like, pajamas and, like, very relaxed in the the tech, I don't know how it is in the science in the, like, chemistry, biology, and so on. But in, computer science, everybody was, like, very, I mean, very relaxed in terms of the stuff they wear, so I wanted to try to really take myself seriously And take every single moment serious in everything I do seriously, and the suit made me feel that way. I don't know how it looks, but it made me feel that way. And I think in terms of people I look up to that wore a suit that made me think of that is is probably Richard Feynman.[2:26:09] Andrew Huberman: I see a wonderful human being.[2:26:11] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. I see him as, like, the epitome of class and humor and brilliance. And, You know, obviously, I I can never come close to that kind of, you know, be able to simply explain really complicated ideas And to have humor and wit, but definitely aspire to that. And then there's just the, you know, Mad Men, that whole era of the there's a classiness of that. There's something about a suit that both, removes the importance of fashion From the character, you see the person.[2:26:46] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think, not to I forgot who said this. Might be like Coco Chanel or something like this. Is that, you know, you you wear a shabby dress, and everyone sees the dress. You wear, a beautiful dress, and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense, I it was, hopefully, I'm quoting that correctly.[2:27:11] Dr. Lex Fridman: But,[2:27:12] Andrew Huberman: Sounds good.[2:27:13] Dr. Lex Fridman: I I think there's a sense in which a simple, classy suit Allows people to focus on your character and then do so, like, with the full responsibility of that. Like, this is who I am.[2:27:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I love that, and I I love what you said just prior to that. You know, my father who, again, is always asking me why I don't dress formally like you do, Always said to me growing up, if you overdress slightly, at least people know that you took them seriously. So it's a sign a sign of respect for your audience too in my eyes. Someone asked, is there an AI equivalent of, psychedelics.[2:27:55] Andrew Huberman: And I I'm assuming they mean, is there something that machines can do for Themselves in order to alter their neural circuitry through unconventional activation patterns.[2:28:07] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. Obviously. It's well, I don't know exactly how psychedelics work, but you you can see that with, all the diffusion models now with DALL E and the Stable diffusion that generates from text, art. And there's a it's basically in a small injection of noise, into a system that has a deep representation of visual information. So it's able to convert text To art in in introducing uncertainty into that, noise into that, that's kinda maybe.[2:28:43] Dr. Lex Fridman: I I could see that as a parallel to psychedelics and is able to create some incredible things. From a from a conceptual understanding of a thing, it can create incredible art that no human, I think could have at least easily created through a bit of introduction of randomness. Randomness does a lot of work in the machine learning world. Just enough.[2:29:06] Andrew Huberman: There are a lot of requests of you for relationship, A lot of requests about statistics about you, data about you specifically. Flipping past those,[2:29:22] Dr. Lex Fridman: What was[2:29:22] Andrew Huberman: the hardest belt to achieve in jiu jitsu? I would have assumed the black belt, but is that actually true? No.[2:29:29] Dr. Lex Fridman: I mean, everybody has a different journey through jiu jitsu, as people know. For me, the black belt was the ceremonial belt, which is not usually the case because I fought the wars like, I trained twice a day for, I don't know how many years, 7, 8 years. I competed nonstop. I competed against people much better than me. I competed against many and beaten many black belts and brown belts.[2:29:58] Dr. Lex Fridman: I think, for me personally, The hardest belt was the the brown belt. Because for people who know jiu jitsu, the the Size of tournament divisions for blue belts and purple belts is just humongous. Like, worlds, when I competed at worlds, it was like 140 people in a division, which means you have to win, I forget how many times, but 7, 8, 9 times in a row to to to meddle. And so I just had to put in a lot of work during that time. And especially for competitors, instructors usually Really make you earn a belt.[2:30:38] Dr. Lex Fridman: So to to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult extremely difficult. And then to earn the brown belt means I had to compete nonstop against other Purple bells, which are young. You're talking about like, the people that usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25 year olds. They're like shredded, Incredible cardio. They can for some reason, are in their life worth they can do.[2:30:59] Dr. Lex Fridman: No kids. Nothing. They can dedicate everything to this pursuit, 2. So they're training 2, 3, 4 times a day. Diet is on point.[2:31:07] Dr. Lex Fridman: You're going and for me, because, You know, they're usually bigger and taller than me and just more aggressive actual good athletes. Yeah. I had to go to through a lot of[2:31:18] Andrew Huberman: wars to earn that brown belt. But they gotta try this jujitsu thing.[2:31:21] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yeah. You should. But it's a different[2:31:23] Andrew Huberman: I tried. You I did the 1 class, but I I really want to embrace it.[2:31:27] Dr. Lex Fridman: As you know, Many pursuits like digits are different to do in your twenties and thirties and later. It's like it's a different you can't you're not you know, you can have a bit of an ego in your 20s. You can have that fire under you, but you should be sort of more zen like and wise and patient, later in life.[2:31:48] Andrew Huberman: Well, one would hope. That's the wisdom.[2:31:52] Dr. Lex Fridman: Well, I think Rogan is still a meathead. He still goes hard and crazy, and he's still super competitive that so some people can Jocko is somebody like that.[2:32:01] Andrew Huberman: Well, whatever they're doing, they're doing something right because they're still in it, and, that's super impressive. There were, far too many questions to to ask all of them, but, several, if not many, asked a Highly appropriate question for where we are in the arc of this discussion. And this is 1, admittedly, that you ask in your podcast, all the time, but I get the great pleasure of being in the the question asker seat today. And so What is your advice to young people?[2:32:37] Dr. Lex Fridman: So I just gave a lecture at MIT, and The amount of love I got there is incredible. And so, of course, what you're who you're talking to is usually undergrads, maybe young graduate students. And so there 1 person did ask for advice, as a question at the end. I did a bunch of q and a. So my answer was, that the world will tell you to find a work life balance, to, To sort of explore, to try to Try different fields to see what you really connect with, you know, variety, general education, all that kind of stuff.[2:33:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: And I said, in your twenties, I think you should find one thing you're passionate about and work harder at that than you worked at anything else in your life. And if it destroys you, it destroys you. That's advice for in your twenties. I don't know how University true that advices, but I think at least give that a chance. Like, sacrifice, real sacrifice towards, A thing you really care about and work your ass off.[2:33:52] Dr. Lex Fridman: That said, I've met so many people, and I'm starting to think that advice is is best applied or best tried in the engineering disciplines, especially programming. I think there's a bunch of disciplines in which you can achieve success with much fewer hours, and it's much more important to actually have A clarity of thinking and great ideas and have an energetic mind. Like, the grind in certain disciplines does not produce great work. I just know that in computer science and programming, it often does. Some of the best people ever that have built system, have programmed systems, I usually like the John Carmack kind of people that drink soda, eat pizza, and program, you know, 18 hours a day.[2:34:38] Dr. Lex Fridman: So I don't know, actually. I you you have to, I think, really go discipline specific. So my advice applies to my own life, which has mostly spent behind the computer. And for that, you really, really have to put in the hours. And what that means is, essentially, it feels like a grind.[2:34:57] Dr. Lex Fridman: I do recommend that you should at least try it in your own. That, if you interview some of the most accomplished people ever. I think if they're honest with you, they're gonna talk about their twenties as as, as a journey of a lot of pain and a lot of really hard work. I think what really happens, unfortunately, is a lot of those successful people later in life will will talk about work life balance. They'll say, you know what I learned from that process is that it's really important, you know, to get, like, sun in the morning, to have Health, to have good relationships Hire a chef.[2:35:35] Dr. Lex Fridman: Yes. Right. Exactly. But, like, I think you have forgot those people have forgotten The value of the journey they took to that lesson. I think work, life balance is best learned the hard way.[2:35:50] Dr. Lex Fridman: My my my own perspective. There's certain things you can only learn the hard way, and so you should learn that the hard way. Yeah. So that that's definitely advice. And I should say that I admire people that work hard.[2:36:04] Dr. Lex Fridman: If you wanna get on my good side, I think are the people that give everything they got towards something. It doesn't actually matter what it is, But towards achieving, excellence in a thing, I that's that's the highest thing that we can reach for as human being, I think, is excellence at a thing.[2:36:27] Andrew Huberman: I love it. Well, speaking of excellence at a thing, whether or not it's Teaching at MIT or the podcast or the the company that resides in the near future that you create, I I once again, I'm speaking for an enormous number of people that, you know, excellence and hard work certainly are woven through everything that you do. Every time I sit down with you, I begin and finish with, such an immense feeling of Joy and appreciation and gratitude. And, it wouldn't be a Lex Fridman podcast or in Case of a Lex Raymond being a guest on a podcast if the word love weren't mentioned at least 10 times. So, the feelings of Gratitude for all the work you do for taking the time here today to to share with us what you're doing, your thoughts, your insights, your, what you're perplexed about, and and What drives you and and your callings?[2:37:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: Can I read a poem?[2:37:27] Andrew Huberman: Yes, please. He was trying to cut me off, but I was I was getting a little long. No.[2:37:32] Dr. Lex Fridman: No. No. No. This is, I was thinking about this recently. It's one of my favorite Robert Frost poems.[2:37:38] Dr. Lex Fridman: And I, because I wrote several essays on it as you do because I think it's Popular one that's read. And so essays being, like, trying to interpret poetry, and it's one that sticks with me, I mean, both as calm beauty, but in the seriousness of what it means. Because I ultimately think It's the, no. So stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening. I think it's ultimately a human being, a man asking The the old Sisyphus, the old Camus question of why live, I think this poem, Even though it doesn't seem like it is a question of a man contending with suicide and choosing to live Whose whose woods these are, I think I know.[2:38:26] Dr. Lex Fridman: His house is in the village, though. He will not see me stopping here to watch his Woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake, the darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there's some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.[2:38:52] Dr. Lex Fridman: The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, But I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep. The woods representing the darkness, the comfort of the woods representing death, and he is a man choosing to live. Yeah. I think about that often, especially in my dark darker moments, is, you have promises to keep. Thank you for having me, Andrew.[2:39:24] Dr. Lex Fridman: You're a beautiful human being.
