Kronikle AI - Dr. Andy Galpin: Optimal Nutrition & Supplementation for Fitness | Huberman Lab Guest Series - TranscriptDr. Andy Galpin: Optimal Nutrition & Supplementation for Fitness | Huberman Lab Guest Series - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the 6th and final of the 6 episode series on fitness, exercise, and performance. And today's discussion is all about nutrition and supplementation to maximize your fitness, exercise, and performance goals, doctor Andy Galpin. I'm super excited to discuss today's topic, which is nutrition and supplementation for performance and recovery.[0:00:34] Andrew Huberman: And I'm particularly excited about this conversation because I've been interested in supplementation and nutrition for performance really since my teens, but also because in recent years, we've witnessed a massive transformation in the general public in terms of their view of supplementation and nutrition. First of all, more people Our thinking about nutrition, what is good nutrition, what is not, a very barbed wire topic as you know, but there are some truths in there that we'll discuss, but also supplementation. You know, whereas 10, 15 years ago, I think most people, would either be really into supplements. That was a small percentage of people. But the majority of people, were either told or were thinking, oh, you know, vitamins, you you mostly excrete them.[0:01:16] Andrew Huberman: They're just expensive urine. Nowadays, it seems that many people, including many of my colleagues and physicians all the way down to sports performance experts, are taking and making recommendations about certain supplements. And so the way that I like to think about supplements is That they aren't necessarily just supplements, which makes it sound like they are augmenting what should already be there, but you're not quite getting enough of. But indeed, a lot of these things we call supplements are very potent compounds that can transform our ability to perform in the short term, to recover from exercise, and that can really shape brain chemistry, hormone patterns acutely and when taken long term. So So I'm very excited about today's topic and to be able to try and sort through this let's call it a a cloud.[0:02:06] Andrew Huberman: Hopefully, not a storm, but this cloud of Supplements that are out there, because indeed, many of them are excellent and can provide us a lot. Some of them are terrible, And then some just don't do anything and therefore are terrible because, either they have side effects or because they're very expensive and they don't do anything. And then, of course, within the realm of nutrition, there's an equal amount of of confusion. But that's why I'm talking to you, because you're gonna put clarity and structure and definition on these incredibly important topics.[0:02:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: You you absolutely nailed it there. One of the major reasons supplements can work is because you can consume nutrients in extremely high concentrations in such that you would not get in nature through food. Having said that, you really do wanna focus on the basics, sleep, nutrition, hydration, and I'm going to get into very civic detail later with some of those things. That said, there are plenty of situations and circumstances when supplementation can do exactly what you said. Also though, because you are taking them in such high concentrations, they can also be unproductive, they can be destructive, or they can be counterproductive.[0:03:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in case if you're taking a couple of supplements over here, it may actually be counteracting the benefits of some of the other supplements It's over there. So in the ideal situation, we would be able to work like snipers here. So we would be able to run full Biological testing. So extensive blood work and saliva and urine and stool, and have an in-depth analysis of your gut microbiome and your stress patterns and Your time of day and your cortisol curve and, like, all the things that we do in our high performance folks. With that then, we can get extremely high precision supplementation.[0:03:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: And And quite honestly, our philosophy is we only give individuals exactly what they need. So even some of the standard, generally safe and effective Supplements, we don't really necessarily use them if there's no specific need. We've talked about the consequences of this with things like antioxidants, but even Simple stuff like stimulants and other tools that are effective for recovery, we don't use them unless we have a reason. That said, that's That's not the reality for a lot of people. They're not gonna be able to do something like that or work somebody who can help them in that.[0:04:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there are a handful of supplements that I would consider to be in my My 80/20 rule, which is sort of like the 20% of supplements that are gonna give you 80% of the benefit for the lowest cost. And And so what I can actually use to sort of start there even though this, like, burns my skin and my soul a little bit. I absolutely hate this. I am the context guy. I'm the it depends.[0:04:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's high precision guy. But let's be real. There are a number of supplements that are fairly effective and fairly cheap for a wide range of outcomes. So this is for general public. This is for People who wanna do the 3 buckets.[0:04:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? You wanna look a certain way, so supplements that could enhance muscle growth and fat loss, non hormonal based supplements, of course. Supplements that can improve energy or physical performance. Again, from everything from, you know, squatting more to Feeling better in your yoga class to having more energy throughout the day, to our 3rd major bucket that we've been talking, about throughout this entire series, which are longevity. So we can cover those first if you'd like to start there.[0:05:14] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Absolutely. Let's start there.[0:05:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oftentimes, when we think of supplements, we immediately jump to high sport performance type of things Or vigorous workouts or or muscle building. Though that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. Take for example creatine. And I've spoken about this at length and some with Darren Darren Kandow, Who's done a tremendous amount of research. I was just up at his lab recently in Canada, and he has covered extensively.[0:05:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, I I think I put up a post perhaps I could draw this up, Where he laid out all the myriad of benefits of creatine. This is taken in the, you know, typically 3 to 5 grams per day of dose of creatine monohydrate, Which has the most research behind it, seems to be extremely low side effects in almost anyone. And the benefits including course, things like, muscle performance and strength and things like that. And if you go back to our Discussion in our episode on metabolism and and endurance, we talked about the phosphocreatine system. So you can figure out kind of what this is going to do in terms of effect.[0:06:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: That said, There's excellent information and data coming out now on the benefits of bone mineral density in creatine. There's a ton of work Looking at a host of cognitive factors, from memory, executive function, to affects potentially on even things like depression, mood, to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, All forms of of neurodegenerative disease, in fact, it's it's pretty obvious. The brain loves creatine as a fuel. And so not only we were sort of discussed in the episode as being the fuel for skeletal muscle contraction, but the brain needs to do that as well. The astrocytes around the brain need to be able to ride energy, etcetera.[0:06:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So It's very clear that metabolism in the brain is reduced with things like TBI and potentially concussions. So, now to be extremely clear, Creatine does not prevent any of those diseases. It does not treat any of them, and the data are mixed. But it more and more are coming. Some show A little bit of benefits, some shown, you know, maybe none, but I'm not aware of any research in those areas that show it has any downside.[0:07:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: For the most part, side effects are extremely minimal, if not null, and then potentially some benefit and depending on the specific study. So we could put up a, if you'd like, a couple of Links directly to those meta analyses and and folks can go through those things 1 by 1. So, I only say that to, again, maybe expand our understanding or thinking about what these types of supplements can do. It's not just about growing muscle or, you know, high performance. It's everything to again, there's an association with recovery.[0:07:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: So creatine is fantastic for recovery from muscle, from muscle damage, helps, and and can potentially aid in fat loss, and a whole host of things. So You can actually also even look at websites like examine.com. I have, you know, no affiliation with them whatsoever. But if you wanna just type In something like creatine monohydrate, you can see a whole list, and you're going to see thousands of studies of the potential benefits, of creatine. So that is is always Always number 1 on my list.[0:08:15] Andrew Huberman: I'm relieved to hear that creatine sits at the top of your supplementation list because, well, first of all, I started taking it when I was in college. At that time, I was taking it this kind of loading mode where you take it in, you know, anywhere from, 15 to 25 grams per day, often causing some gastric Stress often combining with fruit juice to try and shuttle it into the muscles Sure. And then, so called maintenance phase of reducing to 10 or 15 grams per day. Nowadays, I just take about 5 grams or so. Although later, I know you're gonna tell me why I should probably be taking more than 5 grams per day Given my body weight, so I know we'll get into some of those specifics a little bit later.[0:08:53] Andrew Huberman: But in addition to experiencing direct effects on, muscle size and strength, which I did. I don't know how it contributed to my cognitive function or if it does now because there's really no way to tease that out with with standard, at home tests like a scale. But it is very clear to me based on the literature, that you described and, some of which we've covered on other episodes of the podcast that the phosphocreatine system is vitally important for forebrain function. Right? The forebrain, of course, being the, the, portion of brain broadly speaking, the portion of brain just behind your forehead that is, responsible for planning, action, setting rules, and context.[0:09:33] Andrew Huberman: So, even as simple as if you're going downfield in a game of soccer or basketball and you're on offense, and then, you make an attempt on goal or basket, and then it switches and you go back. Now you're on defense. That it's being on defense is very different than being on offense, and that goals excuse me. That That rule switching is a prefrontal cortical function as is every context dependent way of thinking or or acting. And so Anything that can favor function of the forebrain, I think is good for, humans in general.[0:10:02] Andrew Huberman: It suppresses anxiety, allows us to interpret what's going on for us. And so I'm very, Relieved and gratified to hear that creatine sits at the top of the list. Also, as I'm sure you'll point out again later, creatine is, for the most part, a relatively affordable supplement and for most people so here, we're not talking about something that's really esoteric or that you have to, you know, fly to, some remote location to get an infusion of. Right. But that's[0:10:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Although I apologize to all you because I know the price has skyrocketed recently.[0:10:29] Andrew Huberman: Really? Yeah. Why is that?[0:10:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think it's just well, nobody knows, but it's quote, unquote, a supply And, demand issue, if you will. So, those prices have gone up. There's also, of course, been shipping problems in the world and Things so, every time I I talk about creatine right now, people just flame me Mhmm. For like, oh my god. It's so expensive now.[0:10:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm like, I am. I'm sorry. But honestly, It's only so expensive because you're used to being so cheap. So when you when you counter the fact that we're like[0:10:56] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:10:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Like, relative to the other stuff you're probably relative to any other number of purchases, for the it still lands very high on my ROI list, my, you know, my 80/20 because of that. It's it's, it can be taken any time of the day. It doesn't have to be in magical combination. You talked about co ingesting with carbohydrates.[0:11:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: That can enhance, how quickly you can get in the system. In fact, it's it's it's gonna work on the exact same mechanisms. We'll probably or potentially talk about hydration. But these things are shuttled. Anytime you bring in carbohydrate, that's going to be shipped into tissue as quickly as it can.[0:11:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Creatine then goes long for the ride, and then brings water. Alright. That's how you enhance hydration. That's why it's important to have carbohydrates when you're trying to hydrate. So you're just gonna take it in there, and that's also why you get quote, unquote, cell swelling, which is a good thing.[0:11:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, you're it's just enhancing hydration. We actually use it a ton in our post weigh in protocols. So in individuals that have to cut water weight, creatine's a great thing to throw back in there. It's gonna help you rehydrate. It's also why when you take 30 grams of it, it can pull a bunch of fluid in the intestines and and there you go with your little bit of GI distress.[0:11:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, yeah. There's a lot of fun things you could talk about there. I just had to flag that because every time I've been talking about it recently and I say it's g, people are Killing me for it, so I apologize. I don't know how to make it any cheaper, but it's still fairly fairly affordable.[0:12:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I would say relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of supplements out there. And when It's out there. And when thinking about the return on investment is, it's quite good.[0:12:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So, like, actually sorry sorry to cut you off, but I was just also thinking, there's been a number of studies on, sleep deprivation as well with creatine. That can help. So obviously, sleep deprivation will Generally reduced cognitive function, and creatine can ameliorate some of that drop. So if you think about it in that context, I had a crummy night of sleep.[0:12:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well and if that enables you to perform a little bit better in your job, then you would make up the dollar or so whatever you paid for that day's supply of creatine. So, it is something I kinda on that note, it's not going to work as an acute response. So it's not something you're like, I feel terrible. Let me throw some creatine down the hatch. I'll feel better.[0:12:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: That that's not gonna It's going to take several weeks to have a noticeable effect. It needs to be stored in tissue. It needs to be built up before you can actually do much of anything. So It is unlike some of the other things like stimulants or caffeine that have an acute, you know, response right now. And so if you're going to take it, you probably need to consume it consistently.[0:13:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you can't do that, then really there's no point in doing it. And the loading phase you mentioned, distance we're here, is something you can do, again, if you need to enhance the storage of it really quickly. So say for example, We've done this in some military cases, where it's like you get back to base and you've only got a week, and then you gotta go back out. We may actually have to, do a little bit of a loading phase then. But if that's not the case, the loading phase is unnecessary.[0:13:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not really harmful other than maybe GI stress and maybe Waste. But you're gonna have 3 or 4 weeks. It's gonna reach full saturation. Plenty of time to to be there in that if you're in that 3 to 7 grams per day range.[0:13:48] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you mentioned the slow accumulating positive effects of creatine as compared to so called acute effects. Because the way that I think of Health promoting and performance enhancing protocols like viewing morning sunlight or, endurance exercise for that matter or creatine or sleep, for instance, is that while they can have effects in the immediate term, you might feel a little bit, or in the case of a good night sleep, a lot better. It's really the cumulative effect of raising your baseline level of functioning. You know, there's, another way to think about is, these Supplements or behaviors, and quality nutrition when done consistently over time, and that doesn't mean a 100% of the time, but, You know, probably 80% of the time Sure. Lead to a sort of buoyancy in your system that allows you to be more brilliant under conditions, where conditions aren't perfect.[0:14:42] Andrew Huberman: Right? And if conditions are made perfect or close to perfect and you already have that buoyancy, That's when you really start to see the ultra high performance effects, that are so much fun, but they have to be established through consistent Supplementation, consistent nutritional intake. So today, I know we're going to distinguish between, normally, they're called chronic and acute effects, but that Yep. Makes it sound like chronic illness, the moment people hear chronic, well, they might think of other things. But but in the context of health, they typically think of, you know, chronic illness, and we're not talking about that.[0:15:12] Andrew Huberman: What we're talking about is slow modulatory facts in the body. A lot of things in the body take time to build up, but once they've built up, they, they clearly can benefit us. And then other things as you mentioned, you know, a a stimulant, for instance Yep. Has a very acute effect that is going to occur with, you know, peak within 30 minutes and wear off within, you know, 4 hours or so. Can also have some chronic effects, but, typically, it's a short lived effect.[0:15:36] Andrew Huberman: So we just wanna frame up the the language that we'll be using, and I'm really excited to dive into this topic, and I think creatine is a beautiful example of a supplement that has positive, chronic, Mental and physical benefits.[0:15:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Down the road, I can come back and talk a little bit more about creatine, and we can cover some other information regarding best practices for getting the most out of it, as well as we'll certainly dive into some of the common side effects or at least a thought of side effects. While we're here though, I also could throw in a few other of these high impact, low cost, generally safe, things that are my 80/20 rule, if you will. So the way I actually kinda think about it is, you want 1 from each of 3 categories. And these categories are fuel, stimulant, and fatigue blockers. So creatine is actually in the fuel.[0:16:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not a stimulant. We talked about the chronic effect there. So we've already knocked that one off. Another one from the, fatigue blocker is It's gonna be anything like beta alanine or sodium bicarbonate. And then from the stimulant use, of course, we have anything like a beet root juice To a caffeine or, something of the equivalent.[0:16:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we can come back again and talk about all those in more detail, a little bit later.[0:16:51] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate for doctor Andy Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, We'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Momentous.[0:17:13] Andrew Huberman: Momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentous for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, Their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations.[0:17:35] Andrew Huberman: With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentous supplements ship internationally, and this is, of course, important because we realized that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for Focus as well as a number of other things, including exercise recovery. You can go to live momentous, spelled o u s, so that's live momentous.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.[0:18:08] Andrew Huberman: Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor. Many people are aware that their blood sugar, that is their blood glucose level, is critical for everything from Fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body. Most people do not know, however, how different foods and different activities including exercise or different temperatured environments impact their blood glucose levels, and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things. I first started using Levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods, exercise, and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night Impact My Blood Glucose Levels, and I've learned a tremendous amount from using Levels. It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat, when best to exercise, How best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep.[0:19:09] Andrew Huberman: So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. That's levels.link slash Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium, magnesium, and potassium To optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance, most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best.[0:19:36] Andrew Huberman: But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve cells, neurons in particular, requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize Is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet that is not a lot of processed foods, which, of course, is a good thing, Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. LMNT contains a science backed ratio Of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element, that's l m n t.com/huberman to get a free LMNT sample pack with your purchase.[0:20:26] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drink element, l m n t, .com/huberman to claim my free sample pack. To start off, I wanna ask you about something that as As soon as I say it, some people might roll their eyes or wonder why are we even talking about that now? But that I have to believe is among the more fundamental, if not foundational aspects of nutrition and supplementation for performance, and that's Hydration. Right? I mean, I think we hear hydration.[0:20:56] Andrew Huberman: It's like, okay. We have to drink 6 to 8 glasses of water every day. Our Our urine should be relatively clear. If it's too dark yellow, we're not doing a good job of hydrating enough.[0:21:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:21:06] Andrew Huberman: How much of that is true? Is alkaline water worthwhile for changing the alkalinity of my body. I learned when I was in college and graduate school that the alkalinity of the different Tissues in your body is very well controlled in order to keep you alive, and that you don't want it to shift too much or You can enter pretty horrible states of seizure, vomiting, and even death. So tell me about hydration and woven into that if you would, Educate me on electrolytes and hydration because I think most often when people ingest electrolytes, sure, they could be ingesting salt tablets. Probably getting some electrolytes.[0:21:44] Andrew Huberman: By the way, electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, potassium through their food. I think most people think about drinking electrolytes. So water and electrolytes, I think, is a vitally important topic to kick this off with.[0:21:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. We can jump right into your alkaline water. While there's perhaps much to say about this, we can maybe revisit this in another 7 part series all on its own. I would just say it this way. There's probably a few things you should do before worrying about the alkalinity of your water, and I'll I'll just leave it at that.[0:22:16] Andrew Huberman: Meaning the alkalinity of the water is is sort of irrelevant?[0:22:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not that You won't go that far. It's just it's probably remember we sort of started off talking about 80/20? Mhmm. Well, this would be in my, like, 99.1 in terms of, like, If we're really at the level of worrying about the pH of their your drinking fluid, we have optimized so many other things, then we can talk about it. But until we have nailed, months years of work on other things, this is just not gonna make much of an impact.[0:22:45] Andrew Huberman: Great. Then perhaps you could tell us about what volume of water we should be drinking, when we should be drinking that water relative to training, and just generally. And, yeah, and anything else related to water and electrolytes that can improve mental performance, physical performance, and offset any, you know, ill effects.[0:23:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: I like the Fact that you mentioned physical and mental performance because it's clear in both cases. We hear that we need to drink more water, and I can give you some numbers and I will in a second. What we also need to recognize is there's this is hormesis. We talked about hormesis a a few episodes ago. And this is the case.[0:23:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Whether we talked about food or hydration or I think I gave you the example cyanide, naturally occurring in your food. Hot water is the same way. So if you are under hydrated or dehydrated, And there is a clear negative effect on your body. And as I increase the level or improve the level of hydration, things get better, whether this is your physical performance or whether this is mental performance.[0:23:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, we know that A body weight reduction of as low as 2% via dehydration. So imagine you're doing a bout of exercise and you're sweating, and you lose 2% of your body weight. That alone is enough to reduce accuracy and performance. So the classic study we talk about here was in basketball players. So shooting accuracy, so free throw shooting, I think, is specifically what they looked at.[0:24:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Significant reduction in performance with as little as 2% dehydration. That that level, you also see a significant increase in perception of difficulty of exercise. And so only right at 2%. Now again, when I say 2%, I mean, percent body weight lost. Right?[0:24:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's what that means. You start getting the 3, 4, 5% dehydration, you start having a significant reduction in blood volume. And that's incredibly important for endurance. Your blood becomes viscous. It gets hard to pump through, and you're gonna start having all kinds of issues.[0:24:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So being dehydrated Is again not only going to reduce performance, but because of the mental aspect which we just walked through, and neuromuscular issue, you're You're gonna lose accuracy, you're gonna lose total endurance performance, and you're gonna lose speed and power. So we have the try out there. No matter what you're interested in, it's gonna be harmed by being dehydrated. That also is happening then if you're starting your program dehydrated. So, if you're already 1% or so dehydrated, maybe you're like a little under hydrated and you lose a little bit of sweat, you've already hit that 2%.[0:25:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so we're starting to see reductions, in performance there. The same happens on the other side of that hormetic curve. So if you are optimally hydrated in some large window, But you start going past that. We can start running into equal problems. Remember, there is a there is a need for an optimal concentration of sodium and potassium and chloride, between your cell inside your cell and outside your cell, these are electrolytes.[0:25:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is what we call osmolality and osmolarity. This is really good. Just think of it like concentration and osmosis, if you remember those terms. So if we are trying to create a muscle contraction that requires an electrical gradient, and so sodium and potassium, Specifically, in magnesium, calcium are positively charged, and chloride is negatively charged. And we need to have a certain amount inside the cell and outside the cell so that the positives and the negatives are balanced appropriately, so that when we move 1, we change the voltage and we have in the case of a muscle contraction.[0:25:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: K. I just skimmed through a whole lot of of physiology there To say, if you then go mess with fluid only and you say if I were to give you a bolus of, you know, 3 liters of pure water Right now, you're going to dilute your blood, and so there's not going to be as many chemical, there won't be as many electrical signals in there because you've taken the same amount of sodium, potassium, etcetera, and put it in a larger volume of pure water. So that gradient is now changed. That becomes a significant problem for contraction. I mean, quite literally, it can kill you.[0:26:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is what we call hyponatremia. So, atremia be spelled n a, hypo being low. Hyponatremia, if you actually go to the periodic chart, n a Is what we use for sodium. So hypon it's because the word is natriuremy actually. So that what that literally means is low sodium, and you didn't get that from sweating out all your Sodium, you actually get hyponatremia from drinking in too much water.[0:26:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's not that the total amount of sodium gets low, it's the fact that the concentration gets low from excessive fluid intake. So in the extremes, in fact, if you look at the the literature, you'll see, anywhere between, like, 2 to 15% of people who finish endurance races are Our Inda hyponatremia. Now that varies wildly if you're doing Ironman in Kona versus, like, you know, the marathon in Denver in In October, right, it's it's gonna be totally different depending on weather conditions, but these are all important. So while, like, death happens, that is sort of extreme. If you back up just a little bit, you start seeing the same types of performance saccharinents.[0:27:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, the symptoms can be identical. Brain fog, confusion, Performance, irritation, a GI distress. And you think, man, these are symptoms of dehydration, so then you drink more water. And you're just exacerbating the problem. And I can actually, give you one little example of this.[0:27:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: We had, an executive, actually a female CEO. I would say she's probably when her was in her early forties. And so she came to us and she thought, man, for sure, she has some sort of gut problem going on. Because we hear a lot about kinda like gut health and how it affects everything. And so He's just like, I have brain fog, and I've done all these things, and I got blood work done, and everything's fine, like, nothing's going on.[0:27:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think I must have some sort Good thing Eric going on or whatever is okay. And we just started going through her stuff, and, she was, I think, about a £170, plus or minus. And she was consuming, like, 250 to 60 ounces of water a day. That's a lot of water. That's a ton of water.[0:28:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we were like, holy shit. What are you doing this for? And she says, like, That's sort of like my thing. It was but she didn't realize it was more of like a nervous tic than it was anything else. Right?[0:28:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: She just like sip, sip, sip, sip, sip water. I'm like, man, How often do you go pee? And she's like, yeah. Like, every, you know, 30 minutes or something. I'm like, fantastic sleep problems, focus, and so she Smashing caffeine.[0:28:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: She was at, like, 8 cups of coffee a day.[0:28:36] Andrew Huberman: Which is also gonna add just to excretion of sodium.[0:28:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. Right? So it's like, okay. We don't really need to come in and run a sleep study on you. We're just gonna lower your water.[0:28:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: And she was like, what? We dropped her down to, like, 1.80. So basically, an ounce per pound of body weight, which is still high because she did train.[0:28:56] Andrew Huberman: 180 ounces. Correct. Yep.[0:28:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: She She does work out, so she need to replenish some stuff. And we'll cover these numbers in a second. Instantaneously, I mean, like, 2 days in, she's like, oh my god. I I haven't slept 6 to 8 hours in years. And then after that, it was like, basically, tears coming back to us.[0:29:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? My focus, my brain fog is gone because she's in a very high pressure job. Like, everything's coming back. Like, now she was down to 3 or so cups of coffee a day, blah blah blah. Like, the whole thing, digestion improved, all of it.[0:29:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: She was sick like, her only problem after all the analyses was she was just drinking way, way too much water. And adding more salt to her Would not have solved the problem because she would've just had simply way too much fluid in her system. She was having all kinds of ADH problems and aldosterone, like, the whole thing, and then That that rolls into cortisol, the whole, like, system gets goes into chaos. So, it is important that you pay attention to hydration, even though as you sort of mentioned, people tend to just kinda like roll their eyes around it. Because if you're in the middle, it's fine.[0:29:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: But if you're anywhere past, not even the extreme extremes, But just that 1st standard deviation away, you're gonna have problems, and you might be thinking adrenal fatigue. You might be thinking your like, you're gonna think all these things, and you simply just haven't Actually dialed in your hydration.[0:30:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think people sometimes roll their eyes at the discussion of hydration because it just doesn't sound very sexy. It's not like Doesn't sound like a neurotransmitter or a hormone. It just sound like testosterone or estrogen or DHEA or, dopamine, but it actually is all of those things. Yep.[0:30:27] Andrew Huberman: It sits at a level beneath all of those, but not beneath on a hierarchy, beneath in in terms of a foundation. It's actually the Without proper electrolyte balance and hydration, none of the cells of the body can function. And then I think people also hear that, oh, you know, we are 70% water, And somehow, like, that statistic alone, or that fact alone doesn't seem to, Stimulate any kind of action we'll take away. Right. It's like, great.[0:30:54] Andrew Huberman: You know? Like, gravity also, you know, keeps us, you know, from jumping as high as we like. You know? What do I do? And so I think, it's it's important that people understand that every cellular process in the body critically relies on having Enough sodium, magnesium, potassium around, and the the way that it's concentrated in fluid, water, is really the way that You allow every cell in your body to function as well as it possibly could and respond to all of the sorts of kind of, quote, unquote, high performance It's tools Yeah.[0:31:25] Andrew Huberman: That we're talking about. The other thing I've observed, many times over is that if people are ingesting too much water and also drinking a lot of caffeine and their electrolytes are low, They get shaky, and they actually can have anxiety like symptoms. So when people come into my lab to do studies on anxiety and fear, we ask a few questions, and, Those questions include how much water they've had that day. Also, a sort of bizarre fact, but one that, I think is worth mentioning is that when the bladder is full, Stimulates a sort of anxiety. If you ever had to urinate very badly and you're in the car or you can't urinate and then you get to the door, like, that's talk about anxiety.[0:32:01] Andrew Huberman: And that's because there's a direct neural pathway from the bladder that registers the mechanosensors, how much stretch there is on the bladder that sends a signal to the brainstem alertness Areas, broadly speaking, locus coeruleus and others, that wake us up. These are the when we're awake, it makes us more awake and when we're asleep, this is what wakes us up to urinate in the middle of the night.[0:32:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. That's actually why you can use, night urination as a a pretty good diagnostic of sleep disorders. So if because of vasopressin. Right? Almost exactly what you're talking about.[0:32:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're having sleep disorder issues and you're staying awake and, vasopressin gets Taking off right in APN, goes straight to the kidneys. Your kidneys are supposed to be dormant, basically, at night. You're not supposed to be filtering a lot of and producing a lot of urine at night. If that's happening and and say you You have any number of apneas kicking on or anything going on, vasopressin keeps going. Keeps sending signal, kidneys start filtering.[0:32:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're waking up and peeing multiple times a night, that's called nocturia. That is a very, very good sign that either 1 of 2 things happen. You 1, you have some sort of sleep disorder, or 2, you're drinking outrageous amounts of water. And so that's actually a bit of a backward cycle now. Right?[0:33:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because you're drinking way too much water, you're waking up and peeing all night. That's actually ruining your sleep. And we have seen this a number of times with our sleep company as we go in, and it's just like, you don't need any of this crap. You just need to be properly hydrated. Alternatively, if your hydration is sound and you're still waking up more than 1 time a night to pee on average, then you almost well, I shouldn't say like that.[0:33:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: But there's a potential that you actually have some sort of, sleep disorder or sleep condition going in. So the rule of thumb on that is over here. Once or night once a night or so of urination is fine. If it is routinely or consistently more than 2, you need to make some adjustments. Start with hydration.[0:33:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's the simplest way. Right? Getting a full sleep study done. Just figure out hydration. We we've had this happen a number of times where people wanna get more health conscious, and they just get they hear things like this, and they're like, I gotta get on my water, and then they just start train wrecking their sleep, and They're waking it up.[0:33:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're waking up multiple times and you're urinating and it is a large amount of urine for you, and it is clear, that's probably not Sleep apnea induced nocturia. That's probably excessive hydration. If you're waking up a bunch of times and it's fairly small amounts of urine, then it's probably not, the fluid issue. It's probably the fact that the vasopressin is kicking your kidneys into gear. So that's not a perfect criteria, but it it's just like a quick little tool you can sort of use.[0:34:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's actually one of the reasons why we measure almost always, your body weight at night as well as in the morning. So that that's it, Like the combat sport and the UFC fighters, boxers, we call that your float. So much you floated overnight. I like to know that number because I wanna know as well your 1st morning void. So when you wake up and you went to bed at £200, you woke up the next morning at 1.95.[0:34:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's like, oh, you floated £5. Did you pee last night? Yeah. Yeah. Three times.[0:34:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Interesting. Another case, you woke up you went to bed at £200. You wake up at 199.5. Oh, okay. You're dehydrated.[0:34:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because you should have a a certain amount of fluid that you're just respirating out as you're breathing throughout your nose throughout night ideally. Guaranteed you're gonna wake up. What was your urine like? Oh, yeah. A little bit pretty dark.[0:35:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like shocker, you're dehydrated. So you can kinda look at numbers like that. A general float is something like a pound to £2 for the 170 Plus pound person, as you scale up, that number can go up a little bit. But you can kinda use these to triage a little bit about what's going on, with this kind of combination, it's everything is everything. Right?[0:35:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's like, it's not just about 1 system, so you're gonna pay attention. You can also look, Well, I don't know. If you wanna jump into it, we can, but there's a whole bunch of ways I I can teach you to diagnose hydration. And then maybe we can start there, and then we could talk about hydration numbers.[0:35:37] Andrew Huberman: Yes. I'd love to talk about diagnostics for hydration, over hydration, dehydration. To start off, would you be willing to give us some numbers? How much water should we be drinking?[0:35:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: The classic rule here, and you're making me do what I hate. Right? I wanna give all the caveats first, but I'll go straight to your number. Half an ounce per pound of body weight is a rough rule. So if you weigh again 200 pounds, that would mean you drink a 100 ounces of water a day.[0:36:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most water bottles are, like, 12 to 20 ounces, something like that. So, you know, you end up drinking 6 of those or so a day, kinda like plus or minus, which is not that unreasonable. This does depend on a number of factors which I could Go over, but that is a a rough starting place. The only other thing to add to that is that does not account for exercise induced water loss Or sauna or anything like that. So that's assuming just like basal daily needs.[0:36:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you are, exercising or sweating at All for any reasons or work related. So, folks that work outside or in the heat or, a humid environment. These these numbers all change, and you can slide the scale up. But you generally wanna drink about a 125% of the fluids you've lost during that physical activity Back.[0:36:50] Andrew Huberman: And how much do you lose per hour of exercise?[0:36:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: The number ranges between 1 to £5 depending on the person. Nick can even be higher with some of our, athletes, like I can think of a number of NFL players right now. It's not uncommon for those guys who do 8 or £9. Even not even like crazy circumstances. If it's August and we're in Jacksonville, It's not wild for us those guys to go £9, £10.[0:37:12] Andrew Huberman: But what about the typical person who goes to a air conditioned gym or goes out for a run on a day that is somewhere Between, let's say, 55 degrees Fahrenheit and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.[0:37:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're probably looking at, like, a pound.[0:37:25] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[0:37:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not extremely high. If you are Totally soaked might be like a pound and a half to 2 pounds. If you're like come back and like your pits are a little sweaty and there's a little bit of water kind of on your neckline, It's probably like a more like a pound or so. So in that case, you might drink back a pound and a half of water.[0:37:43] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So just to review these numbers to make sure that I'm on the correct Page here. A half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight is a a sort of a foundation for hydration. And then you want to replace a 125% of the fluid lost during exercise. And exercise Varies where exercise is done varies whether or not people are wearing uniforms or helmets is gonna impact how much fluid they lose, etcetera.[0:38:14] Andrew Huberman: In a very hot environment, the the amount of fluid lost can be anywhere from, you know, 1 to 5, maybe even £10 Easy. Per hour of hard Heart exertion for most exercise done in conditions of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 7 to excuse me, 85 degrees Fahrenheit done with some degree of effort. One might lose a pound or or, 2 pounds of water.[0:38:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Super easy way to find out. All you have to do is weigh yourself naked, Go do your workout, come back in, dry off, weigh yourself naked. That'll tell you exactly what you lost. So if you went in, you were 100 £2, you come back out, you weigh, you won 58, you lost 2 pounds, drink back 2 and a half pounds of water. You're good.[0:38:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that is, is and honestly, it's like fairly gold standard for For identifying, you could actually buy a whole bunch of technology for this, and they are using the exact same equation, which is your body weight When you were there. Now if you do that though, you do need to account for any fluid you drank during the workout Sure. Because that then offsets it.[0:39:11] Andrew Huberman: Simple, but I think important question. We're talking about a half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight. Does that include Include things like coffee, tea, soda, pre workout drinks, mid workout drinks, mate, matcha, whatever the you know, there's a yerba Ramate, there's a there are a 1000000 things out there, or just water.[0:39:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Any fluid for the most part is gonna count.[0:39:33] Andrew Huberman: And is it true that fluids that contain caffeine generally cause us to secrete sodium? Yeah. Okay. So do you recommend including electrolyte powder or a small pinch of sodium or any number of other supplement type electrolytes that can replace that sodium, magnesium, and potassium.[0:39:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: A couple of things we have to pay attention to to accurately answer that question. What you also sort of asked about you may have not realized is does caffeine actually enhance dehydration? Which is not really what you asked, but it's probably a lot of people thought that as well. So caffeine can, but coffee Doesn't necessarily do that because remember, you're co ingesting that with fluid. And so, we used to say that all the time, how coffee dehydrates you.[0:40:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: It doesn't. It might make your urine yellow. Certainly gives off an odor in your urine. But in general, coffee will not do that because you're ingesting this. If you were to now be taking caffeine pills alone, Now there there is a bit of a diuretic effect there, and so you're gonna with especially when you balance that against the ergogenic effects and benefits of caffeine, it's not something we are concerned about.[0:40:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: 2nd part of your question, do you need to then offset the loss of sodium? I'm not super concerned about the amount of sodium lost to caffeine. I am more concerned about simply the amount of sodium being correct because of the bigger circumstances like how much is actually in your system and how much you lost in In the training session. So it's not the caffeine that I care about that much relative to, you know, if you lost 3 grams of sodium because of the training, And you added another few milligrams because of caffeine, I don't really care or or didn't.[0:41:14] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you brought up the difference between a Substance like caffeine and the vehicle it's contained in, like coffee. This is all really important, and it also raises a question about individual differences in sweating ability. And I call it sweating ability because, I have a good friend I've known for ages, really. I actually work with him in my laboratory, as well, and he's one of these people that the moment he starts any physical activity, it's like a flood warning.[0:41:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:41:42] Andrew Huberman: Right? He just soaks through clothing. It's just the The sweating adaptation is is exceedingly robust in him, other people less so. So is it true that sweating and our ability to dump heat through it by loss of water is something that, we tend to vary on and then also that we can build up that capacity. I know a number of people are probably thinking, ew, gross.[0:42:00] Andrew Huberman: Why would I want to sweat more? There's actually a huge advantage to be able to dump body heat during exertion because body heat in some ways sets the cap for performance.[0:42:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: In lot many, many ways.[0:42:12] Andrew Huberman: Including mental performance.[0:42:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: More so.[0:42:14] Andrew Huberman: Our ability to stay alert often is enhanced by being cold, and, of course, we all wanna warm up properly. But, in terms of loss of fluid through sweating, is there a way to easily bend ourselves into kind of a a low sweater, medium sweater, heavy sweater. That sounds like an article of clothing. But in any case, you know what I'm you know what I'm Man,[0:42:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: another a lot to say here. Wish Wish we had a whole series on this.[0:42:37] Andrew Huberman: Listen. If we have to go 17 hours, we can do it. Just everybody hydrate well.[0:42:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think we've shown the listeners, That is a real threat. That's a very real threat.[0:42:48] Andrew Huberman: Podcasting to failure. You don't have to do every set in the gym to failure, but here we are attempting a podcast failure. In it in all seriousness, what what is the role of sweating ability? And is this something that any of us should Care about or train for or pay attention to, or is this just kinda getting into the arcane?[0:43:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Number 1, you can train your ability to sweat. This is important for heat acclimation. And why that matters, when you sweat, that actually is not what regulates your temperature. You what you want to have happen is the fluid to hit your skin and not to be evaporated. That's the actual mechanism.[0:43:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in fact, if you stop sweating, like, you can guarantee within a short amount of time, you're gonna be done moving.[0:43:29] Andrew Huberman: Oh, very interesting. I hope people heard that and really are are highlighting that in their mind that sweating is a process This is bringing fluid from your body onto the surface of your skin, and then the heat dumping aspect of sweating is the evaporation of that off off Off Your Body, which brings to mind all sorts of ideas about how to dress during exercise, etcetera. But what you said is that if you Are not sweating enough, you're limiting your output capacity. So it's not just about having enough fluid to sweat. Yep.[0:43:59] Andrew Huberman: It's also about being able to sweat and being dressed appropriately is to allow that sweat to move, to evaporate off your body.[0:44:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. And heat acclimation training is as simple as it sounds. So just practice it more. So, if you're going into a process where you either need to be in a hot environment or you need to improve your sweat rate, you just need to practice sweating, and your body will get best for that. Practice a sauna.[0:44:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Practice the jacuzzi. Just get in those things, and you will, improve your ability to do that. Now there is a huge genetic component. I have 1 individual, actually, a A UFC fighter I've been working with, and I don't mind mentioning his name. He'll give me full permission.[0:44:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Scott Holtzman, many many years. He's actually, fighting right now. Actually, today he'll be going. He is, like, he he is like you described. Like, buckets and buckets and buckets of fluids come off this guy When he's tying issues, like, he just goes.[0:44:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Like and then we've we've improved that. I actually sweat too much. We worked on that a lot early in his career, and we we got some improvements down to Get him to hold on to to fluids better. That being said, I've worked with other individuals in his weight category, and it's the opposite.[0:45:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So we can have them literally do the exact same training session together, And Scott will dump £6, and and other folks at his size will dump 2, 2a half. So there's a genetic component that is is there, and you don't need to worry about it there. So can you identify if you are a heavy salt sweater or not? Well, you have a whole bunch of routes for this.[0:45:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Number 1 is you can use the old free, Cost free test of just looking at your clothing, and if you're seeing that white residue all over it. So you've you've all have the friend who probably wears that same bass Baseball hat that they've had for 8 years, if it is covered in the white junk all over the place, that's a sign of a higher salt sweater. If the opposite happens and it's like you can pull their clothing back and and there's just nothing there, there may be a little bit of a lower salt sweater. You can also use any number of hydration tests. I know that there is some coming out in the market very, very soon that can give you Theoretically, real time, measurements, just like a CGM would be.[0:46:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Although I haven't seen any data on if those are accurate or not. I haven't used one yet. But there are a number that are out, super cheap. You know, 10, 15, 20 blocks all the way up to a couple $100. You can buy these patches, put them on you, and get a Reasonably close estimate.[0:46:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: And again, if those things are 5 or 10 or 20% off, I don't know. We have to see independent data come out first. But even if they are, you're not you're not worried about the specific milligrams. Right? Whether you sweat out, you know, 12 150 milligrams in a workout or if it's 13 40, It doesn't really matter.[0:46:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're trying to look for big, big numbers. Right? Are you losing 500 milligrams? Are you using 3 and a half grams when you're at? So those things will get you in a ballpark to do exactly what you just said.[0:46:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Am I Eye, medium, or low. And there's a lot of them that that I've used in the past. So that that's another way to go about it. Then what you wanna do is probably match your electrolyte intake to something close to what you sweat. That's the ideal scenario.[0:46:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: You get a lot of information about hydration from blood. You can look at, like, acute markers of dehydration, like, hemoglobin, hematocrit. If your like, if your hemoglobin is like 15 plus. It's funny. We've talked about this in a few episodes before, but I see that and I'm like, man, that dude's super fit.[0:47:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's like a 15, for hemoglobin would be pretty high. Fourteen or so would be pretty good for a female. That's also the exact same thing as a sign of acute dehydration. So a matter of fact, same thing. If you're north of 50%, you're probably dehydrated.[0:47:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you can get a lot. There are also though a lot of biomarkers that can tell you more about chronic dehydration. So So you can run through those things as well. So a good blood chemistry test can tell you a lot, and you can actually get some insights in your sodium and potassium. Albumin is another fantastic way to to measure longer term, hydration status now with these amazing globulins that we've sort of talked a lot about.[0:47:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you can do all those things. You can Also simply measure the body weight pre and post, and use a sweat patch or not, and use the the freer version of your clothing test, And get a rough idea, of where you're getting it from. So those are good places to start. I wanna go back though and make sure I wasn't over Terrifying the audience too much on a silver piece. If you're performing a type of training or exercise or sport in which you're not losing more than 2% of your body weight, You don't need to be overly concerned about hydrating in the sport.[0:48:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so we can actually get into the to, some equations for how much water to drink during training right now. But if you if you're, again, losing less than that, it's not critical. You can have some fluids if, like, makes you feel better, but you're not gonna be experiencing tremendous amounts of performance decrements if you're, you know, again, out playing a a baseball game and it's 50 degrees out. You're fine. You can drink some water, but that's not gonna be compromising performance or recovery.[0:48:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, we can actually then if you'd like, I can go through the 3 step system For optimizing hydration, but, those are I I wanna make sure I plan that flag so people aren't just terrified that they gotta be guzzling down water if they're, you know, Going to the physical therapist for some stretching. That's that's probably not super important.[0:48:57] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.

I would love for you to tell us what I refer to as the Galpin equation.[0:49:54] Andrew Huberman: Understanding, of course, that you did not name it the Galpin equation. Listen, Folks, scientists can have things named after them, but in general, it's not, reflective of healthy psychology if they name things after themselves.[0:50:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[0:50:06] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes, yes, neuroanatomists used to do that. But in any case, doctor Andy Galpin did not name the Galpin equation after himself. I named it after him, and the Galpin equation For how much fluid to ingest during exercise is[0:50:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: You wanna take your body weight in pounds and divide that by 30. And you wanna consume that number, which would be in ounces, about every 15 to 20 minutes. So in the example, of you being £200, You would take 200 divided by 30, which is let's just call that number 7 to be close, which means you would consume about 7 ounces of water every 15 or 20 minutes or so.[0:50:44] Andrew Huberman: K.[0:50:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now as a little bit of a point, while I also did not name it, I also didn't do the research. It's important to point out that other scientists Figured these things out. I just read their papers and made that derivation of their equation to make it a little bit easier for us folks who do not work on the metric system.[0:50:59] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Couple of things. First of all, I'm not 200 pounds, but it doesn't matter how much I weigh because the point is that the listener[0:51:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[0:51:07] Andrew Huberman: Should take their body weight in pounds divided by 30 and just that number of ounces in fluid every 15 minutes. And then for those out there outside by the US that are accustomed to thinking in milliliters and liters, not ounces, and kilograms, not pounds. What is the Galpin equation in the metric system.[0:51:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: This would be 2 milliliters per kilogram, which again, if you were, let's say, 200 pounds, that's gonna be something roughly Like, we'll call it 90 kilos. And so if you did 2 milliliters per kilo, you'd be something like a 180 milliliters of fluid, again, every 15 or 20 minutes.[0:51:43] Andrew Huberman: Great. And how should people ingest that fluid? And, of course, I would imagine it's through their mouth.[0:51:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: I hope. I hope.[0:51:50] Andrew Huberman: There are other orifices that It might suffice, but let's not go there. They're drinking that water consistently, or is it every 15 minutes they slug it back? Does it matter?[0:52:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Yeah. That's very good. Handful of things. In general, when you talk hydration, the slower and steady you can can go the better.[0:52:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, the reason these these 2 milliliters per kilogram, number came out is because a number of trials were run. When they looked at that every 15 minutes, just 1 bolus of it, you know, in different derivations. And it is pretty clear that the Slower pace one could do it, the better. So whether you're doing it every 10 minutes or 15 or 20 minutes, the reason we actually give that gap is because you have to be also offset A little bit of GI distress. In fact, like, kind of the the 4 golden rules of recovery, if you will, we use sort of 3 r's.[0:52:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: You need to rebuild, rehydrate, and replenish. What that really means is you need to have a continuous glucose stream. You need to have a continuous amino acid stream. You need to hydrate, And you need to do all 1, 2, and 3 without disturbing your gut too much. And so in this particular case, it was sort of found that we can hit that level in general And be just fine for most people.[0:53:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I mean, a little bit of context. The example we gave there in both cases, it's something like 6 to 7 ounces For 15 or 20 minutes. If you think about that, there's 16 ounces in a pound. And most water bottles, like, if you go buy a water bottle at a store here, it's They generally come in, like, 16 ounce bottles ish. So 6 or 7 ounces is really like a third of a water bottle, maybe, Every 15 or 20 or so minutes.[0:53:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's not some egregious amount of water that you have to slam down. Now that is influenced heavily by How hydrated you started the session with? So how hydrated you came in? External factors like heat, humidity, temperature, things like that. But that gives you a rough idea, that again and these are numbers that you would need to consume to optimize performance.[0:53:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: At the end of that, then is when you would look to see how much I lost, like we talked about earlier. And then add back that 125% Taking into account how much fluid you ingested. So if you're 200 pounds and you drink a total of, say, a pound of water during the training, And you started off at 200 and you finished at 1.98. You actually lost £3, not £2, Because you lost 3, you drank 1 during it, so your final net number is 2. So now you don't you really need to drink back a 125% Of that remaining £2, 2 and a half pounds, something like that.[0:54:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: These numbers, especially that 125, are they're just rough guidelines. Some actually papers suggest it's all the way up to a 150%. So it's it's just like an idea. Don't measure out whether you need 5.5 ounces or six 0.2 ounces, like, it just sort of gives you an idea of of where to start. Alright.[0:54:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: A few sips every 15 or 20 minutes is close enough.[0:54:50] Andrew Huberman: I've actually started using, the Galpin equation to determine how much fluid I need for mental work given the Now robust data that are out there on the relationship between hydration and mental work. It's, been very effective for me. And, again, there are Peer reviewed studies that that support the idea that hydration is important for, proper mental clarity and energy and focus, and that Even being slightly dehydrated can disrupt that. But if one is drinking so much water that they're frequently going to the restroom and Can't comfortably, focus on the work they're doing. That's also an issue.[0:55:26] Andrew Huberman: So[0:55:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:55:27] Andrew Huberman: That's very helpful. What are the 3 most critical features of hydration. And then I'd like to move on to, some of the more particulars about supplementation and nutrition.[0:55:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Three parts. Start hydrated, Maintain hydration throughout. Part 3 is hydrate post to fix it. Okay? We gave you the half ounce Per pound of body weight equation.[0:55:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you start the training hydrated. We gave you the, you know, 2 milliliters per kilogram slash body weight divided by 30. To To stay hydrated, then we give you the 125%. But I can actually just give you sort of I'm giving you another list here. I'm sorry.[0:56:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it is My 5 step cheater guide for optimizing hydration for performance. Sorry. Step number 1, drink a lot of water first thing in the morning. This This gets everything kick started, gets you going. It also saves you from having a drink a bunch of water at night, which is then going to compromise your sleep.[0:56:20] Andrew Huberman: What's a lot?[0:56:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Depending on how big you are, the general thing I'll tell people is, like, one of the very first thing you should do throughout your day, you wake up, go to the bathroom. As you're consuming your sunlight, consume water. This is maybe chugging a full glass. It's honestly what I do. It's not the best route, but I'll just get back on.[0:56:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: 16 ounces. Ounces or so is great. It's fine. If you're larger, you know, I'm I'm a 165 to £70 depending on what's going on. Maybe a little higher sometimes.[0:56:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: If If you're £225, maybe that number is 30 ounces. Right? So you just sort of scale up and down. And the only reason I say a lot is it just depends on on what you're doing. And I also should clarify.[0:56:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't really literally mean chug. Just like sips. Because the faster you drink water, the faster it's gonna expand blood volume. The fast food extends blood volume the faster you get rid of it. I[0:57:07] Andrew Huberman: don't think a lot of people will know that.[0:57:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. This is, maybe this is Clarifying, this is also we sort of talked about earlier if you drink too much water, you'll dilute the system. Well, if you have a diluted system, your body's first reaction is to rid of water, to bring total blood volume down. Right? Remember, if you were to go to a doctor and they looked at your total blood volume, and they're like, man, you're 5a half liters.[0:57:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna be like, holy crap. You're gonna be put on a diuretic because you don't wanna have a heart attack and a blood pressure.[0:57:32] Andrew Huberman: I I wonder if people are drinking a 16 ounce glass of water or other fluid all at once before going to sleep, and that's why they're waking up in the middle of the night. Totally. Given what you just said, probably a better, Protocol would be to sip on a glass of water in the final hour or 2 hours before sleep.[0:57:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: You generally, the number we say is 3 hours. In the 3 hours preceding sleep, you wanna basically Limit fluid intake to sipping as needed.[0:57:58] Andrew Huberman: I think that's I'm gonna start that tonight[0:58:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:58:02] Andrew Huberman: Because I wake up generally Once per night to use the bathroom, and I do drink some fluids before I go to sleep mostly because I'm pretty thirsty at that time.[0:58:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:58:11] Andrew Huberman: But I'm gonna start sipping that water in the, 3 hours heading into sleep.[0:58:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So you can actually pay attention to is, To go back, this is actually I love doing this stuff. But if you're waking up at night and you have a very dry mouth.[0:58:25] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Not for me.[0:58:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Because it can be one of 2 things. You might actually be dehydrated. And so then what the mistake people make is like, man, my mouth is so dry. I keep getting up To drink water at night, that makes you didn't pee too much.[0:58:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: What that also indicates is probably your mouth breathing. So a lot of ways to fix People waking up and urinating too much at night is to tape your mouth and or use a a dilator over your nose. And then what happens is You don't feel like you have a dry mouth, so you don't get up to consume any extra water throughout the night. So that actually reduces your your fluid intake, so you don't have the problem of actually now having too much fluid Mhmm. To do it.[0:59:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: And So there's another reasons why mouth taping can really, really help. If you are having those issues, and or snoring, those are not benign.[0:59:09] Andrew Huberman: That[0:59:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: that's a really like, you really should get some work on those. Something you're you're not sleeping very well is the way I'll say it. It's it's doesn't doesn't necessarily mean something And life threatening, but it's not a a good thing. So, you gotta run kinda your triaging things back and forth. So if you're like, I'm waking up to pee a lot, but my mouth isn't thirsty.[0:59:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great. Then you may actually have just a water consumption issue. If it is my mouth is dry, but I'm actually waking up And, having these large urinations, then you're not actually dehydrated, you're just breathing through your mouth. If you're waking up and your mouth is dry, And there's not a lot of pee there, then you actually might actually legitimately be, under hydrated.[0:59:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: So a little bit of a game you could play there.[0:59:49] Andrew Huberman: Well, Well, that's super informative. I think that, the point alone that gulping a bunch of water At once, it's going to cause you to need to excrete that water soon after, is a really important point. Also, for people that Are going to, I don't know, give a talk or, you don't want to have to get up to use the restroom. You have to sit through a long meeting. Yeah.[1:00:14] Andrew Huberman: Clearly, I'm violating all these rules up until right now. I've been, you know, not I I sort of follow the seagull approach to, to consuming fluids, just goom goom In, enormous volumes, I'm gonna start sipping, fluids instead. What are some of the other rules of hydration?[1:00:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're gonna wake up, you're gonna start your day, and start hydrated. So, you know, you're you're consuming a larger percentage of your water earlier in the day. Then you get all the performance enhancing effects of water, and you don't have to worry about it compromising your sleep. So that's step number 1. Also, now you're gonna start your session Closer to hydration.[1:00:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Great. Number 2, eat mostly real whole foods. Why? Interesting.[1:00:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: What you may or not have thought about is a huge determinant of your hydration status is your food choices. If you look at different foods, for example, most Fruit. Watermelon. Watermelon is like 95 plus percent water. A fantastic source.[1:01:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Also, by the way, since we're here, it is not extremely high in right. It's not string extremely high in sugar. It is by percentage, but it says it is almost exclusively water you're eating, it is not, something that is extremely dangerous in terms of sugar. I, there alone, probably of all the things we've talked about in the 6 6 episodes. That comment right there will probably blow the Internet to pieces, and I'll probably get hate mail for life for it.[1:01:33] Andrew Huberman: But from people throwing water throwing watermelons. Yeah.[1:01:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Like, oh my gosh.[1:01:38] Andrew Huberman: Well, I don't think the point is that sugar is Really bad. I think the point is that for most people, they're ingesting too much sugar. Most people.[1:01:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:01:46] Andrew Huberman: And it it's interesting. Oftentimes, the People who are justifying the ingestion of sugar are exactly the kind of people that should not ingest so much sugar. So there's a little bit of a Well, it's user bias there.[1:01:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: The point here is if you're eating Whole Real Food. This is like, now we're we're kind of splitting hairs about this thing. So[1:02:03] Andrew Huberman: Right. So morning hydration,[1:02:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: consume food. Yeah. Now Important point here. If you compare it to other foods, like, actually meat is is a very high percentage of fluid, depending on how well or long you've cooked it, you will reduce remember you said earlier, over 70% water. Right?[1:02:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're eating meat, you're getting actually a big chunk of water. As you cook it, of course, you lose some of that. But meat can be like I wouldn't call it a hydrating food item, but it is not as low as something like a biscuit, which can be actually like 10% water. That's That's why it's like dry and dense, which doesn't mean it's bad for you, but there. If you're eating highly processed foods almost by association, that means they've been dehydrated Or Portially.[1:02:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So you're just getting less total fluid intake. In addition, they have also been highly salted in General. Right? So now we're in this position where we're under hydrated and highly salted.[1:02:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Bad spot. If you now switch over to mostly, again, just mostly whole real food ish, Whatever that means to you. Then your hydration is gonna skyrocket. You're gonna have a lot. So you're eating a ton of food.[1:03:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, it should be Percentage of the fluid intake you have actually should be coming from your food, and you shouldn't have to be smashing water bottles after water bottle all day. In that case, though, you do need to add salt back. So we do see this a lot when people who try to make a transition for maybe a suboptimal nutritional lifestyle, and they they give up a little Other processed food, and they come over, and they start having problems because they're not actually consuming enough salt. So add that back. Easy way to do that, you can use electrolytes, we could talk about those numbers if you want.[1:03:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you just salt your food that you're making, you know, to taste, that's gonna get most people in a in a pretty good spot. So Start hydrated. Consume hydrating foods, step number 2. Step number 3, You wanna pre hydrate. If you know you're gonna do a workout session and it's gonna be hot and long or one of those things, you wanna look for that half a pound, per body weight of ounces.[1:03:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's the number we're looking forward to start our hydration session. We do that, we're pretty much taken care of. And then, like I said, adjust depending on lifestyle, humidity, and and other factors like that. You can use what is called the WUT system, w u t. I think Bob Kenefic has done a ton of research in this area.[1:04:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you wanna read more, look up his research. It is simply weight, urine, And thirst. So in other words, check your body weight, look at your urine color, and gauge your thirst. And actually, you can use 3 those 3 things, And those, can significantly predict actual hydration status independent of actually measuring osmolality or anything like that. So Those 3 metrics alone are pretty good indicator of where you're at.[1:04:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're gonna have that normal amount of water plus or minus. If you missed that number for whatever reason, you get distracted, the number we typically tell people is, like, something like 400 to 500 milliliters of water, in the hour preceding the training. Alright? So that's like 13 to 20 ounces. So, like, you know, you're gonna go work out at 3 o'clock.[1:05:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's 2 o'clock, And you realize, man, I have not drink much water today. You don't need to go smash tons and tons and tons. Just look for something like that, you know, call it a bottle of water, if you will. If that's not enough, if you're in a really tough spot, you can do more like, 5 to 8 ounces, 15 or 20 minutes before exercise. You wanna be really careful about drinking a bunch of water, like, in the seconds before exercise because you're just gonna feel a whole bunch of water bouncing up and down in your stomach and nobody likes So 1 to 300 milliliters, 15 or so 20 minutes before.[1:05:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: That assumes you're in this, like, 185 pound range Yes. Again, if you're talking people of much larger size, you may need to increase those values accordingly. If you do all that, Then you use the Galpin equation for your intra workout hydration, and you're in a pretty good spot. What you want to consume in that is what I call sweat. What I mean by that is you don't actually wanna necessarily consume water only during a workout.[1:06:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: You wanna consume something that is iso osmotic to your blood. So something that is the same concentration That you lost in your sweat. So if you've done a sweat test, you would then drink a fluid that is of the same osmolality. The short version of that, Something in the neighborhood of 200 to 400 milligrams of sodium. Most electrolytes, products are gonna be something like that.[1:06:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now I know LMNT is is a 1000 milligrams, and it's a lot higher. But most products now that you're gonna find are 250 to 400 milligram. And they're typically in the, like, 2 to maybe up to 3 to 1 sodium to potassium range. Right? Coconut water is actually cool.[1:06:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's it's like basically the opposite. Like a cup of coconut water, I think has something like 200, milligrams of sodium, but like 600 milligrams of potassium. So, like, total spoiler alert, but When we use coconut water a lot of hydration, just add a little pinch of salt because that'll bring the sodium way back up.[1:07:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. One note about sodium. Obviously, people who have prehypertension or hypertension wanna be careful with their sodium intake. Anytime I've suggested that people might consider Digesting more sodium, you know, it's sort of, it's like I know. It's like putting a target on your on your back.[1:07:22] Andrew Huberman: And yet, the data are pretty good showing that If people are not getting enough sodium, their mental clarity, their focus, their, mental stamina, their physical stamina really suffers. And then people argue, well, most of us are getting too much salt. That often is true for people that are eating a lot of processed foods.[1:07:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: And not training.[1:07:42] Andrew Huberman: And not training. But for many, people who are already sort of health conscious, who are training, they're largely consuming, or I should say they're consuming largely nonprocessed or minimally processed foods, and especially for folks who are not ingesting many carbohydrates and are consuming caffeine.[1:08:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally.[1:08:02] Andrew Huberman: You know, a lot of people don't know that carbohydrates hold water, and that makes it sound bad. It's not necessarily that, you know, you're gonna get subcutaneous swelling of your body. No. It's recovery. It's it's bringing water into your Just a minute holds water.[1:08:15] Andrew Huberman: So when you drop carbohydrates, starches in particular, you urinate a lot more. And when you drink caffeine, you also urinate a lot more as as you pointed out earlier. So you start combining a few things like slightly lower carbohydrate or low carbohydrate, eating really, quote, unquote, clean, You're not getting a lot of salt in your food and drinking caffeine and then exercising, and then pretty soon those numbers that come along with, you You know, a gram of sodium in your electrolyte drink are not all that outrageous, and what you find is people feel much, much better when they're getting enough sodium. Yeah. And, of course, I should, say that there's no reason why someone has to ingest a a supplement like element or something.[1:08:54] Andrew Huberman: There are Plenty of other ways to bring sodium into your system. You use a a pinch of pink salt or Himalayan salt or sea salt or even just table salt In water, we're just making sure that you're salting your food enough. And I think that there too, salt appetite and salt taste is a pretty good guide. If you taste something and it feels it tastes Really salty to you? That's an indication that either it's really salty or your salt stores are kind of tapped off.[1:09:19] Andrew Huberman: You're okay. Whereas, if you're craving salt and you and you're thinking, gosh, I really wanna put salt on this already salty thing. Not necessarily, but oftentimes, that means that you are salt deficient. The salt appetite is a pretty hardwired set of neural circuits and hormones, and I think, we would all be wise to learn to tap into the our kind of intuition about salt intake, but, of course, also to measure your blood pressure, etcetera.[1:09:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Of of course. If you think you have some sort of contraindication there that work with the medical specialist without Without question, those situations you laid out though were very real. A lot of people are living like that. And so it's important for those folks to understand if you are going through symptoms, fatigue, Lack of focus, cognitive function, performance isn't there, then, hey, like, you may be under salted.[1:10:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: And again, actually, a good amount of Blood chemistry work can unravel that a lot, and it can sort of tell you if you're running out of whack. There are a number of folks who are Extremely sensitive sodium in terms of health risk, and that that is a real thing. Again, work with your, individual folks on that. I don't work with anyone for disease treatment or management And all. I've said that probably 4 times.[1:10:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'll say it 6 more times. I only take people who are healthy and try to make them perform at their best possible level. So it's actually funny you mentioned that because I was going to give people my recommendation for sodium intake in general throughout the day, and then I decided I'm not gonna say that because all it's gonna do is make All the rest of the people who aren't coming to come after me for the watermelon comment, come after me for that. So I'll send it over.[1:10:45] Andrew Huberman: Episode, the goal is that there everyone's coming after you, but also that everyone has learned Something of value. You've already, given us, tremendous, insights and actionable information on creatine and hydration. And Along those lines, I'd I'd love for you to tell us about some of the things that we can do with supplementation in order to enhance Ants training by taking certain things before we train. And I also have the question of how long before training Should we start thinking about supplying nutrients and supplements for the training session?[1:11:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm not sure if I actually finished my fiber. Maybe I wasn't clear enough About the last one. So I just wanna tie that that bow and then we'll go over the next one. Yeah. No.[1:11:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: It was probably my fault. So that, in addition to the Galpin equation in terms of amount. American I ran a recommended at, you know, roughly 3 to 1 sodium to potassium recommendation, and I gave you some rough numbers, Things look that I actually, in all honesty, use probably 6 to 10 different electrolyte, companies depending on the situation. Some of them are really good. In the case, again, like element, it's nice about that is there's no carbohydrate.[1:11:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: However, the downside is there's no carbohydrate. So sometimes I want Carbohydrates in the training, because as you mentioned, there's significant evidence going back, actually several decades on the benefit of carbohydrate during exercise. So if you're in a situation, where you're trying to again maximize actual exercise performance, you especially if it is either a long duration, so more than 2 hours, Or extremely high intensity, and this has to be well north of a 100% of your VO two max. In that situation, as we talked about in the endurance episode, You can actually start having a decrement in performance because of a drop of muscle glycogen. Glibular glycogen can car start coming down.[1:12:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: If that's the case, Augmenting with the carbohydrates during the training that is going to enhance performance. It's gonna do what we call spare the liver, and it's gonna keep My second rule of my four, which is maintain, glucose ingestion, is gonna keep that going. In general, what you're gonna find is the number is like a 5 to 9% glucose concentration in your fluid, which turns out to be, like, exactly the number that most sports drinks have, As well as I think that's pretty much exactly what coconut water is. The downside of sports drinks since we're here is they actually tend to be under salted, And so that they don't provide enough of them. If you look at the numbers, they're gonna say something like 60 to 100 grams of carbohydrate per hour is the target.[1:13:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: And now if you're using the sort of Galpin equation and you're splitting that up into 15, minute intervals, it's something again like 20 or so grams of carbs For 15 to 20 minutes, if you're doing again a an hour long plus training vow. So admittedly, a 100 grams, is a bit much for some folk depending on your size. So I would recommend starting in that, 60 gram or so range again per hour Total is what you wanna get to, and only in the situation in which muscle glycogen depletion is becoming a limiting factor to performance. So The other benefit of that is, as you mentioned, that actually drives water into the cell. And so you're gonna be in that, Nice sweet spot of you're actually keeping glucose going, which is gonna enhance performance, and you're helping hydration at the same time.[1:14:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So The other little part that's important to pay attention to here is the type of carbohydrate matters. So you can use actually a whole combination of things called resistant starches, Which I will use for a long bouts of exercise. But in the middle of the workout, you're going to want to focus on glucose and fructose, mostly glucose. Typically, at least a 2 or 3 to 1 ratio of glucose to fructose. And the reason is those actually get into tissue through separate transporters.[1:14:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so what happens is once the glucose transporters get full, you can't bring anything else in. However, since fructose comes in a separate route, You can maximize total carbohydrate intake by using 2 different unique forms. There there's a lot of ways you can do this, but this is where The Momentous Fuel product is is like, specifically has that exactly in it, so it's fantastic. You can use food. No problem.[1:14:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can use a combination of things like honey and different easily, absorbable and usable, and things that you can actually, like, maybe Put in a drink, to get away with. So there's lots of routes for it, but you wanna look in that that sort of combination, of 5 to 9% roughly glucose for there. So you do need to train your gut, so do not do anything. And there's a generally a good rule, do not do anything in your competition that you've never done in practice. So try these food items, try these amounts, the carbohydrate numbers, try the sodium numbers, try the total amount of water.[1:15:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Start low. You can always increase. What you don't wanna do is have to run out during the middle of your spin class and sprint to the bathroom and hope nobody's in your way, which, in the lab we've seen, we'll just say, accidents like that occur more than once. So, just be careful of your stomach.[1:15:44] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA To help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason The many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests There, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy.[1:16:21] Andrew Huberman: They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also What sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels Into the ranges that are optimal for you.

I realized I jumped the gun a little bit asking about supplementation for before, during, and after a workout, because what I Glected to ask about was training in the fasted state. This is something that we talked about in an earlier episode, but I think it's worth highlighting now.[1:17:00] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes the best way to supplement, If you will, a workout, or pre workout is ingesting nothing. I I'm one of these people. I actually prefer to do my weight training somewhere between 7 and 8 AM each morning, sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little bit later. I drink fluids, water, and I do ingest caffeine prior to those, training days. On days when I don't train, I do, as I often recommend, People do delay my caffeine intake 90 to a 120 minutes after waking.[1:17:31] Andrew Huberman: But in any event, it's water and caffeine, yerba mate or coffee or some sort of stimulant for weight training workouts, and generally not for cardiovascular training workouts, although sometimes yes. So I'm training fasted. That said, I'm ingesting carbohydrate the night before to make sure that my I have glycogen stores that are topped off. And, so it's fasted, but with that caveat. What are your thoughts on training fasted?[1:17:57] Andrew Huberman: And what I just described is Fasted overnight, but some people are training in the afternoon, and they may opt to not eat anything in the, you know, 2 to 4 hours prior to training or maybe even longer, I personally find that caffeine hits my system a lot better When I'm fasted, better meaning it just seems to have more of a potent effect. There are some reasons for that. And, of course, we dissuade people from Ingesting caffeine too late in the day because it'll disrupt sleep. So I'm not saying fast at, for 3 hours then drink caffeine, but who knows? Maybe that's in your protocol.[1:18:31] Andrew Huberman: The simple version of this is, what are your thoughts on training fasted? And if people are going to train fasted, how should they modulate their fluid intake, if at all?[1:18:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: What happens with exercise? In the endurance and metabolism episode, we've walked through in the fact that no matter what you're using for fuel, carbohydrates or fat, Or even, other potential sources. The end product of all of those is ATP, c o two, and water. Right. So you're trying to make ATP.[1:19:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: That is the fuel for exercise. Now ATP is adenosine triphosphate. So 1, 2, 3 phosphates on top of an adenosine. Well, what you may have not put together is if you hydrolyze ATP and you break off one of those phosphates, you now have ADP. If you do it again, you have AMP, adenosine monophosphite.[1:19:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you do it one more time, now you just have adenosine. And if you have then, therefore, run through a lot of exercise, burned a lot of energy, you have increased the amount of adenosine that's floating around. Now if you have a high concentration of adenosine, what's that gonna make you want to do? That's gonna bind a certain receptors, and when we know when those receptors get bound to, you fall[1:19:45] Andrew Huberman: asleep.[1:19:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Bingo. Caffeine will competitively bind to those receptors. Therefore, that's why caffeine stops you From feeling like you wanna go to sleep. Right? So we have a very clear relationship between exercise fuel.[1:20:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, if you look at the literature, There's a pretty clear relationship between the more caloric expenditure in different sports and the higher amount of hours needed for sleep. So there's a nice tie between how hard you're exercising, how much energy you're burning, how much you need to sleep, stimulants, which brings us all the way back to your question of fueling. So do I need a fuel prior to my exercise spout? If you're going to be limited in your exercise spout by fuel, then fueling is necessary, One way or the other. If it is a type of train that is not, then it's not going to matter.[1:20:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so the examples we gave, if you're doing if you're gonna go Do a 32nd bout of maximal exertion, and you're gonna do it one time. You don't need to worry about fueling at all.[1:20:45] Andrew Huberman: We're eating within your workout because only 30 seconds.[1:20:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. You got 30 seconds. You don't need to worry about hydration post exercise. You don't need to worry about recovery. Total energy expenditure was nothing.[1:20:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're gonna go, you know, you're gonna go practice, you're gonna go to the driving range and practice your golf swing, you don't need to worry about The total amount of energy expenditure is just not high. In fact, in that case, you might wanna keep it somewhat low because you wanna keep blood glucose fairly even, and you don't wanna bring it into the system. You certainly wouldn't wanna use stimulants. Right. Because you may get over exerted inside.[1:21:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: In all of these things, we probably should have started off our conversation with this. In terms of macronutrients, The total amount throughout the day is more important generally than the timing of them, Which is why you can do things like have a bunch of carbohydrate at night, not eat the next morning, and lift and be just fine. It doesn't matter that you didn't have them in a few hours before. Your muscle glycogen is topped off. Your liver is glycogen is topped off.[1:21:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're absolutely fine. You have plenty of fuel. Even if you were to wait a few more hours, in fact, even if you were to do conditioning, you're probably fine. I have plenty of athletes that prefer to to many other training sessions faster in the morning for personal reasons, not because it enhances performance. But if it doesn't enhance or, Harmit, then and it's a personal preference thing.[1:22:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fine. If you're gonna go do a session though where you're going to be really concerned with muscle glycogen depletion. And again, you can go back that episode to learn of different types, when those thresholds hits and what you're worried about. Then a feeling would be important. You would either need to have something before the session And or consume it during the session.[1:22:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: So one of the other things we like to say here is recovery starts during the previous workout. Right. So if you're working out right now and you optimize nutrition right now, even if you don't necessarily need it for the current workout, if you can get ahead on recovery, Then you're gonna be fine the next day. And the differentiation here between carbohydrate and protein is important. So the total amount of protein you ingest Throughout the day is probably a bigger determinant for things like muscle growth than the timing.[1:22:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the post exercise anabolic window, it doesn't necessarily matter. Carbohydrate is different. The timing of that does matter. It needs to be around and available. So you can maximize both hydration And muscle glycogen resynthesis, which is restoring the muscle glycogen you burn during exercise.[1:23:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: I also work with athletes that train multiple times a day. So in those particular cases, recovery window is half what you normally have. So if you're in a situation where you have 2 or 3 days before you work out again, You don't need to worry about getting carbohydrate in before, during, or after. Because by the time you go to train again, you will have restored your muscle glycogen levels easily. However, if you're training every day Or twice in a day, then the timing of carbohydrate really starts to matter.[1:23:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: In that case, I see no reason to not ingest, those nutrients either before, during, or after. You don't need need to necessarily do it, but you can. The general rule of thumb I give is something like this. If you're doing something where you're trying to really work hard, whether this is hypertrophy training or a lot of endurance, energy expenditure is gonna be high, Potential muscle damage is high and or energy utilization is high. What you wanna look for is a number something in the area of, like, Half a gram of carbohydrate per pound of body weight.[1:24:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you weigh 200 pounds. You wanna make sure that either pre, mid, or post, or total, you bring in a 100 grams of carbohydrate. It's just a very rough number to start. Protein is about half of that. So it's about a quarter of your body weight.[1:24:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So those numbers would be if you're 200 pounds, make sure you have a 100 grams of carbs and 50 grams of protein. And again, it doesn't necessarily have to be before or during or after, and you'll be in a good spot. All you need to do then is alter what I do, I should say, is alter the amount of carbohydrate based on energy expenditure. So in a lower energy and easier workout, instead of having a 100 grams of carbs, I might tack that down to 75 or even 50, And be at a 1 to 1 carb protein ratio.[1:24:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: If it was even harder, more sun, hotter outside, more fluid loss, I might go from a 100 grams of carbs up to a 150 or 200. I get closer to, like, a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 carbohydrate to protein ratio. So those are the numbers that I I generally go by.[1:25:14] Andrew Huberman: Well, as I take a sip of my double espresso Americano here, I'd love for you to tell us about stimulants.[1:25:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. There's no shortage of these in most of our lives, and, of course, you can cover the health benefits of it later. You maybe you have an episode.[1:25:29] Andrew Huberman: Yes. We have an episode on Ethene. And it does have certain health benefits, although one has to use caffeine correctly in order to drive those. Yep.[1:25:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's caffeine is the easy one to start with, And we won't belabor the point here. The evidence is strong. It has a Nergugenech effect. You can take it At whatever dosage is reasonable for you, and, of course, there is, a bit of a learning curve there, such that, obviously, the more you take it, The more you need to take. Even though there's actually some recent evidence showing even folks who are, acclimated to it will still see an ergogenic benefit even though if they don't feel A big boost of it.[1:26:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So typically, that takes 30 to 45 minutes or so, but it's highly dependent upon the person. So some people can Smell coffee and immediately feel better, and that's probably working actually through a different mechanism, of anticipation. But you You can take it there. The half life of it is, you know, 4 to 6 hours or something like that. It can totally depends on the person, so don't let it ruin your sleep.[1:26:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: But if you take it prior to performance, it has a a noticeable effect on, particularly, endurance. Maximum strength Maybe less well, quite clearly less so. In fact, the data are mixed there on whether it actually does anything for peak strength. Although, I think most people would, rec would suggest that, you know, you're gonna take it prior to trying to truly lift as as high as trying to, you know, lift a 1 repetition max or similar. But most of the the documented effects are on the the endurance based activities.[1:26:55] Andrew Huberman: Yes. So my read of the literature, in terms of performance enhancing effects of caffeine Or that 1 to 3 milligrams I wanna make sure that people hear the units correctly before people Blitz themselves out with caffeine. 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight about 30 minutes prior To exercise has a definite performance enhancing effect. It also has a definite mental performance enhancing effect, especially when people who are regular caffeine users, have abstained from caffeine for anywhere from 2 to 15 days, and and that's an Dreamly rare circumstance. But even if they have not, it appears that 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine taken about again, It's not super precise as far as I, can see.[1:27:44] Andrew Huberman: About 30 minutes before the event starts Can really enhance reaction time and power output and, as, well as as you mentioned, endurance. When I was researching the caffeine episode, one interesting caveat that, I discovered was that if people are not caffeine adapted, they are not regular users of caffeine, the sudden introduction of caffeine Can really degrade performance, mostly because people don't know how to operate at that high level of autonomic arousal. Have you ever observed that?[1:28:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. A 100%. In fact, there's actually data going up High is 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight[1:28:20] Andrew Huberman: Wow.[1:28:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Which is, in fact, once you cross the 5 milligram per kilogram threshold, You will start seeing performance decrements. So there's absolutely such a thing of ruining your performance with too much caffeine. So most people listening to this, if you're thinking, Wow. They said caffeine, I'm all in, and then you just stop listening, and now you, you know, go for your quad espresso shot before your every time you go to workout. You probably are passing that threshold.[1:28:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you think about those numbers, 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight. If you weigh a 100 kilograms, that's 220 pounds. That'd be something like 2 to 500 milligrams of caffeine, which is like a pretty high amount. But, you know, a coffee is gonna get you Close. An espresso is gonna get you somewhat in that ballpark depending on sources of so you don't really need to go and blister your brain with caffeine.[1:29:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, if you do, it's Quite common and, in fact, likely that you'll actually make performance worse.[1:29:16] Andrew Huberman: Right. Yeah. The amount of caffeine in different Coffees and sodas, etcetera, of course, varies. One thing that people ought to know is that the smallest of commercially available, Coffee's at the most popular commercial vendors, generally contain anywhere from 250 to 350 Milligrams of caffeine. What that means is that the so called medium and the large contain as much as 500 milligrams or 1 gram of Caffeine.[1:29:47] Andrew Huberman: So for you morning, large coffee at a commercial vendor, Mhmm. Drinkers, If you're wondering why you get an a headache if you're 30 minutes late on that caffeine or, If you can't access that caffeine at all or even if you're drinking coffee, excuse me, from another source, you're finding like, oh, it's really not doing it for me, it's because The amount of caffeine in the now commercially sold, coffees is exceedingly high. It's about 2 or 3 times higher than the standard lookup Up tables that you'll see on the Internet. So I'm not saying that to demonize, caffeine. We can pretty quickly adapt to and form a tolerance to caffeine.[1:30:25] Andrew Huberman: Some people never really can get over the jitters. Other people, are just fine with, even a 1000 milligrams of caffeine, but only because they've been drinking a lot of caffeine consistently.[1:30:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Anyway It's also wildly inconsistent from location to location, the brew type, the functionality. So, Yeah. That that stuff can be very hard to figure out what what's happening.[1:30:45] Andrew Huberman: There's only one way really to, objectively measure caffeine, and that's use caffeine tablets. And they work pretty well. Actually, someone I know, who's, prominent in the podcast space uses 100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form combined with tea. Yep. So they've now conditioned themselves to think that herbal tea actually has this caffeinating effect.[1:31:08] Andrew Huberman: But, Tablet form caffeine, while I'm not recommending it to to, outright, it is going to give you the best sense of how much caffeine you can Can tolerate and how much is performance enhancing or is performance degrading?[1:31:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's actually another line of supplementation that we can go down here, which is not technically a stimulant, But it's something I use to help performance when you don't want caffeine. And so this thing specifically, if you're one of those folks who have to exercise at night, And you want a little bit of boost for your training, but you don't wanna have caffeine because it messes up your sleep. And this is when you can turn to the whole, like, citrulline, arginine, Nitric oxide sort of route, and, we'll skip the explanation there. But effectively, what happens is Nitric oxide is this wonderful compound that causes vasodilation. And of course, that's going to aid then in transporting nutrients in and out of the cell.[1:32:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it has an ergogenic effect. You have a number of ways you can go about this. Some of them have more pros and cons than others, and and there are more and more data coming out specifically on citrulline And more recently, if you look though, in my opinion, the most consistent evidence for the most consistent effect is In the supplement of beet root or beet root juice or extract or something like that. So you can find those supplements, and they tend to, again, they're pretty effective at enhancing performance, specifically Anything moderate to longer duration endurance performance, and they are not a stimulant, so they won't ruin your sleep that much.[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: One, note of caution, for those of you that are interested in citrulline or or beet root because they are in the arginine pathway. If you're somebody who has, a predisposition to cold sores, oral cold sores that is or other forms of cold sores that, because activation of the arginine pathway can exacerbate some of the neural related aspects of of cold sores, and that's because The viruses that cause those cold sores actually live on neurons, then you wanna be very cautious with citrulline, especially high dose citrulline. I can really amplify that the cold sore Response. What about non stimulant yet, focus enhancing supplements? Things like Alpha GPC, for example, I routinely use 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to Hard physical training, typically weight training.[1:33:31] Andrew Huberman: But occasionally, I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to a mental work bout. Less often these days because I kind of reserve it for physical training, and I don't tend to use it every day. Maybe once every, you know, 3rd or 4th workout combined with caffeine. So that combination is pretty, pretty potent, I find. And so, technically, because it's a cholinergic agonist, it's not a stimulant in the traditional sense, but it has a, focusing in an alertness promoting aspect to it.[1:34:04] Andrew Huberman: What are your thoughts on those sorts of compounds?[1:34:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's not much human perform exercise performance data On those, there are certainly, cognitive functioning tests on those. So you're not gonna find a lot of information. No. But there isn't None. We actually will use many of these substances.[1:34:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could globally call them nootropics, which is, you know, any Substance that specifically all hands brain function is a rough way to think about it. We'll use them prior to More challenging bouts of training. This is something that we'll pull out, say, on the sparring day only, or the most important training session, or a session when you're trying to work on pitch command, Or when you're trying to enhance, work on your shot and as a basketball player, or you're really trying to improve a a certain swing as a golfer or something like that. But we do not use them every day. We do not use them with every person.[1:34:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, yeah, we will use those. They are not stimulants, but they can be performance enhancing. And another kind of way to think about this is If you're in the case of caloric restriction, so whether you're you're trying to lose weight or we're actually trying to control weight for, you know, weight purposes in terms of Sports where you have to be in a certain weight class or something like that. While we may not be able to give you food, in fact, we may not be able to give you stimulants Because of the sleep thing or because we're already like maxed on our siblings, now we can go this route. And so at least, like, mentally, you're a little bit there, and you're more likely to be Alert and focused, and you can train harder despite the fact we didn't actually change fuel.[1:35:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now that's a little bit of a short game in terms of That's not your permanent solution. You eventually need to bring calories up or, you know, whatever other train you're training or whatever you're going to do, but it can work in a nice short pinch.[1:35:43] Andrew Huberman: I'm very interested to learn from you about fatigue reducers, and I'm hoping that Rhodiola Rosea will come up in the conversation.[1:35:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Great. Let's just start right there then. There's actually a lot of research on this despite, most people not having heard of it. I think I mentioned in a previous episode, I've used it a lot over many, many years.[1:36:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have to be a little bit careful of it. There's, Well, first of all, no we and we should have said this at the onset. No supplement is a panacea. Right? Nothing's gonna work for everything.[1:36:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Rodeal is no no different. It can have a Number of effects. And if you look across the literature, you're gonna find generally somewhere between a small benefit to little benefit, but not often is it Detrimental with a few exceptions. I know of a handful of papers that would be 2, specifically, where it may actually reduce muscular endurance. Okay.[1:36:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fine. If you think about what's happening is one of the benefits that has been seen so far with rhodiola Is is helpful at managing cortisol, but cortisol suppression is not necessarily a good thing. We talked about how if you do an acute bout of stress, Cortisol will will go way up, and that is a sign of of acute stress. However, a sign of long term excessive stress is cortisol suppression. And so this is a a thing to be really careful of is if you're feeling down or lethargic or tired, and you think your adrenals are messed up, then you start taking Cortisol modulators, you could be making the problem worse because now your cortisol is actually suppressed.[1:37:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: And now you're taking these things to blunt it or keep it low, And and in your you continue to feel lethargic and and lack of desire and libido and focus and and sort of all these things. So cortisol is not a bad thing. We want this to be going up and down, in the amounts that we want. So if we're we're for thinking about, like, for example, waking up, you would want generally something like a 50% reduction in the 1st hour in terms of cortisol concentrations. However, if you're extremely suppressed already, going down is is only gonna be a problem.[1:37:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: So rhodiola is is has a, a good evidence base to support it for that. You'll see actually a number of of studies that have Looked at it in a whole host of areas, for benefits. So something good to do. The difficult part with rhodiola, to be quite honest, Is getting it from a high quality brand and source. It's difficult to get as a single source, which is a very, very important thing Thing to do with supplements is try to get them sourced alone.[1:38:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Rhodiola typically comes in combination with any other herbals or other stuff, Adrenal support and etcetera, etcetera. And also then getting them then third party certified, which for most folks is not necessary. But for any athletes that need to go through drug Testing systems, you should not take any supplement at all that does not have some sort of third party certification. So Those are the challenges. That being said, if you've ever ran into somebody who's taken rhodiola and they're like, it didn't do anything for me, it it's possible.[1:38:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's, You know, nothing works for everyone. And also could be just very poor quality sourcing. So if you look at, the there have been a number of papers on, it's perception of fatigue. And you you sort of mentioned that you felt pretty immediate effects, I've taken it a few times.[1:38:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm fairly sensitive with supplements, but I've started taking, rhodiola before workouts and found that I could push much harder, much longer through the workout. Normally, I would, or typically before taking it, That is in sessions where I did not take it. I would be able to work out very hard for 20 minutes or so. The next It's 10 minutes.[1:39:18] Andrew Huberman: I could get some work output, and then the remaining, period of time, it was kind of a tapering off. Now granted these are very intense Training sessions. These are not the endurance training sessions. These are the weight training sessions that one one time per week per body part type sessions. What I've noticed is I can complete the entire 60 minutes with with minimal fatigue now.[1:39:39] Andrew Huberman: I mean, obviously, I hit fatigues within sets and, of course, You know, I you remain human despite taking it. But, I found to be very useful, and I've been using it whenever I use Alpha GPC prior prior to workouts.[1:39:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:39:51] Andrew Huberman: And I've been impressed by by it overall. I do wanna highlight something that you said because I think it's so, so vitally important, which is that using single ingredient formulations for most things is critical to figuring out what works for you, what doesn't, what dosages you need, being able to take things, 2 on, 1 off. 2 days on, 1 day off, for instance, being able to, increase dosage in the morning and then maybe Reduce the dosage and combine with something else in the afternoon, single ingredient formulations are pretty much the only way to do that. There's perhaps only one Supplement that I take at all, and that's Athletic Greens as they've been a regular podcast sponsor for a long time. That is a cocktail of many, many things, and those are all adaptogens as well as some probiotics and vitamins and things like that.[1:40:36] Andrew Huberman: So I'm not opposed to blends where the blends include a lot of nutrients that are synergistic, but for all Pill capsule, based supplements where I'm looking for a very targeted effect, and it's not just about sub foundational nutrition. I Really believe strongly that single ingredient formulations are the way that you can build a rational approach to supplementation and also make adjustments if something isn't making you feel better? And also make adjustments if something's really working for you. So for instance, some people might take alpha GPC 300 milligrams and not feel anything, go Go up to 600 milligrams, not feel anything, maybe just feel kind of, they don't like it. Other people, like myself, took 300 milligrams of alpha GPC the first time.[1:41:16] Andrew Huberman: I was like, wow. This really puts me in the zone, but I wanna be really careful how often I use it. I did mention I go up to 600 milligrams occasionally, but that really puts me on the outer threshold of kind of overall levels of focus and amped up such that if I drink too much caffeine, it can tilt me over the edge. So I encourage people to become scientists of themselves, and the only way to do that is to try and limit the number of variables. And the final point is that I think that single ingredient formulations are by far the best in terms of Changing things over time, you know, this could be, women during their menstrual cycle might find that during certain phases of the cycle, they're They're more sensitive to certain things than not others.[1:41:57] Andrew Huberman: And for men and women, it may be that, you know, certain times of year even, and, Certain supplements might go better closer to sleep, some earlier in the day, and on and on and on. There's just no real way, in my opinion, to have a supplementation protocol That involves lots and lots of blends. 1 or 2 blends, okay. But lots of blends, I think that's, I actually think that's potentially dangerous territory.[1:42:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I mean, just take rhodiola as a good example. I know a a new meta analysis came out, just in the last few months looking at it. And they found in general, you see, again, a slight to moderate improvement in everything from, power output to fatigue resistant antioxidant effects, to endurance performance. So it's like, okay.[1:42:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. Maybe there's a little bit here. Now let's say you want to do it, and the only way you could access rhodiola is in combination with that and, some lion's mane and, you know, some other, these adaptogens. And I was like, wait a minute. I just wanted to take this to get a better workout.[1:42:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: But now it also came with this stimulant or this cortisol suppressor or cortisol activator. Well, now all of a sudden, you can't take it at night, Or you can't take it in the morning because you already you already had coffee. Your your options are just way limited. So I think the biggest part of all that If you if something doesn't feel good, you have absolutely no idea. You don't know if it was Rolliola.[1:43:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't know if it's the Buswell unit that is in there. You don't know if it was any of the other things that Smashed in there, or it could be something as simple as the, the the citric acid they use. Like, some other combination of thing. And now, here you are thinking that some supplement that actually works For you, doesn't, and you throw that out of your repertoire, for the rest of your life, which is, you know, not the biggest crime, but it's not needed and you're not really going to know. So yeah.[1:43:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I Fully stamped. You can look back at my course lectures for the last decade, and you will see, like, stamped number 1 on the supplement sections is Make sure you're taking single ingredient supplements at all costs. The last part about that too is You're more likely to ensure the amount that is on the label is correct. So So if you're taking rhodiola and it says, you know, it's a 100 milligrams in there, and if that's only thing that's in there, you're you're more likely than not To actually get something close. Now, they're never perfect, but it will be close.[1:44:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: If it's in a combination of 20 other things, you actually don't have any idea if that's in there. In fact, there have been many papers on, melatonin and vitamin d, and a number of other supplements in which when you actually just pull them off the shelf, these are these are standard studies where they would go on and buy, I said, like, 20 to 25 different supplements in the case of melatonin. They I will actually measure the amount of melatonin actually in them. And and despite the fact that the label says 5 milligrams, they can be up to a 500 to a 1000 fold Actual concentration in that supplement. And then you wonder why some people react great to melatonin, some people have absolutely destroys you.[1:44:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: And this is also why, like, we'll we'll actually we'll see this constantly. Well, people will have, like, 500 times the upper limit of melatonin the morning after. When the half life is supposed to be more like 90 minutes, it should be totally gone. But we're seeing extremely high. I'm not even talking, like, double.[1:45:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm talking 10, 20, 30 x, the upper limit range for melatonin the next morning. And then it's like, well, what are you taking? He's like, oh, I got this melatonin at x store or x website, and you're like, holy cow. So I'm I'm not Pose to melatonin theoretically, but you have to be careful with that one in particular. So any supplement has that to be true.[1:45:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So So you you wanna buy them from as many places as you can that are high quality, and if they are third party tested even if you're not a performance athlete. I wanna stress this. Even if you're not a performance athlete, third party certified and tested supplements are you're less likely to just get wildly high concentrations or low concentrations of active ingredients. And so relative to other ones, who you might get for cheaper, But you could be totally wrecking yourself by getting, you know, 50 milligrams of melatonin every night and not realizing it. So then, of course, the next morning you drown yourself in caffeine, And then you can see what death cycle you're in now.[1:46:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And, people could look for third party certification on the packaging, and, Some websites will allow you to zoom in on the bottle beforehand. It it's largely listed on on certain, vendor websites. A brief point about supplement cost and blends, and I promise this will be a brief point. Different ingredients, meaning different types of supplements, have widely varying costs In order to, you know, create to to get them to manufacture them.[1:46:28] Andrew Huberman: So oftentimes, what you'll find is that blends will, include The least amount of the most expensive, ingredient. Right? Not always the case. There's some there are certain exceptions to this. And I mentioned some blends that I like a few minutes ago that are for foundational nutrition adaptogens and probiotics.[1:46:48] Andrew Huberman: Athletic greens, of course, just being one of several examples out there. But when it comes to, say, a sleep blend or a pre workout blend, There are some decent products out there, but a lot of them tend to put in more of the least expensive ingredients and less of the ones that you're actively seeking. And so those tend to be, caffeine tends to be a kind of a buffer against the other things. Meaning, if you prework out, Putting caffeine in there isn't necessarily a bad thing. But if it has 5 other things in there, oftentimes, what manufacturers will cheat on Is the actual amount of the things that are costly?[1:47:23] Andrew Huberman: Yep. So again, single ingredient formulations for 80% of your supplements, I I think it's really, the way to go. And the other thing that I know is gonna come up as we're talking about all these supplements is this issue of dependency. I often get this question, and when I solicit for to for questions, on social media in anticipation of this episode, a number of people said, okay. So if you take a sleep formulation, do I need to take it every night?[1:47:47] Andrew Huberman: If I don't take it, will I have an incredibly hard time sleeping? If I take a pre workout every time I train, will, will I need it? It's a great question. Some people will take supplement holidays, as they may be called, for a couple of days each week, back to back. Some people take them Straight through.[1:48:04] Andrew Huberman: I myself take a a sleep cocktail. We've described this. It's magnesium, theanine, and things. This is not 1 ingredient. These are multiple ingredients.[1:48:11] Andrew Huberman: In fact, precisely because some people who have Leap walking in vivid dream issues. Can't take theanine before bed. In any case, I've had times when I either forgot my supplements, That's rare, where I just didn't have what I needed or just simply took a break for a night, and it was not a problem. But In terms of pre workout, I do think that people become dependent on being in that really ramped up state, but I don't think we view all this as, like, true dependency, kind of like Addiction.[1:48:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally.[1:48:39] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, I define addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. So, you know, I I suppose people could get addicted to pre workout, but it seems a little unlikely. More likely, there would be a dependency such that if you didn't have your pre workout, you might feel like, oh, you're not motivated to train. So what are your thoughts on, I'm taking little holidays from supplements and varying frequency of supplement intake, in particular as it relates to stimulants and fatigue reducers.[1:49:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: The end goal anytime I coach somebody is to get them into a physiological state in which they require No or close to no supplementation. That's the target. We should really be in a position to where our lifestyle, Our sunlight exposure, our stress management, our physical activity, our sleep and our hydration, and our whole food nutrition provide us almost everything we need. Now Look, again, there are some foundational items that we can give people. We put together a little bundle actually for this that of basic things that you can go look at.[1:49:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: But that's the goal. Right? So the target is to be let your physiology run the guide. Your physiology is way smarter than we are. Even if I take a bunch of biomarkers from you, Your physiology still knows better than those few markers can tell me.[1:49:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's always where we're ending up. I actually personally Don't like people being in a position that they have to take a supplement for anything. So I don't like it if you have to take a supplement to have a good night of sleep. I don't like it if you have to have a supplement to train. We will use any of these stimulants very, very carefully, with Any of the athletes we work with and certainly for the non athletes, because at least the athletes we have an end date.[1:50:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: We have a fight schedule. We have a season. We have a game you're gonna pitch, whatever. When you don't have that, it's sort of like you're in this endless cycle of, oh, you're just gonna do that all day every day? We don't really need to be in that spot.[1:50:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what I the way that I describe my philosophy is, I will use those short term tactics to symptom manage if I have to. So if somebody comes to me and they're like, you're feeling awful, and we've gotta get through the hump. Okay. Great. Maybe we'll give you something for sleep immediately to get you sleeping.[1:50:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: That allows us to then come back and work on the causal problem. Right? So this is what is why are you having a hard time sleeping anyways? If you have to take a a 9 cocktail supplement to sleep, then all we're doing is is blinding The reason why are you in that position to begin with. Right?[1:51:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we see this all the time whether it is sleep problems, whether it is cortisol or testosterone. The question is, well, why is that low? Now we may give you something again to manage it immediately, but the task, the the mystery I'm going to try to unveil is why. Why is it there to begin with? This could be something like this is natural for you, and your lack of energy is something else.[1:51:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or it could be actually, it is not a natural level for you, but something is Depressing it. Any number of, you've got some infection going on, there's some allergy allergic reaction to something in your environment, there's, you know, mold, Mercury, like that one comes up a lot. You'll see mercury in folks, and that's causing a lot of problems, or any number of heavy metals or toxins, Any host of things. Psychological distress, bad daily habit. You don't ever see the sun.[1:51:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, you don't ever sweat. You don't ever drink. We've talked about so many things. So I'm always gonna hunt for that, and I hate using this phrase. It's highly maligned for a good reason, but root cause.[1:51:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. So we're trying to find that. It's like, are we making sure that we're not causing this problem? And I'm not going to want to give you a supplement To cover up something, if we're not even trying to solve the problem of what's being there. That being said, am I that concerned about people taking a multivitamin?[1:52:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just all throughout no. Not really. Am I concerned about people taking creatine? No. Like, go ahead.[1:52:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Though those ones are generally pretty fine to To just take, but anything else, I want a reason. I really don't like giving people anything in a super physiological concentration We're a superfood concentration. Right? So again, an amount you wouldn't find in a normal food dosage, unless we have really a specific reason. Some of these things are more problematic, Others are less problematic.[1:52:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: So when an ant to answer the question of dependency, you have a combination of actual physiological dependency, caffeine. Like, that actually creates a physiological dependency versus a, emotional or psychological dependency or just a, I like drinking this. Like, that's my habit. That's my routine. There's a fancy scientific phrase for that, but it doesn't matter.[1:53:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, yeah, we we wanna get off that and, like, again, Again, my personal philosophy is I don't want you dependent upon anything. I wanna create extremely resilient people, and I wanna create physiological resilience. We actually have a Fancy little algorithm we use to to measure that in people, and so we can actually calculate that number. And the goal of us is to push that number higher so that we don't have to have anything. So many situations pop up in your real life that you're not gonna have your supplement, or you're not gonna have your routine, or you're not gonna have your journal, or whatever.[1:53:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: But also for the long term, I don't wanna create a situation in which this is a short term success that you have to now do that the rest of your life. No. Let's just get out of the way. Let's fix the problem if we if there is something, symptom Management, that's real. While we're actually searching for better foundational habits, the last thing I wanna say about this is If you're only covering symptom, you're really missing signal.[1:53:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Which is if you're constantly tired throughout the day, And all you're doing is giving yourself a a number of alpha GPCs and caffeines, etcetera, even though there's good little sugar. Are you really just using that To allow your poor sleep hygiene to happen. If they took those away, I bet you, you would actually start addressing your sleep if that's the cause. Right.[1:54:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Your your stress, sir. Your poor hydration. Like, you would go hunting for the problem. And so, like, you wanna walk a fine line here of going like, hey, look.[1:54:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is an athletic greens supplement that big a deal? No. Probably not. But wait a minute. Am I actually now covering up the pain point That is maybe needed.[1:54:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a signal to actually get my ass in gear to go make one of these changes, Whatever it needs to be. So I know I got, like, a little bit meta on you and a little bit philosophical, but that's honestly how I approach it. Yeah.[1:54:46] Andrew Huberman: I think it's really important. A Friend of mine who's a physician has a great saying, which is better living through chemistry still requires better living.[1:54:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, Boy, that's that's golden. That's so good.[1:54:57] Andrew Huberman: You know, and it pertains also to things like antidepressants and ADHD drugs and things of that sort. Most all of those things were developed as tools to allow people to move from a, maladaptive state okay. Maladaptive is hard to define, but think about In any domain of life, you can either be back on your heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. And there are times when people are so compromised Neurochemically, that they need to use pharmacology in order to get into a flat footed position. Yeah.[1:55:26] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, they're really back on their heels, flat footed or forward center of mass. But the idea It's always that those things were developed as things to allow people to engage in the sorts of behaviors that can produce the same sorts of neurochemical shifts. And if people are thinking, well, what sorts of Behaviors can induce these neurochemical shifts. I'll just zoom out myself for a moment here and say, I am a big proponent, and I believe you are as well, if I may, In doing behavioral tools first whenever possible, really establishing good habits, the do's and don'ts, which we've talked a lot about in this series and in this episode. Then excellent nutrition, which involves do's and don'ts, volume, food choice, timing, all the factors.[1:56:06] Andrew Huberman: And then also supplementation. And also, they're sometimes a case for prescription drugs, certainly, and often brain machine interface or body machine interface measuring stuff using devices. But the the foundation of behaviors and good nutrition are really truly foundational. And it's hard in anything to skip steps, but supplements and prescription drugs are one place where people often skip steps, And then they don't they don't actually learn how to cultivate the best, behavioral practices, including the don'ts, as you mentioned. And then just one more point along these lines.[1:56:42] Andrew Huberman: You know, you you talked about taking anything for energy is really, disruptive to the system. And it is because, Especially caffeine, while it has its uses and even health benefits, it's really borrowing. It it's against the adenosine system with interest. And so because caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist effectively, while caffeine is present in those receptors, you don't feel as sleepy. You have more energy.[1:57:07] Andrew Huberman: Your Reaction time goes down. Memories enhance focus, performance of all kinds. Yes. But then when that caffeine is dislodged from the receptor, then the adenosine can act even more potently at those receptors. So it's sort of like being able to borrow against the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep.[1:57:26] Andrew Huberman: And this is why we encourage people, If they're not training first thing in the morning to push their caffeine intake out about 90 to a 120 minutes after waking so they can clear some of that adenosine in the which tends to happen even, after we wake up. People can listen to episodes on Master Your Sleep or Perfect Sleep or the Caffeine episode to understand more about that. But the the final thing I just wanna say here, and then it it, prompts a question, is, you know, in thinking about supplement protocols, I think a lot of people assume that once they start taking something, they're gonna have to take it all the time. And one idea, perhaps, is that People have some, alpha GPC around that they could take. And granted it'd be great if people could try things without having to buy a whole Product, I think companies hopefully are listening to this and will, give people a sample to see if something works for them, and then give them an opportunity to try it, To have things around, but not necessarily assume you're gonna take it every time.[1:58:21] Andrew Huberman: Right? Some things you take every day, foundational nutrition, supplements for instance. But then also to take a look at how well you're eating or not eating. Right? At times when I'm eating much better, I consuming, you know, low sugar fermented foods, Foods which are great for the gut microbiome, I consume less probiotics.[1:58:37] Andrew Huberman: If ever I've been really compromised for whatever reason, then I will take pill form probiotics, but I don't take those all the time, because I get them from food and from certain, you know, green strings, like athletic greens and so forth. So I think that nutrition and supplementation are Tethered in this way in my mind, and I don't think that, most people think of supplementation as something that where you can induce a lot of variability in when and how you take them. But as far as I'm concerned, as long as they're single ingredient formulations, you can be, you can use supplements once a week If you want, you can use them 7 days a week. You could use them, twice a day, 4 times a day every day, or you could use them not at all. Agreed?[1:59:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Some of them, will have an effect randomly like that. Others will not. And we talked about creatine being one of them. It's If you're going to take it once or so a week, then there's I mean, basically[1:59:29] Andrew Huberman: No benefit. That's a very good point. Yeah. Creatine's a[1:59:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Beta alanine As another fantastic example of something you need to take consistently if you want some sort of benefit, it needs to be built up in muscle. We need to use that to create, Carnicine, which is what's actually gonna help us with our fatigue management. That's why we call it like an acid buffer. So in our previous metabolism episode, we talked about that being a major cause of fatigue. The wonderful part of the one of the reasons why beta alanine works so effectively is it blocks that buildup.[1:59:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that is a good example of another one that you would want to take. Other things like fish oil, You could certainly skip a day here and there. It wouldn't be that big a deal. I also do support your comment if you can take absolutely none of these things and and be just fine. In terms of and it will come back maybe to beta alanine in a second.[2:00:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: In terms of some other fun stuff, my colleague, Greg Gacycki, ran a really Cool number of studies looking at how exercise actually alters the gut microbiome. This is actually an area that we've I probably have 300 stool samples sitting in my freezer in my lab.[2:00:30] Andrew Huberman: Oh, goodness. Another reason to pause before entering your lab.[2:00:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Another reason to not apply to come be one of my graduate students.[2:00:37] Andrew Huberman: Unless Unless you[2:00:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: wanna deal with that, we actually have a number. We've applied for a couple of grants to look more into this, specifically with females. So hopefully, we can get that Funded, but nonetheless, you can actually see some, like, pretty traumatic, and I say that word on purpose, changes in the gut microbiome. There's one in particular study Thinking of that Greg did is he looked at the the changes pre, post, and ultra marathon. And even within a single bout of exercise, I can't remember some of the markers, but I know one of the markers, was specifically increased by, like, 14,000%.[2:01:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: After a single bout of exercise now this is an ultra marathon. This is like like totally absurd amount of exercise relative to what normal people would do Would be but that number I remember, like it was like 14,229% or, like, something some random number like that.[2:01:26] Andrew Huberman: Of Something Meaningful.[2:01:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Something meaningful. I can't remember which marker, that was. That had changed. I know streptococcus was in there.[2:01:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Streptococcus went up, like, maybe something more like 30 or 40 or 50%. The point is, we haven't even had the proper time, and we don't, to even launch into the gut microbiome. Supplementation there needs to be ultra specific. You wouldn't be best served to just jump in and take random things there. That's it's a whole area of emerging science.[2:01:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: We know very, very, very little about it, but there is a number of actionable things one could do, there. So Probably something to not mess with. Would certainly work with a a qualified physician if you think you have something going on clinical or, You know, some actual problem there. Don't work with someone who's not a specialist, a medical doctor there, but, just Randomly assigning a bunch of probiotics or prebiotics without intention is is maybe, the next forefront of human performance research, But we'll have to maybe come back in a few years and dive into that in detail, or perhaps you could bring somebody on as an expert in that to discuss that.[2:02:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Gut microbiome is Fascinating. I think of sleep as the most powerful performance enhancing activity. Of course, you still have to do the activity. Yeah.[2:02:43] Andrew Huberman: I consider it foundational. Like, it basically raises the tide on mental health, physical health, performance of all kinds. There's recent data that during sleep, your body goes through all its various forms of metabolism Possible Yep. Which is amazing. So it's measured from breath in human subjects breath metabolites in human subjects.[2:03:04] Andrew Huberman: So, obviously, if one is thinking about supplementation and wondering, okay, what's what's the best supplement to enhance performance? You gave some, Great rationale for why creatine would be an excellent choice provided you're eating well and, hydrating well. And then To my mind, the next thing on the list would be anything that allows you to improve the quality and Maybe even the duration of your sleep. Although, if you wake up and you feel rested throughout the day and only need a short nap in the afternoon, not everyone needs 1. But then generally, that means you're feeling okay.[2:03:37] Andrew Huberman: People sometimes Get flipped onto this idea that they have insomnia. Insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness where you're falling asleep during the day. That's insomnia. Could also be narcolepsy, but that's insomnia. But supplementation to improve the quality or duration of sleep or both seems to me like the, most direct route, even though, Actually, technically, it's an indirect route to to, performance enhancement and then thinking about things that increase alertness and stimulants and fit and fatigue reducers.[2:04:07] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that's a good logic?[2:04:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. We go to absurd lengths To dial sleep in as much as we can. I mean, the honest answer is, like, truly absurd. This is a conflict of interest of my my company that I'm a part of this. Absolute rest Is anyone with that company?[2:04:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: We actually go out to your house and run a full clinical grade sleep study in you your bedroom on you, and run that over multiple nights. So instead of having to go to a sleep clinic and and have it done in this weird hospital room or sort of setting with these people looking at you through a mirror, it's, like, totally creepy. That is important because that's the only way to truly determine how you are sleeping. Now that said, the technology of wearable trackers is getting better. In fact, I would actually predict Those things will reach a level of accuracy equivalent to the PSG in the next couple of years, and probably will get FDA approval to be able to diagnose officially sleep disorders.[2:04:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's my total my my prediction from some inside information. I don't know that to be true, but it is getting a lot better. Right now, those wearables are not accurate enough to meet that threshold. So the we do is we bring up basically all the equipment, to do that. So we'll come in and do that.[2:05:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now once we understand exactly how you're sleeping, The next question is to answer, why are you sleeping that way? And so this is a full fourfold system. Number 1 is we're going to look at biology, Which means you're going to take saliva and blood, and we're looking at everything from, neurotransmitters concentrations to, vitamins b 6, b 12, etcetera, that are important for sleep performance. So we're gonna see is that is it a physiological problem? Is there something happened there?[2:05:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is cortisol DHEA ratio that we've Previously talked about or, is something like that off. If it's not physiology, then we're going on the next one which is environmental. We run a full environmental scan of your bedroom during those nights of sleep that were there. And that's really important because we can look at everything from dander and pollen and allergens that are in the air. A quick tip here is wash your sheets at least once a week.[2:06:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: One of the common most common places that people, Get allergens in the air is actually from accumulation on your sheets. So if you clean those more often, you'll be in a better spot. A next one the next one there also is, like, keep your I'm sorry. This hurts my heart. I don't even I in in truthfulness, I violate this, but keep your pets out of your bedroom, Certainly keep them off your bed.[2:06:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Our our ghost face killer is my dog, and Noki is my other one. They don't go on my bed, but they're right next to my bed. So we violate that one. But full environmental scan, includes all those things. Of course, there's, we measure light and temperature and humidity and everything else that's going on in the room.[2:06:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Volatile organics that are coming out of the mattress, formaldehyde, lead, out of out of the wall. Like, all these things that could potentially Disrupt your sleep, and we wanna make sure that none of those things are kicking on. We see this constantly. People will have things like trying to be cool, And they wanna be cold at night because that's important. And so they'll turn air conditioner on or a fan, but the air air conditioner kicking on and off at night actually can 2 out of various sleep stages.[2:07:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wanna be really careful that is going. The last metric on that is actually c o two. And so what you remember from our metabolism discussion is You exhale, you're breathing out c o two. Well, if your room is closed and the ventilation isn't great, the amount of c o two in your room starts to build up. And we actually very specifically know the threshold, based on information collected from the International Space Station actually.[2:07:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: We know the threshold at which c o two crosses And starts it disrupting sleep. So we wanna make sure that you're not sitting in the c o two bath in front of your face, and then breathing it back in and and disrupting your sleep. So Environment is the 2nd one. The third one is actually now psychology. So, one of the members on our team is a Harvard MD in psychiatry and and put together an entire sleep And survey.[2:07:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we run through all that to see if there's anxiety, depression, anything like that psychologically going on. And then the furth 4th one there is if you have some sort of actual sleep Pathology. And so this again will include some eye tracking stuff that we can use. So we take all those data. They go back to our team.[2:08:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: We work in combination with with Steve Lockey, from Harvard, who's done a ton of stuff. He actually set up a lot of the circadian rhythm stuff in the International Space Station as well. Himself, Jeffrey Drummer, an MD PhD, Etcetera. And all these folks in the room go over your data, identify what's going on, and build action plans off of that. Occasionally, those action plans will include supplementation, But only if necessary.[2:08:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're really gonna try to come back and work through a system, to improve the sleep however so I realized that is not, totally accessible for a lot of people, but, like, if you really need to go to The end of the earth to figure out sleep, that service is available.[2:08:44] Andrew Huberman: Absolute Rest sounds like an amazing tool Given that most people won't be able to use it, or access it, although we will provide a link in case people are interested in it and do want to try it, You mentioned a few things that I think everyone should, assay their sleeping environment for and, determine whether or not they are hindering their sleep, without realizing it. For instance, the, air conditioning going on and off, or this could be heater going on and off, or, central heat heating or cooling unit. This could be keeping the room dark. This could be cleaning your sheets. Certainly, that doesn't require, that one signed up for Absolute Rest.[2:09:24] Andrew Huberman: So cleaning 1 sheets routinely, keeping pets out of the bedroom as you had admitted you don't entirely. Different opinions about that. But if you're having sleep issues, the dander from animals may may be part of those issues. And then one that I'll just add, which which I think is pretty interesting is that there's some beautiful data out of Michael Turman's lab at Columbia Medical School in New York, on negative ionization. And this sounds pretty, wacky, kind of new AGP.[2:09:52] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure some of you are like, no. Negative ionization, but listen. The Terman lab is a serious laboratory on circadian biology for many decades now. Negative ion concentrations are higher near coastal locations. So if you've ever gone to the sea or gone on vacation and you Sleep better near a body of water.[2:10:08] Andrew Huberman: That's actually a real thing. And there are negative ionization machines, but there are also some things that one can do in order to Increase the negative ion concentration in their sleeping environment that are, nearly zero cost, if not zero cost. You can look those up online, and and we probably will do an entire episode about this in the future. But I think what you described for absolute rest really highlights a more general set of themes that I think are really important, which is Your sleep environment is an environment. It's got a lot going on in it, and it's worth running through the checklist, that you described and asking, you know, where Where things, you know, maybe not optimized, but where am I really getting in my own way in terms of sleep?[2:10:46] Andrew Huberman: All of this, again, being related to the fact that Getting excellent sleep consistently is a com will completely transform everything that you do, and not getting excellent sleep consistently, which is a challenge for so, so many people.[2:10:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:10:58] Andrew Huberman: Will also transform everything that you do and think and feel, but in the negative direction.[2:11:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I can also offer a few tips, honestly, based on things we find most consistently, for those that can't go through, the whole protocol. One quick little actually app Called Time Shifter is really cool for anyone that's dealing with consistent travel and jet lag. So you can go and enter your location, your time, where you're going, The location, and then it'll actually back calculate, you know, give you full light, stimulant, food, hydration, and stuff Protocol and you just follow along with that. And we've used that for many years actually, especially when traveling to, like, Abu Dhabi for vice, and, Mongolia, and And Brazil for the Olympics and sort of all over the place.[2:11:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, that's I think that app is still available. I hope so. It it's great. A nice tool. A couple of things we found major.[2:11:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're dealing with acid reflux, so if you're someone who has problems like that, you can just elevate the head of your bed by, like, 6 inches. So So if you, you know, put little piece of wood or something underneath it, you can also buy very inexpensive pillows, that can elevate that. Now that's not solving the problem, but at least can help you sleep Whether it's just that night or if it's a consistent problem, you can do there. If you're snoring, like I said, that's not really benign. You should probably take a look at that.[2:12:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your first step there is mouth tape. If that doesn't work, you can go through what's called myofunctional therapy, which I don't know if you covered that before. But it's basically tongue exercises, and that can be quite effective specifically for people who have problems with REM sleep. So myofunctional therapy, it's just a it's kinda like you do, like, Depending on the protocol, some tongue exercises kind of in the morning, afternoon, or night. And that takes a while, to be honest.[2:12:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're probably going to need at least 6 weeks Before you start seeing anything, but that actually is is pretty well demonstrated to help with sleep. So you can probably Google. We could find a link for for exact protocols. I don't wanna describe all them. But, Yeah.[2:12:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna strengthen your tongue so that it stops falling in the back of your neck and waking you up at night. So that's a really free easy free protocol to use. If you're struggling with no. It could be insomnia, but it could be just things like when you get into bed, you're super Tired and you can't fall asleep or things like that. Kind of a basic rule of thumb we use is only 2 things happen in your bed.[2:13:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: And if you can make sure those are the only 2 things you do in your bed, the problems of falling asleep or insomnia tend to go down. Those 2 things are you have sex and you sleep, and nothing else goes down in your bed. And so you can make that environment, very special, and that can help, quite effectively improve your ability to fall asleep, And then not wake up early. So keeping that environment specific to what it's for, can be effective. The only other thing I would think of is and I I hate to say this because it's not super practical, but it's just quite clear at this point.[2:13:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sleeping with a partner in your bed, It's just not very good for sleep. So[2:13:52] Andrew Huberman: Good luck with that one.[2:13:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: I know. You can do a couple of things if it helps. You can get 2 smaller beds and put them right next to each other. If you can actually have separate sheets, that alone can be helpful. So if you get you know, I mean, if you're on a king-size bed or something, and again, I know some people, they're just like, there's no chance.[2:14:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: But if you wanna know the the cost for your, like, the Effective and your relationships. Lose your lose your loved one. Ideally Please[2:14:20] Andrew Huberman: don't. Please don't.[2:14:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh my goodness. So, the only last thing I wanna mention here is something that's popped up just a few times recently, but you're going to see more of, which is called orthosomnia. So that is a term that is people are growing concerned over, which is wearables and sleep trackers causing sleep issues. So people be basically become too obsessed with optimizing, maximizing scores, and that alone well, actually it's actually You so you learn when to wake up, and so you have actually, an anticipatory response when many hours prior to waking up. So if you actually learn to have A little bit of a what's that little molecule of, like, excitement and reward?[2:15:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, dopamine. That's the one. If you start getting that because you wake up and you get super excited to check your score, or your phone it is the same thing if you check your phone or Twitter or whatever in the morning. That'll actually start carving back your wake up time Because you start launching it, so it it can ruin sleep becoming too obsessed. So what I'll say is if you're going to use a sleep tracker And you just, like, don't care.[2:15:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: You wanna check it and you have fun with it? Great. But if, like, you are really, really, really interested in it and you pay a lot of attention to it, don't check your sleep score For at least the 1st 60 minutes after waking up, and then you'll that should help you.[2:15:36] Andrew Huberman: That's a great tool. I think they'll, end piece of advice, I think, generally, because I think a lot of people are waking up in the middle of the night checking their phone 2 or 3 times per night. I'm kinda wondering why they're doing that, and I'm guessing it's this anticipatory wake up Circuit.[2:15:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. You absolutely should use either your night mode or do not disturb or airplane mode or something overnight.[2:15:54] Andrew Huberman: Or leave it out of the room.[2:15:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I mean, if you have to wake up and, Like some people have, like, a family member who's maybe on great health, and so they have to get their phone around in case they call or things like that. So So I get it. You're like, I can't leave it out. Keep leave it in there.[2:16:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Leave it in do not disturb, and enter in their phone number or whoever's phone number so only they can get through. But keep it black and white. So if you do have to look at your phone at night, you see black and white, and you do not have notifications. So make sure that there's no notification for no for no email and a a no DM, like, get all that stuff off your screen, and so you look at the did anybody call? Did anybody text of importance?[2:16:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: What time is it? No emergency going on, black and white. Okay. Right back to sleep. So that can help a little bit.[2:16:35] Andrew Huberman: One of the supplements that I found is Extremely useful for being able to fall back asleep if I've woken up in the middle of the night and for some reason can't, and is also very effective for enhancing sleep when one is ingesting fewer carbohydrates, an issue that a lot of people run into, or for people that are fasting for many hours before sleep. You know, people are trying to not eat anything within, you know, 2 to 4 hours. But Is Inositol 900 milligrams of myo inositol? I I find again, this is ANECD data, to be clear. That if I wake up in the middle of the night and I've taken 900 milligrams of inositol before initially falling asleep, then I fall back asleep much more easily.[2:17:17] Andrew Huberman: So that's why I've added 900 milligrams of inositol to my so called sleep stack. I've also tried just taking it alone, and it works well alone, but it works better, of course, with the MAG 3 and 8, ApoGen and theanine sleep stack. The, the also in terms of tools For sleep, the the app Reverie that was developed by my colleague, doctor David Spiegel, who's a medical doctor at Stanford Psychiatry Stanford School of Medicine Psychiatry. There is a free trial. There's a nominal cost if you use it, month to month, but the data are really strong that people that use that, I think it's 8 to 11 minute sleep hypnosis once a week, and it doesn't have to be in the middle of the night when you wake up.[2:17:59] Andrew Huberman: Really helps improve people's, ability to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep, fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night. In some cases, curing insomnia. In other cases, really just helping people with their general sleep issues. And I mentioned this because, obviously, it's a technology. It's not a supplement.[2:18:14] Andrew Huberman: But I know that some people are supplement averse. Also, if you look at by at the cost comparison between taking the sleep stack Totally. And the Reverie app, it's pennies on the dollar, really. So, again, I'm a proponent of both for myself, but I realize that people have varying budgets. And, again, I should say, as always, behavioral tools first.[2:18:35] Andrew Huberman: And I I think of the Reverie app as as more or less a behavioral tool.[2:18:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. It's, it's really just a tool. Any of these breath work protocols, hypnosis protocols, they're just a tool for you to Touch back in with your own physiology rather than a a substance that's coming in. So I I fully support those. We have used a number of those, in in protocols, there's some other tricks that we can pull in those areas.[2:19:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: I probably shouldn't say this, but the reality is Depending on what's keeping you up, sometimes we recommend just getting up and getting it done. Like, if it's a really like, if it's A project or a thing or whatever, like, sometimes it it rather than laying there all night not sleeping, you can get up, get it done, and then if you stay awake, Fine. At least the anxiety is gone. Or sometimes you can actually go back to sleep because you're like especially if the task only literally would take, like, 10 or 15 minutes. It may ruin your sleep, but you're you're gonna have ruined sleep anyways.[2:19:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you you can try that tool. You don't wanna pull that card very often, and you have to be very careful to what You consider to be something worthy of doing that, but that is, like, between me and you and nobody else here. That's a tool I have used personally more than a few times, where it's just like, I get an idea and I don't lose it or, like, the solution for something you've been noodling on for a long time pops in your head and just like and you're not wanting to forget it. Just get up, get it done, and get on with your day.[2:20:03] Andrew Huberman: In several previous episodes, you emphasized how exercise induces various adaptations depending on the Type specificity, volume, intensity, etcetera, of the exercise. And that during exercise, the degree of adaptation that one triggers is often associated with things that normally we don't associate with exercise related health, things like huge increases in blood pressure during exercise, Huge increases in inflammatory markers, muscle damage. Right? These all things all sound terrible. But as you beautifully explained all of that triggers adaptations that then bring those markers below the baseline with which they were previous to the exercise.[2:20:45] Andrew Huberman: So that's the adaptation and the recovery. Within the realm of supplementation and nutrition, I'm aware of a number of things, some herbal, some lipid based, Other compounds that are used for various things, but that are known to have a potent anti inflammatory effect, Things like omega 3 fatty acids, ashwagandha for its effect on cortisol, although that's a bit indirect to the inflammatory pathway, Curcumin, and things of that sort. Given that we want inflammation in order to trigger the adaptation response to exercise. And given that we want to reduce inflammation in the recovery period, Can we put together a logical framework as to when is best to take anything anti inflammatory, whether it's supplement based or prescription or over the counter drug, and when to Strictly avoid taking any anti inflammatory supplement or, a behavioral Tool, you mentioned ice can reduce inflammation. That's why you don't want to do it too close to exercise.[2:21:50] Andrew Huberman: Anyway, I think you get the gist of the question. What about specific supplements related to Inflammation and anti inflammatory responses, what are the best ones? When should we take them? When should we avoid taking them?[2:22:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: The way that I think about it is Understanding what we call the fitness fatigue model. So what I mean by that is whenever you do some sort of insult, the whole idea is is for you to come back and get an adaptation. Now recovery is not adaptation. Right? Recovery is recovery.[2:22:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Adaptation is what happens after you're recovered. Right? So it's a very important distinction there. Fitness fatigue model says, basically, you've done something and you've got an adaptation, and you've enhanced fitness. And And by fitness, in this case, I mean it as a nonspecific term.[2:22:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you got stronger, you've, improved your endurance, like, whatever thing you're trying to train for. At the same time though, your fatigue elevated. So what happens is if fitness increases at the same or similar rate as fatigue, Your performance actually isn't any better. And so you may think, oh, my program isn't working. I need to then train harder, or I need to take more Anti inflammatory or whatever the things are.[2:22:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: When reality, all you really need to do is reduce fatigue. And if you do that, Your performance will increase and all the training adaptations will be actualized. So the way that we do that is a couple of things. 1st and foremost is actually a taper. So the the first step I think of if someone is training very, very hard and you're not seeing any results, and we want think about supplementation.[2:23:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Before I get there, I wanna think about taper and deload. If you're actually training hard and sleep and everything else is taken care of. So just Without going too far into taper, some general from general parameters there. You wanna think about about a 50% reduction in training volume Over the course of about a week, for every 8 weeks of training. Super, super rough.[2:23:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So if you've been training hard for 3 months for something, You might wanna taper for 2 weeks. Something like that. Right? It it's sort of a rough estimate.[2:23:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: That taper, you actually don't need to reduce intensity because intensity is not the driver fatigue. It tends to be volume. So as long as your volume is reduced by 50%, you can maintain intensity. You can maintain in fact, I generally would recommend maintaining Frequency. So if you're used to working out 4 days a week, keep it 4 days a week.[2:24:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can go down a little bit in frequency, but if you go down too much in frequency, you actually tend to feel super lethargic. So So I wouldn't do that. If you do those things correctly, you can typically see somewhere between, like, a 3 to 8% improvement in performance, within a matter of days. So it's important to do that. We actually ran a study on cross country runners years ago, testing on a metabolic heart, muscle biopsies, blood, a whole bunch of things, and we did it pre and post 3 weeks of taper.[2:24:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we actually this is cool because we did this in competitive season. So these were collegiate cross country runners, And we got them to come to our lab 3 weeks before their conference championship, ran them all through a bunch of testing, biopsied them. They went through their 3 week taper, and then we biopsied them again, and then they went and ran, their conference championships and stuff. Well, what happened was they end up hitting about a 50% reduction because what they did is they took out what we call the junk volume. So So they kept their race tempest high intensity stuff in there.[2:25:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: They kept the recovery stuff, and then at medium pace, they just basically reduced. Now they were terrified as any endurance Ron or or a Darrin South Leader participant would understand, when you take volume away, they tend to get very nervous. And so they didn't like that. But as a result of that, what we saw is their VO two max, despite the fact that they covered half the mileage, their VO two max did not Go down in 3 weeks of reduced taper. Your fitness is ins is extremely stable.[2:25:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: And in fact, once we actually looked at their data, The enzymes in their muscle responsible for oxidative metabolism were maintained. And so you don't have to worry about losing, Again, fitness, we're talking about overall performance or even, oxygen capacity, mitochondrial function, etcetera. That was all preserved. Obviously, we saw performance go up. What was actually really interesting is we saw I think it was around a 10% increase in type 2, which are fast twitch Muscle fiber size.[2:25:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we saw a 10% increase in FastBridge Fiber size at the end of 3 weeks of tapering. Now what you may think is like, wow, I guess tapering is anabolic, but that's probably not what happened. What realistically probably happened was their volume of training was actually causing their fibers to be reduced in size. And then once we remove that fatigue, they just recovered back to normal. So that's a good example of what I'm talking about.[2:26:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Once you remove the fatigue, you can actually see enhancements and performance not because you're necessarily getting better, but because you're removing the A semi life is suppressing you. So that being said, the way that you wanna think about recovery like this is although recovery, Especially, like, injury recovery, like, seems chaotic. Biology is very organized, and there's a very specific 3 step process That you're gonna go through for recovery, and then there are different supplements that can help you in each of those 3 areas. So area 1 is basically inflammation. So this is when the Sidok Heim storm comes rolling out.[2:26:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: It starts signaling the injuries there. In this case, even if it's muscle damage. It activates immune system to kick on and that whole repair process happens there. What you're trying to do effectively in fact, this is why You probably ever wonder, like, why is inflammation a thing? What you're trying to do is bring in fluid, enhance the size, and increase Blood flow in so they can get nutrients for repair and immune cells or anything like that in the system and get the waste out.[2:27:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So short term inflammation, even in the case of muscle soreness is the Example we we talked about in the previous episode. But any inflammation, it is part of the necessary process. That's why you would not wanna take an anti inflammatory in that state, And so why you also would not wanna do things like an ice bath. So in that immediate inflammatory response time window, this is, You know, seconds to hours after training, you would wanna stay away from things like that. A good option here are things like omega threes.[2:27:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Good evidence. Some are somewhere in the neighborhood of, like, 2 to 5 grams total. Typically, like a one to one, EPA to DHA ratio is fine. Similarly, this is another example of when good doesn't mean more is better. Because for example, there is actually evidence showing up to 15 grams will harm the immune response.[2:28:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so you don't just wanna be like, man, I'm super sore. I'm training harder. I'm just gonna go to 10 grams in here. More and more. You're actually causing yourself more of a problem.[2:28:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: So antioxidants, anti inflammatories are fine. Again, omega threes in that dosage, are a decent thing. You can also do something like 500 milligrams of curcumin, Three times a day. That's gonna be enough, to keep you in a decent spot. There are some other things that you could look up.[2:28:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe some potential benefit for ginger, I'm Boswellia and some things like that for inflammation. But under unless we're in, like, very specific circumstances where we have like an injury, we're probably not going to those, you know, areas.[2:28:54] Andrew Huberman: I just wanted to highlight one thing that came up in a previous episode. Some, not all people, but some, including myself, are very sensitive to curcumin. Yep. It has a very potent effect in reducing DHT, dehydrotestosterone, and leads to all sorts of, clamping of testosterone associated positive things. So, I have experienced that myself.[2:29:18] Andrew Huberman: I've had people write to me and say, I don't understand. I started taking a supplement. Curcumin is supposed to be a great anti inflammatory. It flat lined my libido. It took away my drive, and kind of wondering what's going on there.[2:29:31] Andrew Huberman: Those people are very likely to be very DHT sensitive. Curcumin, while it's a potent anti inflammatory, can also potently reduce DHT. But some people tolerate it quite well and are hearing this and probably think that's ridiculous. Well, it's, certainly substantiated by the biochemical pathways that curcumin Taps into in the known roles of DHT on libido, aggression, power output, etcetera, and mood. So just be wary that, a, there's no way to predict this.[2:29:57] Andrew Huberman: One simply has to figure it out empirically, meaning you have to try and see if you like it or don't. The good news is is those, negative effects on DHT seem to reverse pretty quickly after, ceasing to take, curcumin. So just a mention of something that came up in a previous episode, but in case people didn't hear that on that segment, just wanted to highlight those those facts.[2:30:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Further evidence do I Strongly discourage. Strongly discourage taking anything in the anti inflammatory, antioxidant realm unless you actually have a reason to do so. If you're waking up and you're, like, maybe I'm inflamed, that's probably not a good approach. Right? Let's have a reason to do so.[2:30:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Step 2 is actually what we call proliferation, and that's kinda like the cleanup crew. That's when you're gonna be going in there and cleaning out dead cells and debris and misfolded proteins and things like that. At this stage, a fantastic evidence based supplement, is glutamine. Glutamine, 20 grams a day. We typically honestly split it up into 2 dosage, 10 grams morning, 10 grams night.[2:30:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a conditional amino acid, which means You can make it. Your body can make enough of it at times, and other times you may wanna support it. Generally, those conditional times are things like burn victims, high stress situations or injury, things like that. So, there isn't also, like, a ton of downside Taglutamine because it can go through, transamination, which means your body can take it and say, like, we don't need anything here for our muscle recovery. Let's make it into an, something else and use it for whatever else is needed.[2:31:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's kind of another one of these, like, low risk, products is also why you see it in a lot of recovery products. If you're ever wondering, like, what the heck is that in there? I don't need amino acids, and you're thinking it's like for protein synthesis, it's really not. It's because of this it is, beneficial to this proliferation process.[2:31:47] Andrew Huberman: I've been taking glutamine for years. I tend to take it In higher dosages several times throughout the day if I'm ever feeling particularly rundown.[2:31:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[2:31:56] Andrew Huberman: I know there are decent data. Not great, but decent data on the role of glutamine for leaky gut.[2:32:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally.[2:32:01] Andrew Huberman: We're off saying leaky gut. That's getting a little bit into the realm of, like, not super well substantiated, but in the in the peer reviewed literature, but some a a lot of anecdotal and, and certainly some peer reviewed work, but not a ton. And then there is also, growing interest in the idea that glutamine, because it can trigger activation of the neurons in the gut that signal to the dopamine pathway in the brain, that it can be used to offset sugar cravings. This is kind of an interesting new, and emerging theme, which makes sense given the biology of the neurons in the gut that respond to, specific amino acids including glutamine, essential fatty acids, and sugar. And because they respond to any, and all 3 of those, anyone or combination of those, I should say, to trigger this dopamine response.[2:32:52] Andrew Huberman: Some people have taken to, A teaspoon or so of of Glutamine in some water or other drink couple times throughout the day as a way to reduce their sugar cravings because What's essentially doing is it's tricking the pathway in the into activation of those neurons through an alternate, ligand receptor interaction.[2:33:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. Also, another interesting point, there are very I'm trying to think right now off the top of my head. I can't think of a time and And I've used glutamine a lot. I can't think of a time where I've ever heard anybody come back with any side effect reports.[2:33:24] Andrew Huberman: I think if you take enough of it, you can get Some gastric distress, but, of course, you take enough of any powdered substance, you'd mixed in water, you're gonna get a a gastric distress response. And what I've noticed about gastric distress with things like, creatine, glutamine, and even protein powders for that matter, I use a high quality, whey protein powder, routinely, is that if you build up to it over the course of a few days, Then you can get away with using much higher dosages without any issue.[2:33:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. Beta alanine is the same thing, by the way. We sort of talked about that earlier. If if, You've ever tried that and you're like, oh my gosh.[2:33:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, I feel like I've just rolled around in grass and my skin is itching everywhere.[2:34:04] Andrew Huberman: Ants under the skin sensation?[2:34:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. All that stuff. You can just take a little bit of a lower dosage and be fine, for the most part. And then you will build up a tolerance to that pretty quickly, so you can Up that dosage along the way. So what we will oftentimes do there is start at a dosage that's pretty minimal like 2 grams.[2:34:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then Every week or so, you can go up another gram until you get to whatever final point you wanna be 5, 6 grams a day, you know, whatever. So that's another way you can sort of mitigate that problem. So the 1st step in this recovery process, after inflammation, proliferation, we're now into remodeling. And this is when you're actually, you know, quote unquote, growing back bigger and stronger. This is where the majority of the repairs actually taking place.[2:34:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: And at this point, we're basically playing a micronutrient and macronutrient game. Right. By that, I mean, we've talked about basic macronutrients. One thing to pay attention to. Oftentimes, if people are hurt, Whether they had an injury or they've had, just they're super sore and they are concerned about eating excess calories, They tend to want to eat less food during this process because they're like, I'm not working out so much, so I'm gonna eat less calories.[2:35:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: One of the things that you have to pay attention to is Injury can increase basal metabolic rate by up to 10%. Wow. So what you want to do in general is just Take your calories up about 10%. At least that's what I recommend. If that is an extended period of time, then yes, you may put on a slight amount of Body fat or something.[2:35:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: But if that also means you come back some percentage faster, then it's worth the exchange. So we recommend that. In terms of your carbohydrate or fat split, I'm not super worried about it. My general recommendation is just don't make any major changes relative to what you were doing. Right.[2:35:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Keep yourself, pretty much in the same spot. In terms of protein, this is the big one. You wanna make sure you were absolutely at 1 gram per pound of body weight, Because we need those amino acids to come in and start helping, with recovery.[2:36:01] Andrew Huberman: One gram of of protein per pound of body weight or more or 1 gram?[2:36:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or more. Yeah. There's gonna be very little downside to to having more. Remember, Protein and carbohydrates both stimulate insulin. And remember, insulin is anabolic, and so we're trying to drive this process of recovery.[2:36:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's why you want both. So you wouldn't want to skimp on carbohydrates in this phase nor would you wanna skimp on protein because you need the activation, the drive into the tissue, as well as the structure. Going back to one of our earlier conversations, and at this point in the week, I honestly can't remember at all what episode we cover this in, but I gave an analogy about, use making a campfire And using fat and carbohydrates as the wood and then the log and the protein were the the the metal structure. So you need that Supply. If you're trying to bank if you've cleared out in the previous step, damaged proteins and you need to make new ones to recover that process, you have to have the raw supply in Immaterial.[2:37:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wouldn't wanna avoid either one of those things. There's actually some indirect inflammation management that comes from fatty acids, which you actually sort of alluded to earlier. I don't think you need to go crazy. You didn't don't need to change your fat intake that much. Just don't drop it, you know, depending on where you're at.[2:37:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're a little bit of a higher carb, lower fat person, great. If you're moderate, great. If you're the indirect, if you're higher fat, lower carb person, awesome. Just don't Make an extreme change and don't and try to not be on the extremes of either one of those ratios. But, the only specific number to pay attention again is that Protein number.[2:37:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: And if you go a little bit high or even a lot high, it's totally fine. Just don't go low. So that's the the macronutrient portion of remodeling. In terms of micronutrients, to be honest, you you just get your bases covered. This is when a basic multivitamin, is Effective.[2:37:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: What you're really trying to look at here are vitamin a and zinc. They actually have independent mechanisms that are helpful here. But those are typically covered in most multivitamins. So We generally just give people a multivitamin. Magnesium is actually has some some benefits here, something like 6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight Is the dosage you're looking for there?[2:38:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Magnesium citrate is probably has the most evidence, in terms of disrespect, but it doesn't mean I actually have no reason to think you couldn't use Glycinate or if you're using other form for sleep, That probably fine. I don't know that for sure, but I I can't think of a reason why the other forms of magnesium would all of a sudden not work. So you could probably choose whichever form you like. I'll be at citrate has probably the most research in this aspect. The only other things you would probably consider here, 3 things.[2:38:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Calcium might be on your list, particularly if you're trying to if you're concerned with some sort of bone injury, and we sort of gone past, like, Recovery and we're actually, like, into injury. So you'll see that in recovery products occasionally, and that's why. And then the last 2 ones, of course, are vitamin d, And that's pretty well researched. And then the last 1 is actually, something that can help you if you're at this stage, and you still are dealing with a lot of soreness, or not. And that is tart cherry juice.[2:39:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that's actually effective for, both DOMS, muscle injury, muscle soreness, and actually has another benefit of potentially aiding with sleep. So I'm not a bad one to turn to as well. And there's a number of companies that make these things. Yeah. And then there's actually more ongoing research that I know of on those areas, but, promising literature, we'll say.[2:39:27] Andrew Huberman: Not often, but every once in a while on this podcast, I will solicit social media for questions from the audience, where I should say the audience to be, and then ask some of those questions on the fly during the podcast. I did this with doctor Lex Friedman. I'm going to do it with you. Your goal is to answer each of these questions, certainly not all of them, thousands of them within the last couple of hours. To answer each of these questions in 3 or 4 sentences.[2:39:59] Andrew Huberman: I certainly won't be counting the number of sentences that you speak. So just know that if you wanna go over a little bit, that's fine. But feel free to refer to your Instagram site at a future time where you might go more in-depth or to refer to a study, or, if you like, you can also say pass if you don't think that you can answer the question, you know, succinctly enough for this format. And here, the goal is not to put you on the spot. The goal is simply to allow the audience to ask some questions directly, and I I confess I'm looking at these for the 1st time.[2:40:30] Andrew Huberman: So I'll try and be quick with my with my reading. Some of these we may have touched on In previous episodes or in this episode even, in which case, you can just kind of queue us to the reminder. This is not directly related to supplementation, but it is related to nutrition, and I don't think we touched on this directly. Can we do intermittent fasting, aka time restricted feeding, with Keto and still gain muscle mass.[2:40:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: TBD. I am am quite clear. Such study does not exist. So I don't know. I think I've alluded to, before that we did run an intermittent fasting 16/8 hypertrophy study.[2:41:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: There is no keto arm. The results of that study by the time this comes out, will probably be ready though. I'm not sure. So I can't comment, on it. I haven't looked at the data.[2:41:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: But regarding whether or not if you did that with keto or not, I can't comment scientifically.[2:41:26] Andrew Huberman: Do you ever prescribe the use of GABA supplements?[2:41:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, I can't prescribe anything to to make sure we're clear.[2:41:34] Andrew Huberman: But you're a professor. You can profess.[2:41:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can profess. We generally don't spend too much time on GABA. Rarely.[2:41:41] Andrew Huberman: Is it okay to wait, train, fasted, then not break the fast and eat for 3 or 4 hours after training. So in other words[2:41:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[2:41:49] Andrew Huberman: Train fasted, I do this, but then also not eat immediately following training and wait another 3 to 4 hours after training.[2:41:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Once we have our results from our intermittent fasting study back, we will we will have a better answer here. My General recommendation as it stands now though is as long as your total protein intake is sufficient, you should be in a decent spot.[2:42:13] Andrew Huberman: Great. A lot of questions about fasting and training just to Yeah. To note that. Can you train high performance fasted, and how long before, you need to refuel the body.[2:42:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. You can certainly do that. I know of actually many athletes. Some athletes that will do that, though the vast majority will not. As it gets higher and higher in intensity and or duration, it gets more challenging.[2:42:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it really does come down to what you did the day before as well. So if you ate sufficient Galleries the day before, didn't train, and your glycogen stores are topped off. You have a fighting chance. Now the duration part of that equation is really kinda dependent upon you. So are you really talking 30, 45 minutes, 60 minutes?[2:42:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're probably fine. And whether you're out past that in several hours, you may not be. And then the only other comment I would make is there's keep in mind, whenever you think about fasting and any other, I'd say against the textbook, you know, quote, unquote style, you really, really need to be careful in thinking the difference between can I do it and is it optimal? So I have absolutely no reason to think fasting like that would improve performance. I only work for the most part with people who are trying to perform at the highest level possible, So I can't think of a scenario which I would go too fasting to try to enhance performance.[2:43:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: So whether or not you can maintain some level of performance? Probably. Will it Provide any benefit. I struggle to find scenarios in which that would actually make you perform better.[2:43:39] Andrew Huberman: How do different forms of carbohydrates impact performance? And then right below Another question about carbohydrates, which is does carbohydrate cycling work? So these are 2, Questions from people that I think don't know one another, but a lot of carbo questions about carbohydrates and performance, which we've touched on. Anything else that you want to add to that conversation?[2:43:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't think I really maybe you might wanna think about carb loading, slash carb cycling. So carbohydrate loading does help. However, a misconception there is it's just, you know, a big bowl of pasta the night before. That can help top off storages, but really optimal carbohydrate loading prior To a long duration endurance performance is probably best over the course of 3 or 4 days. So you wanna gradually increase carbohydrate intake for multiple days Rather than just have 1 big bowl of pasta.[2:44:32] Andrew Huberman: Branch chain amino acids and essential amino acid supplementation. Yay, nay, or as I would say, meh.[2:44:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Meh, usually. If your total protein intake is fine, Then you don't really have a need for them. If you're for whatever any number of valid reasons, total protein is not, Then going to an essential amino acid would be my first step rather than a BCAA. Now admittedly, we actually do use essential amino acids somewhat regularly Because it's it's also sort of like a there's no real harm other than if you're price conscious and you're sort of like I'm wasting money, that's fine. The people I work with generally again, that's not A few dollars for to maximize.[2:45:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Recoveries is not that very so we will sometimes use that, pre med or post Training in in some circumstances, total protein would be my high quality whey, something like that. If you can't use Whey for whatever reason, there are plenty of high quality vegan proteins you could use. If you wanna top all that off though and add some essential amino acids, it wouldn't hurt anything and may potentially help slightly. So you choose, based on that algorithm.[2:45:43] Andrew Huberman: I was hoping somebody would ask this. Touched on it a little bit. It's a little bit of a loaded question the way they phrased it. So, at risk of leading the witness. Does the mythical anabolic window really exist?[2:45:56] Andrew Huberman: And I'm just laughing because the way they pose the question, they're already telling us what their stance is. Making it more effective as To create hypertrophy, to eat within a certain time frame after working out, I'm going to assume that this person genuinely wants to know whether or not the anabolic window Really exists or not, because they refer to it as mythical. I'm gonna assume that they're, Suspicious, but what's the deal? Is the anabolic window a real thing?[2:46:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: The post exercise anabolic window is extremely real. So What this is, you can see more detail in a number of videos on my YouTube page, I believe. It is the idea that you need to must, consume Some sort of nutrients specifically, usually protein, in some time domain, 30 or 60 minutes post exercise in order to maximize growth. So is that window real? Yes.[2:46:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Are you hypersensitized to nutrients in that time frame? Yes. Is it very important that you rehydrate, replenish muscle glycogen and rebuild tissue, quickly after exercise to maximize recovery. Absolutely. It's not real though in the sense that you that you have to have it within 30 minutes.[2:47:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: In the case of protein as we talked about a 2nd ago, your total protein intake throughout the day is more important. Timing though for things like carbohydrate, especially if you're training multiple times a day, it is very real. So It is a very real thing. It's just you may or may not actually care about it. It may not be important for your context.[2:47:23] Andrew Huberman: Garlic seems like an appropriate question. What if any functional roles does garlic have in performance?[2:47:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Garlic's actually really cool. There's a number of things you can dive into That are outside of my 3 to 4 sentences considering I'm at, like, 2a half probably already. You're not gonna find strong human data on garlic extract. However, there is a little bit, suggesting it can actually enhance recovery from injury or potentially tissue damage. So You gotta kinda be careful though because in order to understand what's happening, you have to differentiate between innate and adaptive recovery processes.[2:48:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: And when we say things like immunity, realize that's not one thing. That's just like a very colloquial term for a number of things.[2:48:09] Andrew Huberman: Again, it's a verb. Like, it's a noun. Right? The immune system, but it it immunity is a bunch of processes or processes. If you're about to correct my speech, I'll correct yours right back.[2:48:20] Andrew Huberman: Not yours, Andy, the listeners. Prosthesis, but tomato, tomato, It's a verb. Immunity is a verb.[2:48:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is my problem with immune boosters. Same issue. Right? You're like, woah. Woah.[2:48:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Woah. What are you boosting Specifically, because in fact, if you're boosting the wrong part of immunity during the wrong phase of recovery with garlic, you may be actually hurting, then the process because you're theoretically, could be trying to down regulate that portion so you can up regulate the next portion. That's the faster way to say it, if you will. So, we actually you may see more data come out that says the garlic extract's now overrated. I don't know.[2:48:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually don't even know yet. We just don't have enough human data on it, but yeah. There's some stuff there if you wanna look hard enough.[2:49:07] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna ask this question for myself because I'm curious to know the answer.[2:49:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Selfish.[2:49:12] Andrew Huberman: Tart cherry extract.[2:49:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Pretty effective, actually, for two things, potentially hate aiding in sleep, getting to sleep, as well as muscle soreness. That's the bulk of the research is in muscle soreness and, seems to be a moderate effect there.[2:49:28] Andrew Huberman: I think for people that might be interested in dosages of things like tart cherry extract, garlic, etcetera, obviously, doctor Andy Galpin's Instagram and Twitter are great places to ask questions like that and to find quest answers to questions like that. As well as examine.com is a terrific website. They actually recently overhauled their entire website, so they have this human effect matrix that shows the, the effects and the the strength of different effects in human studies of many, many different compounds, relating everything to, you know, hormone health in men and women, sports performance, cognitive performance. It doesn't cover everything, but it certainly covers a lot with links to studies. There's a lot that's available at completely zero cost.[2:50:14] Andrew Huberman: By joining examine.com, you can access some additional features. And this is, by the way, not a paid endorsement from examine.com. I'm simply a long time user of examine.com myself. And so I just want to cue people to it. And, again, many of the resources there are available completely free of cost.[2:50:33] Andrew Huberman: It's a wonderful site. So for dosages of garlic, tart cherry extract, and things of that sort, whether or not you're getting it from food or you're getting it from extra, powders rather. All of that information is is Pretty nicely laid out there. So unless you have something to add to that, I was just gonna, queue people to that resource.[2:50:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. I've been using that since the 1st day that website was launched. I I was made aware that it was coming. Been fortunate to know those guys for a while. So, yeah, I've used it.[2:51:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: I've used it in all my classes. I use it I don't even know. Probably weekly at this point. Another neat nice feature that's actually on there is they have a a series of like, they'll do some topical reviews, basically. So they'll write, a big paper out on muscle damage or blood pressure or[2:51:17] Andrew Huberman: Testosterone testosterone enhancement or, hormone, your menstrual cycle and and[2:51:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. PCOS, I think they do going on Yeah. And all kinds of stuff. So you can search by topic, like, you You know, energy or recovery or whatever, or you can search by, you know, black cumin seed extractor. Like, whatever number of things you wanna do.[2:51:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: And it'll also tell you if there's any interactions to pay attention to. So it's really, really nice. So be careful protecting a and b or whatever. So, yeah. It's wonderful.[2:51:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Wonderful.[2:51:45] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They've done a marvelous job. So thank you, Exam.com. Keep up keep up the amazing work. Well, we've come close to the end of this episode, and that means that we are close to the end of the series where you have so graciously joined us for 6 full episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast to educate us on all things fitness.[2:52:07] Andrew Huberman: Episode 1, You reviewed and educated us on assessing our level of fitness. In fact, I learned so many ways of assessing fitness that I had not thought about and also assessing my recovery capacity, for instance. One thing that I'm definitely going to implement from that episode It's a routine broad jump test and, an in home high jump jump and touch test. If people don't know what I'm referring to, that's all contained in that episode. It's time stamped.[2:52:36] Andrew Huberman: These are very straightforward, zero cost ways to assess one's level of fitness. There are few others that require a bare minimum of technology, like taking your pulse rate in very specific ways at specific times, also some timing of Mile runs and some other things relate to strength and hypertrophy and on and on. Really, it's a it's a buffet of options that we can select from, and I already know the 4 or 5 that I started implementing this week. I've recognized how I'm pretty good in a couple of areas. I'm doing maybe, maybe better than pretty well in one area, but that I'm doing amissably poorly in a few areas that, I just wasn't aware of.[2:53:19] Andrew Huberman: And so I've already started, taking on ways to, adjust that over time, and I'll I'll keep people posted. So that 1st episode was absolutely incredible and just provides so much actionable knowledge and the rationale behind it. The 2nd episode, you educated us about strength, speed and hypertrophy training. And there too, an immense amount of incredible knowledge. We got way down into the details.[2:53:43] Andrew Huberman: You explained sets, reps, the rationale for sets, reps, rest, cadence, number of workouts per week. I'm definitely gonna take away my need to do some speed based training and some power based training. Normally, I think in terms of strength or hypertrophy, and I'm relieved to learn that a lot of the speed and power based training, it's low intensity enough that it can be done fairly often and incorporated into my program, which already touches on strength and hypertrophy and indeed some endurance work as well. So amazing tips that you provided there. I'm certainly going to implement the 3 to 5 program that you described.[2:54:19] Andrew Huberman: 3 to 5 exercises done for 3 to 5 repetitions, 3 to 5 minutes between sets. You're doing this 3 to 5 times per week and so on and so forth. All the details again time stamped, in the strength in hypertrophy, episode show notes. So just incredible.[2:54:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: We even used that to set up PR with you this week. That's right.[2:54:40] Andrew Huberman: I did PR this week. Thanks thanks to your input and following that program, and, I'm really grateful for that. It it does feel good to break through a barrier. And I intend to break through more barriers, but not just with strength and hypertrophy because episode 3, you taught us all about endurance. The 4 different forms of endurance, how to train for each of those different forms, the value of doing even very brief 22nd Sprints are bouts of jumping jacks throughout the day, which to some people might just sound like a, you know, like a little hack or a gimmick, but, no, these are actually tapping into fuel systems and Modes of neuromuscular interactions that greatly aid other forms of endurance like long duration endurance.[2:55:22] Andrew Huberman: I would love to return to my, high school mile time, I won't reveal what that is because this is not really about me. But I plan to start doing, if not mile repeats, then doing some mile mile runs and testing there once sitting there once a week. You laid out a beautiful program for how to do that. And then in the next episode, you Wowed us again with a description of the science and the tools and this right down to the details, but all laid out very cleanly and clearly as to how to design an optimal fitness program. What are the things that really represent an optimal program?[2:55:58] Andrew Huberman: What questions does one have to answer before designing a program? What are some of the barriers in the way? This concept of defenders As things that prevent you from reaching your goals and one of the key things, I have it right here in front of me, that I took away from that episodes was this quadrant, approach of really thinking about and figuring out how much one intends to devote to work career calling. Let's make that one been. Relationships, another bin.[2:56:25] Andrew Huberman: Fitness, in the other bin, and recovery, in the other bin. And, here, we'll tip our hat to our our good friend, Kenny Kane, for, mentioning that overall, scheme for doing this has been immensely useful. And I've actually charted it out and thought about and drawn out which different things fall into each of these categories. You might think it's obvious. Okay.[2:56:43] Andrew Huberman: Relationships. But that includes a lot of different things, and there's crossover between these bins, in terms of how you can combine enhancing relationships with fitness, work, recovery, and so on. So that episode is just, again, a treasure trove of knowledge. And then in the next episode, you you educated us on recovery in all its forms in the very short term, in Within the workout, immediately after the workout and from workout to workout, ways to really accelerate recovery, assess recovery. And as you pointed out, for people like me who always assume that we don't recover very well and that some sort of character trait[2:57:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: or[2:57:20] Andrew Huberman: nervous system thing or genetic, To really think about how my training is impacting my level of recovery, and in doing so, it's revealed to me that I have far more capacity than I thought I had. And already this week, I've managed to train more often doing more work, and I feel better than ever. And that's also despite the fact that we've spent a fair amount of time in these chairs across from one another.[2:57:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a kind way to say it.[2:57:44] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's it's been it's been a pleasure. And then In today's episode, you explained nutrition and supplementation as it relates to performance. And, of course, that touches into recovery, but also optimal mental states for training, how to approach one's training, and how to extract the most from training through Quality Nutrition. Right? So what to eat and when, which carbohydrates, protein amounts, windows of opportunity, windows you absolutely don't want to miss, and then some that are a bit more flexible.[2:58:15] Andrew Huberman: And then we went deep into the weeds of magnesium, garlic, tart cherry extract, alpha GPC. We touched on neurotransmitter related systems, hormone related systems. We went deep into a discussion about sleep because, of course, sleep is the foundation for recovery and performance of all kinds, emotional, mental, and physical recovery and performance. And in taking us through this enormous arc of a journey through fitness, I think it's fair to say that you've given us your knowledge contained in your head. I was telling someone, just the other day that one of the things that I always lamented in science is that I would encounter these incredible professors and scientists and in other domains of life too, and you just wish there was some way to download their brain because they had so much knowledge inside them.[2:59:00] Andrew Huberman: And, I'm looking for a USB or USB c, port on you, and I don't see one yet. But what you've effectively done for us across these 6 episodes is to download the actionable knowledge. And, you know, it's wonderful. The information you've provided is clear. It's super interesting.[2:59:18] Andrew Huberman: It's highly, highly actionable. And in many cases, it's counterintuitive and surprising. But once one understands the logic behind it, as you've provided for us also, and it all makes sense in a way that's extremely satisfying and extremely motivating. So it's certainly motivating me to change the way that I train in a number of ways, and I promise that I'll report back to our audience and to you as to what my results are. But really, as we both agree, this is not about me.[2:59:46] Andrew Huberman: This is not about you. This is really about the people listening. And so for those of you listening, I, hope you can appreciate what an incredible gift it is to have somebody of doctor Andy Galpin's experience and, drive and, scholarly background who also works with athletes and everyday people just to splay out all this knowledge for us systematically over 6 episodes. Doctor Andy Galpin, thank you ever so much.[3:00:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: I appreciate that far too kind of, words to me. There If you've been following along through this entire journey as you called it, you know, I like first principles thinking and I like lists. So I'm gonna get you with 1 more list, and I got 5 things On this final list, get your pen and pad out, please. Number 1, I want to really emphasize, Science itself is a verb, which means it's ongoing and changing. I I did my best over the course of these many, many, many hours To, provide my interpretation of the science, to provide my practical knowledge and things that I use, but that's fallible.[3:00:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Science changes. There are many, many things in my career that I was very sure they all that the evidence was clear on, and then it changed. So as you move forward, do not think of any of the recommendations I gave you, whether they were about supplement dosages and timing, rep ranges, or Breathing tactics, anything in between, just use them as guidelines. So number 1, science is a verb. Number 2, I really wanna thank the audience.[3:01:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: This has been an extremely long haul. Some of you have somehow I'm sure, Which I'm not sure how, but some of you have probably made it through this entire journey and listened to all 6 episodes. You should probably get some sort of Free Huberman Lab shirt or something or a plaque or I don't know.[3:01:40] Andrew Huberman: How about a Galpin plaque?[3:01:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Galpin plaque. How about a Internet high five? And even if you just dropped in for a few of the episodes, you know, I I appreciate you taking the time. There's a lot of things you could be doing with your time, and, to make To spend those resources on my words is, touching. Number 3.[3:01:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: I wanna actually thank you, of course, Andrew and the whole team, the crew up here for 3 things. Number 1, I think it's incredibly important That you have gone out of your way to give other people credit for their work. You go out of your way on your large platforms of social media to tag people, To give scientists credit for their work, most people do not do that, and that's something you don't have to do. And I think that is a culture. And, you know, I I know why you do it.[3:02:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: You come from science. That's just what you do. You give people credit for their work, but you go out of your way to do that. And so I wanna thank you for that. The next one is, Many people who have outlets and platforms will try to fill those with people who are going to grow their platforms.[3:02:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: It Doesn't mean these people are wrong or bad, but I think what's extremely special about what you've created here is, again, you have gone out of your way to bring on the direct source of information. I can't even imagine how many of your podcast guests have never been on a podcast before or have been on a very short number of them. And you've made an extremely large Platform doing nothing but talking about super deep dork science directly from the scientists themselves. And to create a community like that, it's, I'm so happy that science has has made it here, and you've shown the world. People aren't stupid.[3:03:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: People want detail, and people want science, and you've given it to them. And the last 1, of course, let's see if I can get through this, is, thank you for what you've done for me in my career. I Understand there could have been any number of people in this chair. To put me on your your platform once was, incredibly gracious, but to do it for 600 hours or whatever we did in the series is, I can't thank you enough for that opportunity. So I hope I lived up to it, and I had a tremendous time.[3:03:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then thank you for being such a gracious host.[3:03:50] Andrew Huberman: Well, you more than exceeded, expectations, you are absolutely the person to be in this chair talking about these topics with me and for the world. And, Once again, I just wanna say thank you as a colleague, as a public educator, as an exercise scientist, and as a friend.
