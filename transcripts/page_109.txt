I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Kyle Gillett. Doctor Kyle Gillette is a dual board certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine, an expert in hormone optimization. He is an MD, that is a medical doctor, and he treats patients with a variety of backgrounds, ages, and goals.[0:00:32] Andrew Huberman: Today, we discuss male hormone optimization. We discuss behavioral tools, nutrition based tools, supplement based tools, Prescription drug based tools and their interactions in determining overall levels of testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, Estrogen growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and many other hormones that impact mood, libido, well-being, strength, cognition, and various psychological factors. We covered hormone optimization in both men and women in previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but today's discussion is different. Doctor Kyle Gillette offers very specific recommendations for people with different goals and of different ages. And we get deep into the weeds of, for instance, how does one know whether or not their testosterone is optimized or not?[0:01:23] Andrew Huberman: How often to test for specific hormones such as testosterone and other hormones, and really how to gauge how good One should feel. This is something that's often overlooked in discussions about hormone optimization or health optimization of any kind for that matter. For instance, people will talk about Reduce libido and discuss whether or not testosterone levels are to blame. But how does one calibrate their libido in the 1st place? That is, how does one know whether or not their libido Is normal, too low, or too high?[0:01:53] Andrew Huberman: We also discussed, for instance, whether or not hormone optimization should be pursued continually throughout the year. For instance, Optimal hormone function. These are things that every male should be doing and various things they should actively avoid if their goal is to have healthy hormones and to, quote, unquote, Optimize their levels of every hormone from growth hormone to testosterone at any stage of life. And while today's discussion is about male hormone optimization. I want to emphasize that we discuss all the various ages for male hormone optimization.[0:02:32] Andrew Huberman: So for those of you that are parents, for those of you that Our young, those of you that are middle aged or old or teenagers, we explore adolescent, puberty, teen and late teens, early adulthood, Adulthood and into the late geriatric ages. So regardless of your age and whether or not you are male or female, today's episode ought to be of interest to you. I should also point out that we will soon also be hosting an expert guest on female hormone optimization. One thing that I'm certain people of all ages And biological sex will enjoy about today's conversation is that we also get into descriptions of how psychology and life events impact hormones and how hormones impact our psychology and the way that we show up to various life events. So today is really a broad overview that goes all the way down to find details about male hormone optimization.[0:03:22] Andrew Huberman: And I'm certain that by the end of today's episode, you'll have an immense amount of new information about how this endocrine, that is hormone system And your body works and how it interacts with your brain and other tissues and many, many actionable tools that you can pursue regardless of stage of life. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis.[0:03:58] Andrew Huberman: Thesis makes custom nootropics. And as I've said many times before on this podcast, I am not a fan of the word nootropics because it means Smart drugs. And frankly, there are no specific neural circuits in the brain or body for being, quote, unquote, smart. Thesis understands this, And they've developed custom nootropics that are designed to bring your brain and body into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish. They use the highest quality ingredients, things like Phosphatidylserine, Alpha GPC, many ingredients I've talked about before on this podcast and that I happen to use myself.[0:04:31] Andrew Huberman: Been using Thesis for over a year now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a game changer. For me, I like their nootropic for clarity. I use that before cognitive work Often, and I like their nootropic for energy, and I often use that before workouts, in particular, workouts that are especially intense. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to takethesis.com/huberman. Take their 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month.[0:04:57] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman, and use the code Huberman at checkout to get 10% off your first Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see clearly. For instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back again, whether or not you're looking at something up close or off into the distance, ROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity.[0:05:40] Andrew Huberman: ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and cycling. And indeed, they are very lightweight. Most of the time, I can't even remember that they're on my face. They're so lightweight. But the important thing to know about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that while they can be used during sports activities, they also have a terrific And they can be used just as well for wearing to work or out to dinner, etcetera.[0:06:03] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code huberman to save 20% off on your first order. Again, that's rokaroka.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress well over a year ago, and it's been the best sleep that I've ever had.[0:06:28] Andrew Huberman: One of the things that makes Helix mattresses so unique is that they match the design of the mattress to your unique sleep needs. So for instance, if you go onto their website, you can take a brief quiz. It only takes about 2 or 3 minutes. You'll answer questions like, do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night, or whether or not you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach, or maybe you don't know. Regardless, they will match you to the custom mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs.[0:06:51] Andrew Huberman: For me, that was the Dusk, d u s k mattress, which for me was not too firm, not too soft, and was ideal for my sleep patterns. You take the quiz, and you'll find out what mattress is ideal for your sleep patterns. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helix sleep.com/huberman.

I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly Banding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.[0:07:40] Andrew Huberman: And now for my discussion with doctor Kyle Gillett. Doctor Gillett, great to have you back.[0:07:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Great to be back. Thank you.[0:07:48] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to begin with a question about one of the most mysterious and important phases of life, which is puberty. I've long wondered whether or not how quickly somebody goes into puberty, so at what age, And how long puberty takes, so how brief or protracted that puberty is for them to acquire the so called secondary sexual characteristics, things like Hair growth on the face for males or, changes in bone and muscle, density and growth, etcetera. You know, when I was in middle school and high school, I noticed that some people transitioned into all that very fast, and some people, took a long time to acquire those characteristics. Can we learn anything about ourselves, our hormones, and maybe even how long we're going to live based on The time in which we enter puberty and how long it takes us to progress through puberty, I guess that also raises the question, does puberty ever truly end?[0:08:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There are many takeaways from puberty. Some of the actionable items from it is, yes, it can and does affect your adult height And also stature and also body composition. So puberty is a time, and If you're if we're talking specifically about males, think of it as a a time where if you have obesity as a child, You could potentially use that time to change your lifestyle and habits and reset things, and it is a bit easier. It's almost like a a free injection of testosterone and metabolism and drive and effort into your life. There is a wide variation in, how quickly puberty goes through.[0:09:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So there's stages called Tanner stages, which we don't necessarily need to get into. But if you enter puberty very early, then it can, decrease your adult height or stature.[0:09:45] Andrew Huberman: So for a given male that enters puberty at 13 versus a male that enters puberty at 15, can we say that the Guy that entered puberty at 13 is going to be shorter than the guy that entered puberty at 15, or it's not quite that straightforward?[0:10:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If they are identical twins And the individual who entered puberty at age 13 also finished puberty, went all the way through the Tanner stages. And if you do a bone scan, which I believe is usually done on the left wrist, And it says, yes. Your growth plates are mostly closed. You're not gonna grow more than a couple inches of height after that.[0:10:20] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Just a related question. When I was growing up, it was thought or at least people would say That resistance training, in particular lifting heavy weights, could stunt one's growth. Is that true or false?[0:10:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It is False when you're talking about just lifting heavy weights. Dirty bulking certainly has the potential to stunt one's growth for for 2 main mechanisms. Could you define dirty bulking? So, dirty bulking is eating an excess of calories not just to acquire lean metabolically active body mass Or get stronger, but, purposely acquiring body fat.[0:11:02] Andrew Huberman: So purposely Acquiring muscle and fat by overeating[0:11:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes.[0:11:07] Andrew Huberman: And lifting weights can stun one's growth. Do I have that correct? Correct.[0:11:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it does 2 things. If you're doing that as a very young child, it can that fat can can become leptin resistant, and it can produce more leptin. And that leptin can activate the hypothalamus, which activates the pituitary, which releases gonadotropins, which basically just Increase testosterone and estrogen earlier than it otherwise would have. It's the same mechanism behind why childhood obesity causes early puberty. Interesting.[0:11:39] Andrew Huberman: I do remember a paper published in Science Magazine. I believe it was focused mainly on females, but showing that when Enough body fat accumulates, the hormone leptin is secreted, and that triggers the onset of puberty.[0:11:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct.[0:11:52] Andrew Huberman: Given the increase in, childhood obesity that we're observing now, are we seeing an earlier onset of puberty in males and females?[0:12:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. In both males and females. Not to get too technical, but there's a g protein coupled receptor on the hypothalamus, and leptin directly binds it. So it does appear directly causatory and not just correlation.[0:12:14] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So and if I understand correctly, what you're saying is for a young guy, let's say, 13, 14, who wants It's to really bulk up and deliberately deliberately, excuse me, overeats and is doing their squats and deadlifts and bench presses and really trying to Get big, they will get big, but only in the lateral dimension. They are they're effectively limiting their total height, And it can shut down the long bone growth of of their limbs. Is that correct?[0:12:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. The the growth of the long bones is mostly related to the estradiol Alpha receptor, so, basically, one of the receptors for estrogen, which can be secondary to, early puberty and also is related to body fat because you have that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.[0:13:00] Andrew Huberman: So can we assume that If a young male wants to get into resistance training, that bodyweight exercises are probably okay And maybe even some weight training, kettlebells, etcetera, but that they should avoid doing so called dirty bulking, trying to deliberately gain weight Up until what age? Until puberty is over?[0:13:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I would say an individual should limit the amount of, body Abnormal body fat accumulation or dirty bulking indefinitely throughout their entire life?[0:13:33] Andrew Huberman: So, again, if I understand correctly, that recommendation to avoid Deliberate weight gain or rapid weight gain is not just to allow an individual to reach their maximum height, but Also, to avoid laying down a lot of body fat cells. Correct? Correct.[0:13:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The balance between that is when you are going through puberty, You are able to add a lot of lean body mass, not just muscle mass, but bone mass and other mass as well.[0:14:00] Andrew Huberman: I started lifting weights when I was 16, and I confess I trained pretty heavy at times. I don't know whether or not I would have been taller, than I am now. But When I started that training, I had already reached what was at least close to my predicted height. I can't say that I deliberately waited until I'd grown. It just so happened that I stumbled into the weight room and found that I liked it at age 16 at which point I was already the height that I am now.[0:14:28] Andrew Huberman: So in any case, what I'm hearing is that laying down a lot of excess body fat is not a good idea. What if Somebody grows up chubby or fat, for whatever reason, reasons related to the eating patterns in their family, maybe with some genetic reasons. Is it safe And or wise for a young person, so let's say somebody who's around the age of puberty or even younger We're in their late teens to be dieting and actively trying to lose body fat. Is that safe?[0:14:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Under the supervision of a physician, it is certainly safe to Change your body composition. In pediatric obesity medicine, you're often talking about a recomposition or a Renormalization of the growth curve compared to peers.[0:15:13] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you. So as you may have sense, we started Chronologically with puberty, and I know that there's another puberty that even precedes the puberty that we're all familiar with. Maybe if you wanna just briefly mention that because I was Talking with you about this before we started, the puberty that I'm most familiar with and I think most people are most familiar with, the acquisition of deepening of the voice, It's, growth of muscle and bone, body hair, acquisition of libido, and things like that. That's actually the 2nd[0:15:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The 1st puberty of everyone's life is the 1st 3 months of their life. You may notice that your baby has more acne the 1st 3 months And that they also have, in general, just more changes related to androgens and estrogens, Perhaps oilier skin, even more genitourinary like, genital growth during the 1st 3 months, And this is mostly due to DHEA, which is an adrenal hormone. The 2nd puberty or the puberty that most people know of actually starts that same way as well. It's called adrenarche, and it's when the adrenals kick in, I guess, for the 2nd time.[0:16:29] Andrew Huberman: Is there a standard Age or age range in which the testicles descend in males?[0:16:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Usually before birth. It is not uncommon to have 1 or even 2 undescended testes, but there is a risk of testicular cancer, especially if they're not fixed early and also heat damage to the testy.[0:16:49] Andrew Huberman: Well, thank you for that coverage of the 2 puberties. So early in life, I imagine some of our listeners are probably, still in 1 or the well, one of the other puberty. The ones that are in the 1st puberty, obviously, aren't aware that they're, listening to this podcast, but maybe it'll be embedded in their subconscious. But some listeners probably are still in puberty, but I think everyone can remember back to their puberty and roughly when they first entered puberty and how quickly they aggregated the secondary sex, characteristics. I'd like to turn now to a general question about what all males ought to do in order to optimize their hormones.[0:17:24] Andrew Huberman: So if you could just list off the things that all males should do on a daily basis, weekly basis. I mean, should guys in their teens twenties be getting their blood work done? Should they be taking supplements? We already talked about weight training. What should they be doing?[0:17:37] Andrew Huberman: What should they avoid doing if the goal is to have a long arc of healthy hormone throughout the lifespan.[0:17:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's many things that you should do. An analogy that I often make is When there's a brand new car that comes off the assembly line, you do a full scope of diagnostic workup, hook it up to the computer, and I think we should do the same thing with humans as well. During puberty, you know, obviously, you're a functioning human, but, I would say there's still development. And I think that the The human always develops. I don't think development ever ends, but you wanna monitor that progress across a person's lifespan.[0:18:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So for[0:18:17] Andrew Huberman: oh, sorry. So for blood work, I mean, what would be the earliest let me put it this way. If blood work Didn't cost anything, and everyone could get it. When would you want to see everybody get their blood work done for the first time?[0:18:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Obviously, individuals under the age of 18 should talk with their parents about this. And as long as that, the parents And the child kind of agree, and the parents are on board with this as well. You can start getting blood work. Often, A child will come in with complaints of either precocious puberty or delayed puberty, and this individual might be 9 or this individual might be 15 for a healthy child when they're going through kind of their later Tanner stages, which is 45, so they've developed several secondary sexual characteristics. They might have, hair growth or, starting to notice, more beard growth, that's a good time to do it.[0:19:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If you're concerned with stature or height Or if you're not tracking along where most members of your family have, not just their height and stature, but also the timing of their puberty, then That's[0:19:26] Andrew Huberman: time to get lapsed. Right. So if I could travel back in time, I would have gotten my blood work done for hormones and lipids and everything else At 18, I, unfortunately, didn't know where and how to get that, and I didn't have any pressing clinical issues. And so I think the 1st time that I got my blood work done, I was in my late twenties, maybe even my early thirties, and I'm still dying to know what my blood work was when, for instance, I was 17 and I felt a certain way. And and I and I confess that in many dimensions, I actually feel better now at I'll be 47 soon at 47 than I did in my teens and twenties.[0:20:03] Andrew Huberman: And I think it was more on the psychological side. I think that, but in terms of just understanding why we felt Great or why we felt or feel terrible or not so great. I think, blood work is extremely informative. What do you think are the Key things to look for in blood work. I mean, testosterone is always the topic that comes up in the context of male hormone optimization, but, certainly, there are a lot of other hormones that are important as well.[0:20:28] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:20:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And with testosterone, you want to get either testosterone and SHBG or a free testosterone.[0:20:34] Andrew Huberman: Could you define SHBG for our listeners, please?[0:20:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It is sex hormone binding globulin. It is the protein that binds up all androgens and estrogen of the body. So the stronger the androgen, the stronger it binds. During puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT, which is the strongest bioidentical androgen, Has a huge role, a prominent role in secondary sexual characteristics. And if your SHBG is very high, then your DHT can run higher because it's not metabolized, but there's not quite as much free DHT.[0:21:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So you wanna balance between, a high enough free DHT and a high enough total DHT.[0:21:14] Andrew Huberman: And, obviously, these blood tests are going to have to be Read and interpreted by a qualified physician. Most people aren't going to be in a position to evaluate them properly or at least not with the full depth that they could if they had an MD like yourself, looking at them. Okay. So everyone should get blood work as early as possible, depending on their budget and and availability. What should everybody do in terms of monitoring those markers?[0:21:39] Andrew Huberman: So assuming that there's no major intervention, How often do you recommend that people get their blood work done?[0:21:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Let's say let's take an individual who just turned Teen, they just got their 1st set of blood work. They'll probably find something in it that they may want to optimize using shared decision making with their physician. Usually, a[0:21:57] Andrew Huberman: good follow-up is about 6 months. K. So twice a year getting blood work done and having a Physician evaluated. That sounds reasonable to me. And for those that didn't initiate this at 18, such as myself, is the best time to start then would be as soon as possible.[0:22:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right. In terms of the other things that all male should do, meaning all males of all ages, puberty and beyond, should do, What what are some of those things? So on a daily basis, maybe you could just take us through the arc of a day and, and push out some of the protocols that you use or the things that you like to see your male patients use in order to try and optimize their hormone status.[0:22:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I'll briefly touch on some of the lifestyle pillars to start. Diet and exercise are the first 2. In puberty, sleep is particularly important, of course. But with diet and exercise, throughout a lifespan, you want to Not exclude things that are helping you. For example, during puberty, if you're consuming dairy and then all of a sudden you cut out all dairy, dairy can help increase IGF one And free IGF one.[0:23:05] Andrew Huberman: And and just, again, for our audience, maybe you just mentioned what I g what having enough IGF one can do for us that's beneficial is[0:23:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It helps you grow. It, helps with, genital development, secondary sexual characteristics, and long bone growth, skin growth, hair growth, a host of things.[0:23:22] Andrew Huberman: So getting an array of nutrients that include dairy, what other sorts of nutrients are important during development?[0:23:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You wanna have adequate vitamin d. Vitamin d helps with testosterone production. It helps again with bone mineralization And, Stature, after an age of about 25, and there's not a strict cutoff, but Up to about the age of 25, optimizing your growth hormone in IGF one helps with bone density and bone growth. So, from the dietary standpoint, you wanna have enough free estrogen, not too much when you're growing, but You want to help, basically, stockpile bone to prevent a risk of osteoporosis or thin bones fractures[0:24:06] Andrew Huberman: When you're older or someone who broke his left foot 5 times while in high school, I can say that whatever young people can do to optimize their would be great. That problem seems to have resolved itself over time, but I don't know. Back then, I was, I did a short run as a vegetarian, but I've always been an omnivore. I realized that some of this relates to ethics and food allergies and things of that sort. But would you say that on balance that most People would benefit from eating a combination of, you know, quality proteins from animal sources and nonanimal sources, fruits, vegetables, and starches.[0:24:42] Andrew Huberman: I mean, what do you think, for instance, about people following a pure carnivore or a very, pure vegan diet in their twenties thirties? In their late twenties, it[0:24:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: might be a reasonable option. In early twenties and certainly teens, it is a horrible idea because it is likely to significantly decrease your free androgens. So you will have less Can we decrease your free androgens so you will have less testosterone acting on receptors through the body?[0:25:07] Andrew Huberman: Are there any other micronutrients or macronutrients that people in their twenties and thirties should emphasize?[0:25:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: We haven't really touched on fatty acids or fiber too much. Fiber is going to be paramount in kind of like setting your set point of your gut microbiome the rest of your life. There is Prebiotic fiber, which you could think of as fish food for your good gut microbiome. Your gut microbiome is kinda like an aquarium or a fish tank.[0:25:33] Andrew Huberman: I'm just thinking about goldfish swimming around in that the goldfish eating people. Don't eat goldfish, people. Yep. Live or dead.[0:25:41] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. But any fiber or food that you're putting in your gut, it's either going to it's going to skew your gut microbiome towards something that is more beneficial or more detrimental.[0:25:52] Andrew Huberman: And would you say that the prebiotic fiber and getting essential fatty acids, That would be important to do throughout the lifespan or just for people in their twenties and thirties?[0:26:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Throughout the lifespan, particularly important in the teenage twenties, thirties Because that helps with brain development. You're certainly more of an expert than me when it comes to, brain development, but it does continue to develop Really throughout the lifespan, but certainly through the twenties thirties as well.[0:26:20] Andrew Huberman: About, taking a multivitamin while you're growing up. So many people, Do that. Is it necessary? Is it useful? And if it's not necessary, is it safe to do anyway?[0:26:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's generally safe to do anyway. I do not think everybody needs a multivitamin. The more exclusionary your diet is, For example, if you have, celiac disease or if you're planning on fertility soon, then perhaps it's more reasonable to take a multivitamin.[0:26:48] Andrew Huberman: In a previous discussion of ours, I asked you about, caloric restriction in testosterone. And if I recall correctly, the idea was that if Somebody is overweight, they have excess fat adipose tissue, then getting rid of some of that adipose tissue by through caloric restriction and exercise, Provided it's done not too fast in a healthy way is going to be beneficial for testosterone in the long run. But that For individuals who are not carrying an excess of body fat, caloric restriction is actually going to lower testosterone. First of all, do I have that correct? And second, there any, addendums to that that you'd like to to give us now?[0:27:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's correct. If you look at An individual in a caloric deficit, several changes will happen. One is that they'll have less building blocks for hormones. Another is that they will be in a catabolic state more often so that balance of anabolism and cat catabolism will be different. They'll likely have less signaling from growth hormone in IGF one, and they'll also have the high SHBG that we defined earlier as the binding protein.[0:27:53] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So there Free androgens and free estrogens will go down.[0:27:57] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Okay. So we touched on sleep being critical, I would say, throughout the lifespan. Trying to get Enough quality sleep, at least 80% of the nights of your life, and the other 20% are just what happens when there's noise outside or you're stressed. It just You have an exam or you're having a great time for whatever reason.[0:28:16] Andrew Huberman: There are a lot of good good reasons to lose some sleep now and again[0:28:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[0:28:19] Andrew Huberman: As well. But so we have sleep. We've got, nutrition. We touched on that. We'll get back into supplementation.[0:28:26] Andrew Huberman: Now what are some of the other pillars of creating a the proper environment for hormone optimization.[0:28:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Stress is probably the next one. During, both puberty, but also the twenties and thirties, individuals are figuring out how they want to cope with stress And also figuring out what they want to choose to put their effort into. So if someone is overstressed, then they can have, it can Put all the other lifestyle pillars, and then they stop dieting well. They stop exercising, and everything else can go askew. There is also some degree of, social component to this, so perhaps I need to add a 7th pillar of social.[0:29:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You know, during your twenties thirties, you may be forming a family as well. Perhaps you have children, and the health of the family unit is going to be vitally important, not only not necessarily directly for hormone optimization, but it's gonna throw everything else off if it's off.[0:29:29] Andrew Huberman: And for people that are not starting their own families in their twenties and thirties, can that social connection, be extended to friendships and work relationships as well?[0:29:38] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Absolutely. In fact, if someone's not starting a family, it it is just as concerning, but for other reasons. Each individual is gonna have their close group of family and friends. And if someone does not have one of those connections, that's when things can potentially, get bad, not just for them individually, but also society.[0:29:57] Andrew Huberman: So when you say stress, you mean learn to manage your stress. What does that look like? I mean, when if a patient, you know, has high blood pressure, even if they don't, you just sense that they're stressed. They put a lot of pressured speech or they're not feeling well or communicating that they're not doing well. What are some of the things that you recommend in order to try and ameliorate Stress.[0:30:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's different mindfulness or relaxation techniques. Going outside can often help with this as well. Dietary changes and exercise can help with this too. Some people like prayer or meditation, and a lot of people like, counseling or therapy or even just talking, openly with a family member or a friend.[0:30:37] Andrew Huberman: What would be some of the other pillars for hormone optimization? Here, I feel like we're not just about people in their twenties and thirties, but, again, we're, you know, wrapping our arms around, basically, puberty onward. I mean, I'd I mean, gosh. I looking back, I I started meditating pretty early. I started weight training And running early, I gave some thought to my diet in high school, but really was in college that I started thinking more about what I was ingesting and why and trying to do better there.[0:31:00] Andrew Huberman: But People are coming to the table at different stages of, life and trying to optimize for hormones. So, you know, so what what would it be some of the additional things that everybody should do?[0:31:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Everyone should get outside and find, a movement pastime to last a lifetime. Gonna get sunlight. You're gonna get some degree of heat and cold exposure, and you're also just gonna move more. Being in an artificial environment Where there's artificial lights, artificial air conditioning, is, going to have many effects on your body. So that's vital.[0:31:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Another one is finding what your purpose is in life. So I call this spirit, but it's really just component of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is basically your physical needs, your mental needs, and[0:31:48] Andrew Huberman: then your purpose in life, what you really like to do. Now picking some goal or target. And I always say that you don't have to stick to the same goal over time. Certainly, I haven't. Although I got started early in the science game and I'm still in it.[0:32:00] Andrew Huberman: The idea is not to pick the end goal. It's to pick a goal. And then once you reach that goal to Assess and then pick another goal and so on. I think sometimes when people hear about picking a purpose, they're like, oh my goodness. I have to define sort of like naming oneself that you you you actually can change your your your goals and purpose over time.[0:32:20] Andrew Huberman: This is terrific. Would you, suggests that people actively use or avoid supplementation prior to doing all these other things. I'm somebody who likes to throw the kitchen sink at things, but I also like to do things pretty systematically. So I always say behaviors first, then nutrition, then supplementation, and then maybe and if and only if there's a real need, and, of course, working with a doctor prescription drugs. Mhmm.[0:32:43] Andrew Huberman: But, you know, there are probably people in their twenties or thirties, maybe even in their fifties that aren't feeling great, and they wanna do something in order to be able to train more and or to, feel more confident to seek out social connection. They try and go go about the whole, business from the other from the other side as well. And what are your thoughts on that?[0:33:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I see supplements and medications as very similar, one's prescribed and one's not. In general, medications have more side effects or potentially stronger therapeutic with more efficacy, but they're just tools to reach an end goal. So depending on the goal, if there's an individual that's an athlete, then certainly they should consider supplementation. Or if someone, desires Optimal or very a very high level of cognitive performance, they should also consider supplementation. At the same time, food is medicine, and a lot of benefits you can get in supplements, can get into food as well.[0:33:37] Andrew Huberman: Guess it depends on how much time and energy you're willing to spend and also finances. You know, I know that when I was in college, I could afford just a few supplements, And they're basically whey protein and some fish oil. I was fortunate that I was pointing the direction of those things and some creatine. I couldn't afford much else. Over time, of course, I could afford more, but, it really does often depend on on finances.[0:34:00] Andrew Huberman: Before we get into some specific recommendations To optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, growth hormone, etcetera, I wanna ask you a question I've been wondering about for a long time. You know, so often in the discussion about male hormone optimization, people will say, well, you know, if your libido is suffering, You know, you might wanna be concerned about testosterone or even estrogen. Right? Because we know that estrogen can impact libido as well. Sometimes Having estrogen too low is detrimental for libido.[0:34:28] Andrew Huberman: Or people will say, you're not recovering from workouts or you're just or you're feeling kind of depressed. The problem is it's all subjective. So How does one know whether or not their recovery from workouts, their energy, their confidence, their libido is within within a healthy range. I mean, obviously, for people in a relationship, they can know whether or not their libido matches the sort of cadence of of the relationship in their partner.[0:34:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Mhmm.[0:34:51] Andrew Huberman: But How should people think about this and maybe even start to talk about it? Because one of the big differences, I think, between, males and females is that because females have a monthly cycle, They are familiar with the changes that occur in their hormones over time because every 28 days, those hormones are changing dramatically in ways that impact their physiology and psychology. But for males, I feel like there's sort of a a, a dearth of language to get into the more subtle aspects of this. It also has to do with privacy issues and people feeling like they don't wanna overshare, too much, not knowing what's appropriate to share. But when you Talk to a patient who's in their thirties or maybe even their seventies or sixties, doesn't matter, a male patient.[0:35:33] Andrew Huberman: What are you listening for? And, you know, I know you're not a psychiatrist, but, you know, what are your ears tuned to in order to try and figure out whether or not this person could really use some help with hormone optimization or whether or not something else? Or maybe they're just doing great, and they don't realize it because they're placing demands on themselves that are excessive.[0:35:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You wanna you wanna use a lot of open ended questions. This process is called motivational interviewing, and your goal is to listen to the patient and not Plant an idea in their mind that they can follow because everybody is going to have a different goal. Some people are better at reading their biofeedback Or, telling how they feel on a daily basis. There is screening questionnaires designed, for example, an ADaM questionnaire to look at men's, men's health and hormone related health.[0:36:22] Andrew Huberman: It's called an ADAM questionnaire. ADAM questionnaire. A d a m. Correct. Is it available online that could be administered to themselves, although we don't want people making clinical diagnosis of themselves or anyone else.[0:36:32] Andrew Huberman: Is it that sort of exam? It is. Interesting.[0:36:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I don't believe it is a clinically validated tool like an ASCVD, which is like a a risk of heart attack and stroke tool or many other tools. There's one for depression. There's one for anxiety. They're called PHQ 9 and GAD 7, respectively. But, anyway, there's often an in the Adam questionnaire and what you hear from the patient, if you are a very careful listener, is often different.[0:37:00] Andrew Huberman: Can you give me an example of some of the questions on this Adam questionnaire or the sorts of motivational interviewing that you might do? So, Sam, you're patient. We sit down. What sorts of questions would you ask to probe these kinds of dimensions of of hormones? Questions about libido, Questions about athletic performance, questions about motivation.[0:37:19] Andrew Huberman: And often, the patient will answer one thing, but what you hear from them subjectively is far different. Interesting. Can you give me an example of of a question? I'm I'm happy to be the the guinea pig here.[0:37:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A classic one is a guy comes in, And a lot of times, they say, oh, no. The wife made me go to the doctor. I go, once a year. That's it. I don't want anything.[0:37:41] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I don't want any medications. Their screening questionnaires might be zeros across the board, so nothing, no issues. They're apparently in perfect health. They talk to you for a while. They get some rapport.[0:37:53] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They like you. And then right as you're finishing up the visit and about to go out the room, They mentioned that, and their libido isn't quite there, and they're having a little bit of ED as well and perhaps are even having some chest pressure tightness.[0:38:07] Andrew Huberman: I see. So right as you're leaving the room, a patient will tell you that they're having some sexual side effects or not side effects. They're having some sexual challenges, And then they'll mention chest pressure. Is the chest pressure a sort of general decoy for it's gotta be my heart, or is it, or is it related to the other things they're reporting?[0:38:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It can be related. In fact, erectile dysfunction is known as the canary in the coal mine. So coal miners would take the canary down, and it would, the canary would die before the coal miners would have, I believe, carbon monoxide poisoning. And often, one of the causes of ED is plaque buildup, which can happen in the coronaries as well, but sometimes they notice the symptom in the genitals before they do in the coronaries.[0:38:49] Andrew Huberman: So for such a patient, let's say that patient was a young person where plaque buildup in the arteries and veins is not all that likely if they're, let's say in their twenties or thirties, what would be your next step of the interview at that point, and what what would you consider? Would you immediately order labs for that person to try and rule out any kind of, actual hormone level deficiency.[0:39:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I certainly would order labs. There are some individuals that are very similar, and they come in and they have the same symptoms. And 1 individual might have a very, very high testosterone, and 1 individual might be, severely hypogonadal. So there's a A big difference between the subjective and what the labs look like, so I certainly order labs. You also ask them about, if it's situational or not or not, you ask them if they have ED, if they're, you know, you ask them about their habits.[0:39:39] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You even ask about, Porn and masturbation and all these issues, and, of course, it's between the doctor and the patient. And depending on what they tell you, you can often determine if there is a Situational component, some people call it psychogenic ED, but I don't love the term psychogenic ED because it kind of puts some Some blame on the patient's mind, but a lot of the time, that is the case. There is even a test, and this is very rarely ordered, but it's called a nocturnal penile tumescence.[0:40:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Because is is it true that there are Periodic erections during sleep.[0:40:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct? Yeah. So, you basically put a cuff to see if you're having, an a normal sized erection during sleep. And I believe about 90% of the time they do that test, they are indeed having erections.[0:40:28] Andrew Huberman: Which would point to this psychogenic Origin of whatever challenges they're having in terms of sexual interactions. You mentioned porn and masturbation. This topic has come up a bunch of times on this podcast and on other podcasts I've gone on because of the relationship between dopamine, sexual motivation and sexual behavior. And I've been of the pretty strong stance that while I'm not judging porn or masturbation, it Can create a brain wiring situation where males in particular essentially teach their brain to be aroused by watching other people Have sex as opposed to being the 1st person actor in sexual, interactions. So in that sense, you know, that's more about the brain wiring and neuroplasticity and dopamine.[0:41:14] Andrew Huberman: But what are your thoughts on porn and masturbation as they relate to hormones? Mean, this is a big debate on the Internet. In fact, one of the most, common debates is whether or not masturbation increases or decreases testosterone in males. Certainly, It will decrease motivation to go find sexual partners. We know this, and there are more and more data on this all the time.[0:41:36] Andrew Huberman: In terms of the effects of Pornography and masturbation. And here, I suppose we need to be somewhat specific and operationally define what we're talking about. We're talking about Porn and masturbation to the point of ejaculation. Right? Because my understanding is that the Ejaculation and and orgasm associated with it cause an increase in prolactin, which blunts libido for some period of time.[0:41:59] Andrew Huberman: The duration of that will vary person to person and circumstance to circumstance. But, basically, all of this points to the fact that porn and masturbation can really limit libido In the real world. Mhmm. And to me, pornography and the screen is not the real world. Though screens exist in the real world, the real world doesn't exist in the screen.[0:42:19] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's an accurate statement, and prolactin does have a significant acute increase after, ejaculation. It does to some degree after orgasm as well, but prolactin acts on the pituitary to inhibit the release of the hormones, LH and FSH, of which LH can increase testosterone. So this may be one of the cases where the dose makes the poison. And if it is a very frequent habit,[0:42:49] Andrew Huberman: Certainly,[0:42:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: daily or more than once a day would be very detrimental from a hormonal component Not even taking into account the the neural wiring.[0:42:59] Andrew Huberman: Listen. I think it's terrific that you've actually defined frequency because this is the problem. On the Internet or even in the doctor's office, You'll see, descriptions about pornography being dangerous for certain things or or detrimental to hormones. People say frequent, but what's frequent? So you're saying daily or multiple times Per day would be potentially detrimental to the hormone profile of a male of essentially any age.[0:43:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And that's just for masturbation. With pornography, with porn use as well, it would likely be worse.[0:43:30] Andrew Huberman: Why why is that? Just this this the sort of dopaminergic drive of the stimulus, just a really intense visual stimulus?[0:43:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Dopamine sensitivity. I think that, using the analogy of a dopamine wave pool, it would deepen the pool, but not increase your supply of dopamine.[0:43:47] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you could describe the dopamine wave pool because I think it's such a powerful way of thinking about dopamine and what dopamine does. In fact, I've Always credited you in when I've done it, but I've I've generally, stolen your analogy of the dopamine wave pool because it it's so astute.[0:44:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The dopamine wave pool describes the natural variation of ups and downs in your dopamine or your motivation. And, in the wave pool, depending on how high the peak is, you often have a deeper trough, So you do not want too high of a peak. In addition, if your peak is very, very high, for example, when you're using, many substances Like, cocaine or like amphetamines, your dopamine can go so high. You lose almost all the water from the wave pool. And then when you crash from that, not only is the trough low, you have less dopamine in the pool to begin with.[0:44:43] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The dopamine receptor is extremely sensitive as is the GABA receptor, which is an inhibitory receptor, whereas dopamine is technically a stimulant more related to adrenaline or noradrenaline. The depth of the pool can change very quick. So you wanna have that happy medium where you're fairly near the top, but you're not so near the top that the depth of the pool is gonna go down.[0:45:06] Andrew Huberman: So if I interpret, that in the context of this discussion about, libido, sex, and masturbation, it if somebody has a very intense sexual experience and not not here, we're not necessarily talking about an intense, orgasm. We're talking about just an, You know, a lot of intense visual, so very, a lot of intense imagery, your auditory input, or both. That is going to lead to a situation where dopamine is going to be depleted afterwards. Correct. A guest on this podcast, before my colleague at Stanford, doctor Anna Lemke, Addiction talked a bit about this, this sort of seesawing.[0:45:41] Andrew Huberman: Like, you were talking about a wave and a crashing out of the water from the wave pool there. It was a seesawing from Pleasure and pain is gonna be a longer and deeper period of lack of pleasure following that. And I think a lot of people think, oh, well, that's great. You know? They want the intense experience.[0:45:57] Andrew Huberman: But if that intense experience is coming from pornography and masturbation Or I suppose coming from, you know, high adrenaline activities like, you know, life, life risking parkour hanging off the side of a building, It inevitably is gonna lead to depressive episodes, low libido episodes that follow. Is that right?[0:46:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. In a similar physiologic way, to withdrawal from stimulants like amphetamines. Now is sex with a partner different? Because there are many people[0:46:27] Andrew Huberman: who are chasing more and more intense experiences with a partner as opposed to through pornography and masturbation. Again, here, we're talking about all ages, and I should always Anytime we're talking about sex with a partner, we're talking I you know, the the 4 conditions that I was, lay out on the, Huberman Lab Podcast are that we're talking about consensual, Age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate interactions.[0:46:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. And, this is also a case where the dose makes the poison. So if there's, you know, obviously, meeting all those criteria, if they have one preference, that for both of them is a positive experience, then that is likely okay. You're not gonna be able to maintain dopamine over a certain threshold for a long period of time. So there very well may be a crash experience as well, and the crash may be different in one partner than the other.[0:47:23] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Oh, I'll draw an analogy to food. It'd be like, you know, you don't have to serve the banquet meal 7 7 nights of the week, maybe just 2. Is that right? And there are other delicious foods out there.[0:47:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Can I use[0:47:34] Andrew Huberman: that analogy?[0:47:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That is very reasonable.[0:47:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Not trying to be PG 13. Just trying to, parsimony, Occam's razor, the ability to Describe a lot of things in in a in a few words. I'd like to return to the key things that people should do, I should say the key things that men should do to optimize their hormones. So we talked about getting some movement, getting some sunlight, getting quality social connection one way or the other, Avoid excessively frequent masturbation and viewing pornography.[0:48:03] Andrew Huberman: And for some people, 0 might be the optimal number. And I keep coming back to this people. For most people. Interesting. I feel so fortunate to have grown up prior to the availability of Internet pornography.[0:48:14] Andrew Huberman: I've never been a big everyday life. Consumer of pornography had just not been my thing, but I hear so often from males of all ages about their addiction to it, their Fliction by it, it's really a serious issue, and that's one of the reasons why I'm grateful that you're willing to talk about this and your clinical experience with these patients. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.[0:48:49] Andrew Huberman: The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact Our immediate and long term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, And they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera.[0:49:36] Andrew Huberman: And they'll give you a year's Apply a vitamin d 3 k 2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d 3 k 2. In terms of exercise, you know, here's again, it's a double edged sword. On the one hand, it's great to get exercise, but I'm familiar with know, if I train an hour a day, you know, 10 minutes of warm up and 50 minutes to an hour of weight training or 50 minutes to an hour of cardio, I feel great, especially once a week, I take a complete day off. That's sort of my general schedule.[0:50:06] Andrew Huberman: I'm also familiar with when I go out for runs that are excessively long, 2 hour runs, or I And 90 minutes in the gym too frequently start to feel like garbage. Everything suffers. My sleep starts to suffer. It doesn't matter how much I eat. I don't seem to recover.[0:50:20] Andrew Huberman: I don't feel well. So I realized that recovery ability varies between individuals, but what do you think is a healthy, sustainable exercise regimen that Anyone can follow that will also support their hormone status.[0:50:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: For really vigorous exercise, Around 3 to 4 times a week is very sustainable over a long period of time. On top of that, you could add in 3 or 4 more Instances of less vigorous exercise.[0:50:48] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So for less vigorous, what do you mean that, you know, zone 2 cardio where you can hold a conversation but beyond which you you can't? And for more vigorous, you're you're thinking weight training or hit, high intensity interval type training. Is that right?[0:51:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. You can also weight train and have Some benefit even at a low to moderate intensity. If you think about, weight training where you have and it's not necessarily related to the incidence DOMS, which is delayed onset muscle soreness. But if you weight train lazy or easy from time to time obviously, you wanna weight train very heavy time to time as well because of, more lean body mass growth. But, if you weight train lighter, you're going to be able to do it more often, And it can still help with the hypertrophy of, collagen, for example, in tendons and ligaments.[0:51:39] Andrew Huberman: So here again, like to, perhaps drill into this notion of intensity and lightweights because for me, some of the most brutal workouts I've ever done were In what I would consider a high repetition range, 15 to 50. Actually, I went up to Oregon to watch the international track and field championships, and we went by the, Cameron Haynes' place. Mhmm. Right? The the Cameron Haynes.[0:52:00] Andrew Huberman: And he and his trainer put us through a workout that was 25 to 50 Repetitions per set, and it was done in circuit, and it was brutal. So it was light. I mean, that's those weights were nothing. In some cases, it was body weight, But the number of repetitions was brutal. So when you say limiting intensity, are you talking about limiting the number of, sets to failure?[0:52:21] Andrew Huberman: Are you talking about, really being kinda a lazy bear in the gym. I like to do that everyone, so a long long rest to that sort of thing. What what are your thoughts on that As it relates to hormone optimization so I'll just mention and then I'll let you answer. I feel best overall when I'm training for 10 minute warm ups in about 45 or 50 minutes of weight training where I'm pretty lazy between sets. 2 to 3 minute rest, training somewhere in the 6 to 10 rep range, Going to failure every once in a while, but mostly getting that sort of last rep before what I would think is failure.[0:52:53] Andrew Huberman: No forced reps, that kind of thing. And then jogging on the other days, nice and easy. When I do that, I feel Fantastic in all other dimensions of life. When I train more intensely than that even with lightweight, So faster cadence and lower rest, I feel like garbage. I get a headache.[0:53:11] Andrew Huberman: I'm kinda ornery. I everything suffers. So what are your thoughts on kind of defining a optimal exercise strategy for hormones? I've never measured my hormones in those 2 different contexts, but I have to imagine that cortisol related.[0:53:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: When they study the effect of exercise, specifically vigorous exercise, one area that's been studied is, vigorous exercise episodes lasting longer than an hour, and they usually track it by a rating of perceived exertion, which isn't perfect. And it's not Extremely actionable, but it's helpful for clinical science. But the takeaway from that is basically do not it is not Hormonally helpful to train, especially regularly train, vigorously for longer than an hour.[0:53:57] Andrew Huberman: Great. So, I'm happy to hear that because it sounds like for most people that hours of work is really the threshold. I think this is important for people to hear, especially, males, because I think with all of the incredible examples out there of people like Cam, like David Goggins, people who are training for very long periods of time, You know? And leaving aside, all issues of what people are doing in order to optimize the recovery, I think an hour a day of exercise is just a great program[0:54:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[0:54:27] Andrew Huberman: That most anyone can follow. And beyond an hour, you start running into challenges. And I you know, the occasional 90 minute or 2 hour workout is no big deal. But if you start doing that more than once every 2 months, I think you're headed for trouble. Have you seen that in people's blood blood work and in their hormones?[0:54:46] Andrew Huberman: Do you ever see people that are just badly overtrained because they're just training too hard and too often?[0:54:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. When the blood work is particularly bad, they're often in a large caloric deficit as well. There's a synergistic effect between a caloric deficit. Even if you're maintaining adequate protein intake, you might not be maintaining adequate iron intake Core, adequate vitamin d, and you're also just literally in a caloric deficit, perhaps low carbs as well, very low free testosterone, And they're simultaneously doing a lot of vigorous exercise.[0:55:23] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. I often hear, and I'm starting to wonder whether or not Some of the quicker to results nutrition tactics, things like dropping all carbohydrates Or, the quicker to result exercise habits, like starting to do 6 day a week, really intense workouts, whether or not In the short run, they work because they cause the cosmetic changes that people are seeking, but that they really undermine the overall goal, which is, at least to me, to have Your hormones may be not optimized to the, you know, a 100%, but to always be aiming for a 100% and be close to at every stage of life. Consistency is key here. If you are not consistent, then, the law of diminishing returns certainly applies. So[0:56:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: 80 or 90% of the benefit over many, many months is far better than, a 100%, But, only half the[0:56:20] Andrew Huberman: time. Yeah. One thing that I found to be tremendously useful is to finish the workout while I still have energy, To not take myself to exhaustion, and then I'm able to kind of talk about the dopamine wave pool. I'm able to sort of ride that into the rest of the day feeling great. I I sort of, save or bank some of the vigor from the training to bring it into my work.[0:56:40] Andrew Huberman: But then again, I'm not an athlete. I don't I get paid to think and to speak, not to, Not to lift weights or to run.[0:56:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Another component of that is the balance between your sympathetic, which is your fight or flight nervous system, and your parasympathetic, which is your rest or digest nervous system. There is an anecdote which is likely true that many elite bodybuilders are very parasympathetic Besides while they're lifting weights.[0:57:03] Andrew Huberman: You mean they're lazy and they like to eat a lot? Yeah. The lazy bear in the gym kind of phenomenon.[0:57:08] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Absolutely. But that being said, after a very, very vigorous workout, for example, one where you're trained to failure, which bodybuilders and power lifters do all the time, You feel the, tiredness or you feel the strain from that heavy, sympathetic activity when you are lifting a heavy weight, And it can potentially affect how you feel the rest of the day. So many people who have a job where That is highly cognitive. Do not like to have an extremely vigorous workout in the morning, which is when a lot of people are able to exercise.[0:57:43] Andrew Huberman: When I exercise early in the morning, that is before 9 AM, I have more energy all day long. If I do it midmorning, I have experienced more of an afternoon crash. There's probably some circadian biology in there. I've also noticed, and I've actually seen in my blood work, that if I don't get out for a 45 minute jog at least once a week, All of my blood profiles suffer in direction that I don't want them to go. In particular, testosterone and estrogen move in directions that are not conducive to my goals.[0:58:12] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to talk about some of the approaches that people can use in order to optimize hormones. And these days, For better or for worse, I think for worse, younger guys are asking about and using Testosterone replacement therapy, so called TRT. And I just wanna frame this up by saying there is no strict cutoff for what is TRT. There are plenty of people whose, blood levels of testosterone and estrogen are in the within the normal reference range and decide to start doing these things. Of course, they can limit fertility.[0:58:42] Andrew Huberman: There are a bunch of issues even at non, quote, unquote, Steroidal, performance enhancing dosages. I'd love to frame this up by first defining our terms because one of the challenges on the Internet is people talk about DRT, then they'll talk about performance enhancing drugs. They'll talk about steroids. They're all steroids. Right?[0:58:59] Andrew Huberman: I mean, testosterone, estrogen are both steroid hormones. But What one considered replacement therapy versus what one considers performance enhancing is gonna depend. Right? So Here's my question. Why in the world why in the world would any male in his Teens or twenties or even thirties whose blood levels of testosterone and estrogen are at the appropriate levels, meaning within the normal reference range.[0:59:29] Andrew Huberman: Why would they take exogenous testosterone given all the negative effects on fertility, some of the challenges that it can present if the dosages aren't quite right, etcetera. Why would they do that? Certainly, if they are not Being paid for a particular endeavor. Like, they're not making money. If they are playing a sport, chances are they're not allowed to do that anyway.[0:59:50] Andrew Huberman: It's it's on the banned substances list. So to me, it just seems like a crazy idea, but then again, I'm of a generation that really hasn't thought about doing that Stuff until people were in their forties and fifties or even never. So is there ever a case for somebody in their twenties or thirties to take testosterone? But if their blood levels are within the 300 to 900 nanograms per deciliter reference range?[1:00:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Not many cases. The reason for any performance enhancing drug whether or not it is a steroid, synthetic bioidentical or otherwise, it it varies a lot. Some individuals do it only for cosmetic reasons, even if it can, have Deleterious effects on, like, the cosmetic appearance, for example, of your skin in a long run. But, you know, everyone has their different reason, as far as, like, when does the benefit outweigh the detriment? Not very often if you're, in your twenties and certainly, probably almost hardly never.[1:00:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's always, you know, rare cases like common syndrome and whatnot, but, almost never if you're very young.[1:01:02] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So for people in their twenties, thirties, and beyond, forties, etcetera, whose, testosterone and estrogen levels are at the appropriate ratios And in the within the normal reference range, and they feel pretty good. Right? We talked about the Adam's exam, or this sort of, like, feel pretty good as sort of code for, libido energy recovery, etcetera, are feeling, you know, at least, workable for for their lifestyle. For those people, What can they do besides get great sleep, train but not too hard or too often, etcetera, etcetera?[1:01:34] Andrew Huberman: What are some of the things in the realm of supplementation that can help Them optimize their testosterone and estrogen without suppressing their own endogenous production of testosterone and estrogen.[1:01:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Let's mention creatine is the first one. Creatine is interesting because it has multiple different effects that helps with amino acid synthesis. It also helps with oxidative stress. It can also serve as the backup fuel tank for your mitochondria, so kind of holding back up ATP. And it does slightly increase total testosterone, and it also increases the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.[1:02:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So, potentially, it's especially useful in, men in their even their teenage years and their twenties.[1:02:17] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and there is mythology out there that creatine can increase hair loss. I'm guessing because at least 1 study showing that creatine can increase DHT. Dihydrotestosterone and DHT is one of the primary hormones that can promote male pattern baldness. So the question, therefore, is does creatine supplementation Increase the rate of hair loss.[1:02:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Theoretically, it can, but, in in each individual, preventing hair loss is a very poor reason to take creatine because it's not going to take you to a supraphysiologic level. It's not going to, you know, increase your androgens to an unnormal level of binding. So I feel like, this if that was a reason to not take creatine for hair loss, then that's[1:03:13] Andrew Huberman: for. Sorry. You mean hair loss is not a reason to avoid taking creatine? Correct.[1:03:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Hair loss is not a reason to avoid taking creatine. It think of it as just Bringing you to what you are naturally inclined to have. If your conversion of testosterone to DHT is already high, Then often creatine does not affect this. It just kind of resets your balance between testosterone being aromatized to estrogen or being 5 alpha reduced DHT. So it's not gonna speed up hair loss more than, just naturally being a male does.[1:03:47] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So in some individuals, it will have no effect. In some individuals, for whatever reason, they have almost no 5 alpha reductase activity that will return them to natural or normal.[1:03:57] Andrew Huberman: I see. Well, I take 5 grams a day of creatine monohydrate. I do it for the, tissue volumizing effects So for exercise benefits, but also for the cognitive effects, I don't know if it's increasing my hair loss. I mean, I've got a little bit of, sort of, widow's peak Type hair loss, that's where it is for me. I suppose beard growth is associated with DHT too.[1:04:18] Andrew Huberman: Most is that right? My what I learned, but then again, I haven't been into this literature in a long time, is that because of chain differences in receptors that DHT causes hair growth on the face and hair loss on the Head. Is that right?[1:04:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. And the amount and the sensitivity and density of those receptors is genetically determined.[1:04:37] Andrew Huberman: And is it true that if your mother's father was bald, that you will be bald in the same pattern, and if that he wasn't, you won't?[1:04:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That is a decent correlation. Part of the proposed mechanism of this, well, there are several genes and you can actually test your genes for hair loss. You do get a decent amount of them from your mother. The unique thing you get from your mother that she may have gotten from her She got one of the copies from her father is your X chromosome, and the androgen receptor gene is[1:05:06] Andrew Huberman: on your X chromosome. So all men got their androgen receptor gene from their mother. It's on their x chromosome, not on the y chromosome. Correct. Interesting.[1:05:17] Andrew Huberman: Even though all of the sort of, quote, unquote, male Male promoting, genes are on the y chromosome, like, Mullerian inhibiting, etcetera. Oh, interesting. Okay. So 5 grams a day of creatine for most people should be Fine. Beneficial for tissue volumizing, so strength, bringing water into the muscles.[1:05:35] Andrew Huberman: And for cognate the cognitive effects and the clinical support of Recretine, I think, is is quite strong at the 5 gram per day dosage. What other sorts of supplements, can people benefit from? We already talked about the omegas making sure that people are getting enough prebiotic fiber, to support the gut microbiome Mhmm. And vitamin d. So what other Supplement based tools, can people consider?[1:05:58] Andrew Huberman: Another one we can loop[1:05:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: in with creatine is beta ene. Some people are nonresponders to creatine, so can increase that to 10 grams, or you can use its cousin beta ene to help with amino acid synthesis and shunting of energy. Along with that, I would put L Carnitine, which is, actually the smallest peptide hormone. It's just 2 amino acids that are put together. So it's a[1:06:21] Andrew Huberman: it's a hormone. Interesting. I'm not challenging it. Peptides. Yeah.[1:06:25] Andrew Huberman: I'm not challenging it.[1:06:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Call it a a peptide[1:06:27] Andrew Huberman: Uh-huh. More more[1:06:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: than a hormone. So I I would not call l carnitine a Okay. But I would call dopamine a a hormone.[1:06:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I could a a neurohormone. It's it's so hard to to define things as transmariners or hormones at some level. I agree. So L Carnitine, actually, I should backtrack.[1:06:43] Andrew Huberman: Betaine, do you recall, what dosage people typically would take if they're Creatine nonresponder? 1 to 3 grams.[1:06:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: In fact, yeah, several versions of creatine have beta ene mixed in Because it helps with the processing of Methionine and homocysteine.[1:07:00] Andrew Huberman: So if somebody is already taking creatine and likes it in response to it, I'll raise my hand, such as myself. Would adding Betaine help, or is it redundant with creatine?[1:07:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Only if homocysteine is persistently elevated, and homocysteine is kinda like an inflammatory marker that can build up if you're not converting enough of it downstream.[1:07:19] Andrew Huberman: How would I know?[1:07:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Just a blood test.[1:07:22] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:07:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism, which is basically how you add methyl groups to many things in the body.[1:07:32] Andrew Huberman: Great. Any side effects of Betaine that people should be aware of?[1:07:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Not that I know of.[1:07:37] Andrew Huberman: Okay. People can look it up, and unexamine .com is a great site for that. They'll surely list it. They just revamped their site, by the way, and it was awesome before, and it's Platinum now. So L Carnitine, what are the ways to take L Carnitine?[1:07:51] Andrew Huberman: I know that there's an oral forms of capsules in there is injectables. Injectables, I think you need a prescription. Is that right? Correct.[1:07:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You need a prescription for the injectables, or you should really get a prescription for the injectables. For when you inject it, of course, at the supervision of your doctor, it's usually done intramuscularly. It's an aqueous solution, So it does not have, like, an oil or a carrier oil in it like t r like testosterone esters do. However, if you inject it Too superficially, it's not gonna make or break anything. Often, it just burns if you inject it subcutaneously, and it does not, Disseminate throughout the body as well.[1:08:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: L Carnitine potentially has localized effects if you inject it. If you ingest it orally, then it has a very low bioavailability, maybe only 10%.[1:08:40] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think most people are going to be able to get L carnitine only or, you know, in its Capsule form. So what are the dosages of L carnitine that one needs to ingest then if they wanna get a benefit? Because I thought only 10% is being absorbed. It's probably a lot of L Carnitine. How much should people take per day?[1:08:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Usually, I recommend, for oral L Carnitine between 1,000 milligrams and up to 4 or 5000 milligrams.[1:09:05] Andrew Huberman: So one to 4, Maybe even 5 grams. Correct. Okay.[1:09:09] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Up to 5 grams a day. If you're on that much, especially if you have a dysregulated gut microbiome, You should be concerned with TMAO, which is a potential carcinogen that both carnitine and choline can convert into, and your gut microbiota determine How much that happens?[1:09:27] Andrew Huberman: Is it true that I can offset any negative effects of alpha GPC, choline, that is n l carnitine, that I take by ingesting garlic. Is that right?[1:09:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's a compound in garlic called Allicin. I believe it's a l l ICIN, it's also part of the scientific name, the genus of types of garlic, and this can help decrease the conversion to TMAO. Berberine actually slightly decreases the conversion to TMAO as well, probably through alteration of the gut microbiome and then just, optimizing your gut microbiome can decrease conversion. Not everyone needs Allicin, but it's something that you should certainly consider if you were on a high dose.[1:10:06] Andrew Huberman: I'm going to continue to take the 600 milligrams of garlic every time I take my l Carnitine, but I'm gonna skip the berberine because berberine gives me brutal headaches, and it makes me crave carbohydrates because it drops my blood sugar.[1:10:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It has many other effects, including the dawn phenomenon where it drops your blood sugar when you're sleeping, then you can't even realize it.[1:10:24] Andrew Huberman: I am not a fan of berberine, and I'm sorry for those of you that are. I'm not trying to offend anyone. Although, frankly, if you're being offended by by stance on Berberine, then maybe we should have another discussion. In any case, Injectable L Carnitine, if one can get that through a doctor, how much is absorbed and how much should one take?[1:10:43] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Almost all of it's absorbed. In general, you're taking between[1:10:56] Andrew Huberman: So why should why should someone go through all of this? Is it to optimize testosterone? Is it, working on the receptor side? What what's L Carnitine doing?[1:11:05] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's a shuttle. So I think it's named carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme a. Basically, it's it just takes nutrients from outside your mitochondria and puts them in. It also has a unique effect. Well, not too unique because tadalafil actually has this effect as well is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor in the Cytoplasm of your cells.[1:11:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So even if your androgen receptor sensitivity doesn't change and even if your does testosterone does not change, You will have more testosterone binding to that increased number of receptors. Does one need to cycle L Carnitine, Creatine, Betaine? No reason to cycle any of those.[1:11:45] Andrew Huberman: Okay. What other supplements can one use to try and improve hormone profiles? And And here, I realized we're using a very broad brush because when we say improve hormone profiles, what are we really talking about? And for me, at least, I I think about the subjective stuff. You know?[1:12:02] Andrew Huberman: Do people feel like they are going to have more energy as a consequence of doing these things? Are they gonna have The, more optimized libido, are they gonna have more optimized, recovery from exercise? Right? Because, I mean, it it's not clear to me that taking one's testosterone from 600 to 800 is always going to be a good thing, especially if estrogen is increasing in parallel, that could cause issues. It could certainly make things better.[1:12:23] Andrew Huberman: It could certainly make things worse. Right?[1:12:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Mhmm.[1:12:26] Andrew Huberman: So with that backdrop, what are some of the other things people can take? And then we'll go back to this issue of what really is optimization. Let's briefly mention vitamin d, which is also[1:12:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: a hormone. It's actually a sterile hormone. And have if you have deficient vitamin d and you replace it, Then you will optimize your testosterone. Let's also mention boron. So if you have a very high SHBG, boron can help lower it usually in a dose of 5 to 12 milligrams per day.[1:12:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's not really a sustained effect, but, boron is depleted in soils. In many countries, I believe it's very high in soils in Greece and Turkey, so eating dates or raisins that are from those areas potentially have more boron. Boron also meet might be one of the reasons why the reference range for testosterone is much higher in those countries than other countries.[1:13:16] Andrew Huberman: And just to remind people, the SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin, is attaching to the testosterone molecule and limiting the amount of so Free testosterone that's available to have its impact on cells. Doctor Peter Attia was on this podcast, in fact, sitting in that very chair, he said that the ideal Level of free testosterone in male should be about 2% of one's total testosterone too. Would you agree with that number or disagree? I'm sure Peter would be fine if you Is that either?[1:13:43] Dr. Kyle Gillett: 2% is a good rule of thumb. Usually, the reference range is between about 1 4%. Some people do have genetic polymorphisms in SHBG, a specific gene mutation where they have very low SHBGs. Also, men that have varicose veins in their testes, also known as varicoceles, tend to have very high SHPGs, So that percentage would likely be less than 2%. So just because your, percentage of free tea to total tea is a little bit above or below 2%.[1:14:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's okay. We just need to figure out the reason why it is.[1:14:19] Andrew Huberman: How would somebody know if they have varicose veins in their testicles, especially if their testicles are still in attached to their body.[1:14:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Mhmm. Sometimes it's hard to tell. There is several grades. If you have a grade 3 or grade 4 test, varicocele. It has what's called a bag of worms appearance.[1:14:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So think about if you've just resistance trained or it's a really hot day Or you're wearing very tight fitting clothing, then if you feel it and almost feels like there's worms in the scrotum. The other way is to do a scary visual. Yeah. Bag of worms.[1:14:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, it was just that yeah. Anyway, I think parasites when I hear that, but that's not what you're you're talking about just the the, the the texture.[1:15:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The best way for most people to check is to Valsalva for a long period of time when you Valsalva, venous return, will decrease.[1:15:11] Andrew Huberman: Can you explain Valsalva for people?[1:15:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's bearing down like you're lifting a weight or, having a bowel movement Where you, swallow and a a lot of times, you can almost see, buildup of, blood in your, like, jugular veins as well. So you have, increased blood return to the heart and increased, blood in the veins themselves.[1:15:34] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition Form that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, Is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based Interventions you might wanna take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.[1:16:29] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/ Huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Okay. So vitamin d three. I'm guessing you're talking about vitamin d three specifically when you say vitamin d, and then boron, 5 to 12 milligrams per day.[1:16:48] Andrew Huberman: Right. And then what are some of the other things to optimize, testosterone that are in supplement form?[1:16:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: We could talk about things that affect the steroidogenesis cascade, so we could touch on Ton Cad Ali. I know we've talked about that a little bit before.[1:17:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But I'm guessing a number of people probably haven't heard that conversation.[1:17:05] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Also known as long Jack, and that upregulates several different enzymes in this steroidogenesis cascade. And by that, what you mean if and this is another good thing to Google. I think anybody interested in hormone optimization should understand where where sterile hormones come from. They come Usually from cholesterol, and they can be shunted off to vitamin d very easily. They can be shunted off to testosterone or estrogens or progestogens quite easily as well.[1:17:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But Tongkat helps with the conversion of multiple key steps where you synthesize testosterone. Another, think of it as like a coenzyme or a cofactor, an upregulator of these steps is insulin and IGF one. So a good rule of thumb is if you are not expecting as much growth hormone, insulin, and IGF one, for example, lower carb diets, Caloric deficits. You're trying to cut body fat or body weight, then Tongkat is going to be theoretically especially powerful. What sorts of dosages of Tonga do you recommend to your patients?[1:18:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Anywhere from 300 to 1200 milligrams a day. With tongkat, you need to be careful with the standardization because and if you're thinking about a general tongkat supplement, which is by far the most well studied, Then, you're looking at the Eurycominone content, which is a plant compound that is likely the main, active Pharmacologic effect, so that's the compound that's having the effect on the body. And if you standardize the Eurycominone very, very high, Then, theoretically, you're having more effect at a lower dose.[1:18:49] Andrew Huberman: I take 400 milligrams of Tonga Ali, per day. I take it early in the day because it has a bit of a stimulant effect, and if I take it after 2 PM, it starts to inhibit my sleep. I've been taking it for years, and, I rather like the the effects. It seems subtle, but, you know, consistent. I've never cycled it.[1:19:09] Andrew Huberman: Do you recommend cycling it?[1:19:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I don't see any reason to cycle it. There is, there is a reason to cycle some supplements, but no reason to cycle Tonka.[1:19:19] Andrew Huberman: My blood work tells me that it causes an increase in free testosterone for me and also a slight increase in luteinizing hormone for me. What are some of the other effects on various hormones that you've observed in the blood work of your patients taking Tongkat Ali?[1:19:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA. And if you have a very high SHBG, again, that's the protein that binds up your androgens and is an extremely important protein. The higher your SHBG, the more it helps decrease it. So they've studied Tongkat in, Populations with very normal SHBGs, and[1:19:56] Andrew Huberman: it does nothing for SHBG. Interesting. Does that mean it does nothing for somebody overall? So if somebody has SHBG that's in the normal range, will taking Tongkat benefit them in any other way?[1:20:08] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. It it'll increase their total and free testosterone.[1:20:12] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Okay. Does it is it known to have effects on anything else like thyroid hormone, growth hormone, or is it purely in these steroid synthesis pathways? Or steroid, I should say, synthesis and receptor and modulation pathways.[1:20:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's no direct effect on those pathways. However, anytime you alter your Free androgen or free estrogen, particularly one without altering the other. It will alter the binding protein that binds thyroid hormones. So any change you make, whether it's natural optimization or hormone replacement, you're going to slightly skew your thyroid hormone profile. While one common, like, actionable example of this that I see often clinically is, someone starts, let's say estrogen replacement or testosterone replacement.[1:20:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Maybe they're taking AI with their testosterone replacement. Aromatase inhibitor. Correct. An aromatase inhibitor which blocks the conversion to estrogen. If they're taking testosterone and they have very little estrogen, Then you're going to decrease the binding protein, also known as thyroxine binding globulin, which binds active thyroid hormones.[1:21:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you start TRT and you either have low aromatase activity or no aromatase activity, no conversion to estrogen, Then your free thyroid hormones will go up even just acutely. Usually, feedback inhibition, which is how the body talks to itself and says, you know, we need to make more of this or less of this. But acutely, there's, not always enough time. You're going to have very high Thyroid hormones, and you can have tachycardia, which is a fast heart rate, or you can feel kind of, like, overly fight or flight due to increased thyroid hormone activity in the in tissue.[1:21:59] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Okay. So, Tongali, this there's a broad range, 300 to 1200 milligrams Per day, and I realized that the source matters there. What are some of the other hormones that you, prescribe to your patients, who do not wanna go on testosterone replacement therapy or take exogenous DHEA or anything like that.[1:22:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: We could talk about Fidosia next. Fidosia is interesting because it's a genus of plants. Fidosia agrestis is one of them. There's many others that are very interesting. That species is likely the most well studied, and it will increase l h.[1:22:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So, I would not consider it an l h mimetic, so it doesn't really mimic it, But it increases the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary. That's a hormone that binds to the leydic cell to the LH receptor, kind of like HCG does, and it will increase the release of testosterone.[1:22:53] Andrew Huberman: I see. So I think for people that aren't familiar with HCG, so human chorionic gonadotropin is basically synthetic Luteinizing hormone, and luteinizing hormone is the hormone released from the pituitary that is going to travel down to the testes to stimulate the production of Sperm and testosterone, but mainly testosterone. Is that correct?[1:23:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Mostly correct. Technically, synthetic l h is also known as little r l h Or recombinant LH and HCG can be synthetic, but often, it is just refined from the urine of pregnant ladies since the, Since the placenta makes it, that's why it's called chorionic, gonadotropin. So where are[1:23:31] Andrew Huberman: they getting all this pregnant, women's Urine. I mean, is I mean, is there a a location? I mean, not that I wanna go there. I'm just really. So there were 1st[1:23:41] Dr. Kyle Gillett: trimester pregnant ladies. It's Very high.[1:23:43] Andrew Huberman: Donating their urine, and then they're purifying it, and then men are injecting it.[1:23:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. Wow. And that's actually the same for menopausal ladies. So 1st trimester pregnant ladies, that's how you can make, you know, nonsynthetic HCG. And then for minotropins, which are also known there's a couple of different names for it, like Menopur.[1:24:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You have menopausal ladies that have very high LH FSH, and then you refine the FSH and l h.[1:24:13] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So moving away from the sources and from urine, Fidogia Agrestis, what dosages, do you have patients take? I've heard of, some potential toxicity to the testicular cells.[1:24:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There is 1 study, and this is a rat study, but you can equate the dose of toxicity in rats and humans. They did not give these rats any antioxidants,[1:24:37] Andrew Huberman: But it[1:24:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: increases a couple different, like, pro inflammatory markers. 1 is GGT or gamma Glutamyltransferase, Comes from both the testes and the liver, and one is alkaline phosphatase, also known as alkyphos, again, coming from both areas. There are several different ways that you can attenuate this increase, and you can also just check to see if you have increased in the rat dose that equates with humans that had no effect, so the safe dose was an average of 300 milligrams a day.[1:25:06] Andrew Huberman: So that would be 300 milligrams a day in humans is the Dosage that did not have toxicity. Correct. Correct. And often, even if there is toxicity[1:25:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: in rats, There is not toxicity in humans, so it's not directly equitable. But to be safe, another regimen that I have people take is six 100 milligrams every other day or 600 milligrams 3 times a week, often Monday, Wednesday, Friday.[1:25:32] Andrew Huberman: This is very interesting and and relevant because I I've been taking Fidogia for some period of time. All my markers and and tests indicate that there's no toxicity, but, I've been taking 600 milligrams per day, but I've been cycling it for about, 8 to 12 weeks on and then a few weeks off. But based on what you're saying, I'm thinking maybe 3 times per week or or every other day might be better. Is that right?[1:25:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If you weren't gonna get any labs, That is certainly with the regimen that you want. If you're gonna check your GGT and ALK FOS or even take other things to prevent those from increasing, Then you can certainly, be more aggressive with your Fidosia dosing. You can increase it quite a bit, and it has a dose dependent response In both the activities associated with high testosterone and also just LH and testosterone. So the and a more aggressive regimen would be 600 milligrams daily For a month, and then take 1 to 2 weeks off. Great.[1:26:29] Andrew Huberman: I think that's more or less what I've been doing. Okay. Terrific. In terms of other hormones, what are some of the supplements that can support growth hormone? Right?[1:26:38] Andrew Huberman: A hormone that's associated with tissue repair and, in some cases, metabolism and fat loss. What are some of the tools, nutritional and or supplement based one can do to, tap on the, growth hormone pathway? And And let's lump IGF 1 in there too since they're essentially working along the same dimensions.[1:26:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A quick synopsis. Growth hormone is a peptide hormone, And it is released by the pituitary. There's growth hormone releasing hormone and ghrelin that stimulate the release. So there's also peptides that are very analogous to these 2 things. You have that pulsatile secretion of growth hormone in a very fast half life of just minutes, And then it increases IGF one.[1:27:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There is both peripheral IGF one and central IGF one and IGF two, but no need to get into the specifics. There is a happy medium to where your growth hormone is at a adequate level and your IGF one is an adequate level. Usually, those 2 are congruent. So in most cases, we just check an IGF one and, occasionally, the binding peptides for IGF one, Kind of like SHBG that we talked about earlier, but, you're estimating a free IGF one. It's it's kinda confusing because all Hormone almost all hormones have, binding proteins to help regulate them, but often you wanna look at free testosterone, free estradiol, Free IGF one or at least estimate it.[1:28:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Free cortisol even and free thyroid hormone. But, when you're talking about, growth hormone and IGF one, usually, you don't need to do anything to optimize it. If you are, diabetic, Then depending on the type of diabetes, your IGF one and growth hormone can be too high. Specifically in type one diabetes, your growth hormone is Extremely high, but your IGF one is low. So if you're in a dysregulated state or have pathology, I would just talk to your doctor about IGF one or growth hormone.[1:28:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Taking thing taking amino acids before you go to bed could potentially help with growth hormone release just because, most growth hormone is released while you sleep.[1:28:47] Andrew Huberman: I've heard that fasting can increase growth hormone, and I know there are certain Patterns of weight training that can increase growth hormone. Some of those regimens in the weight room that increase growth hormone Have been covered by, doctor Duncan French who is a, on a guest on this podcast. And, so maybe we'll refer people to, that episode for the specific protocols is high volume training.[1:29:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: During those training exercises, it usually does it Transiently for a period of a few hours, and it, a lot of this IGF one is released by the muscle itself, So it's not necessarily released by the liver. IGF one that is released directly due to growth hormone signaling. Usually, the growth hormone comes from the pituitary and binds To the liver, where it usually has a half life of about a week, where the paracrine or autocrine think of it as, like, the peripherally acting or Deen in the muscles itself, which is also helpful, is released and is not as concerning because it's not related to insulin resistance, but it is related to the training itself.[1:29:53] Andrew Huberman: So fasting and growth hormone, Is it true that fasting can increase growth hormone? And maybe as a little, related tangent, I've heard that especially carbohydrate laden meals can, blunt that peak that occurs during sleep quite substantially. So 2 questions. Does avoiding Food intake in the 2 hours prior to sleep help increase growth hormone release. Maybe it's being overly neurotic.[1:30:29] Andrew Huberman: Maybe people need to avoid food in the 4 hours before sleep. But regardless, what is the relationship between fasting and growth hormone release? I find this really interesting.[1:30:38] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Fasting certainly potently increases growth hormone release. However, the end binding to the receptor is less sensitive. So although fasting does increase growth hormone, The genes that are downstream to it, both the growth hormone genes and IGF one related, gene transcription activity will not be significantly higher. However, if you are optimizing the growth hormone that is, released as pulsatile secretion, it is helpful to avoid eating for 2 hours. So the general rule of thumb is eating about 2 hours before bed, I think that's clinically significant and helpful, but fasting otherwise specifically for growth hormone optimization And someone who already has normal growth hormone signaling is not helpful.[1:31:29] Andrew Huberman: That's extremely, useful to hear You see, one of the major reasons why people fast is to get that growth hormone increase. But if they're, adjusting things on the back end that negate that, well, then, No such luck. Not that I have anything against fasting. I do a pseudo intermittent fasting mostly because I prefer to eat it fairly regular times of day. Okay.[1:31:51] Andrew Huberman: So it does sound like there's a lot that people can take in supplement form to improve growth hormone. What about thyroid hormone? What are some of the things that people can take or do in order to Make sure that their thyroid hormone levels are, appropriate.[1:32:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You wanna have a balance of iodine, and you wanna have a good source of iodine. So there's some camps that say you should use a huge high dose of iodine, and there's protocols for it. And there's some that Say you should use just barely enough iodine. I believe it's, like, 200 micrograms per day, but you wanna balance. One of the things that I see that many people do not talk about when it comes to iodine and thyroid is there's Compounds known as goitrogens or goitrogens.[1:32:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And these goitrogens are neither good nor evil, but they're actually kind of a nice check and balance. You need more iodine if you consume more goitrogens. And some examples of these are some of my favorite fruit foods, cruciferous vegetables. Boron is also a goitrogen. So higher goitrogens, higher iodine.[1:32:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So Adjusting iodine containing salt is useful. Yes or no? Iodized salt does prevent goiter, But it is not necessarily the ideal form of iodine. Good forms of iodine often come from the ocean. If you look at a chart of hypothyroidism, There is a tendency to have more hypothyroidism the more inland you go.[1:33:17] Andrew Huberman: So trying to eat some cruciferous vegetables Each day would be the best way to improve thyroid harm. Along with plenty of iodine.[1:33:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You don't want too much iodine signaling. Many people are familiar with radioactive iodine tablets, and that's basically an extremely high amount of iodine to block out The, like, the radioactive iodine that comes from after, you know, like a nuclear meltdown or whatnot.[1:33:42] Andrew Huberman: So we've got creatine, Betaine, L carnitine with Allicin, garlic, to offset the TMAO, vitamin d 3, boron, Tonga Ale, Fadogia, Some fasting. Love to talk to you about peptides. So I can imagine a hierarchy. The hierarchy starts with Behaviors new and nutrition. Behaviors, of course, includes training and limiting stress and all the things we talked about before, sunshine, etcetera, and Optimize nutrition.[1:34:12] Andrew Huberman: Then we talked about supplements, all the things we just listed off to optimize testosterone, and We can get into this, but estrogen as well, which is important for libido and brain function and tissue function and joints feeling good, etcetera. But then we get into the realm where one Might or could consider exogenous hormones. Get taking a small dose of testosterone or taking a small dose of of GH even if, you know, If that were appropriate and certainly only working with a doctor. But in between, there's a step of so called peptides. And, of course, there are many peptides.[1:34:44] Andrew Huberman: We've already talked about some of them. When people talk about taking peptides, the ones that I hear most often about is a a category that increases GH and IGF one, And those, to my knowledge go by the things like sirmorelin, ipramorelin, tesamorelin, sort of a a kit of things that, taken separately or or in combination to increase GH and IGF one. But then other people, for instance, are taking peptides, like BPC 157 to try and, improve tissue healing and recovery. There's a lot of interest in peptides. Please, if you would, tell us about what you know about the safety of peptides in terms of their sourcing and the utility of peptides.[1:35:27] Andrew Huberman: You know? Is this something that people should consider, before thinking about hormone replacement, should people be wary of these things? I am very wary of particular sources that are sold online that are Not clean. They contain contaminants, and it could be dangerous. I really would love your thoughts on peptides.[1:35:42] Andrew Huberman: So I'm just gonna sit back and let you riff on peptides. But if you could Touch on some of the ones that I mentioned, I'd be most grateful.[1:35:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A peptide is just a chain of amino acids between 2 and a couple 100 in length. So I think of peptides as several different categories. And the GHRPs that you mentioned, I would consider those, and that stands for growth hormone releasing peptide. You have 2 main types, the ghrelin agonist that or They hit the ghrelin receptor and though and it helps release growth hormone because of that. And then also the, GHRH like peptides.[1:36:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So they're very similar to growth hormone releasing hormone. Often, they just change a couple amino acids, and it acts like that. Tessa Moreland is one of them. Sir Moreland is another one, and CJC is another common one. I believe those are all in the class of GHRH like peptides, whereas Ibomirelin or Ibupro Morin, which is also known as MK 677, Those 2 are in the class of ghrelin agonists, so they're more like they hit the receptor that ghrelin does, whereas the other ones hit the GHrh receptor.[1:36:54] Andrew Huberman: I think of ghrelin as making me hungry. Hungry and angry. Why would I wanna take something that would increase ghrelin or signaling?[1:37:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Some people are trying to gain weight. It also does increase your growth hormone. So if your growth hormone is very low, you can consider it. Ibutamorin is a long acting, so as a long half life, also known as MK677. It was well it was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency.[1:37:19] Andrew Huberman: And do these people get angry also?[1:37:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They can. Many people report a side effect of anxiety or significant hunger. Most people take it in the evening, so they don't notice that hunger as much. It can also greatly increase your blood glucose. If you're insulin resistant or prediabetic, it's especially concerning.[1:37:41] Andrew Huberman: This is one of those rare moments where I hear something, and I they and I think, Okay. Even though there is this, kit of compounds that can increase GH and IGF one, based on everything you're telling me, Maybe just taking GH is the better option for those people because growth hormone, at least it's synthetic growth hormone is mimicking an endogenous hormone. Mean, certainly not taking anything might be the ideal, but for those that wanna increase growth hormone and they wanna use pharmacology to do that, something these peptides are pretty Precarious.[1:38:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. It kinda depends on the situation. If there's a an individual that, struggles with hunger and not eating enough, For example, you know, someone who has a very small stomach or they just have a very low hunger drive, Sometimes you want more of that orexigenic signaling. The hypothalamus, you have anorexigenic signaling, which is kinda like anorexia and orexigenic signaling, which is I call it the hangry center of the, hypothalamus or the the hangry center. And if there's an imbalance between those 2, Then, perhaps it'd be helpful, potentially theoretically helpful in anorexics of which, the incidence of anorexia at men is increasing significantly.[1:38:56] Andrew Huberman: As you're telling me this, I'm remembering being 14 or 15 years old, and I would go into the kitchen sometimes, and I was so hungry. I would just obliterate all the food. And I do remember being I've always been pretty high energy guy, but having an immense amount of energy. I don't I can't recall if it was a hangry feeling or not, but I'm guessing that was growth hormone. I grew 1 foot in a single academic year.[1:39:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So[1:39:16] Andrew Huberman: I imagine that was at least in part due to growth hormone. In any case, sirmarellin is It's the peptide that I hear most often about. I admittedly tried a a run of it. I was researching a book, and decide to take it before sleep on an empty stomach, it gave me a tremendous, depth of sleep. But that sleep was really truncated, which is just nerd speak for saying deep but short sleep.[1:39:42] Andrew Huberman: I would wake up after very intense dreams. I can't say that it Helped me recover from exercise that much. I didn't notice any additional fat loss or anything. Sort of abandoned it except for occasional use. Again, this was prescribed by a doctor.[1:39:55] Andrew Huberman: You know, I was trying to get the sense that these these peptides and their effects are are somewhat vague and distributed and highly individual. Is that a fair way to to describe them?[1:40:05] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Part of the problem with the effect of peptides is many people take them in levels that are far above the physiologic range. Even individuals who are checking their IGF one while they take, these different GHRPs, Most of them do not check the binding peptides. For example, IGF binding peptide 1, 2, or 3, and, their free IGF one level might be significantly different. So the, common doses that people will take these off label 4 as a supplement are often much greater than the therapeutic or physiologic range.[1:40:45] Andrew Huberman: Which for me just underscores the fact that pretty precarious. I mean, I'm not coming in here as the referee of what anyone should or shouldn't do. Just trying to gather and distribute information. But It I've heard, for instance, that some of companies where people can acquire these things without prescription, they those companies are not good at cleaning out The, l the lipopolysaccharide, the LPS, which can cause an inflammatory response. In other words, these are dirty compounds, and that just sounds risky.[1:41:12] Andrew Huberman: It just sounds frankly, it just sounds really dangerous to me.[1:41:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: LPS is a common additive in many companies that are not pharmacies, but they're selling things that people often use as human consumption. One interesting note about lipopolysaccharide is your, gut microbiome actually makes a lot of of it as well, especially prevotella, which is a specific species that can have to do with your baseline body temperature. So your baseline body temperature might also change depending on if you're on a peptide that has LPS in it.[1:41:46] Andrew Huberman: Yikes. Yikes. And yikes. But I tend to be pretty conservative, when it comes to taking anything exogenous. But I do rely on, many of the supplements that we talked about earlier, and I do try and optimize behavioral things and nutritional things have for a long time.[1:42:01] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So then, leaving peptides behind, we are now, I suppose, in the territory of exogenous hormone. So let's say that somebody decides they're not concerned with fertility or They're gonna bank sperm, or they already have kids, or they're going to defer on this issue of 1 and a half kids. My understanding is that nowadays, a lot of people are using Testosterone, let's not even call it replacement therapy because some of these people have 600, 700, or even, you know, 800 nanogram per deciliter read. So they're Not replacing anything that is diminished.[1:42:34] Andrew Huberman: They're just trying to augment what's already there, increase what's already there. My understanding is that Taking a low dose more frequently is gonna be more beneficial than the kind of old school way of giving, you know, a 100 or even 200 milligrams in a single injection once every 2 weeks. Is that right? And and what do you do with your patients? So let me give you a hypothetical.[1:42:53] Andrew Huberman: Somebody comes into your office. They, do their blood work, and they have, blood levels of, let's say, 600 nanograms per deciliter. Testosterone, their estrogen is also in normal range. Everything else checks out, but they're complaining of, you know, slightly diminished libido, slightly poor recovery from workouts, maybe, you know, reduce motivation and drive, although no major depression. And you come to the conclusion that testosterone therapy, Not replacement, but testosterone therapy might be a good option to explore.[1:43:24] Andrew Huberman: What's a typical dosage range and frequency of administration range that you might consider exploring.[1:43:32] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And some of this depends on the SHBG and free testosterone as well. So if that same individual had a very high SHBG, BG, which again is the binding protein that binds up the testosterone and all androgens and estrogens. If it is extremely high and they have a free testosterone of 2, Then they might need a different dose because they need enough testosterone in order to, have a normal Huguenadal Free testosterone. But a general normal dosing range, especially for someone starting, is around 100 to 120 milligrams Divided over the course of a week, usually either every other day or 3 times a week, occasionally, twice a week. Many people with SHBG a bit higher can get away pretty easily with twice a week.[1:44:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: This is assuming that the ester is scipionate or a. Date.[1:44:20] Andrew Huberman: So 2 60 milligram injections of testosterone, saponate per week? Yeah. Very common dosing. To hit that 120 milligrams per week as kind of the typical average. Correct?[1:44:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And I would consider this, a like a physiologic Huguen adult dose. For many people, even 200 milligrams a week is far above the reference range. All of this is said with the caveat that testosterone is normally released in a pulsatile manner. So it's high in the morning, low in the evening. Whereas if you're on, testosterone therapy, then, you're going to have a steady state, so your testosterone level is gonna be Pretty much the same even in the evening.[1:44:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And[1:45:00] Andrew Huberman: in your experience, when patients do that, they I'm guessing they report the normal constellation of positive effects, know improved mood, improved energy, improved sleep, recovery, etcetera. What are some of the hazards or things that, can crop up in blood work or just subjectively That, can be warning signs that even a dosage of a 120 milligrams divided into these 2 or 3 dosages per week is too high.[1:45:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Every organ system in the body. So this is when you really have to be, at least well versed in every organ system, not just the gonadal, like, you know, Genital system. You need to have, you know, dermatology prowess. Acne is a very common change. Lots of different, skin pathologies or even bruising can be related to hormone replacement.[1:45:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Hair loss is very common to see as well. Mental status changes. It could occasionally, it even induces a manic or a bipolar episode because testosterone is also dopaminergic. And then cardiovascularly, not just in the heart, but also concerns for, like, microvascular ischemic disease, ferritin buildup because the estrogen also increases, And then, fertility concerns as well and lipid concerns too. So you really have to be, you know, hematologist, dermatologist, Cardiologist, lipidologist, the whole 9 yards.[1:46:23] Andrew Huberman: So another reason or set of reasons rather to If one is considering using testosterone therapy to really do this in close communication with a really good physician, That's a lot to monitor. Knowing whether or not you have acne or not is one thing, but knowing whether or not your LDL is going up, your APOB is going up, that's a whole other biz, and that needs to be done through blood work is What I'm hearing.[1:46:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. And if your physician that is managing or prescribing your, testosterone therapy or your HRT is not well versed in these systems, you would want him or her to be part of an interdisciplinary team where they have other experts that can monitor those systems.[1:47:03] Andrew Huberman: I skipped over a sort of still intermediate set of things, prescription drugs, but maybe Talking about testosterone first was a bit of a mistake on my part because I'm aware that there actually, I think there are companies, but certainly groups out there Let's say, no. Wait. Don't go straight from nothing to supplements to testosterone. Once you're doing, behaviors and optimizing nutrition supplements, let's forget peptides. Instead of going straight to testosterone therapy, one idea that many people are pursuing is to, take the prescription drugs that trigger luteinizing hormones, so take taking HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, which my understanding is will increase testosterone, but also estrogen, or they'll take things like clomiphene.[1:47:47] Andrew Huberman: In fact, I think there are a bunch of companies out there now that are, I'm saying don't take testosterone. It shuts down spermatogenesis, shuts down, testosterone production. Clomiphene is the way to go. Maybe you could educate us about the HCG monotherapy, I think it's called, where you're just mono one, just taking HCG, and Clomiphene as a, and or clomiphene as a tool to, ratchet up hormones.[1:48:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So quick points on HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, made during, especially the 1st trimester of pregnancy, it has effects other than binding to the LH receptor. It also binds to the TSH receptor in the thyroid. It's thyroid stimulating hormone. Yes. In fact, if you look at a molecule of HCG and Thyroid stimulation hormone, they are extremely similar.[1:48:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: However, you need a relatively high dose of hCG To bind to the TSH receptor. This is the normal mechanism in pregnancy that accounts for the increased need of thyroid hormone, usually about 30 to 40%. So that's why if someone has hypothyroidism, we need to increase their dose of thyroid because the HCG is not gonna be doing it for you. The Clomid or clomiphene, there's 2 main, I believe it's distero isomers, And one of them is Nclomiphene. One of them is zuclomiphene.[1:49:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And these 2 work slightly differently. Nclomiphene, I believe, has a faster Half life, and it is, potentially slightly better tolerated. However, they were studying it. Know, Clomid is a very commonly prescribed drug, and, obviously, there's plenty of in Clomiphene in, Clomid. However, The drug, which was androzole, a n d r o x a l, did not go all the way through the FDA approval process despite Clomid being FDA approved.[1:49:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So there's Clomid, which contains Clomiphene, but they're also because we're talking about men hormone male hormone optimization this episode. There are males out there who want to increase their testosterone and other hormones, maybe growth hormone, etcetera, who opt to not take exogenous testosterone. So no cream, no pellet, no no, pill, no injectable cipionate, but Decide to take Clomiphene a couple times a week. My understanding I've never done this, I would say if I had.[1:50:05] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that Taking Clomiphene maybe 2 50 milligram tablets a week is what I hear people are doing, will increase what? Luteinizing hormone, The various estrogen receptor subunits, could you explain how Clomiphene would benefit anyone? And is this a good strategy? I'm I'm hearing that it's being done quite a lot now.[1:50:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It will increase testosterone in a dose dependent manner, but it has many other pharmacodynamic effects, which is the effect of the drug on the body Other than its effect on the hypothalamus and the pituitary. So in the hypothalamus and the pituitary, it, does what's called negative Feedback inhibition, or it it blocks the action of estrogen. So it crowds out estrogen from the estrogen receptor On the hypothalamus and the pituitary.[1:50:54] Andrew Huberman: And what's the subjective effect that that would cause? So my understanding and experience of estrogen is that, if I ever took and I did take a very low dose of an aeroentase inhibitor once, and I felt terrible. Actually, reduced libido, joints felt achy. That's when I discovered that, wow, estrogen is actually really important for your brain function, for joint function, and for libido. And suppressing estrogen for me, it turned just turned out to be the The wrong idea.[1:51:19] Andrew Huberman: But my levels indicate that it's within reference range. Okay. So why would I want to take something that would Increase the activity of an estrogen receptor. I just can't find the rationale for that.[1:51:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The main rationale behind taking a serum is as a very temporary measure that is not going to suppress pituitary or hypothalamic function. If your testosterone is just so drastically low that it is unlikely to recover anyway anyway. So most of the time, it is not clinically useful, and, serum should not be prescribed very often, certainly not as long term Testosterone replacement, or testosterone optimization in most individuals. There's always exceptions to everything, but, there's 5 different Estrogen and estrogen related receptors. There's 2 main estrogen receptors in Clomid, and every serum has a very unique Profile because they selectively inhibit some receptors in some tissues, but not other receptors in other tissues.[1:52:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: For example, Clomid can inhibit receptors that are in the eye, and it can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially at higher doses, and it also acts in every other tissue of the body. So side effects from Chlomid and other selective estrogen receptor modifiers are very common.[1:52:48] Andrew Huberman: So I'm at least by my mind, I'm gonna Pool them with peptides and say it sounds precarious and, probably not ideal for most people. Going back to testosterone therapy, then again, notice, Folks, I've deleted the replacement part because I think so many people are using testosterone therapy without the need to the sort of Reference range need to, to replace anything, but rather building on what they already have for purposes of increasing vitality, etcetera. Going back to that, my understanding is that taking HCG, several times per week can help maintain spermatogenesis and fertility even while people are on testosterone. But and you and I were talking about this earlier that there's tremendous variation. Some people will take a small amount of testosterone and just crush their Firm count, they just won't make any viable sperm.[1:53:37] Andrew Huberman: Other people can maintain viable sperm production while on testosterone, especially if they're take taking HCG. Is that right?[1:53:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. And there's many reasons for this. Some of this has to do with heat damage to the testes, so, potentially, cold therapy could be helpful for that.[1:53:52] Andrew Huberman: And Ice baths, cold showers.[1:53:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Mhmm.[1:53:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Or just avoid and and certainly avoiding Most sauna hot tub. Yeah.[1:53:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Yeah. Stopping the daily hot tub can restore fertility in many people.[1:54:03] Andrew Huberman: I know a number of people that are trying to conceive children that go into the sauna, And they'll just put a cold pack in their shorts or between their legs depending on whether or not they're wearing shorts or not when they go in, or they'll alternate ice and heat in a way that maintains Coolness of the the I think the, milieu in which the the sperm live. In other words, they're cooling, their scrotum deliberately in order to avoid killing the sperm. Actually, I saw an interesting paper, that said that for every 2 degree increase In, temperature, of the scrotum, there's a 20% decrease in in spermatogenesis and, and viability of sperm. And then, actually, if you look at the difference between people who stand a lot, sit a lot, and drive a lot, what you see is a progressive decrease in sperm count that because when people Sit sitting, there's an increase in temperature, and then when they're sitting on the hot seat of the car, there's an, or using the the heated seats actually kills sperm. I think there are good data on that.[1:55:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Excellent data, and, anecdotally, you see it as well. I've had several patients come in for fertility consultations, And all we do is, like, you know, no medications, no supplements. We change their, like, several lifestyle things. An uptight fitting very tight fitting clothing is another one, and soon they have fertility, and, they're no longer, they they have Sperm, whereas before, they did not.[1:55:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Interesting.[1:55:30] Andrew Huberman: Like to talk about some of the do's and don'ts, but We have talked about a lot of dos, things that one can do to optimize hormones. Maybe we could just do sort of, more rapid fire, q and a on some of the don'ts, and maybe throw in some science where you feel, it's appropriate. Cannabis, marijuana, THC, Yes or no. It diminishes testosterone levels. Smoked cannabis,[1:55:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I would say diminishes testosterone, increases prolactin, that's a no. Other cannabinoids, not particularly harmful. So CBD, CBD, not particularly harmful. Smoked CBD, I'm not sure.[1:56:11] Andrew Huberman: What about edible cannabis and THC?[1:56:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: As far as I know, edible cannabis and THC does not significantly increase prolactin to a point where it would be, disruptive of hormones.[1:56:23] Andrew Huberman: Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever you wanna call it, increase gynecomastia, the growth of male breast tissue?[1:56:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. It certainly can, and there's a a pretty good association between smoked THC and gynecomastia.[1:56:37] Andrew Huberman: What about, nicotine and testosterone and estrogen and other hormones? Smoked nicotine.[1:56:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Nicotine is particularly not only for testosterone, but also for estrogen. Part of it is if you're talking about nicotine from tobacco, there's many other carcinogens in it, especially if it's smoked. But nicotine, even if it is chewed in a dose dependent manner so if you can use an extremely small amount of nicotine, Then it's not as concerning in a long run, but it's a vasoconstrictor. And, one of the main concerns with it would be, cardiovascular disease or even, microvascular ischemic disease that can lead to neurodegenerative disease, so like a type of dementia That can be partly due to nicotine. If you use nicotine for a very long period of time, especially at a higher dose, It's a dose dependent effect on your hormone profile.[1:57:32] Andrew Huberman: Is that also true for Nicorette and nicotine other nick nicotine gums?[1:57:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: At High doses, if you can use an extremely low dose of a nicotine gum, then theoretically, that would be, you know, maintainable. It's not gonna overload the nicotinic receptor. You have acetylcholine and the cholinergic system as one of your, you know, main nervous systems, of course, You have muscarinic receptors and nicotine receptors, and there's just better ways to optimize your nicotinic receptor activity. For example, Acetylcholine precursors like alpha GPC, Phosphatidylserine, Phosphatidylcholine, weak Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones, Potentially have a, like, a part as well and then other alkaloids. So nicotine is an alkaloid from the tobacco plant.[1:58:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There is other plants like cytosine and the, that genus of plants, and that alkaloid is also a nicotine receptor agonist.[1:58:33] Andrew Huberman: Is it true that cycling for too long, literally, bicycling, sitting on a bike seat too long can damage the prostate?[1:58:41] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. It can be very concerning, especially if you're seated while cycling, especially if you're putting a lot of pressure on the perineum. Your, core is kinda like a box where your diaphragm sorta makes the top and your abs and serratus make the front and the sides. Your back muscles make the back, and then your pelvic floor makes the bottom of the box, which is arguably the most important part of your core. And that pressure can weaken and even lead to incontinence and, impotence.[1:59:13] Andrew Huberman: So we were talking earlier today in the gym about how, heavy leg work, hack squats, dead lifts, those kinds of things that a lot of guys are doing to increase their testosterone done correctly Can actually augment and build up the strength of the pelvic floor. Done incorrectly can actually weaken the pelvic floor and lead to all sorts of issues, including sexual effects. Negative sexual effects. So, how does one go about learning whether or not their movements are being done properly To support pelvic floor or to destruct pelvic floor.[1:59:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The pelvic floor is a constellation of muscles just like any other kinda System in the body and, you know, form is important if you're doing the Valsalva maneuver, which again is that, Kind of like bearing down or deep breath where you feel all of your abs are tight. You can also notice that your pelvic floor is tight as well. If you have a history of a, an inguinal hernia, which is a whole kind of, like, connecting the abdominal cavity down through the pelvic floor or even the scrotum in some cases and that can be, a sign that, there is weakness in that area, and you might have to concentrate it on it most or even have a physiotherapist or a physical therapist specifically target the pelvic floor. Many exercises in which you Valsalva Or use your, glutes or legs. You can learn to squeeze them and have that mind muscle connection in order to help build up the pelvic floor and there's other things.[2:00:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Many people are familiar with kegels. That is just one of the many different exercises that can help your pelvic floor.[2:00:48] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that while strengthening the pelvic floor is good, excessive contraction of the pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow to the pelvic area, the penis, and so forth. So This is again, it's a double edged sword. Right? I mean, you don't want guys out there to just start doing endless number of kegels every day because they're actually gonna constrict blood flow to that area. Right?[2:01:06] Andrew Huberman: There's a Yeah. And in fact, the the erection response is parasympathetic. It's a relaxed induced response. Right? Correct.[2:01:14] Andrew Huberman: So, you know, for the the reason I chuckle is that, you know, for because we're talking about things. We don't have visuals or charts, and and certainly, it's hard to know Whether or not a given exercise like Kegels are gonna be good or not good, if it's excessive, what you know, how many sets and reps be, does does it take before it goes from from good to bad? Is there a kind of general rule of thumb for people to think about this? I mean, clearly, blood flow to that area is key, right, for sexual performance. And yet when one trains the legs or even walks, you're getting blood flow.[2:01:46] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. So my understanding is this, that a combination of Weight training to stimulate the positive hormonal and muscular and, connective tissue growth is key. Mhmm. It provides not overtraining, but so is Casual exercise like walking and stretching and the sorts of things that will then return blood flow to that area. Is that Overly basic way to think about it, or will that suffice?[2:02:09] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I think that's a good way to think about it. I think the main point with kegels is they're just One of many different things. So if you're having some pelvic floor pathology certainly or even just concerned about your pelvic floor, Don't just, you know, take the advice. Do key goals, and you'll be okay. That is not near enough.[2:02:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's just one of the many aspects.[2:02:30] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Okay. So going back to the rapid q and a, and then we'll come back to this issue of blood flow because there's some interesting science and protocols there. Question I have is Alcohol, does it increase aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen or not? And, is there a dose dependence there?[2:02:48] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It significantly does. There is a dose dependence. In general, I would not recommend more than, 3 to 4, you know, standard drinks. 1 huge glass of wine is probably 5 standard drinks.[2:03:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[2:03:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But, I'd say every 2 weeks. Mhmm.[2:03:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's consistent with what, I discovered researching, alcohol in an episode we did on alcohol that No alcohol is definitely better for all aspects of health than any alcohol, and anyone that says that, well, red wine contains these various things. Well, It doesn't contain enough of those positive things to have a positive effect, but that if people do opt to drink alcohol, that 2 drinks per week and meaning Twenty grams of alcohol, so that's probably 2 12 ounce beers or 2, you know, 4 ounce glasses of wine is going to be the limit beyond which you're gonna start seeing all sorts of negative effects.[2:03:41] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The other thing to keep in mind with alcohol is it has a lot of calories, 7 kilocalories per gram, almost as much as fat, which is 9. And then it's also very GABAergic, so it it can activate inhibitory neurotransmission, And that can also affect how many how much, LH and FSH is released. So that can also decrease testosterone almost kind of, similar to how opiates can decrease Testosterone. I feel very lucky that I don't enjoy alcohol. Never really did.[2:04:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You can't take it[2:04:15] Andrew Huberman: or leave it. Certainly don't like sedatives like Valium or anything like that, which you just mentioned, can suppress testosterone. You said the word fat. So, I'm gonna pick up on that and say, In order to optimize hormone production, is it important to have some saturated fat in one's diet? And what happens on very low fat diets To testosterone, estrogen, and other steroid hormones.[2:04:39] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's interesting because, there's so many different beneficial fats, omega threes. Almost every American gets plenty of omega sixes in any developed country, really. When it comes to saturated fat, There is more of a correlation with hormone optimization. If you're eating things with saturated fat, you tend to have, those are things with more, you know, fat soluble vitamins and things that are very nutrient dense otherwise, but it is not vital. In general, you want to eliminate any trans fat, unless it's trans fat from the ruminants.[2:05:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's always an exception to everything. Right? So there is healthy trans omega 3 fats, Which are, formed in the stomach of, like, grass fed and finished, ruminants.[2:05:23] Andrew Huberman: But ingesting mostly olive oils, Maybe nut butters in in limited amounts because they're very calorie dense, but, unless people are trying to increase their calories, in which case they're a great source of calories. Small amounts of butter, ghee, probably okay, but not excessive amounts. Is that the idea?[2:05:41] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. Fat is perfectly fine. Cholesterol, has an interest so cholesterol and in general phospholipids make the bilayer that's around the cell, But cholesterol is also a hormone in and of itself because it binds to the estrogen related receptor alpha. So I consider that, like, in the estrogen receptor category, and that can help with metabolism, but also potentially have concerns for Cancer and tumor risk.[2:06:08] Andrew Huberman: Wanna go back to the prostate and talk to you about something that's kind of a newer emerging trend. I know that, you've talked a little bit about this in, previous podcasts that a number of men or I should say a number of physicians are Prescribing low dose tadalafil, also known as Cialis, to their male patients. So in dosage ranges of, like, 2.5 milligrams to 5 milligrams per day, but not for erectile dysfunction, but rather for improving prostate health. And, presumably, they get sort of a boost in terms of blood flow, to the genitalia as well. But, again, not specifically a deal with, erectile dysfunction, but to deal with prostate health and blood flow to the prostate.[2:06:49] Andrew Huberman: Is that something that you sometimes often prescribe to your patients and of what age?[2:06:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Tadalafil is a very underrated medication. The age would kind of depend on the indication. So tadalafil is also a blood pressure medication. It can very slightly decrease blood pressure, especially at higher doses. At higher doses, it a high dose would be 20 milligrams, not 2.5 milligrams.[2:07:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But consistently, it can somewhat affect with the cones in the eye that have to do with red and green sight. Although if you remove it, That effect is reversed. So, basically, if you don't need really, really good red green discrimination, you can take higher doses. But in general, I recommend no Higher than 10 milligrams a day, usually just 2 or 5 milligrams. One, Other benefit or other use of Tadalafil is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor similarly to L Carnitine.[2:07:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So that's an interesting benefit. Another benefit is that if you give it to people with nocturia, which is urinating at night in general, it will cut the episodes in half. So it could go from 2 to 1, which can make a big difference for your sleep, which will secondarily make a big difference for your growth hormone[2:08:01] Andrew Huberman: and testosterone optimization. Interesting. So you said 2.5 to 5 milligrams per day is kind of typical for these prostate enhancing effects. Yes. And you mentioned the, potential side effects on adjusting visual perception.[2:08:14] Andrew Huberman: As a vision scientist, that rings in my mind. But in terms of red green discrimination, I'm guessing, unless you're gonna be a subject in one of the experiments in my lab or you wanna be a fighter pilot, chances are you can probably get away with a little less red, green color discrimination.[2:08:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. It's not considered clinically significant unless, someone is a commercial pilot.[2:08:35] Andrew Huberman: Right.[2:08:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if someone's getting their, like, pilot exam, that's one of the things we look for. K.[2:08:39] Andrew Huberman: K. So commercial pilots aside, you might wanna ask your doctor about low dose Tadalafil for sake of enhancing prostate health. Certainly monitoring PSA prostate Specific antigen is important. I can give an anecdote there. When I tried SIR MORALIN, one of the surprising side effects that was Not welcome was a dramatic spike in my prostate specific antigen.[2:09:00] Andrew Huberman: No one could explain to me why that would, happened. But when I stopped taking Somorilant, it went back to normal. So it's one reason I avoid Somorilant, at least frequent use of Somorilant. PSA should be kept, what, below levels of, you know, somewhere between 14 is considered healthy. Is that right?[2:09:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It depends on the age. If there's a 20 year old, Likely between 0 and 1. If there's a 40 year old, likely between 1 and 3. And then if there's an 80 year old, it would not be abnormal to have PSA of 5 and have that be well within the reference range. Great.[2:09:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Another thing we should mention about PSAs, if you do take a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, Like finasteride or dutasteride, often these will cut your PSA in half. So if you for example, if you have a PSA of 6 And you start finasteride or butasteride, and then you recheck it in 6 months, and it's 6.5, that is a huge concern because that's actually doubled.[2:09:56] Andrew Huberman: Glad you brought this up because, I almost overlooked the fact that I get a lot of questions about Drugs to offset hair loss. Most of those drugs are going to operate through the DHT system, the dihydrocystosterone system for the reasons we talked about before, DHT receptors being on the scalp and, causing beard growth on the face. Is it the case that a number of people taking, things like Propecia and other things to block the DHT or disrupt the DHT pathway are going to experience diminished, sex drive, diminished, you know, kind of motivation, and general vigor? And if so, are there alternatives like topical DHT antagonists that they might use, If they want to keep their hair, but not have those negative effects.[2:10:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The way that I think about, hair loss is you have your fertilizers also known as a growth agonist, and then you have your antiandrogens. Whether they're systemic or topical, there is both. But that's the general layman's way to think about hair loss. If you're only putting fertilizer in your hair, but you have androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness, Then those hairs will still miniaturize, and, eventually, you'll still have loss.[2:11:06] Andrew Huberman: Such a great word, miniaturize. Yeah. You know? It's enough to send anybody off to find a therapeutic.[2:11:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Right? By the way, it's difficult to tell if miniaturization's happening unless you have a magnifying glass. You can[2:11:17] Andrew Huberman: use a shot. For a second there, I didn't know whether or not you were making a joke. Talking about miniaturization of the hair follicle. Correct.[2:11:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yep. So what[2:11:23] Andrew Huberman: can reverse that miniaturization? That's just a fun word to say. I'm gonna just keep saying it.[2:11:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Each individual has, Again, we mentioned the androgen receptor. Males only have 1 androgen receptor gene. It's on their X chromosome. So depending on how sensitive that androgen receptor is And depending on the density of the, receptors in the hair follicle, you can have a arbitrary threshold, and You don't know what this threshold is until you start to have miniaturization and loss of hair. But over the threshold, the follicle will die, and eventually the stem cell will leave.[2:11:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But under the the threshold, you're okay. Every androgen binds to the same androgen receptor, so there is nothing special about DHT. DHT is just a stronger androgen. So the higher your SHBG, things that increase SHBG are beneficial for hair loss prevention because you have less binding of that receptor. So if you think about hair loss, specifically androgenic or male pattern baldness in the terms of That androgen receptor and everything in general binding to it, not just DHT, but also testosterone, it's helpful.[2:12:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's just that DHT is a huge battering ram, whereas the other androgens are just light presses on the door.[2:12:37] Andrew Huberman: Got it. So are some of the topical DHT receptor Antagonists going to be a better choice for people that want to maintain or their hair, grow more hair, if they wanna avoid side effects.[2:12:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Likely so. Some individuals, benefit from systemic, a systemic decrease in DHT for a couple of reasons. 1 could be prostate, and then 1 could actually be hypertrophy of the myocardium. So DHT also disproportionately thickens the ventricle. So for someone on TRT, that might be a benefit that is prone to thickening of the ventricle at baseline.[2:13:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: However, many people that have just a bit of predisposition, they can use things that are topical anti androgens. Ketoconazole is one of them. Caffeine is actually another one.[2:13:26] Andrew Huberman: Wait. Drinking caffeine?[2:13:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Topical caffeine.[2:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I was gonna say my hair tends to grow pretty fast, and so it might be I drink a lot of caffeine. So topical caffeine, really, rubbing coffee on their head or or taking caffeine tablets, and how does it wait. You have to explain how this works. How do people get caffeine into the hair follicle?[2:13:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Topically, the caffeine enters the scalp and crowds out, like, Somewhat crowds out the androgen. It is a weak effect. It's likely just strong enough to be clinically significant. Usually, caffeine is put into formulations with other things like Ketoconazole that are also weak anti androgens. Of notes, spironolactone can be prescribed topically, but is it is absorbed systemically because the size of the molecule.[2:14:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So unless your doctor specifically prescribes that for you, especially as a male, do not use topical spironolactone. Topical finasteride is also a smaller molecule, so it is also systemically absorbed, but it is not extremely well systemically absorbed. If you take topical finasteride, And, usually, your systemic DHT will decrease by about 30%. Topical Dutasteride is likely a Tiny bits, chemically absorbed, but it's unique because its half life is much faster at a lower dose. So topical dutasteride will not affect your systemic DHT at all, and I've seen this anecdotally on many people on topical lutasteride therapy.[2:14:50] Andrew Huberman: We're gonna have to get you back on here and do an episode all about DHT and hair loss and hair growth is, you know, again, not a topic that I focus on a lot for myself, but that I get a lot of questions about for men and women.[2:15:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: One thing that we could mention, I got a ton of questions about turmeric and curcuminoids after the last episode.[2:15:09] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. But, I had reported my own anecdotal experience that taking turmeric really crushed my DHT levels, and I did not feel good. I mean, it crushed all sorts of Positive feelings of vitality. The moment I stopped taking turmeric felt great again.[2:15:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Many people report this, and, the interesting thing about turmeric is most of its beneficial action, not all of it. Some people benefit from systemic, turmeric, and some people that can tolerate it well, it's actually great for the prostate. But most of the action, it does not need to be bioavailable. It acts on the gut microbiome. So you can take turmeric, and if it is not absorbed, some turmeric is put in special formulations like micellar or liposomal or complexed, But a lot of it is put with black pepper fruit extract, which is also known as biopurine, which is actually also a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, and it affects liver cytochromes.[2:16:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And so many supplement companies put this black pepper fruit extract, biopurine, and almost everything. So some people are on really high doses, And that could also be making most of the effect of people, who do not tolerate turmeric well.[2:16:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I avoid turmeric like the plague Based on that one previous experience, because it was clearly turmeric that caused the effect the negative effect coming off it. Everything reversed rapidly. And the biopurine, the black pepper extract Mhmm. I also avoid that like the plague based on everything you just said.[2:16:35] Andrew Huberman: I want my Five alpha reductase, I want my DHT to be optimized Mhmm. Simply because my understanding is DHT is The more powerful androgen is the one that, yes, it causes a little bit of hair loss, and I've got a few, you know, patches here and there, but I'm willing to live with that, based on all the other wonderful things that DHT optimization does.[2:16:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I'll quickly mention a few other things. 1, Sal palmetto is also a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, but only a couple of the isoenzymes. There's 3 main isoenzymes, And a lot of the problem is that you're inhibiting a couple of the isoenzymes, but not the other one. Finasteride inhibits 1 and 2. Dutasteride actually inhibits all 3.[2:17:19] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And, finasteride inhibits the isoenzyme that is in genital skin, But not in the skin throughout the rest of your body. So a lot of the side effects of finasteride, which is loss of sensation And the loss of erectile function have to do with the, this concordance between the sensitivity of the genital skin and the skin.[2:17:41] Andrew Huberman: Again, another reason to not disrupt 5 alpha reductase, and we'll definitely get you back on here to talk about d I think we should just do a whole episode about DHT because so often when people are thinking Optimizing hormones, especially male males trying to optimize their hormones. They're thinking testosterone, testosterone. Maybe nowadays, they think a little bit more about free testosterone, and maybe they think about Estrogen is also being important not to crush estrogen, but DHT is, you know, at least to my mind, the linchpin of so many of the things that Subjectively, people are really focused on libido, motivation, drive, etcetera. I have 1 final question. It's just a brief one, but many of us have heard that the BPAs, that are present in, you know, plastic bottles and even in certain aluminum cans.[2:18:21] Andrew Huberman: And phthalates, a difficult word to pronounce, but a fun one nonetheless, phthalates. And work by doctor Shana Swan has shown that phthalate ex exposure to the fetus, to pregnant mothers and the fetuses, Very likely is negatively impacting sperm counts, testosterone levels, and even changing, genitalia size for the worse. Mhmm. In males nowadays, I saw a beautiful lecture that doctor Shana Swan did on this when I was in Copenhagen, and it's very clear that it's negatively impacting the male fetus. She was also on Joe Rogan's podcast.[2:18:53] Andrew Huberman: Hope to get her on this podcast. However, what she couldn't answer for me was whether or not phthalates and BPAs and these things present in plastics and some people wouldn't claim in Tap water are bad for males after they're born and after puberty. What are your thoughts on Or I should just ask you, do you drink water out of plastic bottles? Do you avoid drinking out of cans that are not specifically non BPA containing Cans and do you actively avoid phthalates? My understanding is that phthalates are most enriched in pesticides, and that's why you're seeing dramatic drops in Sperm and testosterone levels mainly in rural areas where they're dust cropping.[2:19:32] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So I do avoid drinking out of cans that or plastics that may have, BPA or Bisphenol a in them. Bisphenol a is known to bind to what I would consider the 5th estrogen receptor, estrogen related receptor gamma. So it it I would I would consider it a xenoestrogen. So Phytoestrogens are estrogens from plants, and in general, they're not concerning or clinically significant.[2:19:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And xenoestrogens are just other estrogens. So I do avoid, BPA, and I also test my water. I use a water testing service, and I Test it both after it's through my water filter and the tap water that my 2 boys drink almost every day, And it was very interesting. I only found 1 microplastic just a bit over the reference range. So it wasn't a terrible top Score.[2:20:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But even in developed countries, these are widely variable. As far as, phthalates, again, very difficult and interesting for to pronounce. But I remember learning about these because there was, I believe, a lawsuit, that had to do with mac and cheese. And, this is probably 5 years ago, and I was coming up with my list of, each Provider that does obstetrics has a list what to avoid for the pregnant lady. You know, sketchy deli meats or, high mercury fish like swordfish and salmon, and I actually added Processed mac and cheese to that list.[2:21:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Interesting.[2:21:00] Andrew Huberman: Well, thank you for that. I'm going to extract your statement that you avoid drinking out of plastic bottles When when possible, I'm guessing you're not neurotically attached to that. If you're dying of thirst, you might, you know, crack a plastic bottle of water to survive. But listen, Kyle, Doctor Gillette, thank you so much.
