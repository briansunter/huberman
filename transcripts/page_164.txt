Kronikle AI - Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects - TranscriptJournal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today marks the 1st journal club episode Between myself and doctor Peter Attia. For any of you that are not familiar with doctor Peter Attia, he is a medical doctor, an MD, who is an expert in all aspects of health and lifespan. He is the author of a best selling book entitled Outlive, which is a phenomenal resource on all things health span and lifespan.[0:00:35] Andrew Huberman: And he is the host of the very popular podcast, The Drive, where he interviews various experts in all domains of medicine and scientists as well. Today, Peter and I hold our 1st online collaborative journal club. For those of you that aren't familiar with what a journal club is, a journal club is a common in graduate school and or medical school, whereby students get together to discuss 1 or 2 papers, to critique those papers, and to really compare their own conclusions of those papers with the conclusions of the authors and to highlight any key takeaways. Peter and I have been wanting to do a journal club together for a very long time, and we decided to do that journal club and to record it for you. So today, you will be sitting in on the first Huberman ATIA journal club.[0:01:19] Andrew Huberman: By the way, it could just have easily been called the ATIA Huberman journal club, and we will discuss 2 papers. 1st, Peter is going to discuss a paper on Metformin, which is a drug that many people are interested in for its potential role in longevity. I highlight potential there. He's going to compare that paper to previous findings on metformin. And by the end of that discussion, He will advise as to whether or not he himself would take metformin and whether or not other people might be well advised or ill advised To take metformin based on the data in that paper and at this time.[0:01:53] Andrew Huberman: Then I present a paper which is about the placebo effect. I have to imagine that most of you have heard of the placebo effect, but what's interesting about the paper that we discussed today is that it shows that the placebo effect Can actually follow a dose response. So it's not just all or none. It actually is the case that you can scale the degree of placebo effect Depending on whether or not you're thinking you're taking low doses, moderate doses, or high doses of a particular drug. And the particular drug that's discussed in the paper that I cover is nicotine.[0:02:23] Andrew Huberman: So for those of you that are interested in cognitive enhancement by way of pharmacology Or, frankly, for people who are simply interested in how our beliefs can shape our physiology, I think you'll find that discussion to be very interesting. So by the end of today's episode, you will not only have learned about 2 novel sets of findings, 1 in the realm of longevity as it relates to Metformin, and another in the realm of neurobiology and placebos or placebo effects, but you will also learn how a journal club is conducted. I think you'll see in observing how we parse these papers and discuss them, even arguing in them at times, that what scientists and clinicians do is they take a look at the existing Peer reviewed research, and they look at that peer reviewed research with a fresh eye asking, does this paper really show what it claims to show or not? And in some cases, the answer is yes, and in other cases, the answer is no. What I know is for certain is that by the end of today's episode, you will learn a lot of science.[0:03:19] Andrew Huberman: You'll learn a lot about health is some of which you may want to apply or avoid, and you'll learn a lot about how science and medicine is carried out. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast It's separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Helix Sleep.[0:03:46] Andrew Huberman: Helix Sleep makes customized mattresses to give you the best possible night's sleep. Now sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. When we are sleeping well and enough, mental health, physical health, and performance all stand to be at their best. One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailored to your unique sleep needs. Helix Sleep has a brief 2 minute quiz that if you go to their website, you take that quiz and answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back, your side, or your Stomach, do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?[0:04:16] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions, and that's fine. At the end of that 2 minute quiz, They will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. I sleep on the Dusk, a d u s k, mattress. And when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress about 2 years ago, my sleep Immediately improved. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helix sleep.com/huberman.[0:04:35] Andrew Huberman: Take their 2 minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you. You'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and 2 free pillows. Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $350 and 2 free pillows. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feedback Using a continuous glucose monitor.[0:05:00] Andrew Huberman: One of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes referred its blood sugar levels. To maintain energy and focus throughout the day, you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or dips. Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods and different food combinations, as well as food timing and things like exercise combined to impact your blood glucose levels. I started using Levels a little over a year ago, and it gave me a lot of insight into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards, as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my overall energy. And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize how I eat, What I eat, when I exercise, and so on such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day.[0:05:51] Andrew Huberman: If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Right now, Levels is offering an additional 2 free months of membership. Again, that's levels.link, link/huberman, to get 2 free months of membership. And now for my journal club discussion with doctor Peter Attia. Peter, so good to have you here.[0:06:14] Dr. Peter Attia: So great to be here, my friend.[0:06:16] Andrew Huberman: This is something that you and I have been wanting to do for a while, and it's basically something that we do all the time, which is to Peruse the literature and find papers that we are excited about for whatever reason, and oftentimes that will lead to a text dialogue or a phone call, or both. But this time we've opted to try talking about these papers that we find particularly exciting in real time For the first time as this podcast format, first of all, so that people can get some sense of why we're so excited about these papers. We we do feel that, people should know about these findings. And second of all, that it's an opportunity for people to learn how to dissect information and think about The papers they hear about in the news, the papers they might download from PubMed if they're inclined, and also just to start thinking like scientists and clinicians and get a better sense of What it looks like to pick through a paper, the good, the bad, and the ugly. So we're flying a little blind here, which is fun.[0:07:19] Andrew Huberman: I'm definitely excited for all the above reasons.[0:07:23] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. No. This is, you and I have been talking about this for some time, and and, You know, actually, we used to run a journal club inside the practice where once a month, 1 person would just pick a paper, and you would go through it in kind of a formal journal club presentation. We've gotten away from it for the last year just because we've been a little stretched then. I think it's something we need to resume because it's, It's a great way to learn, and it's a skill.[0:07:47] Dr. Peter Attia: You know, people probably ask you all the time because I know I get asked all the time, hey. What are the do's and don'ts of interpreting, you know, scientific papers, is it enough to just read the abstract? And and, you know, usually the answer is, well, no. But the how to is is tougher. And I think the 2 papers we've chosen today illustrate 2 opposite ends of the spectrum.[0:08:08] Dr. Peter Attia: You know, you're gonna obviously talk about something that We're gonna probably get into the technical nature of the assays, the limitations, etcetera. And the paper, ultimately, I've chosen to present, although I apologize, I'm surprising you with this Up until, you know, a few minutes ago is is actually a very straightforward, simple epidemiologic paper that I think has important significance. I had originally gone down the rabbit hole on a Much more nuanced paper about ATP binding cassettes in cholesterol absorption, but, ultimately, I thought this one might be more interesting to a broader audience. By the way, I gotta tell you a funny story. So I had a dream last night about you.[0:08:41] Dr. Peter Attia: And, in this dream, you were obsessed with Making this certain drink that was like your elixir, and it had all of these crazy ingredients in it. Supplements. So tons of supplements in it. But the one thing I remembered when I woke up, because I forgot most of them. I was really trying so hard to remember them.[0:09:00] Dr. Peter Attia: One thing that you had in it was dew. Like, you had to collect certain amount of dew off the leaves every morning to put into this drink. It was so But it's like[0:09:11] Andrew Huberman: just like something that I would do.[0:09:13] Dr. Peter Attia: And and so but here's the best part. You had you had, like, a thermos of this stuff that had to be with you everywhere, And all of your clothing had to be tailored with a special pocket that you could put the thermos into so that you were never without the special Andrew drink. And, again, you know how dreams when you're having them seem so logical and real, and then you wake up and you're like, That doesn't even make sense. Like, why would he want the thermos in his shirt? Like, that that would warm it up.[0:09:42] Dr. Peter Attia: Like, you know, all these but but, boy, it was a realistic dream, and there were lots of things in it, including dew. Special dew off the leaves every morning.[0:09:51] Andrew Huberman: I love it. Well, it's not that far from reality. I'm a big, Fan of Yerba Mate. I'm drinking it right now, in[0:09:58] Dr. Peter Attia: fact,[0:10:01] Andrew Huberman: in its many forms, usually the loose leaf. I don't tend to drink it out of the gourd. My dad's Argentine, so that's where I picked it up. I started drinking it when I was, like, 5 years old or younger, which I don't recommend people do. It's heavily caffeinated.[0:10:12] Andrew Huberman: Don't drink the smoked versions either, folks. I think those are potentially carcinogenic. But This thing that you describe of of carrying around the thermos close to the body, if you are ever in Uruguay Or if you ever spot grown men in a restaurant anywhere in the world carrying a thermos with them and to their meals and and hugging it close, Chances are they're Uruguayan, and they're drinking yerba mate. They drink it usually after their meals. It's supposed to be Good for your digestion.[0:10:39] Andrew Huberman: So it's not that far from from reality. I don't carry the thermos, but I do drink mate every day, and, I'm gonna start collecting dew off the leaves.[0:10:48] Dr. Peter Attia: Just a few drops every morning. This is just it's ruined.[0:10:52] Andrew Huberman: Oh my. Some other time we can talk about dreams. Recently, I've I've been doing some dream exploration. I've had some absolutely transformative dreams for the 1st time in my life. One dream in particular that has that allowed me to feel something I've never felt before and has catalyzed A large number of important decisions in a way that no other experience, waking or sleep, has ever impacted me.[0:11:16] Andrew Huberman: And this was drug free, etcetera.[0:11:19] Dr. Peter Attia: And do you think you could have had that dream? We don't have to get into it if you don't wanna talk about it now, but was there a lot of work you had to do to prepare For that dream to have taken place?[0:11:29] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yes. Yeah. At least, 18 months of intensive analysis type work, with a very skilled psychiatrist, but I wasn't trying to seed the dream.[0:11:42] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Yeah.[0:11:42] Andrew Huberman: It was just I I was at a sticking point with a certain process in my life, and then I was taking a walk while waking and realized that my brain, my subconscious, was going to keep working on this. I just decided it's gonna keep working on it. And then 2 nights later, I traveled to a meeting in Aspen, and I had the most profound dream ever, where I was able to sense something and feel something I've always wanted to feel as so real within the dream. Woke up, knew it was a dream, and realized this is what people close to me that I respect have been talking about. But I was able to feel it, and therefore, I can actually access this in my waking life.[0:12:23] Andrew Huberman: The it was it was it was absolutely transformative for me. Anyway, sometime I can share more details with you or the audience, but for now, maybe we should talk about these papers.[0:12:33] Dr. Peter Attia: Very well.[0:12:35] Andrew Huberman: Who should go first?[0:12:38] Dr. Peter Attia: I I'm happy to go first. Great.[0:12:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This one's[0:12:40] Dr. Peter Attia: this one's this is a pretty straightforward paper. So so we're gonna talk about a a paper titled Reassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in type 2 diabetics treated with Metformin compared with controls without diabetes, a retrospective cohort study. This is by Matthew Thomas Keyes and colleagues. This was published, last fall. Why is this paper important?[0:13:04] Dr. Peter Attia: So this paper is important because in 2014, Bannister published a paper That I think in many ways kind of got the world very excited about Metformin. So this was almost 10 years ago, and I'm sure many people have Heard about this paper even if they're not familiar with it, but they've heard the concept of the paper. And in many ways, it's the paper that has led to the excitement around the potential For Giro protection with metformin. And I should probably just define for the audience what Giro protection means. When we think[0:13:36] Andrew Huberman: probably also sorry to interrupt what metformin is just for the uninformed.[0:13:39] Dr. Peter Attia: That's a great point. So I'll start with the with the latter. So Metformin is a drug that has been used for many years. Depends, You know, where it was first approved, I think, was in Europe. But, you know, call it directionally 50 plus years of use as a first line agent For patients with type 2 diabetes, in the US, maybe 40 plus years.[0:14:03] Dr. Peter Attia: So this is a drug that's been around forever, trade name, Glucophage, or brand name, and, but but, again, it's, you know, it's a generic drug today. The mechanism by which Metformin works is debated hotly. But what I think is not debated is the Immediate thing that Metformin does, which is it inhibits complex one of the mitochondria. So, again, maybe just taking a step back, So the mitochondria as everybody thinks of those as the cellular engine for making ATP. So the most efficient way that we make ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation where we take either fatty acid pieces or a breakdown product of glucose once it's partially metabolized pyruvate, we put that into an electron transport chain, and we basically trade chemical energy for electrons that can then be used to make phosphates onto ADP.[0:15:00] Dr. Peter Attia: So it's you know, you think of everything you do. Eating is taking the chemical energy food, taking the energy that's in those bonds, making electrical energy in the mitochondria, those electrons pump a gradient that allow you to make ATP. To give a sense of how primal and important this is, if you block that process completely, you die. So everybody's probably heard of cyanide. Right?[0:15:21] Dr. Peter Attia: Cyanide is something that is incredibly toxic even at the smallest doses. Cyanide is a complete blocker of this process. And if my memory serves me correctly, I think it blocks complex 4 of the mitochondria. I don't know if you recall if it complex 3 or complex 4.[0:15:36] Andrew Huberman: I I know a lot about toxins that impact the nervous system, but I don't know a lot about poisons.[0:15:40] Dr. Peter Attia: Mitochondrial. Yeah. But if[0:15:41] Andrew Huberman: ever you wanna have some fun, we can talk All the dangerous stuff that animals make and insects make and how they kill you.[0:15:47] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Like, the neurotoxin and all these things that block sodium and animal damage.[0:15:51] Andrew Huberman: And, I I really geek out on this stuff because it allows me to talk about neuroscience, animals, and scary stuff. It's like combines it. So we could do that sometime for fun, maybe at the end if we have a few moments.[0:16:02] Dr. Peter Attia: So so, you know, something like cyanide that is a very potent inhibitor of this electron transport chain will kill you instantly. People understand that, of course, a drop of cyanide and you would you would be dead Literally instantaneously. So metformin works at the first of those complexes. I believe there are 4, if my memory serves correctly, 4 electron transport chain, complexes. And, but, of course, it's not a complete inhibition of it.[0:16:25] Dr. Peter Attia: It's just kind of a weak blocker of that. And the net effect of that is what? The net effect of that is that it changes the ratio of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine diphosphate. What's less clear is why does that have a benefit in diabetics, because what it unambiguously does is reduces the amount of glucose that the liver puts out. So hepatic glucose output is one of the fundamental problems that's happening in type 2 diabetes.[0:16:54] Dr. Peter Attia: You may recall, I think we talked about this in a previous podcast. You and I sitting here with normal blood sugar have about 5 grams of glucose in our total circulation. That's it. Five grams. Think about how quickly the brain will go through that.[0:17:07] Dr. Peter Attia: Within minutes. So the only thing that keeps us alive is our liver's ability to titrate out glucose. And if it puts out too much, for example, if the glucose can if the glucose level was consistently 2 teaspoons, you would have type 2 diabetes. So the difference between being metabolically healthy and having, you know, profound type 2 diabetes is 1 teaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream. So the ability of the liver To tamp down on high glucose output is important.[0:17:36] Dr. Peter Attia: Metformin seems to do that.[0:17:38] Andrew Huberman: So Can I just ask, 1 question? Is it Fair, to provide this overly simplified summary of the biochemistry, which is that when we eat, the Food is broken down, but the breaking of bonds creates energy that then our cells can use in the form of ATP. And the mitochondria are central to that process. And that metformin is partially short circuiting the energy production process.[0:18:03] Dr. Peter Attia: Yep.[0:18:03] Andrew Huberman: And so even though we are eating, When we have metformin in our system, presumably, there is going to be less net glucose. The bonds are gonna be broken down. We're chewing. We're digesting, but less of that has turned into blood sugar, glucose.[0:18:19] Dr. Peter Attia: Well, sort of. I mean, it it's not, It's not depriving you of ultimately storing that energy. What it's doing is changing the way the body, Partitions fuel. That's probably a better way to think about it to be a little bit more accurate. So, for for example, like, it's not depriving you of the calories that are in that Glucose.[0:18:41] Dr. Peter Attia: That would be, you know, fantastic, but that's not the[0:18:44] Andrew Huberman: that was the, olestra program. Remember the olestra from the nineties? Olestra, folks, for those of you who don't remember. By the way, if you ever ate this stuff, you'd remember, because it was a fat that was, not easily digested. It had sort of in sort of analogous to Plant fiber or something like that.[0:19:01] Andrew Huberman: So it was being put into potato chips and whatnot. And the idea was that people would would simply excrete it. And I don't know what happened except that people got a lot of stomachaches. And, the the anal seepage in the world. We know that.[0:19:17] Dr. Peter Attia: The the anal seepage is what really did that product go.[0:19:20] Andrew Huberman: Seepage. Only a physician, because after all, Peter's a clinician or physician, an MD, and I'm not, could find a an appropriate term to describe[0:19:32] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. When you have that much when you have that much fat Malabsorption. You you start to have accidents. Wow. And so So that that did away with that product.[0:19:41] Andrew Huberman: Right. It was either that or the diaper industry was gonna really take off. Okay. Why you don't hear about Alastra.[0:19:46] Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. So so we've got this drug. We've got this drug Metformin. It's considered a perfect first line agent for people with type 2 diabetes. So, again, what's happening when you have type 2 diabetes?[0:19:56] Dr. Peter Attia: The primary insult probably occurs in the muscles, and it is insulin resistance. Everybody hears that term. What does it mean? Insulin is a peptide. It binds to a receptor on a cell.[0:20:08] Dr. Peter Attia: So let's just talk about it through the lens of the muscle because the muscle is responsible for most Glucose disposal. It gets glucose out of the circulation. High glucose is toxic. We have to put it away, and we want to put most of it into our muscles. That's where we store 75 to 80% of it.[0:20:23] Dr. Peter Attia: When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, Tyrosine Kinase is triggered inside. So just Ignore all that, but a chemical reaction takes place inside the cell that leads to a phosphorylation. So ATP donates a phosphate group and A transporter, just think of like a little tunnel, like a little straw goes up through the level of the cell, and now glucose can freely flow in. So I'm sure You've talked a lot about this with your audience. We things that move against gradients need pumps to move them.[0:20:55] Dr. Peter Attia: Things that move with gradients don't. Glucose is moving with its gradient Into the cell, it doesn't need active transport, but it does need the transporter put there. That requires the energy. That's the job of insulin.[0:21:07] Andrew Huberman: By the way, I did not know that. I I mean, I certainly know active and and passive transport as it relates to, like, neurotransmitter and ion flow, but I'd never heard that when insulin binds to a cell that literally a little straw is placed into the Yeah. Membrane of the cell.[0:21:21] Dr. Peter Attia: Doesn't need a pump to move it in, because there's much more glucose outside the cell than inside. So it's just but the energy required is to move the the straw up to the cell.[0:21:31] Andrew Huberman: So biology is so cool.[0:21:33] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. It is. So so what happens is as and Gerald Shulman at Yale did the best work on elucidating this. As the intramuscular fat increases, and I by intramuscular, I mean intracellular fat, triacyl and diacylglycerides accumulate in a muscle cell, that signal gets interrupted. And all of a sudden, I'm making these numbers up.[0:21:57] Dr. Peter Attia: If you used to need 2 units of insulin to trigger the little transporter now, you need 3, And then you need 4, and then you need 5. You need more and more insulin to get the thing up. That is the definition of insulin resistance. The cell is becoming resistant to the effect of insulin. And therefore, the early mark of insulin resistance, The canary in the coal mine is not an increase in glucose.[0:22:24] Dr. Peter Attia: It's an increase in insulin. So normal glycemia with hyperinsulinemia, Especially postprandial, meaning after you eat hyperinsulinemia, is the thing that tells you, hey. You're you're 5, 10 years away from this being a real problem. So fast forward many steps down the line, someone with type 2 diabetes has long passed that system. Now not only are they insulin resistant where they just need a boatload of insulin, which is made by the pancreas, to get glucose out of the circulation.[0:22:53] Dr. Peter Attia: But now that system's not even working well, and now they're not getting glucose into the cell. So now their glucose level is elevated. And even though it's continually being chewed up and used up because, again, the brain alone would account for Most of that glucose disposal, the liver is now becoming insulin resistant as well. And now the liver isn't able to regulate how much glucose to put into circulation, and it's overdoing it. So now you have too much glucose being pumped into the circulation by the liver, and you have the muscles that can't dispose of it.[0:23:23] Dr. Peter Attia: And it's really a vicious, brutal cascade because the same problem of fat accumulating in the muscle is now starting to happen in the pancreas. And now the relatively Few cells in the pancreas called beta cells that make insulin are undergoing inflammation due to the fat accumulation within the pancreas itself. And so now the thing that you need to make more insulin is less effective at making insulin. So, ultimately, way, way, way down the line, a person with type 2 diabetes Might actually even require insulin exogenously.[0:23:53] Andrew Huberman: Could you share with us a few of the causes of type 2 diabetes of insulin resistance? Mean, one, it sounds like is accumulating too much fat.[0:24:01] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. So energy imbalance would be an enormous one. Inactivity or insufficient activity is Probably the single most important. So when Gerald Shulman, was running clinical trials at Yale, they would be recruiting undergrads study, obviously, because you're typically recruiting young people. And they would, you know, be doing these very detailed mechanistic studies where they would require actual tissue biopsies.[0:24:24] Dr. Peter Attia: So, you know, you're gonna biopsy somebody's quadriceps And actually look at what's happening in the muscle. Well, I remember him telling me this when I interviewed him on my podcast. He said, the most important criteria of the people we interviewed is that because they were still lean. These weren't people that were overweight, but they had to be inactive. You couldn't have active people in these studies.[0:24:42] Dr. Peter Attia: So exercising is one of the most important things you're going to do to ward off insulin resistance. But there are other things that can cause insulin resistance. Sleep deprivation has a profound impact on insulin resistance. I think we probably talked about this previously, but if you notice some very elegant mechanistic studies where you sleep deprive People you know, you let them only sleep for 4 hours for a week, you'll reduce their glucose disposal by about half. Wow.[0:25:05] Dr. Peter Attia: Which is I mean, That's a staggering amount of you're basically inducing profound insulin resistance in just a week of sleep deprivation. Hypercortisolmia There's another factor, and then obviously, energy imbalance. So where when you're when you're accumulating excess energy, when you're getting fatter, if you start spilling that fat Outside of the subcutaneous fat cells into the muscle, into the liver, into the pancreas, all those things are exacerbating it.[0:25:29] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[0:25:30] Dr. Peter Attia: Okay. So enter Metformin, first line drug. So most of the drug so every drug you give a person with type 2 diabetes is trying to address part of this chain. So some of the drugs tell you to make more insulin. That's that's one of the strategies.[0:25:45] Dr. Peter Attia: So here are drugs like Sulfonylureas. They tell the body, make more insulin. Other drugs like insulin just give you more of the insulin thing. Metformin tackles the problem elsewhere. It tamps down glucose by addressing the glucose the, hepatic glucose output channel.[0:26:03] Dr. Peter Attia: GLP one agonists are another drug. They increase insulin sensitivity initially causing you to also make more insulin. GLP So that's Ozempic? Yes. Yeah.[0:26:12] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah.[0:26:12] Andrew Huberman: And bur is it true that Berberine is more or less the poor man's Metformin?[0:26:17] Dr. Peter Attia: Yep. Okay.[0:26:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's a from a Tree bark, it just happens to have the same properties of Yeah. And by the way, of course mTOR and reducing blood glucose.[0:26:24] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. And metformin, by the way, occurs from a lilac plant in France. That's where it was discovered. So it's also Metformin is also based on a substance found in nature.[0:26:32] Andrew Huberman: So you you need a prescription for Metformin. You don't need a prescription for Berberine.[0:26:36] Dr. Peter Attia: Correct.[0:26:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah, we can talk about berberine a little bit later. I had a couple great experiences with berberine and a couple bad experiences. Interesting. Berberine.[0:26:44] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. So, Maybe taking one step back from this. In 2011, I became very interested in Metformin personally, just reading about it, obsessing over it, And just somehow decided, like, I should be taking this. So I actually began taking Metformin. I still remember exactly when I started.[0:27:02] Dr. Peter Attia: I started it in May of 2011, and I realized that Because I was on a trip with a bunch of buddies, we went to the Berkshire Hathaway, shareholder meeting, which is, you know, the Buffett, shareholder meeting. And, you know, it's kind of like a fun thing to do, and I remember being so sick the whole time because I didn't titrate up the dose of Metformin. I just went straight to 2 grams a day, which is kind of like the full dose, and we went to this[0:27:28] Andrew Huberman: Is that characteristic of your approach to things?[0:27:31] Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. I think that's safe to say.[0:27:33] Andrew Huberman: Next time, I'll give you a thermos of this dew that I collect in the morning. Oh, really?[0:27:39] Dr. Peter Attia: So I remember being so sick that the whole time we were in Nebraska or or Omaha, I guess, I couldn't we went to Dairy Queen because you do all the buffet things when you're there. Right? Like, I couldn't have an ice cream at Dairy Queen.[0:27:51] Andrew Huberman: You couldn't.[0:27:51] Dr. Peter Attia: I mean, I could. I'm so nauseous.[0:27:52] Andrew Huberman: Oh, because I would say if you've got metformin in your system, you're gonna buffer glucose. You could have 4 ice cream cones and probably[0:27:57] Dr. Peter Attia: couldn't put I couldn't keep anything down. Mean, I was so nauseous. Uncomfortable. So so clearly, Metformin has this side effect initially, which is a little bit of appetite suppression. But, regardless, That's the story on Metformin.[0:28:08] Dr. Peter Attia: There there are a lot of reasons I was interested in it. I wasn't thinking true protection. That term wasn't in my vernacular at the time, what I was thinking is, hey. This is gonna help you buffer glucose better. It's gotta be better.[0:28:19] Dr. Peter Attia: And this was sort of my first foray into, you know, self experimentation. Do[0:28:23] Andrew Huberman: you wanna define Giro protection on that?[0:28:25] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. It's a good term[0:28:26] Andrew Huberman: to define. Geriatric Giro?[0:28:28] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. So so, yeah, Giro from from geriatric old Protection. So protection from aging. And when we talk about a drug like Metformin or Rapamycin or even NAD, NR, these things, The idea is we're talking about them as giro protective to signal that they are drugs that are not targeting a specific disease of aging. For example, a PCSK nine inhibitor is sort of giro protective, but it's targeting one specific pathway, which is cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia.[0:29:01] Dr. Peter Attia: Whereas the idea is a Jiro protective agent would target hallmarks of aging. There are 9 hallmarks of aging. Please don't ask me to recite them. I've never been able to get all 9 straight, but people know what we're talking about. Right?[0:29:13] Dr. Peter Attia: So decreased autophagy, increased senescence, decreased nutrient sensing or defective nutrient proteomic instability, genomic instability, methylation, all of these things, epigenetic changes. Those are all the 9 hallmarks of agents. 7. Yeah. So a Giro protective agent would target those deep down biologic hallmarks of aging.[0:29:34] Dr. Peter Attia: And in 2014, a paper came out by Bannister that basically got the world focused on this problem. By the world, I mean, the world of of anti agent. So what what Bannister and colleagues did was they took a registry from the UK, and they got a set of patients Who were on Metformin with type 2 diabetes, but only Metformin. So these were people who had just progressed to diabetes. They were not put on any other drug, just Metformin, and then they found from the same registry a group of matched controls.[0:30:10] Dr. Peter Attia: So this is a Standard way that epidemiologic studies are done because, again, you don't have the luxury of doing the randomization, So you're trying to account for all the biases that could exist by saying we're gonna take people who, look just like that person with diabetes, so Can we match them for age, sex, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, BMI, everything we can, And then let's look at what happened to them over time. Now, again, this is all happening in the future, so you're looking into the past. It's retrospective in that sense. And so let me just kinda pull up the the sort of, table here so I can kinda walk through. And this is not in the paper we talked about, but I think this is an important background.[0:30:54] Dr. Peter Attia: So They did something that at the time I didn't really notice. I didn't notice what they did. I probably did and I forgot, but I didn't notice this until about 5 years ago when I went back and looked at the paper. And they did something called, informative censoring. So the way the study worked is if you were put on Metformin, we're gonna follow you.[0:31:19] Dr. Peter Attia: If you're not on Metformin, we're gonna follow you, we're gonna track the number of deaths from any cause that occurred. This is called all cause mortality or ACM, and it's really the gold standard In a trial of this nature or a study of this nature or even a clinical trial, you wanna know how much are people dying from anything because we're trying to prevent or delay death of all causes. Informative censoring says if a person who's on Metformin deviates From that inclusion criteria, we will not count them in the final assessment. So how are the ways that that can happen? Well, 1, the person can be lost to follow-up.[0:31:57] Dr. Peter Attia: 2, they can just stop taking their metformin. 3, and more commonly, they can progress to needing a more, significant drug. So all of those patients were excluded from the study. So think about that for a moment. This is, In my opinion, a significant limitation of this study.[0:32:18] Dr. Peter Attia: Because what you're basically doing is saying we're only gonna consider the patients Who were on Metformin, stayed on Metformin, and never progressed through it, and we're gonna compare those to people who were not having type 2 diabetes. So An analogy here would be, imagine we're gonna do a study of 2 groups that we think are almost identical. 1 of them are smokers, And the other are identical in every way, but they're not smokers, and we're gonna follow them to see which ones get lung cancer. But every time somebody dies in the smoking group, we stop counting them. When you get to the end, you're going to have a less significant view of the health status of that group.[0:32:55] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:32:56] Dr. Peter Attia: So with that caveat, The Bannister study found a very interesting result, which was the crude death rate, was And by the way, the way these are done, this is also one of the challenges of epidemiology is the math gets much more complicated. You have to normalize death rate for the amount of time you Study the people. So everything is normalized to 1,000 person years. So the crude death rate In the group of people with type 2 diabetes who were on Metformin, including the censoring, was 14.4. So fourteen 0.4 deaths occurred per 1,000 patient years.[0:33:38] Dr. Peter Attia: If you looked at the control group, it was 15.2. This was a startling result, and I remember reading this in, again, 2014 and being like, holy crap. This is really amazing.[0:33:52] Andrew Huberman: Is there, could you explain why? Because I I I hear those numbers, and they don't seem that striking. It's a difference of about a year and a half. Now, of course, a difference of about a year and a half in lifespan is is is remarkable.[0:34:05] Dr. Peter Attia: It doesn't even translate to that. So so taking a step back, Type 2 diabetes on average will shorten your life by 6 years.[0:34:12] Andrew Huberman: I see.[0:34:12] Dr. Peter Attia: So that's the actuarial difference between having type 2 diabetes and not all comers. But you're right. This is not a huge difference. It's only a difference of a little less than 1 year of life per 1,000 patient years studied.[0:34:24] Andrew Huberman: Okay. There and by the way, up here, just point out my my math was wrong when I said about a year and a half.[0:34:28] Dr. Peter Attia: But But but the the point here is you would expect the people in the metformin group to have a Far worse outcome, IE to have a far worse crude death rate. And the fact that it was statistically significant in the other direction, And it turned out on the what's called the Cox proportional hazard, which is where you actually model the difference in lifespan. The people who took Metformin and had diabetes had a 15%, 1 5, 15% Relative reduction in all cause death over 2.8 years, which was the median duration of follow-up.[0:35:05] Andrew Huberman: Well, that seems to be the the number that makes me go, wow. Yeah. Right? That, because could you repeat those numbers again?[0:35:13] Dr. Peter Attia: Yep. So 15% reduction in all cause mortality over 2.8 years.[0:35:19] Andrew Huberman: That's a big deal.[0:35:21] Dr. Peter Attia: It is. And, again, there's no clear explanation for it Unless you believe that metformin is doing something beyond helping you lower blood glucose. Because the difference in blood glucose between these 2 people was still in favor of the nondiabetics. So, Again, the proponents of Metformin being a JIRA protective agent, and I put myself in this category at one point. I would put myself today in the category of undecided.[0:35:52] Dr. Peter Attia: But at the time, I very much believed this was a very good suggestion that Metformin was doing other things. You mentioned a couple already. Metformin is a weak inhibitor of mTOR. Metformin reduces inflammation. Metformin potentially Tams down on senescent cells and their secretory products.[0:36:10] Dr. Peter Attia: You know, there are lots of things metformin could be doing that are off target, And it might be that those things are conferring the advantage.[0:36:19] Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals Through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals And the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one.[0:36:50] Andrew Huberman: I have more focus and energy, and I Sleep better, and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer a g one. If you'd like to try AG one, go to drink a g one.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:37:12] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drinkagone.com/huberman.[0:37:16] Dr. Peter Attia: So fast forward until year ago and I think most people took the Bannister study as kind of the best evidence we have for the benefits of metformin, and I'm sure you've Had lots of people come up to you and ask you, should I be on metformin? Should I be on metformin? I mean, I probably get asked that question almost as much as I'm asked Any question outside of dew? I mean, people definitely wanna know if you should be consuming dew, but but after that, it's metformin.[0:37:40] Andrew Huberman: Fresh off the leaves Has to be. While viewing morning sunlight.[0:37:43] Dr. Peter Attia: So okay. So let's let's kinda fast forward to now the the paper that I wanted to spend a few more minutes on. Yeah. And[0:37:49] Andrew Huberman: thanks for that background. I I'm still, dazzled By the, insertion of the straw by way of of, insulin. I I I don't think I've ever heard that described. I need to I need to go get a Better textbook.[0:38:02] Dr. Peter Attia: It's a pretty short straw in fairness. You know? It's just it's just a little trickster.[0:38:06] Andrew Huberman: I just, to give people a sense of why I'm so dazzled by, I am always fascinated by how quickly, how efficiently, and, how specifically biology Can create these little protein complexes that do something really important. I mean, you're talking about an on demand creation of a of a portal. Right? I mean, these are cells engineering their own machinery in real time in response to chemical signals.[0:38:32] Dr. Peter Attia: But but remind me[0:38:33] Andrew Huberman: is it that's it's great.[0:38:34] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. But but I'm I'm sort of rusty on my neuroscience, But an action potential works in reverse the same way. Like, you need the ATP gradient to restore the, To to restore the gradient. But once the action potential fires, it's passive outside. Right?[0:38:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So what Pierre's referring to is, the way that neurons Become electrically active is by the flow of ions across the from the outside the cell to the inside the cell, and they've we have both active conductances, meaning they're triggered by electrical Changes in the gradients via changes in electrical potential, and then their passive gradients where things can just flow back and forth until there's a balance equal inside and outside the cell. I think what's, what's different is that there's some movement of a lot of stuff inside of neurons when neurotransmitters like dopamine binds it's receptor and then a bunch of you know, it's like a bucket brigade that gets kicked off internally, but it's not often that you hear about receptors getting inserted into cells very quickly. Normally, go through a process of of, you know, transcribing genes and making sure that the specific proteins are made, and then it those are long, slow things that take place over the course of many hours or days. What you're talking about is a real on demand insertion of of a channel.[0:39:43] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And it makes sense as to why that would, be required, but it's just oh, so very cool.[0:39:47] Dr. Peter Attia: It's cool. Yep. So Keyes and colleagues came along and said, we would like to redo the entire Bannister analysis. And I I think their motivation for it was the interest in this topic is through the roof. There is a clinical trial Called the TAME trial that is, I think, pretty much funded now and may be getting underway soon.[0:40:09] Dr. Peter Attia: The TAME trial, which is an important trial, is going to try to ask this question prospectively and through random assignment.[0:40:16] Andrew Huberman: So So this is the targeting aging with met Forman trial.[0:40:20] Dr. Peter Attia: That's correct. Okay. Nir Barzilai, is probably the senior PI on that. And I think in many ways, the Bannister study, along with some other studies, but of lesser significance, probably provided some of the motivation for the TAME trial. So they said, okay.[0:40:37] Dr. Peter Attia: Look. We're gonna do this. We're gonna use a different cohort of people. So the 1st study that we just talked about, the Bannister study used, I believe it was like, roughly, they sampled, like, 95,000 subjects from a UK biobank. Here, they used a larger sample.[0:40:53] Dr. Peter Attia: They did about half a 1000000 people sampled From a a a Danish health registry, and they did something pretty elegant. They created 2 groups to study. So the first was just a standard replication of what Bannister did, which, was just a group of people with and without diabetic that they tried to match as perfectly as possible. But then they did a 2nd analysis in parallel with discordant twins. So same sex twins that only differed in that one had diabetes and one didn't.[0:41:24] Dr. Peter Attia: I thought this was very elegant because here you have a degree of genetic similarity, and you have similar environmental, factors during childhood that might give you you know, allow you to see if there's any sort of difference in signal. So now turning this back into a little bit of a journal club, Virtually any clinical paper you're gonna read, table 1 is the characteristics of the people in the study. Always wanna take a look at that. So when I look at table 1 here, you can see it's and by the way, just for people watching this, we're gonna make all these papers and figures available. So if you're, You know, don't don't you know, we'll have nice show notes that'll make all this clear.[0:42:02] Dr. Peter Attia: So table 1 in the Keyes paper shows the baseline characteristics. And, again, It's almost always gonna be the 1st table in a paper. Usually, the 1st figure in the paper is a study design. It's usually a flowchart that says These were the inclusion criteria. These were all the people that got excluded.[0:42:20] Dr. Peter Attia: This is how we randomized, etcetera. And you can see here that there are 4 columns. So the The first 2 are the singletons. These are people who are not related, and then the second 2 are the twins who are matched. And you can see remember I said they sampled about 500,000 people?[0:42:35] Dr. Peter Attia: You can see the numbers. So they got, you know, 7,842 singletons on Metformin, the same number then they pulled out matched without diabetes. On the twins, they got 976 on Metformin with diabetes, and then by definition, 976 Co twins without them. And you look at all these characteristics. What was their age upon entry?[0:42:57] Dr. Peter Attia: How many were men? What was the year of indexing when we got them? What medications were they on? What was their highest level of education, marital status, etcetera? The one thing I wanna call out here that really cannot be matched in a study like this, so this is a very important limitation, is the medication.[0:43:14] Dr. Peter Attia: So look at look at that column, Andrew. Notice how pretty much everything else is perfectly matched until you get to the medication list?[0:43:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's all over the place.[0:43:22] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. It's just you it's not even close. They're nowhere they're nowhere near matched. Right? In other words, just to give you a couple of examples.[0:43:29] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? On the and let's just talk about the singletons because it's basically the same story on the twins. If you look at what fraction of the people with type 2 diabetes on lipid lowering medication, it's 45.6% versus 15.4% in the matched Without diabetes, it's a three x difference. What about antiplatelet therapy? That's 30% versus 14%.[0:43:51] Dr. Peter Attia: Antihypertensive, sixty 5% for 63% versus 31%.[0:43:55] Andrew Huberman: Because people who have one health issue and are taking Metformin are likely to have other health issues.[0:43:59] Dr. Peter Attia: Exactly. So this is, again, a fundamental flaw of epidemiology. You can never remove all the confounders. Ugh.[0:44:08] Andrew Huberman: Is why I became an experimental scientist Yeah. So that we could control variables.[0:44:12] Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. Because without random assignment, you cannot control every variable. Now you'll in a moment when we get into the analysis, they go through 3 levels of corrections, but they can never correct this medication one. So just keep that in the back of your mind. Okay.[0:44:28] Dr. Peter Attia: So the 2 big things that were done in this experiment or in this survey or, you know, study To differentiate it from Bannister was, 1, the twin trick, which I think is pretty cool. The second thing that they did was they did a sensitivity analysis with and without informative censoring. So one of the things they wanted to know was, hey. Does it really matter if we Don't count the metformin patients who progress. So, so let's see kind of what what transcribed.[0:44:59] Dr. Peter Attia: So the next figure, figure 2 pardon me, the next table, table 2, walks you through the crude, mortality rate in each of the groups. So the most important row, I think, in this Table is the one that says crude mortality per 1,000 person years. Now you you recall that in the previous study, in the Bannister study, Those were on the ballpark of about 15 per. Okay. So let's look at each of these.[0:45:29] Dr. Peter Attia: So in the, Single the singletons with without so the nontwins who were not diabetic, it was 16.86.[0:45:39] Andrew Huberman: And could you put a little more contour on what this 1,000 person years[0:45:44] Dr. Peter Attia: What what it is?[0:45:45] Andrew Huberman: Are you talking about pulling the lifespans of a of of a bunch of different people until you get to the number 1,000 Yeah. Because you're normalizing not so it's not who's gonna live a 1000 years because Barron's expecting that. You're essentially taking so you've got some people that are gonna live, 76 years, 52 years, 91 years, And you're pooling all of those until you hit a1000, and then that becomes kind of a, a a it's like a normalized division. You're basically like so let's say The the control group, you're asking if there were a 1000 person years available to live, How likely is it that this person would live another 15?[0:46:24] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. So a couple ways to think about. A simple so taking a step back, we always have to have some way of normalizing. So when we talk about the from a disease like cancer in the population, we would we report it as what's the mortality rate Per and it's typically per 100,000 persons.[0:46:41] Andrew Huberman: Okay. That's a much more intuitive way to express it.[0:46:44] Dr. Peter Attia: It is. But the reason we can do it that way is because We're literally looking at how many people died this calendar year, and we divide it by the number of people in that age group. So it's typically What you're doing when you look at aged groups in buckets of, like, decades. So that's why we can say the highest mortality is, like, People 90 and up. Even though the absolute number of deaths is small, it's because there's not that many people there.[0:47:14] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? The majority of deaths in absolute Terms probably occur in the 7th decade. But as you go up, because the denominator is shrinking, you have to normalize to just normalized the number of people. Here are all the people that started the year. Here are all the people that ended the year.[0:47:30] Dr. Peter Attia: What's the death rate? Why are these done in a slightly more complicated way? Because we we we don't follow these people for their whole lives. We're only following them for a period of observation. In this case, roughly 3 years.[0:47:42] Dr. Peter Attia: So to say something like, you know, we have accrued death rate of 5 deaths per 1000 person years, one way to think about that is If you had a 1,000 people and you followed them for 1 year, you'd expect 5 to die. If you had 500 people and you followed them for years, you expect 5 to die. If you have a 1000 people and you follow them for 1 year, you expect 5 to die. Those would all be considered equivalent mortalities.[0:48:11] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you for clarifying that.[0:48:13] Dr. Peter Attia: No. No. This this stuff is I mean, like, I find I find epidemiology when you get in the weeds is Way more complicated than following the basics of, experimental stuff where you just you get to push all this stuff into the garbage bin And just say, hey. We're gonna take this number of people. We're gonna exclude this group.[0:48:32] Dr. Peter Attia: We're gonna randomize. We're gonna see what happens.[0:48:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's what like the paper we'll talk about next.[0:48:36] Dr. Peter Attia: Yep. Yep. So when you adjust for age, and they don't show it in this table. It's only in the text. When you adjust for age, A very important check to do is what is the crude death rate of the people on Metformin who are not twins versus who are Now in this table, they look different because it's 24.93 for the metformin group and 21.68 For the twin group in that's on Metformin.[0:49:05] Dr. Peter Attia: When you adjust for age, they're almost identical. It's it goes from 29 point 24.93 to 24.7. One other point I'll make here for people who are gonna be looking at this table is, you'll notice there are parentheses after every one of these numbers. What does that what does that offer in there? Those parentheses are offering the 95% confidence interval.[0:49:27] Dr. Peter Attia: So, For example, to take the number, you know, 24.93 is the crude death rate of how many people are dying who take Metformin. What it's telling you is we're 95% confident that the actual number is between 23.23 and 26.64. If a 95% confidence interval does not cross the number 0, it's statistically significant. Okay. So the first thing that just jumps out at you, I think when you look at this is there's clearly a difference here between the people who have diabetes and those who don't.[0:50:04] Dr. Peter Attia: It complicates the study a little bit because it's basically 2 studies in 1, but you're comparing, 95 pardon me. 24.93 to 16.86, which, by the way, remains After age adjustment, when you go to the twin group, it's 24.73 to 12.94.[0:50:23] Andrew Huberman: So maybe just to zoom out for that, what you're describing, if I understand correctly, is This, crude deaths per 1,000 person years, let's just talk about the singletons, the nontrans, is 16.86. So 16.86 people die, and some people are probably thinking, how can 0.86 of a person die? Well, it's not always whole numbers, but There's a there's a bad joke to be made here. But[0:50:47] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Just call it 17 versus 25.[0:50:49] Andrew Huberman: Right. Seventeen deaths per 1,000 versus 25 deaths. Yep. And the 25 is in the folks that took Metformin. Now that to the naive Listener, and to me, means, oh, you know, Metformin basically kills you.[0:51:05] Andrew Huberman: Right? Not faster or, you you know, you're more likely to die. But We have to remember that these people have another they have a major health issue that the other group does not have. That's right. Because people weren't Signed drug or not assigned drug.[0:51:19] Andrew Huberman: It wasn't placebo drug. It's let's look at people taking this drug for a bad health issue and compare to everyone else.[0:51:26] Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. So now you have to go into and and I'll just sorta skip the next figure, but the next figure is Kaplan Meier curve. I I I think it's actually worth looking at it because they show up in all sorts of studies. So if you look at figure 1, it's a Kaplan Meier curve, which is A mortality curve. So you'll see these in any study that is looking at death, and this can be prospective randomized.[0:51:52] Dr. Peter Attia: This can be retrospective, but These are always gonna show up, and I think it's really worth understanding what a Kaplan Meier curve shows you. So on the x axis is always time, and on the y axis is always the cumulative survival. So it's a curve that always goes from 0 to 11 or 100%, And it's always decreasing monotonically, meaning it can only go down or stay flat. It can never go back up. So that's what a cumulative, mortality curve looks like[0:52:22] Andrew Huberman: And now we're looking at you're starting at alive, and you're looking at how many people die for every year that passes. That's right.[0:52:30] Dr. Peter Attia: And in each curve, there's 1 on the left, which is the matched Singletons, and there's 1 on the right, which are the discordant twins. You have two lines. You have those that were on metformin with type 2 diabetes, and you have their matched controls. And in this figure, the matched controls are the darker lines, and the people with type 2 diabetes on Metformin, that's the lighter line. You'll also notice, and I like the way they've done it here, they've got shading around each one.[0:52:58] Andrew Huberman: And we should mention for those that are just listening that in both of these graphs, the, downward trending line from the controls, so, again, nondiabetic not taking metformin, is above the line, corresponding to the diabetics who are taking Metformin, put crudely, The people who are taking Metformin that have diabetes are dying at a faster rate for every single year exam, and the two lines Do not overlap except at the beginning when everyone's alive. It's like a footrace where, basically, the people with metformin and diabetes are falling behind and dying as they fall.[0:53:37] Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. And I'm glad you brought up a good point. It's not uncommon in treatments, to see Kaplan Meier curves cross. They don't have to it it's not a requirement that they never cross. It's only a, a requirement that they're monotonically decreasing or staying flat.[0:53:54] Dr. Peter Attia: So I've seen cancer treatment drugs where they have, like, 2 drugs going head to head in a cancer treatment, and, like, one starts out looking really, really bad, then all of a sudden, it kinda flattens while the other one goes bad, and then it actually crosses and goes underneath. But that's not the case here. To to your point, The people with diabetes taking Metformin in both the matched singletons and the discordants are dropping much faster, And they always stay below. And I was just gonna say that the shading is just showing you a 95% confidence interval. So you're just Putting basically error bars along this.[0:54:28] Dr. Peter Attia: So if this were experimental data, if you were doing an experiment with a group of mice, And you were watching their survival, and you were you know, you you'd have error bars on this which you're actually measuring. So this is Because you have much more data here, you're just showing us in this fashion.[0:54:43] Andrew Huberman: For those that haven't, been familiarized with statistics, no problem. Error bars correspond to like, if you were just gonna measure the heights of a[0:54:52] Dr. Peter Attia: Of a roomful of[0:54:52] Andrew Huberman: 10th graders, there's gonna be a range. Right? You have the very tall kid and the and the very, shorter kid, and you have the short kid and the medium kid, and you'll and so there's a range. There's gonna be Average, a mean, and then there'll be standard deviations and standard errors. And, so these confidence intervals just give a sense of How much range?[0:55:10] Andrew Huberman: You know, some people, die die early. Some people die late. Within a given year, they're gonna be different ages. So These error bars can account for a lot of different forms of variability. Here, you're talking about the variability is how many people in each group Die.[0:55:26] Andrew Huberman: We're not tracking 1 diabetic taking Metformin versus Right. A control. I I should have asked this earlier, but,[0:55:33] Dr. Peter Attia: Well and it's also a mathematical model at this point too that's smoothing it out.[0:55:37] Andrew Huberman: Right.[0:55:38] Dr. Peter Attia: Because notice it's running for the full 8 years even though They're only following people for, you know, typically, I think the median was, like, 3 or 4 years at a time. So they're using this Quite complicated type of mathematics called the Cox proportional hazard, which is what generates hazard ratios. And, Basically, any model has to have some error in it, and so they're basically saying this is the error. So you could argue when you look at that figure, We don't know exactly where the line is in there, but we know it's in that shaded area.[0:56:08] Andrew Huberman: It might those[0:56:09] Dr. Peter Attia: if those sort of make one other point. If those shaded areas overlapped, you couldn't really make the conclusion.[0:56:16] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:56:16] Dr. Peter Attia: You wouldn't know for sure that one is different from the other.[0:56:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's actually a good opportunity to, to raise a common myth, which is a lot of people when they look at a paper, Let's say it's a bar graph. You know? Yes. Yes.[0:56:31] Andrew Huberman: And they see these error bars, and they will say people often think, oh, if the error bars overlap, It's not a significant difference. But if the error bars don't overlap, meaning there's enough separation, then that's a real and meaningful difference. And that's not always the case. It depends a lot on that form of the experiment. I often see some of the the more robust Twitter battles over, you know, how people are reading graphs.[0:56:54] Andrew Huberman: And I think It's important to remember that, you run the statistics, hopefully, the correct statistics for the for the sample, but determining significance Whether or not the the result could be due to something other than chance, of course, your confidence in that increases as it becomes Typically, p value is p less than 0.0001 per percent chance that it's due, to chance. Right? So very low probably. P less than 0.05 tends to be the kind of gold standard cutoff. But when you're talking about data like these, which are repeated measures over time, people are dropping out literally, over time, you're saying they've modeled it to make predictions as to what would happen.[0:57:35] Andrew Huberman: We're not necessarily looking at, you know, raw data points Yeah.[0:57:38] Dr. Peter Attia: The raw data was in the previous table. That's now taken and run through this Cox model, and it's smoothed out.[0:57:46] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[0:57:46] Dr. Peter Attia: And, to your point about the bar graphs, yeah, I think the other thing you always wanna understand is just because something doesn't achieve statistical significance, The only way you can say it's not significant is you have to know what it was powered to detect. And statistical power is, a very important concept that probably doesn't get discussed enough. But before you do an experiment, You have to have an expectation of what you believe the difference is between the groups, and you have to Determine the number of samples you will need to assess whether or not that difference is there or not. So you use Something it's it's called a power table, and you you would go to the power table. So if you if you're doing treatment a versus treatment b, you say, well, look, I think treatment a is going to have a 50% response, and I think treatment b will have a 65% response.[0:58:41] Dr. Peter Attia: You literally go to a Powertable that says 50% response, 15% difference. That gives you a place on the grid, And I wanna be 90% sure that I'm right, so 90% power. I'm being a little bit so it's gonna be a statistician listening to this who's gonna wanna kill me, But this is directionally the way we would describe it, and that tells you this is how many animals or people you would need in this study. You're gonna need a 147 in each group. And by the way, if you now do the experiment with a 147 and you fail to find significance, You can comfortably say there is no statistical difference at least up to that 15%.[0:59:20] Dr. Peter Attia: There may be a difference at 10%, but you weren't powered to look at 10%.[0:59:24] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And, very important point that you're making. Another point that's just, more general one about statistics. In general, The way to reduce variability in a dataset is to increase sample size. I mean, that kinda makes sense.[0:59:36] Andrew Huberman: Right? If you if I just walk into a 10th grade class and, hey. I'm gonna Measure height, and I looked up by the first 3 kids that I see. And I happen to look over there, and it's the 3 that all play on the volleyball team together. I my sample size is small, and I'm likely to get a skewed representation.[0:59:53] Andrew Huberman: In this case, taller than average. So Increasing sample size tends to decrease variation. So the that's why when you hear about a study from the UK Biobank or from, you know, Half a 1000000 Danish citizens, like, for instance, in this study, that's those are enormous sample sizes. So even though this is, not an experimental study. It's an epidemiological observational study.[1:00:16] Andrew Huberman: There's tremendous power by way of The enormous number of subjects in the in[1:00:21] Dr. Peter Attia: the study. The way that epidemiology will make up for its deficit. So you could never do a randomized assignment Study on half a 1000000 people. You'd have you know? So so epidemiology makes up for its biggest limitation, which is it Can never compensate for inherent biases by saying we can do infinite duration if we want.[1:00:44] Dr. Peter Attia: Like, we could we could survey people over the course of their lives, we can have the biggest sample size possible because this is relatively cheap. The cost of actually doing an experiment where you have tens of thousands of people is It's prohibitive. I mean, if you look at the Women's Health Initiative, which was a 5 year study on, I don't know, what was it, 50,000 women, I mean, that was a $1,000,000,000 study. So This is this is the balancing act between epidemiology and randomized prospective experiments. And, they so they both offer something, you just have to know the blind spots of each one.[1:01:17] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes From your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, You get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes Very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etcetera, mean, and Behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health.[1:02:03] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker's ultimate you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman To get 20% off.[1:02:24] Dr. Peter Attia: So let's just kinda wrap this up. I mean, I think, let's just go to table 4, which I think is the most important table, in in here, which now lays out the the the final results in terms of the hazard ratios. So this is this is the way we wanna really be thinking about this. So Again, hazard ratios, these are important things to understand. A hazard ratio is a number, and you always subtract 1 from the hazard ratio, And that tells you if it's a positive number, if it's a number sorry.[1:02:51] Dr. Peter Attia: If it's a number greater than 1, you subtract 1, and that tells you the relative harm. So if the hazard ratio is 1.5, you subtract 1. 0.5 is a 50% increase in risk. If the number is negative, you may recall the Bannister paper, the hazard ratio was 0.85. So if it's not that so that means it's a 15% reduction in relative risk, And here you can see all the hazard ratios are positive.[1:03:15] Dr. Peter Attia: So what it's telling you here is and I'm gonna walk through this because it's there's a lot of information packed here. You've got singletons. You've got twins. They're showing you 3 different ways that they do it. They do an unadjusted model.[1:03:27] Dr. Peter Attia: If you just Look at the singletons with and without metformin and you make no adjustments, the hazard ratio is 1.48, Meaning, the people on metformin had a 48% greater chance of dying in any given year than their nondiabetic counterpart.[1:03:45] Andrew Huberman: The only reason I'm smiling, it's not because I enjoy people dying quite, quite to the contrary is that, this is novel for me. And that I've read some Epidemiological studies before, but it's not normally where I spend the majority of my time. But up until now, I was thinking, okay. People taking metformin are are dying more than those that aren't. I just and I I'm just relieved to know that I wasn't, looking at all this backwards.[1:04:07] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah.[1:04:08] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So they're dying more, but, Of course, we don't have a group that's taking metformin who doesn't have diabetes, and we don't have a group, who has diabetes and, you know, is taking Metformin plus something else. So, again, we're we're only dealing with these constrained[1:04:24] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Now there's another arm to this study that I'm not Getting into because it adds more complexity, which is they also have another group that's got diabetes, takes Metformin, and takes Sulfonylureas, which is a a bigger drug, And those people die even more.[1:04:39] Andrew Huberman: Woah. So which again speaks to the point.[1:04:42] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? The more you need these medications, They're never able to erase the effect of diabetes.[1:04:49] Andrew Huberman: But in this case, it seems that they might be accelerating, Possibly accelerating death due to diabetes. Possibly.[1:04:56] Dr. Peter Attia: We we could never know that from this because we're we don't see we would need to see diabetics who don't take Metformin who take nothing, and I would bet that they would do even worse. Mhmm. So my intuition is that the metformin is helping, but Not helping nearly as much as we thought before. So my point is they make another set of adjustments. They say, okay.[1:05:16] Dr. Peter Attia: Well, look. In the first one, in the unadjusted model, we only matched for age and gender. Okay. That's pretty crude. What if we adjust For the medications they're on, the cardiovascular, psychiatric, pulmonary, dementia meds, and marital status.[1:05:31] Dr. Peter Attia: I don't know why they threw marital status in there, but they did.[1:05:34] Andrew Huberman: Don't know. Maybe being married or unmarried can accelerate it.[1:05:37] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Things like a random thing to throw in with all their meds. I would have personally done that adjustment higher up. But, nevertheless, if you do that, All of a sudden, the, hazard ratio drops from 1.48 to 1.32, which means, yep, you still have a 32% greater chance of dying in any given year. Alright.[1:05:55] Dr. Peter Attia: What if we also adjust for the highest level of, education along with any of the other covariance. Well, that doesn't really change it at all. It ends up at 1.33 or a 33% chance Increase in death. Okay. I[1:06:08] Andrew Huberman: always knew that more school wasn't gonna save me.[1:06:10] Dr. Peter Attia: It was it's not doing Jack. So now let's do it for the twins. If you do the twin study, which you could argue is a slightly cure study because you at least have 1 genetic and environmental thing that you've attached. The unadjusted model is brutal. 2.15.[1:06:26] Dr. Peter Attia: That's a 115%. Think about this. These are twins who in theory are the same in every way, except one has diabetes and one doesn't, And the one with diabetes on Metformin still has a 115% greater chance of dying than the nondiabetic co twin. Brutal. When you make that first adjustment of all the meds and marital status, you bring it down to a 70% increase in risk, and when you throw education in, it goes up to an 80% chance of risk.[1:06:53] Dr. Peter Attia: Now they did this really cool thing, which was they did the analysis on with and without censoring. So everything I just said here was based on no censoring.[1:07:04] Andrew Huberman: Tell me about censoring.[1:07:06] Dr. Peter Attia: Censoring is when you stop counting the metformin people who have died. Okay. So in the singleton group, when you unadjust it and the reason I'm doing the unadjusted is that's where they did the sensitivity analysis. I don't think it really matters that much. It's you just have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.[1:07:23] Dr. Peter Attia: You'll recall that that was a 48% chance of increased mortality, all cause mortality, if you stop counting, if you if you, pardon me, if you don't censor, Meaning, if you include everybody, including when people on metformin with diabetes die, if you censor them, it comes down to 1.39. In other words, this is a very important finding, it did not undo the benefits that we saw in the Bannister study. Bannister saw a 15% reduction in mortality when they censored. When Keys censored, it got better, but not that much better. It went from 48 to 39%.[1:08:04] Dr. Peter Attia: In the twins, It went from a 115% down to only 97%. So In some ways, this presents a little bit of an enigma because it's not entirely clear to me having read these papers many times exactly why Bannister found such an outlier on the like, such a different response. There's another there's another technical detail of this paper, which is they you can see on the right side of table 4, they did something called a nested case control, But you'll see and I was gonna go into a long explanation of what nested case controls are. It's another pretty elegant way to do case control studies Where you sample by year and you you you sort of normalize you you don't count all the cases at the end. You count them 1 by 1.[1:08:53] Dr. Peter Attia: I don't think it's worth getting into, Andrew, because it doesn't change the answer. You can see it changes it just slightly, but it doesn't change the point. The point here is The Keyes paper makes it und undeniably clear that in that population, there was no advantage offered by Metformin that undid the disadvantage of having type 2 diabetes. This does not mean that Metformin wasn't helping them because we don't know What these people would have been like without Metformin, it could be that this bought them a 50% reduction in relative mortality to where they've been. But what it says is In my way, this is what you would have expected.[1:09:31] Dr. Peter Attia: This is what you would have expected 10 years ago before the banister paper came out.[1:09:35] Andrew Huberman: Or maybe even before Metformin was used because in some ways, it's saying, what is the likelihood that sick people who are on a lot of medication are gonna die compared to not sick People who aren't on a lot of medication. Yep. 1 you know, it's not quite that simple in the in the sense that, as you said, there are ways to, try and isolate the Metformin contribution somewhat[1:09:57] Dr. Peter Attia: Yep.[1:09:58] Andrew Huberman: Because they're on a bunch of other meds. And, presumably, that was done and analyzed in in other figures that where they they can sort of try and they they can never attach the results specifically to Metformin. Right? But, there must be some way of weighting the percentage that are on psychiatric meds or not on psychiatric meds as some way to tease out whether or not there's actually Some contribution of metformin to this result?[1:10:22] Dr. Peter Attia: Well, that's what they're doing in in b in the in the partial adjustment is they're actually they're actually doing their best To say[1:10:30] Andrew Huberman: Oh, right. Married or not married. They're going variable by variable.[1:10:33] Dr. Peter Attia: Drug by drug all the way through high blood pressure, nonhigh blood pressure, smoking, nonsmoking, etcetera.[1:10:37] Andrew Huberman: Right. And the way they would do that presumably is by saying, okay. Married, not married. That's what that's a simple one.[1:10:44] Dr. Peter Attia: Are you on lipid lowering meds? Yes or no? Okay. You are not. You are not.[1:10:49] Dr. Peter Attia: They[1:10:50] Andrew Huberman: and then comparing those groups.[1:10:51] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.[1:10:52] Andrew Huberman: So no no differences jumping out that can be purely explained by these other variables.[1:10:58] Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. Although, again, this is a this is a great opportunity to talk about why no matter how slick you are, no matter how slick your model is, you can't control for everything. There's a reason that, to my knowledge, virtually every study that compares meat eaters to non meat eaters finds an advantage amongst the non meat eaters. And we can talk about all[1:11:17] Andrew Huberman: the advantage.[1:11:18] Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. And we can or disease, you know, incidence, studies. And, yeah, it might be tempting to say, well, therefore, eating meat is bad, until you realize that it takes a lot of work to not eat meat. That's a very, very significant decision that a person for most people, that's a very significant decision a person makes. And for a person to make that decision, they probably have a very high conviction about the benefit of that to their health.[1:11:42] Dr. Peter Attia: And it is probably the case that that they're making other changes with respect to their health as well that are a little more difficult to measure. Now there's a 1,000,000 other problems with that. I picked a silly example because the whole meat discussion then gets into, well, you know, when when we say eating meat, what do we mean?[1:11:59] Andrew Huberman: Like, the document is, like, deli meat versus grass[1:12:01] Dr. Peter Attia: fed or a or a, you know,[1:12:03] Andrew Huberman: a deer that you hunted with your ball[1:12:04] Dr. Peter Attia: That that's right. Totally different. So how do we get into all those things? But my point is It's very difficult to quantify some of the intangible differences, and I think that even a study that goes to great lengths as this one does Epidemiologically, to make these corrections can never make the corrections. And so for me, the big takeaway of this study is, one, this Makes much more sense to me than the Bannister paper, which never really made sense to me.[1:12:28] Dr. Peter Attia: And, again, I was first critical of the Bannister paper in 2018 about 4 years after chemo. That's about the time I stopped taking by the way. I stopped taking it for a different reason, which we can talk about in a sec, but, that was the first time I went back and said, wait a minute. This information this this this informative censoring thing is That's a little fishy, and I think we weren't looking at a true group of real type 2 diabetics. Now that said, maybe it doesn't matter.[1:12:52] Dr. Peter Attia: In other words, maybe and eve even the Keyes paper doesn't tell us that metformin wouldn't be beneficial because it could be That those people, if they were on nothing, as their matched cohorts were on nothing, would have been dying at, You know, a hazard ratio of 3, and this brought it down to 1.5, in which case you would say there is some Giro protection there. It is putting the brakes on this process. All of this is to say, absent a randomized controlled trial, we will never know the answer.[1:13:22] Andrew Huberman: Has there been a randomized controlled trial?[1:13:24] Dr. Peter Attia: Not in not in[1:13:24] Andrew Huberman: this stage.[1:13:25] Dr. Peter Attia: Not not when it comes to a hard Now there has been in the ITP. So the interventions testing program, which is kind of the gold standard for animal, studies, which is run out of 3 labs. So it's a it's an NIH funded program that's run out of 3 labs. They, they basically test molecules For gero protection. The ITP was the 1st study that really put rapamycin on the map in 2009.[1:13:50] Dr. Peter Attia: That was the study that fortuitously demonstrated that even when Ravamycin was given very, very late in life, it was given to 60 month old mice, it still afforded them a 15% lifespan extension.[1:14:03] Andrew Huberman: Has a similar study been done in humans? I mean, it's hard I mean, it's hard to no. I mean, you can't really control with rapamycin. No.[1:14:10] Dr. Peter Attia: But when the ITP studied Metformin, it did not succeed. So the the there have not been that many Drugs that have worked in the ITP. The ITP is very rigorous. Right? It's a it doesn't use an inbred strain of mice.[1:14:24] Dr. Peter Attia: It is done concurrently in 3 labs with very large sample sizing. And so when something works in the ITP, it's pretty exciting. Rapamycin has been studied several times. It's always worked. Another one we should talk about it in the subsequent time is 17 alpha estradiol.[1:14:42] Dr. Peter Attia: This continues to work in male mice, and it produces comparable effects to rapamycin. Estrogen. Doesn't work in female mice.[1:14:49] Andrew Huberman: Makes sense.[1:14:49] Dr. Peter Attia: But but this is alpha, not beta. So this is 17 alpha estradiol, not beta estradiol, which is the estradiol that we all that that is bioavailable in all of us.[1:14:57] Andrew Huberman: And and, just as a brief aside, I think you and I basically agree that, unless it's a problem, males, we're talking post puberty, should try and have their estrogen as high as possible without having negative symptomology because of the importance of estrogen libido, for brain function, tissue[1:15:18] Dr. Peter Attia: Bone health.[1:15:19] Andrew Huberman: Health. Bone health. Body health is still good. Crushing estrogen and raising testosterone is just silly. Right.[1:15:24] Andrew Huberman: There's not let's just leave raising testosterone out of it. But many of the approaches to raising testosterone that are pharmacologic in nature Also, raise estrogen. A lot of people try and push down on estrogen, and that is just again, unless people are getting, hypoestrogenic effects like gynecomastia or other issues Is the exact wrong direction to go? You want estrogen.[1:15:46] Dr. Peter Attia: Estrogen is a very important hormone for men and women.[1:15:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's it.[1:15:51] Dr. Peter Attia: Canagliflozin, an SGLT 2 inhibitor, also very successful in the ITP. But, again, interestingly, rapamy metformin not. So Metformin has failed in the ITP.[1:16:01] Andrew Huberman: So you no longer take Metformin?[1:16:03] Dr. Peter Attia: I stopped 5 years ago.[1:16:04] Andrew Huberman: I mean, you're not a diabetic, so presumably, you were taking it I'm taking it for giro protection. To buffer blood Glucose.[1:16:09] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. And, ultimately, ultimately live longer. Yes. Exactly. And the reason I stopped and this will be the last thing before we move on.[1:16:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, because you couldn't go to the Dairy Queen at the buffet of that.[1:16:18] Dr. Peter Attia: No. Finally, the nausea went away after a few weeks or a month maybe. But once I got really into lactate testing, I noticed how high my lactate was, at rest. So a resting fasted lactate should be in a healthy person, should be below 1, like Somewhere between 0.3, 0.6 millimole. And only when you start to exercise should lactate go up.[1:16:42] Dr. Peter Attia: And in 2018 was when I started Blood testing for my zone 2. So previously, when I was doing zone 2 testing, I was just going off my power meter and heart rate, But this is when, this is after I met Inigo San Milan, and I started, like, wanting to use the lactate threshold of 2 millimole as my As my determinant of where to put my wattage on the bike. And I'm, like, doing finger pricks before I start, and I'm like, 1.6 millimole. And I'm like, what the hell is going can't be 1.6[1:17:11] Andrew Huberman: ran the a flight of stairs up the back of the Empire State Building.[1:17:14] Dr. Peter Attia: Well no. That would put me a lot higher. Right? But but And and and when[1:17:17] Andrew Huberman: I being generous to your[1:17:19] Dr. Peter Attia: No. But but but that's when I started digging a little digging and realized, oh, you know what? This totally makes sense. If you have a weak mitochondrial Toxin, what are you gonna do? You're gonna shunt more glucose into pyruvate and more pyruvate into lactate.[1:17:35] Dr. Peter Attia: Tate, I'm I'm anaerobic Yeah.[1:17:37] Andrew Huberman: You need an alternate fuel source.[1:17:39] Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. So and then my zone two numbers just seemed off. My lactate Could[1:17:44] Andrew Huberman: you feel it? Sorry to interrupt, but[1:17:45] Dr. Peter Attia: could you feel[1:17:46] Andrew Huberman: it in your body? Because maybe now I'll just briefly describe. I took Berberine. Mhmm. I, during the period of maybe Somewhere in the 2012 to 2015 stretch.[1:17:56] Andrew Huberman: I don't recall[1:17:57] Dr. Peter Attia: exactly what taking it for? Well, I'll[1:17:58] Andrew Huberman: tell you. So I I was and I still am a big fan of Tim Paris's, slow carb or hydrant diet. Because I like to eat meat and vegetables and starches. I'm an omnivore. And I found that it worked Very quickly got me very lean.[1:18:13] Andrew Huberman: I could exercise. I could think. I could sleep. All you know, a lot of my, A rationale for following 1 eating regimen or another, what I eat is to enjoy myself, but also have mental energy. I mean, because if I can't sleep at night, I'm not gonna replenish.[1:18:27] Andrew Huberman: I'm not don't replenish. I'm gonna feel like garbage. I don't care how lean I am or what you know? Yep. So I found the slow carb diet to be, which was in the 4 hour body, to be a very good Plan for me is pretty easy.[1:18:38] Andrew Huberman: You drop some things like bread, etcetera. You don't drink calories, except after a resistance training session, etcetera. But One day a week, you have this so called cheat day. And on the cheat day, anything goes. And so I would eat, you know, 8 croissants, and then I'd alternate to sweet stuff, and then I go to And by the end of the day, you don't wanna look at an an item of food at all.[1:18:57] Andrew Huberman: So the only modification I made to the slow slow carb diet, 4 hour body thing was the day after the cheat day, I wouldn't eat. I would just fast. Mhmm. And I had no problem doing that because it was just basically well, since you said, what was it? Anal, Anal seepage.[1:19:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Gel seepage. I did not have that, but since you said that, I, I won't up the ante here, but I'll at least match your anal seepage comment by saying I had, let's just call it, Profound gastric distress after eating like that the next day. So last thing you wanna do is eat any food out. Just hydrate and oftentimes to try and get some exercise.[1:19:30] Andrew Huberman: And what I read was that Berberine, poor man's Metformin, could buffer blood glucose and, in some ways, make me feel less sick When ingesting all these calories and in many cases, spiking my my blood sugar and insulin, because you're having ice cream and you're, you know, etcetera. And, indeed, it worked. So if I took Berberine and I don't recall the milligram count and then I ate, you know, 12 donuts, I felt fine. It was as if I had eaten 1 doughnut. Wow.[1:19:58] Andrew Huberman: I felt sort of okay in my body, and I felt much, much better. Now, presumably because it's buffering the spikes in blood sugar. I wasn't crashing in the afternoon nap and that whole thing.[1:20:08] Dr. Peter Attia: And do you remember how much you were taking?[1:20:10] Andrew Huberman: I think it was couple 100 milligrams. Does that sound about right? It was a bright yellow capsule. Yeah. I forget the source.[1:20:16] Andrew Huberman: But in any case, one thing I noticed was That if I took Berberine and I did not ingest a profound number of carbohydrates very soon afterwards, I got brutal headaches. I think I was hypoglycemic. I didn't measure it, but I just felt I had headaches. I didn't feel good, and then I would eat a pizza or 2 and feel fine. And so I realized that Berberine was putting me on this You had a lower blood sugar state.[1:20:41] Andrew Huberman: That was the logic anyway, and it allowed me to eat these cheap foods. But when I cycled off of the the 4 out because I I don't follow the slow carb diet anymore, although I might again at some point. When I stopped doing those cheat days, I didn't have any reason to take the Berberine, and I feared that I Wasn't ingesting enough carbohydrates in order to really justify trying to buffer my blood glucose. Also, my blood glucose tends to be Did[1:21:04] Dr. Peter Attia: you ever did you ever try Acarbose?[1:21:07] Andrew Huberman: No. What is that?[1:21:08] Dr. Peter Attia: So Acarbose is a glucose disposal in here. It's it's actually a drug that but it works more in the gut, and it just prevents glucose absorption. Acarbose is another one of those drugs that actually found a survival benefit in the ITP. And it was a very interesting finding because the The thesis for testing. The ITP is a very clever system.[1:21:29] Dr. Peter Attia: Anybody can nominate a candidate to be tested. Then the, you know, the panel over there reviews it and they decide, yep. This is interesting. We'll go ahead and So when I think David Allison nominated, Acarbos to be studied, the rationale was it would be a a caloric restriction mimetic Because you would literally just fail to absorb I don't know. Make up some number.[1:21:49] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? 15 to 20% of your carbohydrates would not be absorbed, And therefore, you would the mice would effectively be calorically restricted.[1:21:56] Andrew Huberman: It would pass them out.[1:21:57] Dr. Peter Attia: That's right.[1:21:57] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:21:57] Dr. Peter Attia: And what happened was really interesting. One, the mice lived longer on acarbos, but 2, they didn't weigh any less. So it it they lived longer, but not through calorie restriction.[1:22:10] Andrew Huberman: That's interesting.[1:22:11] Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. And it the the the speculation is they lived longer because they had lower glucose and lower insulin.[1:22:17] Andrew Huberman: And I don't wanna send this down some rabbit holes here, but are all sorts of interesting ideas about, for instance, that some forms of dementia might be so called type 3 diabetes, the diabetes of the brain, and so things like Metformin, lowering blood glucose, ketogenic diets, etcetera, might be beneficial there. I mean, there's a lot to explore here, and I know you've explored a lot of that on your podcast. I've done far less of that. But, Well, at least it seems that we know the following things for sure. One, you don't want insulin too high nor too low.[1:22:47] Andrew Huberman: You don't want blood glucose too high nor too low. If the buffering systems for that are disrupted, clearly exercise, Meaning regular exercise is the best way to keep that system in check. But in the absence of that To or I would say in addition to that tool, is there any glucose disposal agent, because that's what we're talking about here, metformin, berberine, a carbo set, etcetera, that you take on a regular basis because you have that much confidence in it?[1:23:16] Dr. Peter Attia: The only one that I take is an SGLT 2 inhibitor. So this is a class of drug that is used by people with type 2 diabetes, but which I don't have, but Because of my faith in the mechanistic studies of this drug coupled with its results in the ITP, coupled with the human trial results that show profound benefit in nondiabetics taking it even for heart failure. I think there's something very special about that drug. Actually, was another paper I was thinking about presenting this time. Maybe we'll do that the next time.[1:23:47] Andrew Huberman: But but do you believe in caloric restriction As a way to extend life, or are you more of the do the right behaviors, and that's covered in your book Outlive and elsewhere on your podcast, and buffer blood glucose. Is do you still obviously, you you believe in buffering blood glucose in addition to just doing all the right behaviors Yeah.[1:24:10] Dr. Peter Attia: I think you can uncouple a little bit the buffering of blood glucose from the caloric deficit. So, I think you can be in a reasonable energy balance and buffer glucose with good sleep hygiene, lots of exercise, and just thoughtful eating, without having to go into a calorie deficit. So, you know, it's not entirely clear if Profound caloric restriction would offer a survival advantage to humans even if it were tolerable to most, which it's not. Right? So for most people, it's just kind of off the table.[1:24:39] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? Like, If I said, Andrew, you need to eat 30% fewer calories for the rest of your life[1:24:44] Andrew Huberman: I'll I'll live 30% fewer years. Thank you.[1:24:46] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Yeah. Like, there's just not many people who are willing to sign up for that, so it's kind of a moot point. But the question is, you know, do you need to be fasting all the time? Do you need to be doing all of these other things?[1:24:58] Dr. Peter Attia: And the answer appears to be outside of using them as tools to manage energy balance, it's not clear. Right? And energy balance probably plays a greater role in glucose homeostasis than, from a nutrition standpoint than the individual constituents of the meal. Now that's not entirely true. Like, I can imagine a scenario where a person could be in a negative energy balance eating Twix bars all day and drinking, you know, big gulps.[1:25:29] Dr. Peter Attia: But I also don't think that's a very sustainable thing to do because if by definition, I'm gonna put you in negative energy balance Consuming that much crap, I'm gonna destroy you. Like, you're gonna feel so miserable. You're gonna be starving. Right? You're not gonna be satiated eating Pure garbage and being in caloric deficit.[1:25:48] Dr. Peter Attia: You're gonna end up having to go into caloric excess. So that's why interesting thought experiment. I don't think it's a very practical experiment. For a person to be generally satiated and an energy balance, they're probably eating about the right stuff. But I don't think that the specific macros matter as much as I used to think.[1:26:05] Andrew Huberman: I'm a believer in getting most of My nutrients from unprocessed or minimally processed sources simply because it allows me to eat Foods I like[1:26:16] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah.[1:26:17] Andrew Huberman: And, more of them. And I just love to eat. I I so physically enjoy the sensation of chewing that, you know, I'll just eat cucumber slices for For fun. Yeah. Right?[1:26:27] Andrew Huberman: You know? That's I mean, that's not my only form of fun, fortunately. This is an amazing paper, For the simple reason that it provides a wonderful tutorial of the benefits and drawbacks of this type of work. And I think it's also wonderful because we hear a lot about Metformin, rapamycin, and these antiaging approaches, but I was not aware that there was any study of such a large population of people, so it's pretty interesting.[1:27:00] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. So I think it remains to be seen if, and my patients Often ask me, hey. Should I be on Metformin? And I give them a much, much, much, much shorter version of what we just talked about, and I say, look. If the TAME study, Which should answer this question more definitively.[1:27:14] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? This is taking a group of nondiabetics and randomizing them to placebo versus metformin and studying for specific disease outcomes. If the TAME study ends up demonstrating that there is, a Jira protective benefit of Metformin, I I'll reconsider everything. Right? So I think that's you know, we just have to, I think I'll walk around with the an appropriate degree of humility around what we know and what we don't know, but but I would say right now, the epidemiology, the animal data, My own personal experience with its impact on my lactate production and exercise performance, we could there's a whole other rabbit hole we could go down another time, which is the impact on hypertrophy and strength, which appears to be attenuated as well by Metformin.[1:27:57] Dr. Peter Attia: You know, I'll I'll I'll I still prescribe it to patients all the time if they're insulin resistant, for sure. Still a valuable drug, but I don't think of it as a great tool for the person who's insulin sensitive and exercising a lot.[1:28:10] Andrew Huberman: I can't help but ask this question. Do you think there's any longevity benefit to short periods of caloric restriction? You know, so for instance, I decide to by the way, I haven't done this, but let's say I were to decide to, you know, fast into a 1 meal a day type thing where I'm going to be in a slight caloric deficit, you know, 500 to a 1000 calories for a couple of days and then go back to eating, the way that I ate before, that short caloric restriction slash fast, is there any benefit to it in terms of cellular health? Can you, you know, sort of reset the system? Is there any idea that The the changes, the clearing of senescent cells that we hear about autophagy, that we you know, that you in the short term, you can glean a lot of benefits And then go back to the to your regular pattern of eating and then periodically, you know, once every couple of weeks or once a month, just, you know, fast for a day or 2.[1:29:06] Andrew Huberman: Is there any benefit to that that's that's purely in the domain of longevity? Not because there's all discipline function there. There's a flexibility function. There's probably an insulin sensitivity function. But is there any evidence that it can help us live longer?[1:29:21] Dr. Peter Attia: I think the short answer is no, For two reasons. 1, I don't think that that duration would be sufficient if if one is gonna take that approach. But, 2, Even if you went with something longer like what I used to do. Right? I used to do 7 days of water only per quarter, 3 days per month.[1:29:38] Dr. Peter Attia: So I was, I know. Basically, always like it would be 3 day fast, 3 day fast, 7 day fast. Just imagine doing that all year, rotating, rotating, running. For many years, I did that. Now I certainly believed, and to this day, I would say I have no idea if that provided a benefit.[1:29:55] Dr. Peter Attia: But my thesis was, the downside of this is relatively circumscribed, which is profound misery for a few days. And, what I didn't appreciate the time, which I Obviously, now look back, I didn't realize there's muscle mass lost. You're just it's very difficult to gain back the muscle cumulatively after all of that loss. But my thought was exactly as you said. Like, there's got to be a resetting of the system here.[1:30:19] Dr. Peter Attia: This must be sufficiently long enough to trigger all of those systems. But you're getting at a bigger problem with Jira science, which I'm really hoping the epigenetic field comes to the rescue on. It has not come close to it to date, which is we don't have biomarkers around true metrics of aging. Everything we have to date stinks. So we're really good at Using molecules or interventions for which we have biomarkers.[1:30:51] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? Like, when you lift weights, You can look at how much weight you're lifting. You can look at your DXA scan and see how much muscle mass you're generating. Like, that those are biomarkers. Those are giving you outputs Let's say my input is good or my input needs to be modified.[1:31:07] Dr. Peter Attia: When you take a sleep supplement, you can look at your 8 sleep and go, oh, my sleep is getting better. Like, there's a biomarker. Take Metformin. When you take Rapamycin, when you fast, we don't have a biomarker that gives us any insight into whether or not We're moving in the right direction. And if we are, are we taking enough?[1:31:29] Dr. Peter Attia: We just don't know. So I I often get asked, like, what's the single most important Topic you would want to see more research dollars put to in terms of this space, and it's unquestionably this, as unsexy as it is. Like, who cares about biomarkers? But, like, without them, I don't think we're going to get great answers because you can't do most of the experiments you and I would dream up.[1:31:56] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Well, I'm grateful that you're sitting across the table for me telling me all this and that, everyone can hear this. But, again, we will put a link to the papers, plural, that, Peter just described. And for those of you that are listening and not watching, hopefully, you were able to track the the general, themes and takeaways, and, it is fun to go to these papers. You see these big stacks of numbers, and and it can be a little bit overwhelming.[1:32:21] Andrew Huberman: But, my, additional suggestion on parsing papers is notice that Peter said that he spent you know, he's read it several times. Unlike a newspaper article or or a a Instagram post, with a paper, you're not necessarily going to get it The first time, you certainly won't get everything. So that I I think spending some time with papers for me means reading it and then reading it again a little bit later Or you know?[1:32:46] Dr. Peter Attia: And tell me what period of time. Yeah. I was just about to say, what's your because because I kind of have a way that I do it, but I'm curious as to how you do it. Like, if you're if you're encountering a paper for the first time, What do you have an order in which you like to go through the do do you want do you read it sequentially, or do you look at the figures first? I mean, how do you how do you go through Yeah.[1:33:02] Andrew Huberman: Unless it's an area that I know very, very well where I can, you know, skip to some things, before reading it the whole way through, My process is always the same. And, actually, this is fun because I used to teach a class when I was a professor at UC San Diego, called neural circuits in health and disease, and it was an evening course That grew very quickly from 50 students to 400 plus students, and we would do exactly this. We would parse papers. And, and I had everyone ask What I called the 4 questions, and it wasn't exactly 4 questions, but I have a little 3 by 5 card next to me or a Piece of, 8 and a half by 11 paper, typically. And when I sit down with a paper, I want to figure out what is the question they're asking.[1:33:45] Andrew Huberman: What's the general question? What's the specific question? And I write down the question. Then what was the approach? You know, how do they test that question?[1:33:53] Andrew Huberman: And sometimes that can get a bit detailed. You can get into immunohistochemistry, and they did a, you know, PCR for this. It's not so important, for most people that they understand every method, but it is worthwhile that if you encounter a method Like PCR or, you know, chromatography or fMRI that you at least look up on the Internet what its purpose is. Okay? That will help a lot.[1:34:16] Andrew Huberman: And then it was what they found. And there, you can usually figure out what they believe they found anyway by reading the figure headers. Right? What are you know, figure 1. Here's the header that typically, if it's an experimental paper, it will tell you what they want you to think they found.[1:34:31] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And then I Tend to wanna know the conclusion of the study. And then this is really the key one, and this is the one that, would really distinguish the high performing students from the others. You have to go back at the end and ask whether or not the conclusions, the major conclusions drawn in the paper, are really substantiated by what they found and what they did, and that involves some Thinking. It involves really, you know, spending some time thinking about what what they identified.[1:34:57] Andrew Huberman: Now this isn't something that anyone can do straight off the bat. It's a skill that you develop over time, and different papers require different Formats. But those 4 questions really form the cornerstone of a of teaching undergraduates and, I think, graduate students as well of how to read a paper. And, Again, it's something that can be cultivated, and it's still how I approach papers. So what I do typically is I'll read Title abstract, I usually then will skip to the figures and see how much of it I can digest without reading the text and then go back and read the text.[1:35:30] Andrew Huberman: But in fairness, journals great journals like Science, like Nature's oftentimes will pack so much information, the Cell Press Journals too, into each figure, And it's coded with no definition of the acronyms that almost always I'm into the introduction and results within a couple of minutes wondering what the hell this acronym is or that is. And it's, it's just, yeah, it's just wild how much how much nomenclature there really is. I can't remember. Was it you or was it our Friend Paul Conte when he was here, who said that oh, no. I'm sorry.[1:36:02] Andrew Huberman: It was neither. It was chair of ophthalmology at Stanford, doctor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was a guest on the podcast recently, Who off camera, I think it was, told us that if you look at the total number of words and terms that a physician leaving medical school Owns in their mind and their vocabulary. It's the equivalent of, like, 2 additional full languages of fluency beyond their native language. So you're a trilingual at least. I don't know.[1:36:29] Andrew Huberman: Do you speak a language other than English?[1:36:30] Dr. Peter Attia: Poorly.[1:36:31] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So you're You're you're you're at least trilingual and probably more. So the no one is expected to be able to parse these papers the 1st time through without, you know, substantial training.[1:36:42] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. No. I I I I think that's a that's a great format. And you're absolutely right. I have a different way that I do it when I'm familiar with the subject matter versus when I'm not.[1:36:52] Dr. Peter Attia: Well, again, if I'm reading papers that are something that I know really well, I can basically glean everything I need to know from the figures. And then sometimes I'll just do a quick skim on methods, but I don't need to read the discussion. I don't need to read the intro. I don't need to read anything else. If it's something that I know less about, then I usually do exactly what you say.[1:37:13] Dr. Peter Attia: I try to start with the figures. I usually end up generating more questions, like, what what what do you mean? What it how what is this? How did they do that? And then I gotta go back and read methods, Typically and one of the other thing that's probably worth mentioning is a lot of papers these days have supplemental information that are not attached to the paper.[1:37:32] Dr. Peter Attia: So, You're amazed at how much stuff gets put in the supplemental section, and the reason for that, of course, is that the journals are very, specific on the format and length of a paper. So a lot of the times when you're submitting something, you know, like, if you wanna put any additional information in there, it can't go in the main article. It has to go in the supplemental figure. So even for this paper, there were a couple of the numbers I spouted off that I had to pull out of the supplemental paper. For example, when they did the sensitivity analysis on the, censoring versus non censoring, That that was in the supplemental figure.[1:38:07] Dr. Peter Attia: That was actually not even in the paper we presented.[1:38:10] Andrew Huberman: Will, should we pivot to this other paper?[1:38:13] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah.[1:38:13] Andrew Huberman: It's a very different sort of paper. It's an experimental paper where there's a manipulation. I must say, I love, love, love This paper. And I don't often say that about papers. I'm so excited about this paper for so many reasons, but I wanna give a couple of caveats upfront.[1:38:30] Andrew Huberman: First of all, the paper is not published yet. The only reason I was able to get this paper is because it's on bioRxiv. There's a new trend over the last, I would say, 5, 6 years of people posting the papers that they've submitted to journals for peer review online so that people can look at them prior to those papers being peer reviewed. So there is a strong possibility that the final version of this paper, which, again, we will provide a link to, is going to look different, maybe even quite a bit different than the one that we're going to discuss. Nonetheless, there are a couple of things that make me confident In the data that we're about to talk about, first of all, the group that published this paper is really playing in their wheelhouse.[1:39:10] Andrew Huberman: This is what they do, and they publish a lot of really nice papers in this area. I'm not going to mispronounce, her first name, but I think it's Kyaw Si Gu at, who's at the Econ School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, runs a laboratory there studying addiction In humans and, the 1st off author of the paper is Ofer Pearl. This paper is wild. And I'll just give you a couple of the takeaways first As a bit of a hook to hopefully, entice people into listening further, because this is an important paper. This paper basically addresses how our beliefs About the drugs we take impacts how they affect us at a real level, not just at a subjective level, but at a biological level.[1:39:58] Andrew Huberman: So just to back up a little bit, a former guest on this podcast, doctor Ali Crum, whose name is actually Aliyah Crum, but she goes by Ali Crum, talked about belief effects. Belief effects are different than placebo effects. Placebo effects are really just Category effects. It's okay. I'm gonna give you this pill, Peter, and I'm gonna tell you that this pill is molecule X595 2, and that it's going to make your memory better, and then I give you a memory test.[1:40:27] Andrew Huberman: Right? And your group performs better than the people in the control group who I give a pill to, and I say, This is just a placebo, or there are other variants on this where, people will get a drug and you tell them it's placebo. They'll get a placebo, you tell them it's drug. It's It's a binary thing. It's an on or an off thing.[1:40:45] Andrew Huberman: You're either in the drug group or the placebo group, and you're either told that you're getting drug or placebo. And we know that placebo effects exist. In fact, one of the crueler ones I was never the subject of this, but there was kind of lore in high school that, you know, like, kids would do this mean thing. It's a form of bullying. I really don't like it where, you know, they get some Kid at a party to drink, alcohol free beer, and then that kid would start acting drunk and then they go, gotcha.[1:41:08] Andrew Huberman: You know, it doesn't even have alcohol in it. Now that's a mean joke, and just reminds me of some of the the, the horrors of high school. Maybe that's why I didn't go very often, which I also don't suggest. But no. It, it's a mean joke, but it speaks to the placebo effect.[1:41:22] Andrew Huberman: Right? And there's also a social context effect. So placebo effects are real. We know this. Belief effects are different.[1:41:30] Andrew Huberman: Belief effects are not a or b, placebo or non placebo. Belief effects have a lot of knowledge to enrich One's belief about a certain something that can shift their psychology and physiology one way or the other. And I think The best examples of these really of these belief effects really do come from Ali Crum's lab in the psychology department at Stanford, although some of this work she did prior to getting to Stanford. For instance, If people are put into a group where they watch a brief video, just a few minutes of video about how stress really limits our performance, let's say, at archery or at mathematics or at music or at public speaking. And then you test them in any of those domains or other domains In a stressful circumstance, they perform less well.[1:42:15] Andrew Huberman: Okay? And we know they perform less well because We're by virtue of a heightened stress response. You can measure heart rate. You can measure stroke volume of the heart. You can measure, peripheral blood flow, which down when people are stressed, narrowing a vision, etcetera.[1:42:30] Andrew Huberman: You take a different group of people and randomly assign them to another group where now they're being told that stress enhances performance. It mobilizes resources. It narrows your vision such that you can perform tasks better, etcetera, etcetera, and their performance increases above a control group that receives just useless information[1:42:48] Dr. Peter Attia: Mhmm. Or at[1:42:48] Andrew Huberman: least useless as it relates to the task. So In both cases, by the way, the groups are being told the truth. Stress can be depleting or it can enhance performance. But this is different than placebo because now it's scaling according to the amount and the type of information that they're getting.[1:43:04] Dr. Peter Attia: And and can you give me a sense of magnitude of benefit or detriment that one could experience in a situation like the one you just described?[1:43:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So it's it's striking. They're opposite in direction, so the stress gets Less worse makes you, let's say I think that if we were to just put a rough percentage on this, it would be somewhere between 10 30% worse at performance than the control group, And stress is enhancing is approximately equivalent improvement, so they're in opposite directions. Even more striking is the the studies that, Ali's lab did, and others looking at, for instance, you give people a milkshake, you tell them it's a high calorie milkshake, has a lot of nutrients, and then you measure ghrelin Secretion in the blood. And ghrelin is a marker of hunger that increases the longer it's been since you've eaten, and what you notice is that suppresses ghrelin to a great degree and for a long period of time.[1:43:53] Andrew Huberman: You give another group a shake. You tell them it's a low calorie shake, that it's got some nutrients in it, but that doesn't have much fat, not Much sugar, etcetera. They drink the shake, less ghrelin suppression.[1:44:04] Dr. Peter Attia: And it's the same shake?[1:44:05] Andrew Huberman: And it's the same shake. And satiety lines up with that also in that study. And then the third one, which is also pretty striking, is they took hotel workers. They give them a short tutorial or not, Informing them that moving around during the day and vacuuming and doing all that kind of thing is great, it helps you lower your BMI, which is great for your health, you incentivize them, then you let them out into the wild of their everyday job. You measure their activity levels.[1:44:28] Andrew Huberman: The 2 groups don't differ. They're doing roughly the same task, leaning down, cleaning out trash cans, etcetera. Guess what? The group that was informed about the health benefits of exercise lose 12% more weight compared to the other group.[1:44:42] Dr. Peter Attia: And no difference in actual movement?[1:44:44] Andrew Huberman: Apparently not. Now how could that be? I mean, literally, this was Sparked by, in Ali's words, you know, this was sparked by her graduate adviser saying, what if all the effects of exercise are Deepa. Right? Like, which is which is not what anyone really believes, but it's just such a you know, I love that anecdote, that Ali told us because It just really speaks to how, like, really smart people think.[1:45:08] Andrew Huberman: They sit back and they go, yeah. Like, exercise obviously has benefits, but, like, what if a lot of the benefits are that you tell yourself it's good for you and the brain can actually activate these These mechanisms in the body. And why wouldn't that be the case? Because the nervous system extends through both. So So interesting.[1:45:21] Andrew Huberman: So interesting. Okay. So fast forward to this study, which is really about belief effects, not placebo effects. And to make a long story short, We know that nicotine, vaped, smoked, dipped, or snuffed, or these little zen pouches, or taken in capsule form, does improve cognitive performance. I'm not suggesting people run out and start doing any of those things.[1:45:44] Andrew Huberman: I did a whole episode on nicotine. The delivery device often will kill you some other way or is bad for you, but It causes vasoconstriction, which is also not good for certain people, but nicotine is cognitive enhancing. Why? Well, you have a couple sites in the brain, namely In the basal forebrain, nucleus basalis. In the back of the brain, structures like locus coeruleus, but also this what's called it's got a funny name, the pedunculopontine Time nucleus, which is this nucleus in the in the the pons in the back of the brain, in the brainstem, that sends those little axon wires into the thalamus.[1:46:16] Andrew Huberman: The thalamus is a gateway for sensory information. And in the thalamus, the visual information, the auditory information, it has nicotinic receptors. And when the pedunculopontine nucleus releases nicotine or when you ingest nicotine, what it does is it increases the signal to noise of information coming in through your senses. So the fidelity of the signal that gets up to your cortex, which is your conscious perception of those senses, is increased.[1:46:41] Dr. Peter Attia: And how much endogenous nicotine do we produce?[1:46:44] Andrew Huberman: Oh, well, it's going to be Acetylcholine binding to nicotinic receptors.[1:46:48] Dr. Peter Attia: I see. We're not making nicotine. We're just binding. So this is a this is a nicotinic Acetylcholine receptor. Right.[1:46:53] Andrew Huberman: Of which there are at least 7 and probably, like, 14 subtypes. But Okay. So, Right. They're called nicotinic receptors in an annoying way in the same way that cannabinoid receptors are called cannabinoid receptors, but then everyone thinks, oh, you know, those receptors are there So because we're supposed to smoke pot or those receptors are there because we're supposed to ingest nicotine. No.[1:47:13] Andrew Huberman: The drugs that we use to study those the receptor. That's right. Right. Exactly. Receptor is named after the drug.[1:47:18] Andrew Huberman: And so the important thing to know is that whether or not it's basal forebrain, a pedunculopontine nucleus, or a locus coeruleus that at least in the brain, because we're talking about muscle where acetylcholine does something else via nicotinic receptors. There in general, it just tends to be a signal to noise enhancer. And so for the nonengineering Types out there, no problem. Signal to noise, just imagine I'm talking right now and there's a lot of static in the background. There are 2 ways for you to be able to hear me more clearly.[1:47:44] Andrew Huberman: We can reduce the static or I can Increase the fidelity, the the, volume, and the clarity of what I'm saying. Okay? For instance. And that's really what acetylcholine does. That's why when people smoke a cigarette, they get that boost of nicotine, and they just feel clearer.[1:48:00] Andrew Huberman: It really works. The other thing that happens is the thalamus sends information to a couple of places. First of all, it sends Information to the reward centers of the brain, the mesolimbic reward pathway that releases dopamine. And typically, when nicotine is increased in our system, dopamine goes up. That's one of the reasons why nicotine is reinforcing.[1:48:18] Andrew Huberman: We just like it. It's a we seek it out. I've done beautiful experiments with honeybees even where, know, you put nicotine on certain plants or it comes from certain plants, and they'll forage there more. You get, you know, them kind of, like, buzzed. That was a pun.[1:48:29] Andrew Huberman: Bad pun. In any event, There's also an output from this thing, the thalamus, to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is an area of the forebrain that really allows us To limit our focus and our attention for sake of learning, which allows us to pay attention. This is the circuit[1:48:45] Dr. Peter Attia: You talked about this in your fantastic podcast On stimulants.[1:48:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. On a d h so ADHD typically, ADHD drugs. So things like Adderall, Vyvanse, methamphetamine for that matter, Ritalin.[1:48:59] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Why it's counterintuitive that a stimulant would be a treatment for someone with difficulty focusing.[1:49:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. In young kids who have difficulty focusing, If you give them something they love, they're like a laser. And the reason is that ventromedial prefrontal cortex circuit can Engages when the kid is interested and engaged. But kids with ADD, ADHD tend to have a hard time engaging their mind for other types of tasks, and other types of tasks important for getting through life. And it turns out that giving those stimulant drugs, in many cases, can enhance the function of that circuit And it can strengthen so that, ideally, the kids don't need the drugs in the long run, although that's not often the way that it plays out.[1:49:41] Andrew Huberman: And there are other ways to get at this. You know? There's now a big battle out there. You know? Is ADHD real?[1:49:46] Andrew Huberman: Is it not real? Of course, it's real. Does every kid need ADHD meds? No. Are there other things like nutrition, more playtime outside, etcetera, that can help improve their symptoms without drugs?[1:49:56] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Is the combination of all those things together Known to be most beneficial yes. Are the dosages given too high and generally should be, you know, titrated down? Maybe. Some kids need a lot.[1:50:08] Andrew Huberman: Some kids need a little. I probably just, you know, gained and lost a few enemies there. So, the[1:50:13] Dr. Peter Attia: point is that, these circuits are hardwired circuits. Sorry. One other question, Andrew. If my memory serves correctly, doesn't nicotine Potentially have a calming effect as well, and that seems a bit counterintuitive to the focusing one. Are they is it a dose effect Or a timing effect, how does that work?[1:50:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's a dosing effect. So the interesting thing about nicotine is that it can enhance focus in the brain, but in the periphery, It actually provides some muscle relaxation. Mhmm. So it's kind of the perfect drug if you think about it.[1:50:45] Andrew Huberman: Again, it's it was reflecting on this how when we were growing up, People would smoke on plane they had a smoking section on the plane. You know, people smoke all the time, and now hardly anyone smokes for all the obvious reasons. But, yeah, it provides that Really ideal balance between being alert, but being mellow and relaxed in the body. So, hence, it's reinforcing properties. Okay.[1:51:07] Andrew Huberman: This study is remarkable because what they did is they had people come into the laboratory. They gave them A vape pen. These are these are smokers. So these are, experienced smokers. Typically, there's a washout before they come in so they're not smoking for a bit so they can their system of nicotine, and they measure How[1:51:27] Dr. Peter Attia: long is that needed?[1:51:28] Andrew Huberman: Typically, it's a couple of days.[1:51:29] Dr. Peter Attia: Oh, okay.[1:51:29] Andrew Huberman: Right. Which must be miserable for those because[1:51:32] Dr. Peter Attia: they can't have Nicorette gum or anything.[1:51:34] Andrew Huberman: No. Nothing. They must be dying. And I wonder how many cheat.[1:51:36] Dr. Peter Attia: But they they can measure They measure carbon monoxide. Right?[1:51:39] Andrew Huberman: They measure carbon dioxide, and they're measuring nicotine in the blood as well. They do a good job there. So then what they do is they have them vape, and they're vaping either a low, medium, or High dose of nicotine. The dosages don't really matter, because tolerance varies, etcetera. And then they We're putting them into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine so, where they can look at it's really blood flow.[1:52:03] Andrew Huberman: It's really hemodynamic response. For those of you who wanna know, it's the ox it's the ratio of the oxygenated to deoxygenated blood because when blood blood will flow to neurons that are active To give it oxygen, and then it's deoxygenated, and then there's a change in what's called the bold signal. So fMRI, when you see these, like, hot spots in the brain, is really just looking at blood flow. And then there's some interesting physics around, and I'll probably get this wrong, but I'll take an attempt at it so that I get beat up a little bit by the physicists and juniors. Do you remember the right hand rule?[1:52:32] Dr. Peter Attia: Yep.[1:52:32] Andrew Huberman: Right? Okay. So do I have this right, correct? The right hand rule, if you put your thumb out with your first, with your index finger and middle finger and your thumb facing up, think that the thumb represents the charge, the direction of the charge. Right?[1:52:42] Andrew Huberman: And then isn't the electromagnetic field is the downward facing figure, and then it's, do I have that right? I have to look it up. Actually don't know. Okay. Well, someone will look it up.[1:52:52] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But what you do is when you put a person's head in this big magnet and then you pulse the magnet, What happens is the oxygenate and deoxygenated blood, it interacts with the magnetic field differently, and that Difference in signal can be detected, and you can see that in the form of activated brain[1:53:08] Dr. Peter Attia: areas. Yeah. I mean, MRI all works by proton detection. So, presumably, there's a difference in the Proton signal when you have high oxygen versus low oxygen concentration? Yep.[1:53:18] Andrew Huberman: Yep. That's right. And what they'll do is they'll pulse with the magnet because my understanding is that and this is definitely getting beyond my expertise, but that the the spin orientation of the protons, then it it's it's going to relax back at a different rate as well. So Well, by the relaxation at a different rate, you can also get, not just resting state activation. Like, oh, look at a banana.[1:53:39] Andrew Huberman: What areas of the brain light up? But you can look at Con connectivity between areas and how one area is driving the activity of another area. So very very powerful technique. So what they do is they they put people in a scanner, and then you'll like this because you What[1:53:53] Dr. Peter Attia: what are the what are the limitations of of fMRI Oh. In in terms of I mean, how fine is the resolution? I mean, where are the blind spots of the technique?[1:54:01] Andrew Huberman: So resolution, you can get down to subcentimeter. They talk about it always in these paper as the Pixels, which are these little cubic pixels, things, you know, sub subcentimeter, but you're not gonna get down to millimeter. Okay. There Our number of little compounds that maybe we won't go into now that have been basically worked out over the last 10 years by doing the following. You can't just give somebody a stimulus compared to nothing.[1:54:27] Andrew Huberman: I'll just tell you the experiment. It was discovered, for instance, that when someone would move their right hand because, you know, when you're in the The MRI I just went for one of these recently for a clinical, not a problem, but just for a diagnostics scan. You're leaning back and you and you can move your right hand a bit. And they would see an area in motor cortex lighting up, but what they noticed was that the area corresponding in the left hand was also lighting up. So what you really have to do is you have to look at resting state.[1:54:52] Andrew Huberman: How much are they lighting up[1:54:53] Dr. Peter Attia: just to[1:54:54] Andrew Huberman: rest and then subtract that out. So now you'll always see resting state versus activation state.[1:55:00] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Wasn't there a really funny study Done as a spoof maybe a decade ago that put a dead salmon into an MRI machine and did an f like, they did an fMRI of a dead salmon That demonstrated, like, some interesting signal.[1:55:15] Andrew Huberman: No. I didn't know that, but but it[1:55:16] Dr. Peter Attia: We we got to find this one for the for the show notes.[1:55:19] Andrew Huberman: I we should do one of these wild papers Once there's there are papers of, you know, people putting don't do this, folks. Putting elephants on LSD that were published in science and things like like crazy experiments. We should definitely do a Crazy Experiments journal club. In any event, you can get a sense of which brain areas are active and when with fairly high spatial resolution, fairly high, and pretty good temporal resolution on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Not but it's not ultra ultra fast Because a lot of neural transmission is happening on the, you know, tens of milliseconds, especially when you're in talking about auditory processing.[1:55:54] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So they put people into the scanner, and then they they give them a, essentially, a task that's designed to engage The thalamus, known to engage the thalamus, reward centers, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. And it's a very simple Game, you'll like this because, you have a background in finance. You let people watch a market. You know?[1:56:15] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Here's the stock market or you could say or the the price of Peas, it doesn't really matter. It goes up, it goes down, and they're looking at squiggle line, then it stops. And then they have the option, but they have to pick 1 option. They're either going to invest a certain number of the 100 Units that you've given them, or they can short it.[1:56:31] Andrew Huberman: They can say, oh, it's gonna go down and try and make money on the on the prediction it's gonna go down. You could explain shorting better than I could, For sure. So depending on whether or not they get the prediction right or wrong, they get more points or they lose points, and they're going to be rewarded in real money at the end of the experiment. So this is going to engage this type of circuitry. Now remember, these groups were given a vape pen prior to this where they've vaped What they were told is either a low, medium, or high dose of nicotine, and they do this task.[1:57:03] Andrew Huberman: The goal is not to get them to perform better on the task. The goal is to engage the specific brain areas that are relevant to this kind of error and reward type circuits, and we know that this task does that. So that includes the thalamus, that includes the mesolimbic reward pathway and dopamine, it includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. First of all, they measure nicotine in the blood. They are measuring how much people vaped.[1:57:26] Andrew Huberman: They were very careful about this. One of the nice things about the vape pen for the sake of experiment And not recommending people vape, but they can measure how much nicotine is left in the vape pen before or after. They can measure how long they inhaled, how long they held it in. There's a lot that you can do that's harder to do with a cigarette. Okay.[1:57:43] Andrew Huberman: They measured people's belief as to whether or not they got low, medium, or high amounts of nicotine.[1:57:48] Dr. Peter Attia: And it's They were told[1:57:49] Andrew Huberman: They were told they got a this is a low amount, a medium amount, or a high amount. And then, of course, they looked at brain area activation during this task. And what they found was very straightforward.[1:58:00] Dr. Peter Attia: Sorry. They were all given the same amount?[1:58:02] Andrew Huberman: Yes. This is this is the sneak. I was gonna offer it as a punch line, but that's okay. No. I think that The the cool thing about this experiment is that the subjects are unaware that they all got the exact same amount of relatively low Nicotine containing vape pen.[1:58:16] Andrew Huberman: So they they they basically and they're measuring it from their bloodstream. So they all have fairly low levels of nicotine, But 1 group was told you got a lot, 1 group was told you got a medium amount, and the other was told you got a little bit. Now A number of things happen, but the most interesting things are the following. First of all, people's subjective feeling of Being on the drug matches what they were told. So if they were told, hey.[1:58:41] Andrew Huberman: This is a high amount of nicotine. Like, yeah. It feels like a high amount of nicotine, and these are experienced smokers. If it was a medium amount, they're like, no. That feels like a medium amount.[1:58:49] Andrew Huberman: If it's a low amount, they think it was a low amount. Now that's perhaps not so surprising. That's your[1:58:55] Dr. Peter Attia: just a trick placebo in that sense.[1:58:56] Andrew Huberman: Placebo. Yeah. But if you look at the activation of the thalamus In the exact regions where you would predict acetylcholine transmission to impact the function of the thalamus, so these include areas like called the centromedian nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, the names that really don't matter, but these are areas involved in attention. It scales with what they thought they got in the vape pen. Meaning, if you were told that you got a low amount of nicotine, you got a little bit of activation in these areas.[1:59:26] Andrew Huberman: If you're told that you got a medium amount of nicotine and that's what you've vaped, then you had medium amounts or moderate amounts of Activation. And if you were told you got high amounts of nicotine, you got a high degree of activation, and the performance on the task, believe or not, scales with it somewhat. So keep in mind, everyone got the exact same amount of nicotine in reality. So here, the belief effect isn't just changing what One subjectively experiences, oh, this is the effect of high nicotine or low nicotine. It actually is changing the way that the brain responds to the belief.[2:00:04] Andrew Huberman: And that to me is absolutely wild. Now there are a couple of other things that could have confounded this. First of all, It could have been that if you believe you got a lot of nicotine, you're just faster, or you're reading the lines better, or your response time to hit the button is quicker. Know, I tell you you have a drug that's gonna improve reaction time. You might believe that about nicotine, and so you're quicker on the trigger, and you're getting they have a desperate activation as well.[2:00:27] Andrew Huberman: More activation. There could be they rule that out. They also rule out the possibility[2:00:32] Dr. Peter Attia: How did they rule that out?[2:00:34] Andrew Huberman: By looking at rates of of pressing.[2:00:36] Dr. Peter Attia: And there was no difference?[2:00:36] Andrew Huberman: Nothing. And in the sensory areas of the brain that would that would, represent that kind of difference, they don't see that. The other thing that, is very clear is that the connection between The thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that pathway scales in the most beautiful way such that people that were told they had Smoked a low or vaped a low amount of nicotine, got a subtle activation of that pathway. People that were told that they got a moderate amount of nicotine, got a more robust activation of that pathway, and the people that were told that they got a high amount of nicotine in the vape pen Saw a very robust activation of the thalamus to this ventral prefrontal cortical pathway. Now, of course, this is all happening under the hood of the skull Simply on the basis of what they were told and what they believe.[2:01:23] Dr. Peter Attia: And, technically, the fMRI is showing the activation of those 2 areas, And that's how you can infer the strength of that connection.[2:01:31] Andrew Huberman: That's right. There's a separate method called diffuser tensor imaging, which was developed, I believe, out of the group in Minnesota. Minnesota has a very robust group in terms of neuroimaging, that can measure Activation in fiber pathways. This is not that, but you can look at the timing of activation, and it's a known what we call monosynaptic pathway. So haven't talked so much about figures here, but, I guess if we were gonna look at any 1 figure, and I can just Describe it for the audience that's not paying doesn't have the figure in front of them.[2:02:01] Andrew Huberman: The, let's see. The the most, Probably the most important figure is figure 2. Remember, I said I like to read the titles of figures, which is that the belief about nicotine strength induced a dose dependent Bonds in the thalamus. Basically, if you and figure 2 b, can tell you if they believe that they got more nicotine, that's, that's essentially the response that they that they saw. So if you look or or sorry.[2:02:29] Andrew Huberman: Panel e, if you look at the belief rating As a function of the estimate in thalamus of of what how much activation there was, it's a it's a mess when you look at all the dots at Once, but if you just separate it out by high, medium, and low, you run the statistics, what you find is that there's a gradual increase, but a legitimate one, from Low to medium to high. In other words, if I tell you this is a high dose of nicotine, your brain will react as if it's a high dose of nicotine. Now what they didn't do was give people 0 nicotine. Yeah.[2:03:01] Dr. Peter Attia: I was about to say there's a control that's missing here. Right?[2:03:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So what they didn't do is give people 0 nicotine and then tell them, this is a high amount of nicotine. Sort of the equivalent of the cruel high school experiment.[2:03:12] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah.[2:03:12] Andrew Huberman: No alcohol, but then the the the kid acts drunk. Now in the in the High school example, it's unclear whether or not the kid actually felt drunk or not. It's unclear whether or not They had been drunk previously, if they even knew what it would be like to feel drunk, etcetera, and there's the social context. What I find just outrageous And outrageously interesting about this study is simply that what we are told about the dose of a drug Changes the way that our physiology responds to the dose of the drug. And in and in my understanding, this is the 1st study to ever look at dose dependence of belief effects.[2:03:52] Andrew Huberman: Right? To really and and why would that be important? Well, for almost every study of drugs, you look at a dose dependent curve. You look at Zero low dose, medium dose, high dose. And here, they they clearly are seeing a dose dependent response simply to the understanding of what they expect the drug ought to do.[2:04:14] Andrew Huberman: In other words, you can bypass Pharmacology somewhat. Right?[2:04:18] Dr. Peter Attia: Now look at figure 2 b. Mhmm. Am I reading this correctly? So it's got, Four bars on there, you've got the group who were told they got a low dose, the group who was told they got a medium dose, the group that was told they had a high dose, and then these healthy Controls Right. Who presumably were nonsmokers who were just put in the machine.[2:04:38] Andrew Huberman: That's right. This[2:04:39] Dr. Peter Attia: yeah. Yeah. This is measuring Parameter estimate. What is that referring to, their ability to play the the the the trading game?[2:04:50] Andrew Huberman: The parameter estimate is the is the activation, reward related activities from an independent thalamus mass. Right? So what they're doing is they're just saying, if we just look at the thalamus, what is the level of activation?[2:05:02] Dr. Peter Attia: I see. So this suggests that the only statistical difference was between the low and the high.[2:05:09] Andrew Huberman: That's right.[2:05:10] Dr. Peter Attia: And nobody else was statistically different.[2:05:12] Andrew Huberman: That's right.[2:05:13] Dr. Peter Attia: But that's not the whole story?[2:05:14] Andrew Huberman: No. That's not the whole story. So When you look at the output from the thalamus to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that's where you start to identify the[2:05:24] Dr. Peter Attia: Is that figure 4?[2:05:25] Andrew Huberman: That Is yes. So this is where you see, so figure 4 b, if you look at parameter estimates, so this is the degree of activation between The thalamus in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and it's called the instructed belief. You can see that there's a low, medium, and high scatter of of dots for each, and that each one of those is significant.[2:05:46] Dr. Peter Attia: So isn't it interesting that at the thalamus, which is And you'll you'll immediately appreciate my stupidity when it comes to neuroscience, which is more proximate to the Nicotinamide or nicotine That Nicotinamide, what do you call it? The nicotine acetylcholine receptor, you have a lower difference of signal strength, And somehow that got amplified as it made its way forward in the brain? Yeah. Does that surprise you?[2:06:13] Andrew Huberman: It is surprising, and it surprised them as well. The The interpretation they give again, as we're talking about before, important to match their conclusions against what they actually found, which is what we're doing here. The interpretation that they give is that it doesn't take much nicotinic receptor occupancy in the thalamus to activate this pathway, But they too were surprised that they could not detect a raw difference in the activation of the thalamus. But in terms of its output To the prefrontal cortex, that's when the print show you.[2:06:43] Dr. Peter Attia: Figure 4 b is more convincing than figure 2 because even figure 2 e, If you read the fine print, the r, the correlation coefficient is 0.2. It's not that[2:06:55] Andrew Huberman: strong. Right.[2:06:56] Dr. Peter Attia: It's weak. So at the thalamus, it's kind of like, yeah, there might be a signal. By the way, this goes back to our earlier discussion. There could be a huge signal here and we're underpowered. Howard, how many subjects were in this?[2:07:06] Dr. Peter Attia: You would this you wouldn't have a lot of subjects in this experiment.[2:07:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This no. You it and this just speaks to the general challenge of doing this kind of work. It's hard to get a lot of people in and through the scanner.[2:07:16] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. And it's expensive. I mean[2:07:17] Andrew Huberman: expensive. We have to I should know this, but we can, we can go back to the[2:07:22] Dr. Peter Attia: But you you can sort of just look at the number of dots on here. I mean, it's in the low tens. Right? It's, like, 40, 30, something like that. It's not So it's possible you do this with[2:07:30] Andrew Huberman: a Danish study.[2:07:31] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Yeah. You do this with a 1000 people. This could all be statistically significant.[2:07:35] Andrew Huberman: Right. It was, so they talk about this. Know, based on this, we estimate that an n of 20 and a sample size in each belief condition, the final sample would provide 90% power to detect an effect of this magnitude And an alpha of 0.0.5 and a two tailed, test.[2:07:50] Dr. Peter Attia: Okay. So then that's that's them referring to what we just talked about, which is[2:07:54] Andrew Huberman: The powerhouse.[2:07:54] Dr. Peter Attia: We believe at 90% to get an alpha of 0.05, which means we'll wanna be 95% confidence, we need 60 people, 20 per group. Right. Yeah. But if the difference is smaller than what they expected, they'll miss out on some of the significance, which that looks like they're missing between the medium and high group.[2:08:11] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And I too was surprised that, they did not see a difference in the between the medium and the high group, but they did in the output of the thalamus. I was also surprised that they didn't see A difference. This is kind of interesting in its own right. And figure 3 talks about the belief about nicotine strength did not modulate the reward response, the dopamine response.[2:08:31] Dr. Peter Attia: How was that measured? Also, just in f f MRI flight.[2:08:34] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. So if you look at figure 3 b, other people can't see it, but, basically,[2:08:38] Dr. Peter Attia: Oh, yeah.[2:08:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. What you'll see is that there's no difference between these different groups, in terms of the amount of activation in these reward pathways if people got a low, medium, or High amount of nicotine. Now that actually could be leveraged, I believe. If somebody were trying to quit Nicotine, for instance. And they were going to do that by progressively reducing the amount of nicotine that they were taking, but you told them that it was the same amount From one day to the next, you could whittle it down to, presumably, to a low amount before taking it to 0.[2:09:10] Andrew Huberman: And if they believed it to be a greater amount, then it might actually not disrupt their reward pathways. Meaning, they would feel, presumably, they'd feel rewarded by whatever nicotine they were bringing in.[2:09:22] Dr. Peter Attia: What would be your prediction if this experiment were repeated, but it was done exactly the same way with nonsmokers?[2:09:31] Andrew Huberman: Well, one thing that's sort of, interesting, you asked about art, potential sources of of artifact, problems with fMRI. One of the challenges that they note in this study Was you have to stay very still in the in the machine, but the subjects were constantly coughing because they're smokers. So Okay. So, presumably, the data would be higher fidelity. So I'm chuckling at that one, but I I was like, had to read that one twice.[2:09:54] Andrew Huberman: I was like, oh, that makes sense. They're smokers. They're coughing. They can't stay still, so Movement artifact. But in all seriousness, I think that for people that are naive to nicotine, Even a small amount of nicotine is likely to get this pathway activated to such a great degree, sort of like the first time effect of pretty much any drug.[2:10:14] Dr. Peter Attia: But I wonder if they would be more or less susceptible to the belief system.[2:10:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's a really good question. Right. Because they have no prior to compare it[2:10:24] Dr. Peter Attia: They have no pleasant they have no experience to compare it to with respect to the obviously beneficial effects of nicotine that the smokers are well used to.[2:10:33] Andrew Huberman: So this is the the poor kid that got duped into thinking the nonalcoholic beer was at alcohol, though they're actually the winner we know because they didn't episode an alcohol. Alcohol's bad for you. So in the end, that kid wins and the other ones lose poetic justice. But, that kid having never been actually drunk before, Presumably,[2:10:52] Dr. Peter Attia: we're being more susceptible, potentially.[2:10:55] Andrew Huberman: That's my guess as well. So, You know, my glee for this experiment is not or this paper rather is not because I think it's the be all end all or it's a perfect experiment. I just think it's so very cool that they're starting to explore dose dependence of belief because that has all sorts of implications. I mean, use your imagination, folks. Whether or not we're talking about, a drug, we're talking about a behavioral intervention, we're talking about A vaccine and I'm not referring to any one specific vaccine.[2:11:27] Andrew Huberman: I'm just talking to vaccines generally. I'm talking about psychoactive drugs. I'm talking about, illicit drugs. I'm talking about antidepressants. I'm talking about all the sorts of drugs we were talking about before, Metformin, etcetera.[2:11:42] Andrew Huberman: Just throw our arms around all of it. What we believe about the effects of a drug, presumably, In addition to what we believe about how much we're taking and what those effects ought to be, clearly are impacting at least the way that our brain reacts to to those drugs.[2:12:00] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. It it's very interesting. I mean, when you consider how many drugs that have peripheral effects, or peripheral outputs begin with central issues. So, again, I think the GLP one agonists are such a great example of this.[2:12:15] Andrew Huberman: Ozempic.[2:12:15] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I I don't think anybody fully understands exactly how they're working, but it's hard to argue that they're impacting that the GLP one analog is is having a central impact. It's doing something in the brain that is leading to a reduction of appetite.[2:12:34] Andrew Huberman: We believe that.[2:12:34] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. Yeah. And I think[2:12:35] Andrew Huberman: the mouse data point to different areas of the hypothalamus that are related to satiety Yep. That that let's say, it's at least possible.[2:12:43] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. I mean, the the the, you know, there's no quicker way to make a mouse overeat or undereat than by lesioning its hypothalamus depending on where you do so. Mhmm. Presumably, these drugs work there. But, again, it speaks to, like, what do you need to believe in order for that to be the case?[2:13:00] Andrew Huberman: Have they done placebo trials there where people get Something in their told[2:13:04] Dr. Peter Attia: Oh, they do. I mean, of course, those drugs have all been tested via placebo, and the placebo groups, you know, don't do anywhere near as well. That's how we know that there's activity of the But but, again, there's you know, that's a little bit different than being told you are absolutely getting it. Right? Because in the RCTs, you're just told you might be getting it, you might not be getting it.[2:13:26] Dr. Peter Attia: So it's not quite the same as this experiment. This experiment is is one level up where you're being cold. No. You're absolutely getting it. You're just getting different doses of it.[2:13:35] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. To take this to maybe the ADHD realm, Let's say a kid has been on ADHD meds for a while and the parents for whatever reason, the physician decide they want to cut back on the dosage, but if they were to tell the kid it's the same dosage they've always been taking and it's had a certain positive effect for them, according to the results at least in this paper, which are not definitive but are interesting. The lower dose may be as effective simply on the basis of belief, and and this is the part that makes it so cool To me is that and it's not a kid tricking themselves or the parents tricking the kid so much as the brain Activation is corresponding to the belief. Right? So that's where this No.[2:14:17] Andrew Huberman: It's it's critical. Why because it's done in the brain, I think know, it gets to these kind of abstract, nearly mystical, but not quite mystical aspects of belief effects, which is that, you know, your brain is a prediction making machine. It's a A data interpretation machine, but it's clear that one of the more important pieces of data are your beliefs about How these things impact you. So it's not that this bypasses physiology. People aren't deluding themselves.[2:14:44] Andrew Huberman: The thalamus is behaving as if it's a high dose when it's the same dose as the low dose group. Wild.[2:14:50] Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. I mean, you think I think of the implications, for example, with blood pressure. Right? Like, we don't really understand essential hypertension, which is the majority of people walking around with high blood pressure. It's unclear ideology.[2:15:02] Dr. Peter Attia: So lots of people being treated. How do we know that the belief system about it can't be changed? Mhmm. And, yeah, this is this is I don't know. This is Eye opening.[2:15:14] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's cool stuff. And Alichrome is onto some other really cool stuff. Like, for instance, just to highlight where these belief effects are starting to show up. If you tell a group that the side effects of a drug that they're taking are evidence that the drug really works for the purpose That they're taking it, even though those side effects are kind of annoying, people report the experience as less awful, and they report more relief from the primary symptoms that they're trying to target.[2:15:43] Andrew Huberman: So our our belief about what side effects are[2:15:45] Dr. Peter Attia: That's so[2:15:46] Andrew Huberman: interesting. Can really impact how quickly and how, compatible, we feel about how quickly a drug works, excuse me, and how compatible we feel that drug is with our entire life. So maybe if we call them something else, like not side effects, but, like, additional benefits or something. It's kinda crazy. And you you don't wanna lie to people, obviously, but you also don't wanna send yourself in the opposite direction, which is reading the list of side effects of a drug and then developing all of those side effects, when And then maybe later coming to the understanding that some of those were raised through belief effects.[2:16:21] Dr. Peter Attia: We definitely see that. That's the nocebo effect. Right? That's that's the one we see A lot, you know, with with all sorts of drugs. And it's tough because, you know, how do you how do you know which is which?[2:16:32] Dr. Peter Attia: And, I think there are some people who are really impacted by that, and it makes it very difficult for them to take any sort of pharmacologic agent because they basically They can't help but incur every possible side effect.[2:16:47] Andrew Huberman: Is it or is it true that medical students often will start developing the symptoms of the different diseases that they're learning about? Is that true?[2:16:53] Dr. Peter Attia: Well, you know, I'll tell you. I do think that in medical school, you start to you start to think of the zebras more than the horses all the time. You know? That's crazy. Like, you you know what I'm referring to.[2:17:05] Dr. Peter Attia: Right? You know, you see footprints, you you see hoofprints, you should think of horses, but, of course, medical students, you only think of the zebras. There are some really funny things in medical school. Like, there are certain conditions that you spend so much time thinking about that you have a very warped sense of their prevalence. You know, like, in medical school, there's this condition called sarcoidosis.[2:17:22] Dr. Peter Attia: Like, we I feel like we never stop talking about sarcoidosis. I've seen, like, Three cases in my life. Right? Like, it's just not that common.[2:17:31] Andrew Huberman: Does it provide a great teaching tool or something?[2:17:34] Dr. Peter Attia: I don't know. Like, I just Some of these things I don't know. How much time did we spend talking about situs inversus? This is when people embryologically have a reverse Rotation and everything in their body is flipped. Literally, everything is flipped.[2:17:49] Dr. Peter Attia: I hope. So their heart is on their right side. Their liver is on the left side. Their is on the left side, like and so I'm not making this up.[2:17:56] Andrew Huberman: Common is this?[2:17:58] Dr. Peter Attia: I've never seen it. Okay? I was[2:18:00] Andrew Huberman: thinking about boxing the liver shot. Like, it's so you could easily be going for the wrong side of the body.[2:18:04] Dr. Peter Attia: No. I swear to god. Like, as a medical student, if you were told someone had left Sided lower quadrant pain to which the answer is almost assuredly that they have diverticulitis. You'd think, they could have appendicitis in the context of situs and versus. Like, the fact that that would even register in the top 10 things that it could possibly be.[2:18:23] Andrew Huberman: Wild.[2:18:24] Dr. Peter Attia: But, yes, you just have a totally warped sense of what's out there.[2:18:26] Andrew Huberman: Oh, man. Well, this has been pure pleasure for me. I don't know about you. I don't know about our listeners, but for me, this is Among the things that I just delight in and and even more so because you're the one across the table for me teaching me about incredible findings. And Like like lawyers.[2:18:45] Andrew Huberman: And the and the gaps in those findings, which are equally incredible because they're equally important to know about. Yeah.[2:18:50] Dr. Peter Attia: So let's do this again in Austin.[2:18:52] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. Next Time on your home court.[2:18:54] Dr. Peter Attia: Very well. And bring a little bit of that dew if you've got it. Oh, yeah. Yeah.[2:18:58] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'll bring a low, medium, and high level. Medium and high diverse. I wanna know.
