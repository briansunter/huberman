Kronikle AI - Dr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals | Huberman Lab Podcast - TranscriptDr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals | Huberman Lab Podcast - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Maya Shankar. Doctor Maya Shankar is a cognitive scientist who did her undergraduate training at Yale University, her PhD thesis at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and a postdoctoral fellowship also in Cognoscience at Stanford University. Doctor Shankar also served as a senior adviser to the White House, And she founded and served as the chair of the White House behavioral science team.[0:00:38] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Shankar is also the host of her own podcast entitled A Slight Change of Plans. And indeed, doctor Shankar herself is no stranger to having to make major changes to one's life plans. As you'll learn today, Prior to all those incredible accomplishments that doctor Shankar has achieved, she was a student at the Juilliard Conservatory of Music preparing her life to become a professional concert violinist. But as you'll also soon learn, she then experienced a career devastating injury, forcing herself to have to reframe everything about her life plans and her own identity. And that's really what we talk about today.[0:01:15] Andrew Huberman: We talk about identity, Not just doctor Shankar's prior and current identities, but, of course, your identity. We pose a number of questions geared toward getting you to ask, who am I really? Do my goals align with who I am and what I want? Doctor Shankar shares with us the research on identity, goals, motivation, and plans, as well as many practical tools to answer those key questions that guide us down either the correct or incorrect trajectories in life. She shares with us, for instance, how to assess on paper goals of the sort that you would see on a CV, so which school, which job, which salary, which spouse, etcetera, etcetera.[0:01:54] Andrew Huberman: And how to relate those to the deeper feelings that relate to one's ability to continually pursue A given goal, knowing that it's the right goal for us. We also talk about the science of feelings, what they can and cannot tell us, And when they should or should not serve, as a compass for guiding our everyday and longer term decisions. By the end of today's episode, you will realize That doctor Shankar is essentially handing you a science supported road map for how to determine and assess your identity And goals and how one influences the other. That is how your identity influences your goals and how your goals influences your identity in becoming the person that you want to be. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:02:42] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort To bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison. Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes and with guests about the need to get approximately 1 gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition.[0:03:13] Andrew Huberman: Now there are many different ways that one can do that, but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that by ingesting Excessive calories. Maui Nui Venison has the highest density of quality protein per calorie, and it achieves that In delicious things like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth. I particularly like the ground venison. I make those into venison burgers Probably 5 times a week or more. I also like the jerky for its convenience, especially when I'm traveling or I'm especially busy with work, And know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient dense high quality source of protein.[0:03:47] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison, you can go to Maui Nui Venison .com/huberman and get 20% off your 1st order. Again, that's Mauinui venison.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covered with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. Sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.[0:04:11] Andrew Huberman: When we're sleeping well and enough, everything in life goes much better. And when we aren't sleeping well or long enough, things in life get worse. We know that from data. We all know that from our own experience. One of the essential things to getting a great night sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment needs to be such That your core body temperature drops by about 1 to 3 degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, and then increase by 1 to 3 degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning.[0:04:38] Andrew Huberman: With 8 Sleep smart mattress covers, you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment so that it's ideally matched to your temperature needs. I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover a few years ago, and it has completely transformed the quality of the sleep that I get. So much so that I actually loathe traveling because I don't have my 8 Sleep Mattress cover when I travel. If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman, and you'll save up to $150 off their pod three cover. 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia.[0:05:08] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's 8 sleep.com/huberman. Now for my discussion with doctor Maya Shankar. Welcome. So happy you're here.[0:05:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: Thanks, Andrew. It's great to be here.[0:05:18] Andrew Huberman: I have a lot of questions about identity, about goals and motivation, and about change in general. But I'd like to start off with identity. Mhmm. And I'd like to divide it into 2 segments. The first is how we form an identity, And, you know, we'll get into your story in, I hope, a bit or more detail.[0:05:42] Andrew Huberman: But when we're younger, We tend to ask questions about ourselves, but also about the world around us. We wanna learn what our parents do for a living, what The workers on the street are doing that for, etcetera. How much of our early identity do you think is formed by observation of what we are doing versus observation and labels of the people that are around us and closest to us.[0:06:09] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. It's a great question. I think a lot of it is based on what we see around us and what we see, is deemed successful and and society privileges. And there's a concept called identity foreclosure where, actually, when you're young, right, it's not just that you're observing what your parents are doing or what your peer group is doing. They impose their own structures on you.[0:06:32] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so what that can do is it can really limit your mindset in terms of what it is that you Want to achieve and what it is that you're capable of achieving. And so oftentimes, when people experience identity foreclosure, they had to take a lot of Active steps to overcome whatever biases or limitations they experienced as a young person, given what they were projected To do or believe. Right? So identity, you know, can be about what you do. It can also be about what you believe in the world.[0:06:59] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? And so a lot of those belief systems are also passed on. You inherit belief systems from the people, that surround you when you're young. And if there's one thing that I've learned, it's that we we tend to put a huge premium on What it is that we do, we tend to define ourselves by what we do. And you can see this in the questions we ask young children.[0:07:20] Dr. Maya Shankar: What do you wanna be when you grow up? Right? We never say, who do you wanna be when you grow up? What kind of person do you wanna be when you grow up? We say, what do you wanna be?[0:07:28] Dr. Maya Shankar: And The consequence of that kind of mindset is that we end up anchoring our identities very firmly to what it is that we do. And I Certainly, you know, we're talk you were alluding to my personal story. Right? I started playing the violin when I was a little kid, 6 years old, became absolutely obsessed. And for the large part of my childhood, I was first and foremost a violinist.[0:07:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: I mean, if I had met you, I'd be like, hey, Andrew. I'm a violinist, and then the second would be, I'm Maya. That's how tethered my identity was to to being a violinist. And then fast forward to when I'm a teenager, you know, I have these Huge dreams of of going pro and and becoming, you know, yeah, just like a, hopefully, a professional violinist for the rest of my life, and then I tear a tendon in my hand. My dreams end overnight, and suddenly, there's this profound loss of identity.[0:08:21] Dr. Maya Shankar: Because what I hadn't realized is that in losing the violin, sure, I was losing the ability to play the instrument, but I was actually losing a huge part of who I was. And that was so destabilizing and so disorienting for me because when you define yourself by the what, then as soon as the what goes away, you're like, oh my gosh. Who the hell am I? Right? What do I do?[0:08:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: What what value do I bring to the world? And what I experienced at the time is known in, cognitive science as Identity paralysis. Maybe you felt this way during various transitions in your life, but, basically, Who you are and what you're about is suddenly called into question, and you end up feeling really stuck. Right? You you don't see You don't have the courage to imagine what a future could look like.[0:09:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I certainly fell prey to identity paralysis, and it took me a long time to kind of Figure out what my path would look like moving forward, but I learned a really valuable lesson from That very formative experience I had would change about how it is that I should define myself. And for what it's worth, I I don't think our desire as Humans do have identities is going anywhere. We're not gonna be able to dispose of identities, and we shouldn't because our self identities bring us So much meaning and purpose in our lives. Right? You're a podcaster.[0:09:38] Dr. Maya Shankar: I'm a podcaster. You're a scientist. I'm a scientist. These things are actually really helpful and motivating. We don't wanna do away with identities altogether, but what we can be more particular about is what we anchor our identities to.[0:09:51] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I have learned in my adult life to anchor my identity to why I do the things I do rather than what I do. And I found this to be a much more durable, reliable relationship. So to make this concrete, let's think about the violin. Right? Sure.[0:10:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: I loved playing. I loved how music sounded. I love the way the violin felt. But when I stripped away all the superficial features of the violin, what I really, really loved and was so drawn to as a young child, was the Emotional connection that I could form through my music. So that might have been with my orchestra mates, my chamber musician friends, playing, solo and and performing in front of an audience, and and, ideally, we all feel something new that we haven't felt before.[0:10:39] Dr. Maya Shankar: I mean, it's kind of an intoxicating feeling when you're little to have the ability to inspire new feelings in people. Right? And I was so drawn to human connection. And when I realized that human connection was at the heart of what it is that drives me as a person. Right?[0:10:56] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, what lights me up every single day is a desire to connect with others, to understand, other people to understand their psychology, to understand how their minds work. Then when the violin was taken away from me, Even in terms of narrative I tell myself about my life, I could still find that same core underlying feature elsewhere, and I have been able to. Right? I found it, as an academic, as a cognitive scientist who studies the science of connection and and emotion, I've seen it I've seen that connection play out in the in the work that I did in public policy when I was at the White House, obviously, with my podcast, A Slight Change of Plans, you you're forming these intimate connections with people every day. And so Even though it feels in my life like I've done such disparate things, right, there actually is a powerful through line, that connects all of them, And that is my desire to connect emotionally.[0:11:47] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so what I would recommend to people who are listening, especially even the they're in the throes of change and they're feeling destabilized by that Threat to identity, that loss of identity, is to try to figure out what their through line is. Right? Like, what are the underlying features of the things that you used to do that you absolutely loved, And can you find the expression of that elsewhere?[0:12:09] Andrew Huberman: I love that, and I have so many questions. The first one relates back to childhood identities and how we often can project onto children what they are likely to become. I see that as mostly benevolent. You know? You, you observe a child playing with trucks in the sandbox, and And we say, oh, you know, they're gonna become a contractor.[0:12:32] Andrew Huberman: We tend to project, roles that are fairly high up the within occupation hierarchy. Right? We we sort of like any parents, you know, you you wish for the the best possible life for your kids. But I can see the the perils of doing that, if then the kid starts to think, well, that's what I'm bound to become because it it is restrictive. I also am fascinated by the fact that when we are adolescents and teens, there's a tendency to ask questions about identity.[0:13:02] Andrew Huberman: Like, who am I?[0:13:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[0:13:04] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I don't know many 40 year olds that say, who am I at, you know, at one's core, one's essence. And we might change careers, change relationships, change geographies, you know, all sorts of things. But there must be something going on in the brain In those adolescent and teen years, that forces this question of self, of, you know, who am I? And teenagers are notorious for trying on different Uniforms, different friend groups, different behaviors as a way to sort that out, sometimes in ways that support them and then sometimes in ways that act as pitfalls. So I'm curious about, what's known about how we develop our own identity Yeah.[0:13:45] Andrew Huberman: From the inside out as well as from the outside in.[0:13:48] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. No. It's that that's really interesting, and it's also something I'm very curious about. I mean, we know from neuroscience research that There are significant changes that the brain undergoes during puberty and, you know, other periods of adolescence, and and the Primary change that we see is a desire for independence. And so one reason why we see teenagers grappling With this question of who I am is that they're actually breaking from these structures that they grew up around.[0:14:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? The imposed Structures. Right? The identity foreclosure that they might have experienced and are starting to figure out for the 1st time or wanting to ask the question for the 1st time, Who do I wanna be? What do I want to do outside of the systems that I've grown up in?[0:14:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I think this is one of the primary reasons why we find that during teenage years, this this sort of question is asked more commonly. I think that one challenge that, We can we can face because you you you you said this one word that really caught my attention, which was what's my essence? And, you know, one of the things I studied as a cognitive scientist is Psychology of what's called essentialism. So our underlying belief that there are essential qualities to people that are immutable. And there's lots of studies with, you know, young children and adults showing that we really believe that people do have these essences.[0:15:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? And Unclear what that even means from a in in a metaphysical sense. I don't know what that would even mean. But I think that the challenge in believing that we have essences is that it leads us to believe that there are these truly immutable states about ourselves that are that we're incapable of changing. And I think this can give rise to feelings of shame, for example.[0:15:32] Dr. Maya Shankar: So what is shame? Shame is not the feeling, oh, I did something bad. Shame is the feeling I am bad. Right? It's not that I lost at something.[0:15:41] Dr. Maya Shankar: I failed at something. It's that I'm a loser. I'm a failure. And so the problem when we try to figure out the essence piece is that it doesn't give you the kind of malleable way of thinking that Actually, there might not be something that's so defining about you that you're incapable of changing. As humans, maybe all we are are collections of behaviors and thoughts.[0:16:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? And there's nothing more to it than that. And I find that way of thinking a bit more freeing when it comes to who we are because I think it allows for I think it allows us to cultivate more of a growth mindset. I think it prevents us from engaging in these very harmful self narratives that a lot of people tend to have about themselves. I mean, Probably a lot of people listening to your podcast are self critical.[0:16:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: I'm a very self critical person. We're we listen to this because we wanna improve. You know, I'm a fan of your show because I wanna be better and I wanna improve, but that also is often accompanied by a lot of self parading and questioning of self. Right? And so, Yeah.[0:16:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: I think I've just tried to have a slightly more capacious understanding of of who I am and also recognizing that there might not really be these essential features that are that are immutable. I don't know if you resonate with this notion of, like, the essence like, the desire to feel that we have essences.[0:16:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I used the word essence without thinking, too carefully about exactly what I meant, but what I what I, what I I'm trying to say when I said essence, is, you know, as a child, I did certain things, And I enjoyed some of them. I didn't enjoy others, and I really disliked others. Mhmm. A a very famous neuroscientist who's at Cal named Marcus Meister, people literally refer to him as the great Marcus Meister, once said, and I totally subscribe to the fact that neural circuits in the brain, basically, divide our sensory experience along the dimensions of yum, yuck, and meh.[0:17:30] Andrew Huberman: There's not a lot of in between.[0:17:32] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[0:17:32] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because the circuits ultimately have to drive either forward movement toward more. Yeah. Right? Appetitive behaviors as in nerd speak or aversive, you know, leaning out.[0:17:43] Andrew Huberman: I don't want that. Or just kind of a a a neutral response. So yum yuck and meh[0:17:47] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[0:17:48] Andrew Huberman: Seems to be the, the trinary Response. And there is this component of childhood, I think, where we are foraging naturally using our senses, Experiencing yum yucks and mez and hearing yum yucks and mez from our parents. That's good. That's bad. That's whatever.[0:18:07] Andrew Huberman: It's neutral. But at some point, I certainly have had the experience and I've observed others, I think, having the experience of feeling something that's On a different dimension entirely, which is this notion of delight, which is that it it sort of fills your body with a sense of so much Yum. That it gives you energy to do so much more of it in a way that that is, Almost on a different plane. And and I'm not trying to be, you know, spiritual or metaphysical about it, but it feels distinctly different. And I don't know what it represents, But I think that's that, that piece that perhaps even as a scientist, I don't really need to assign a neural circuit to.[0:18:48] Andrew Huberman: Sure.[0:18:49] Dr. Maya Shankar: So Do you think what you're describing in part is the feeling of awe? Like, when you talk about delight, do you think part of it is is a feeling of awe?[0:18:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Like, the 1st time I went to New York City as a 6 year old kid, I remember thinking, and I still feel every time I'm there, I can't believe this place exists. It's like a it's like a human tropical reef. Like, everywhere you look, there's life. So that was that was awe and delight, although I saw some things this was New York in the seventies, and there were some things like Times Square in the seventies.[0:19:15] Andrew Huberman: Right? If anyone's seen that show, Deuces, I went it's like it looked like that. It was especially as a young kid, it was kinda aversive. Yeah. So it wasn't always odd at but the delight of for me was In learning and certain animals and certain things for you as the violin, and I and I wanna make sure that I[0:19:30] Dr. Maya Shankar: And awe, by the way, I mean, it can be aversive. Right? So awe isn't necessarily I think in the Western world, we think of awe inspiring experiences as having a positive emotional valence, but they can also have a negative emotional valence. So, the 2 criteria for satisfying and awe inspiring experience, and a lot of this work comes from Dacher Keltner, professor at UC Berkeley. Yeah.[0:19:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: Is, 1, there should be some element of perceived vastness. This is all ref this is all reference dependent. So it's all based on your own frame of mind. Right? But there's this sense of, like, mystery and wonder at just how vast either the physical apparatus is.[0:20:05] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? Like, Times Square, it's this massive, you know, set of Buildings and it kind of overwhelms your senses because of all the lights and sounds that are hitting, your visual system and your auditory system. There's also conceptual vastness, so we can feel awe when we, feel the delight of a new scientific discovery. Right? Or In my case, like, for the 1st time reading a book about how the mind works, I just remember marveling at this organ and just being completely in awe of how it works.[0:20:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: And then the 2nd criteria for an awe inspiring experience with I which I think might have been met as well when you were in this when when you were in New York is What's called a need for accommodation. So it's just a fancy way of saying that we have a certain mental model of the world. And typically, in the Presence of awe, we need to assimilate this new information with our existing model because it challenges it in some way. And, it makes us It actually leads us to have more open minds because we have to we realize, wait a second. I have this existing vision of, like, what the world is like, and now I'm experiencing this new thing, and I need to kinda make it work.[0:21:09] Dr. Maya Shankar: I need to integrate it with my existing understanding of the world, and that's the mind blowing part of it. Right? But I absolutely I mean, I remember My childhood experience kind of mirroring your experience in New York was I was, I was 12 years old or maybe 11 years old. I was at a summer music camp. It was late at night.[0:21:26] Dr. Maya Shankar: I had my Discman, which is how we listen to things back in the day.[0:21:30] Andrew Huberman: I recall.[0:21:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: I had a CD in there. It was the Beethoven Violin Concerto by Aan Sophie Mueter. And I was I was like, I was so young, Andrew, so I still Don't know how to use words to describe how it is that I felt something that was so powerful and so transcendent. But I remember listening to the 1st movement of the smiling concerto, and it consumed me. I mean, I felt chills Up and down my spine, my heart would race along with the melody.[0:22:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: It felt otherworldly. Right? And I think that was kind of what you're getting at before where it's like, it's just It's it's it's this altered state of mind, and I what I the language I've used since to code that experience is that it was an awe inspiring experience because I think both things Right? I I was all I was in I was impressed by the vastness of the experience that also sent me through time in this interesting way, you know, back to, like, the Time of Beethoven. Right?[0:22:26] Dr. Maya Shankar: So so vastness can exist along a temporal horizon, and then the need for accommodation, which was you know, I I didn't study cognitive science at this point, I remember thinking, I cannot believe a collection of musical notes arranged just so can make me feel this way. And then if you were to tweak it just slightly, just like take the e flat and move it down the down the stream a little bit, emotional resonance completely gone from the passage. And there was just something so simple and magical about that realization. So, anyway, resonate with with this kind of delight and awe experience that you described.[0:23:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm so glad you you describe it that way. You know? This isn't a discussion about my experience, but for me, I realize now that New York was awe inspiring. Mhmm.[0:23:11] Andrew Huberman: Prior to that, the only thing similar was Discovering animal specialization, something I'm still fascinated by. The sensory systems of animals and how they experience the world and how humans experience the world. And then ultimately, it was, Well, then I went into skateboarding and that whole landscape and then eventually into the neuroscience. Yeah. The difference between the New York experience of awe, And I do think that's what it was.[0:23:36] Andrew Huberman: And biology, animals, and eventually neuroscience[0:23:39] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[0:23:40] Andrew Huberman: Is that like your experience with music and realizing that the movement of a note could change something fundamentally. When it came to learning about biology and neuroscience, I felt not just awe, but a sense of delight in that I felt there was a place for me there.[0:23:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes.[0:23:57] Andrew Huberman: And what and what came out of what you just described really, Really, resonated in terms of this moving of a note because it took something from a passive experience, I believe, of That's this incredible thing over there. Like, New York City was awe, but I didn't see myself having any kind of, verb state within it that would change it or alter it in how it is or for me. Whereas with music for you or I think neuroscience, when I realized that you could do experiments, You could actually do some sort of manipulation and through that, hopefully, unveil something fundamental about how the brain works. I thought there's a place for me here. Yeah.[0:24:36] Andrew Huberman: And so I think there's something about the, the experience of something just from a raw sensory perspective, Music or animals or neuroscience in the examples we're using here, but then realizing that there's a verb state of self, like, that I could enact something within it that could give me more of that. Whereas I think when as a young kid in New York City, I I just didn't feel any way that I could plug into it except in a Massive way. Yeah. Because it's the difference between a kid who and this wouldn't have been me, who sees a game of soccer or football or baseball or watches the Olympics and goes, that is amazing. Mhmm.[0:25:09] Andrew Huberman: And the kid that that says, I'm gonna go do that. In fact, I could do that, and I could maybe do that even better or even half as well. And so, the delight, I think, is in the the possibility of of engagement of an and and I'm fascinated. You know, a friend of mine who's a trauma therapist, doesn't he's not a neuroscientist. He always says, you know, nouns are just very slow verbs, but verbs are far more exciting because they create this anticipatory activity.[0:25:34] Andrew Huberman: Anyway[0:25:35] Dr. Maya Shankar: No. I I love before you move on from that, I love that you said that because you're helping me realize something really important about how I saw my role as a violinist. And In a you know, I I'm never gonna modify the notes on the page because, obviously, I'm gonna be faithful to what Beethoven wrote.[0:25:51] Andrew Huberman: This is what made you a great musician and me a by the way, I was a failed violinist. They pulled me out of it because the neighbor's dogs howled. I I was in Suzuki method.[0:26:00] Dr. Maya Shankar: I was in Suzuki too. Yeah.[0:26:02] Andrew Huberman: Terrible at it That they literally made me stop playing music just to just to protect the neighborhood.[0:26:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: That's adorable. And, I mean, we'll talk about the science of quitting maybe later, but that was a great choice for you. I I but what I'm realizing is that there was that element of defining self through the pursuit of the instrument, and, I saw a place for myself exactly like you did, where I thought, I decide how this phrase unfolds. I decide how much vibrato I use. I decide exactly what the angling of my bow is and the cadence and the pacing and the emotion that I bring to the experience.[0:26:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: And when you see a place for yourself, and that takes an awe inspiring experience and then tran and, actually, There's a translation process where you become something bigger than what you thought you could be. And, actually, it's so interesting you mentioned this, Andrew, because I've I've been Chatting recently with a guy named Reginald Dwayne Betts, and he spent 9 years in prison, and he's now a internationally renowned scholar. So, he committed a carjacking when he was 15 years old, and then went to an adult prison for 9 years. And[0:27:12] Andrew Huberman: As a 15 year old[0:27:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: As a he just turned 16 by the time he got his sentence. Yeah. It was totally wild.[0:27:17] Andrew Huberman: Brutal.[0:27:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: And, He he actually talks about the fact that, you know, there was this underground library in the prison system, and He didn't know what he could be in the prison, what identity he could take on, when everyone seemed to be defined by What crime they have committed. Right? It it it felt like his imagination was so limited to to the and and talk about identity paralysis. Right? I mean, like, You're denied all your basic freedoms in this environment.[0:27:47] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? So you really don't even have the ability to imagine what more you could be. So one day, he gets a book, called the black poets, and In in the book, he read a poem by Etheridge Knight who had also spent time in prison and written this incredibly stirring poem about the criminal justice system. And, he goes by Dwayne, but what Dwayne shared with me is he said, I was I was all inspired by what I was reading, but the most important thing that happened in reading that book and understanding the author's history is that it gave me something to be. I saw a place for myself in this world, and he be he wrote, I mean, he was so prolific.[0:28:28] Dr. Maya Shankar: He wrote, like, a 1000 poems in the year after he stumbled upon this book, and he ended up winning the MacArthur Genius Award. He went to Yale Law I mean, he's just crushed it ever since. But I think he's stumbled upon a really important point, which is awe there's a fascinating science of awe and all the benefits can confer to our well-being, but it can also serve as an entry point to helping to define our identities in new places, and I just love that. I think that's a it's a wonderful way to think about it.[0:28:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. When we see ourselves, entering the sphere of experience that, is con is evoking I do think it's something about it converts to this delight. Although, I have to acknowledge that language is insufficient to describe A lot of what we're referring to. Right? There's a that, you know, the even the most reductionist language of biology, can't grab the, higher order emotions and complexity.[0:29:25] Andrew Huberman: Not yet, anyway. We just don't have a a language for it. I'd like to talk more about the violin. Yeah. Not just because I failed miserably at the violin, but, actually, I figured out pretty early on I wasn't going to be a musician.[0:29:37] Andrew Huberman: I still have absolutely no ability to read music. I can memorize lyrics very easily, but and I love music, and I love classical music, as well as other forms of music, but Zero musical talent. You, on the other hand, got quite good at violin. It was interesting for me to learn that The violin was a bit of a rebellious choice for you given your your family history, and you and I do both share this, So a fairly unusual, fact that both of our fathers are theoretical physicists. So did you feel pressured to be a Scientist or something else, and being a musician, was that initially looked at as, you know, a route to poverty or or a or a bad choice?[0:30:19] Andrew Huberman: Or were your parents a bit more cautious? Like, oh, okay. That that's great, but maybe make that a supplement to your other studies and pursuits.[0:30:26] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So I'm the youngest of 4 kids and Kinda stereotypically, my 3 older siblings were total math whizzes. They were, you know, taking the SAT when they were when they were very young because they were so talented. But I think one antagonist to some of those cultural forces is that my mom, when she had grown up in India, had felt very stifled by her environment. Like, as a young woman who is Very capable and very smart.[0:30:49] Dr. Maya Shankar: I mean, she majored in physics. She was mostly, you know, Kept to the spaces of domestic chores, occasional singing lessons, but mostly her job was like, do your homework and then help with cooking, right, and cleaning and whatnot. And so when she moved to this country with my dad in the 19 seventies, she was actually very excited. Was 21 years old, by the way. So long story short, she'd met my dad 20 days prior to their getting married, so it's an arranged meeting.[0:31:20] Dr. Maya Shankar: And, my dad is, doing, his postdoc at Harvard in in physics at the Society of Fellows, and my mom just joins him after a winter break, in the dorm and everyone's like, hey, man. How was your break? And there's like, I went snowboarding, and I went, whatever, to to Tahoe. And my dad's like, I got married. And so, this new couple arrives, and my mom was so lonely in this country.[0:31:43] Dr. Maya Shankar: I mean, this is before you could text your parents overseas or use a WhatsApp group. She can only handwrite letters to her family back home, and her her goal was, you know what? I'm gonna create a little army around me in the form of children. So she had 4 kids, And she was absolutely intent on exposing us to as many extracurricular activities as she could. So I have 2 older brothers, and I have an older sister, Especially her girls.[0:32:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: She said, you can do whatever you want. I'm a give you you know, lay the land when you're young. But when you find something that you're passionate about. I really wanna give you the opportunity to explore it. So I think I really benefited from the fact that she had been denied that kind of exposure And the ability to pursue her her dreams artistic or otherwise, and so she was really hell bent on making sure, that we kids were able to.[0:32:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: Think they were I mean, my older 3 siblings played musical instruments, so, like, clarinet, trumpet, flute. I think they were surprised by my affinity for it because When I was 6, my mom brought down my grandmother's violin from the attic, so my grandmother had played Indian classical music. So that's where she where you're sitting cross legged on the floor and your violin's facing the ground. A very different style of music, but as like a parting gift, my grandmother had given it to my mom and said, hey. Bring this with you to the US.[0:32:55] Dr. Maya Shankar: So she opened the instrument that day, and I just instantly fell in love with it. And, I asked very quickly for a quarter sized violin of my own. And while my parents had to nudge me to do all sorts of things, they really never had to push me to practice, which felt Extraordinary at the time. Like okay. Clearly, the violin is something that Maya has intrinsic motivation for because how is it that we're not asking her to have to practice all the time?[0:33:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: Similar to you, actually, Andrew, I never to this day, I have a really hard time reading music, so I never I was a terrible sight reader. I I couldn't if you put a piece of music in front of me, I would not be able to tell you probably what it would sound like today. I learned entirely by ear. I started with the Suzuki method, which as you know is entirely by ear, and then, I had an extremely, Very kind, awesome, but very inexperienced teacher. I was his 1st student.[0:33:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: My mom went backstage at a symphony concert in New Haven, which is where I grew up, And just asked the concert master, like, hey. Will you teach my daughter? And he's like, sure. Never taught anyone before, but I'll give this a go. And so we just made things up along the way.[0:34:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: I mean, he would play stuff, and I would mimic it, and I would let my emotions and my, you know, whatever innate musicality guide me. And, eventually I mean, I think what that did actually is really interesting from a skill building perspective. My technique absolutely suffered in the long term from not Having a more structured approach, but I was able to fall in love with this endeavor much more quickly than other kids who had drill sergeants that were forcing them to, like, Practice their scales every day and practice a twos. I mean, that stuff is so boring. Right?[0:34:35] Dr. Maya Shankar: And when you're a little kid, you just wanna bang your head against the wall when you're put up against that when there's so much So many barriers to actually enjoying the the fun parts, which are actually playing the pieces. So the one kind of fun aside about my musical journey is I got to jump straight to the fun stuff, And I think that helped me cultivate a much more natural love of of the instrument.[0:34:54] Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. With AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one.[0:35:25] Andrew Huberman: I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better, and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer a g one. If you'd like to try a g one, go to drink a gone.com Slash Huberman to claim a special offer. From now until August 12, 2023, AG one is giving away 10 free travel packs Plus a year supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:35:49] Andrew Huberman: Again, if you go to drink a gone.com/huberman, you can claim the special offer Of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two. The intrinsic motivation part is so key. I've talked a few times before on the podcast about this, I think now famous study that was done at, Bing Nursery School at Stanford where they observed what kids did during free time, and then they rewarded them or didn't reward them, and then they Later remove the rewards, and the essential takeaway is that, receiving rewards for something that a child was initially intrinsically motivated to do undermined some of that intrinsic motivation. So I have to wonder whether or not, the fact that your parents neither encouraged nor discouraged your violin playing might have allowed you to fully Brass and and lean into your intrinsic motivation as opposed to, for instance, in my case, there is, we are distantly related, not closely related, but there is a a great violinist by the name of Bronislav Huberman who has a street named after in Israel, there's a famous picture of him and Einstein playing violin together, and I was told about that early on.[0:36:52] Andrew Huberman: And when I failed to play well After a couple of practices, I was convinced that there was no way I was gonna live up to it, and I quit.[0:37:00] Dr. Maya Shankar: That's a high bar, man.[0:37:01] Andrew Huberman: A high bar. It's a high bar.[0:37:02] Dr. Maya Shankar: Have any such role models that I was to feel like in my family.[0:37:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Turns out I'm but exactly. And so I think that there's actually more opportunity in, in kids Leaning into or in adults probably, leaning into the sensory experience of what they're doing and not putting that up against some benchmark. And I worry about that today so much with social media and with video games, where in a video game or on social media, you can see something being done at The very highest level often by someone quite young or early in their career to the point where it can be a little bit overwhelming. And I think it then we start measuring ourselves against, you know, metrics that are not about the the experience.[0:37:43] Andrew Huberman: That said, Your parents, whatever they did, worked out well enough that you became very proficient. Right? You succeeded in getting into Juilliard, which is, at least from my understanding, is the the most competitive, music preparatory, is that how you refer to it, that one can possibly go to. And so at that point, had your identity merged with the behavior, and were you still enjoying yourself Up until the point where you had this injury that we'll also talk about.[0:38:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. I was still enjoying myself, around the time went when I auditioned for Juilliard in particular because of exactly what you said, which was everything was kind of beating my expectations and my parents' expectations up until this point, right, which is that We didn't really have any, and so it all just felt like icing on the cake. Wow. Our kids found something that they really love. This is great.[0:38:35] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? It can sometimes take you years, decades to figure out what it is that you love, what you're passionate about. And I think we go through this renewal process often in our lives. Right. I've had to have moments in life where I'm like, what do I like again?[0:38:45] Dr. Maya Shankar: What do I love again? And so it's not also a onetime experience. But there was was kind there's a thrilling aspect to my musical life when I was young, which is, again, everything kinda felt just like bonus. So one one story I love sharing is about how I even got into Juilliard in the place. My parents you know?[0:39:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: So my dad's a theoretical physicist physicist as you mentioned. My mom helps immigrants get green cards to study in this country. Neither of them had exposure to the classical music sphere. Right? So they're, like, the opposite of tiger parents.[0:39:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, even if they wanted to be tiger parents, they wouldn't know how to be tiger parents in this domain because they lack the connections, and, like, the wherewithal to figure out what it would mean to to to go pro and and to access the best teachers or whatever. So My mom, who is a very fearless person by nature, she knew that at some point, my passion for the violin was surpassing Her ability to, like, connect me with the right resources. And so 1 weekend, we were in New York on inspiring New York, And I had my violin with me because I had another audition, and we were just walking by Julliard, the building. And my mom was just eager for me to see it from the outside Because it's just really cool as a kid. Right?[0:39:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: It's like all your musical idols went to this place. I just wanted to see it and, like, imagine what it would have been like Pearlman to go in and out and Midori to go in and out is Yo Yo Ma. Right? Like, it's so exciting. And as we're passing the entrance, My mom looks at me and says, hey.[0:40:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: Why don't we just go in? And I was like, what are you talking about? She's like, let's just going? What's the worst thing that can happen? And I'm like, security guards and, like, a lot of other terrible things, mom.[0:40:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? But I had a youthful enthusiasm that, like, propelled me into the building that day. She strikes up a conversation with a fellow student and her mom, finds out that she's studying with, like, a top teacher at Juilliard, asked if we can get an introduction within an hour. I'm auditioning for this teacher on the spot. Right?[0:40:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: No idea that this was gonna happen.[0:40:43] Andrew Huberman: Wild.[0:40:44] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. He tells me, he has what I refer to as a, It's like muted enthusiasm about my playing. Doesn't think I'm great, but see something. Like, he told me later, he liked my personality, my enthusiasm, so I got the personality card coming out of that music audition. Great.[0:41:00] Dr. Maya Shankar: And what he did is he said, look. I'm with you. I don't think that you're ready. You would not get into Juilliard if you audition today. However, I take residence at a summer music program In Colorado, if you come there for 5 weeks, we can do an intense boot camp where I try to skill you up and Get you to learn, like, your 1st scale in your 1st etude, which you will need to pass the Juilliard audition, and also maybe, hopefully, get you to, like, read music a little bit better than you can right now.[0:41:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I went to that summer camp, and I worked my butt off. I mean, you're also in this incredibly intensive environment where Everyone your age is there, and they're all practicing, like, their age equivalent. Right? And so I felt very inspired by that, and I ended up getting into Juilliard in the fall, and it was such a wonderful reminder that, you know, when opportunities are not on a silver platter for you. You just have to have this kind of imaginative courage and what my mom had that day, right, to figure out a path from point a to point b.[0:42:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: She really just, like, created a plate for me and said, like, okay. Like, you're prepared for this thing. We're gonna get you in front of this teacher, And that's a lesson I used time and time again. When I felt like there was something cool I could be doing, the opportunity did not exist. So for example, when I was in the White House, the the job that I wanted, which was, to be a practitioner of behavioral science, did not exist.[0:42:24] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so I sent cold emails, and I pitched them on the idea of creating a new position for a behavioral science adviser. And then I said, hey. By the way, if you this position. Could you, like, also consider hiring me to play that job even though I've had no public policy experience and I've been an academic, for the entirety of my adult life, and, you know, they said yes. And so it's it's just it it was such an energizing lesson to learn as a young kid, which is, like, You can do the cold call.[0:42:52] Dr. Maya Shankar: Oftentimes, there's few consequences. You'll just get rejected. I mean, that's truly the worst thing that's gonna happen, but one thing to be told that. It's another thing to have lived the experience out and to see how amazing, the aftermath can be, and that's the that's what I got to experience as young kids. So[0:43:07] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. And, so let's all express some thanks to your mom for for barging in the door. I know. And to you because you also had the agency to To do the audition on the spot, I think a lot of kids and adults would have thought, you know, I'm not ready. I'm not gonna do this.[0:43:22] Andrew Huberman: But it it takes a, certain gumption to just do it. Right? And and also to integrate the feedback. And then I'm curious about this camp. Yeah.[0:43:33] Andrew Huberman: I went to a few camps, of different types. Crashed a few camps. That's a different story. Turns out if you show up, you know, you can get by for a few days before they realize you're not one of the main[0:43:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: with you.[0:43:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. No. I there's a whole other set of stories there. I love it. But I'm curious.[0:43:47] Andrew Huberman: You know, you're you're among very driven, maybe even obsessive kids. Yeah. Were they nice to one another? Do you recall the kid that was the best?[0:43:59] Dr. Maya Shankar: Oh, yeah. Rachel Lee.[0:44:00] Andrew Huberman: There you go. Isn't this incredible?[0:44:02] Dr. Maya Shankar: Oh my god.[0:44:02] Andrew Huberman: Remember these names?[0:44:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Total prodigy. I I bristle when people say, like, oh, my like, Maya was a young violin prodigy. I'm like, no. I wasn't, and there's no false humility in my saying that.[0:44:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: I just actually saw what prodigies were like, And I was not one of them. I mean, truly, just talk about awe inspiring. I'm like, how is it that music comes so effortlessly to Rachel. I feel like she I feel like she was born with a violin in her hands. I mean, that's how it felt whenever I watched her play, and It's a double edged sword.[0:44:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: On the one hand, you're drive you're deriving inspiration from the incredible talent you see around you. On the other hand, you feel demoralized So often because you're running up against whatever, limitations exist when it comes to your natural talent and your work ethic. Like, at the end of the day, I was never the hardest working violinist. My mom insisted that we were well rounded kids. I played soccer all through elementary school.[0:45:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: I auditioned for the school play, Really Rosy. I did art classes. Like, it was just really important to, you know, both my parents, I think, that we had just, like, relatively normal lives, and I was studying alongside kids who had literally left half their families behind in their home country had moved with 1 parent to a studio apartment in Manhattan or in Colorado for this camp And we're devoting their entire lives to this pursuit, and so I felt like, I was I was a Super envious kid. Like, I was always looking around being like, I suck, and they're great. Right?[0:45:39] Dr. Maya Shankar: We talked about, like, having a self critical personality.[0:45:42] Andrew Huberman: I think a lot I think a lot of kids feel that way. Yeah. We're we're I think at that age, and this sometimes extends into adulthood, we have this tendency to try and We find benchmarks of where we are. Yeah. You know?[0:45:55] Andrew Huberman: And and sometimes that spell, you know, turns into a hierarchical Things sometimes very lateralized, but trying to figure out where you are in the landscape of things is it just seems like it's kinda fundamental to the teenage experience.[0:46:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. You know, the universe shrinks too. Right? So, like, you're no longer getting access to what the average kid violinist sounds like. I mean, you're in the elite of the elite, and so it's So intimidating, and I often felt I felt like what happened is especially when I became a teenager so 2 things happened when I became a teenager.[0:46:24] Dr. Maya Shankar: The first is that My violin life just started to speed forward. So, Itzhak Perlman inviting me to be his private violin student, you know, considered the best violinist in the world. It was, an incredible experience. I felt so overwhelmed even by the opportunity. I'd also stumbled upon MTV and was do I even wanna do classical music?[0:46:44] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, Britney Spears is doing much cooler things. So that that was my version of, like, teenage rebellion was coming home from school and what I should have been practicing watching MTV. But the other thing that happened is I went through the natural teenage process, which is I became very self conscious. I became more insecure. I was trying to figure out who I was, who I am, and I think that was the period of my life, my my high school year is when I was the least happy as a violinist.[0:47:12] Dr. Maya Shankar: So I described to you earlier that incredibly awe inspiring experience of listening to the Incredibly awe inspiring experience of listening to the Beethoven Violin Concerto and it feeling otherworldly and feeling like I could see a world beyond my own personal wants and needs and desires. Right? It really made me feel small against the backdrop of this magnificent world, and I liked that feeling of smallness. And when I was in my teenage years, you know, we're all in this highly narcissistic state of mind. We're, like, consumed with ourselves and how we feel, and I just I just felt like I gave some of my worst performances when I was a teenager.[0:47:47] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I often found to your point about, you know, these pressure cooker environments, my best performances were actually just to the public. My worst performances were when I was in my little studio having to play for my peers. Like, that just sapped all the joy out for me because I was, Yeah. Just, like, really tough on myself, and I I lost that was a period of time where I lost touch with what it is that I loved about music. And, of course, there's an ebb and flow.[0:48:15] Dr. Maya Shankar: I had magical experiences playing the violin when I was a high schooler, but I just think if you were to do, like, the average of joy, Like, pre 12 and then post 12, the average joy was much higher, before I became a teenager.[0:48:27] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's there's so many things to extrapolate from that. I I really Feel that when we get into a mode of trying to, hit milestones that are extrinsic, that it really can undermine our our love of[0:48:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[0:48:40] Andrew Huberman: Of what we're doing. But if we keep going and we can reframe what those external rewards are, in in part by just realizing that they're so transient compared to the The delight that we can experience. What I mean is that I don't think of delight as something that that wells up in us and then and then dissipates. I think of it as something that Changes our nervous system in a way that gives us access to new abilities. I really do.[0:49:04] Andrew Huberman: I mean, being a faculty member at Stanford, you know, you look to your left, you look to your right, and it's like, I literally in the building, I mean, I've got Nobel Prize winner below me. Like, the people by the MacArthur award winners all over the place. Like, everywhere you turn and these people do other things too. Like, you know, oh, no. Also d one athletes, and they've got 5 kids, and all their kids seem to be doing great.[0:49:22] Andrew Huberman: They're like, who are these people? And it becomes very important In that environment to, to just shrink your spirits, like, what's, you know, 1 foot in front of you and just keep going and not pay attention. But it's hard to do, Not by way of comparison because I actually get excited about being immersed in a group where everyone's doing well. I do think being Among all these other incredibly talented and driven, although you you carefully said and importantly said rather that You did not see yourself as talented. It's very clear that you have a ton of grit and and hard work clearly went into it.[0:49:54] Andrew Huberman: I think that word talent can be a little bit misleading. So, we wanna underscore the fact that you've worked incredibly hard. But I think that it's a tough thing. You know? It It's hard for us to develop much in isolation, and it's also hard for us to, stay connected to the source.[0:50:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes. The source. Exactly. And that's[0:50:12] Andrew Huberman: a word that I stole from, a former guest on this podcast and and a good friend of mine who's, the great Rick Rubin, one of the most successful music Yeah. Producer rock and roll music producer involved. He talks about the source. You know? So there are so many different, trails we could go down here.[0:50:28] Andrew Huberman: Just one thing briefly is I I, again, completely miserable, at music, but I once saw Itzhak Perlman in the in the airport With his family, I was with my father who's a huge classical music fan, and we watched him, and he said watch. And it turns out he was getting on to our plane. He sat in 1st class next to his, I presume, Stradivarius violin. His violin got a 1st class seat. He got a 1st class seat, and his family sat across from him.[0:50:55] Andrew Huberman: And my dad said, His violin is so important that it gets its own 1st class c. I couldn't believe it.[0:51:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: So great.[0:51:01] Andrew Huberman: So in any in any event[0:51:04] Dr. Maya Shankar: I think just one thing to your to your point, one reflection I've had, and this kinda goes back to this question of identity, right, which is When you are in these very competitive environments, and, again, I'm sure a lot of people listening are in very competitive environments, You feel that so much can be taken away from you, just in terms of mental well-being because you're always looking at the world through a comparative lens. Right? You're you're benchmarking yourself you said, like, there's benchmark, and where do I fall on the continuum of, you know, mediocre to great? I don't know. And yesterday, I I I didn't have a terrible performance, so that's gonna set me back, etcetera, etcetera.[0:51:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: I have found that When I've anchored when I reanchor myself to what, you know, what Rick Rubin referred to as the source and identify the characteristics, of music or other pursuits that really energizes me. It feels like I'm actually insulated from a lot of the external noise, And I bring a lot more clarity and focus to the work that I do every day. So there's 2 things that I think define find me as a person, at least right now. Right? I allow for that malleability.[0:52:12] Dr. Maya Shankar: One is that I'm a deeply curious person, and the second is that I really relish getting better at things. I love seeing progress internally. And in my violin life, no one could take those 2 things away from me in my current life, as a cognitive scientist, as a podcaster. Like, You just can't take those from me. Like, no one can take those that joy from me, and it feels protective in a really important way, which is, for example, I mean, I I pour, I mean, just like you, I mean, I see the the labor of love that you put into the Huberman Lab Podcast.[0:52:48] Dr. Maya Shankar: It's extraordinary. I put I put So much time and energy and thoughtfulness and love into making a slight change of plans. But at the end of the day, when you put the episode out into the world, like, you just don't get to control what the reaction is. Right? Your favorite episode might not be everyone else's favorite episode, and that's just something you have to deal with.[0:53:05] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? But what I found is that if I really relish the process of making the episode, right, it had that curiosity, and I got better as an interviewer. I got better as a thinker. I got more clarity on a topic that I was curious about. I mean, it just It gives me a foundation that feels really sturdy.[0:53:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: Do you know what I mean? It's just yeah.[0:53:25] Andrew Huberman: Well, those things are intrinsic to you, and they they are, I guess now we're using, nomenclature, but they're not what we would call domain specific. Mhmm. Like, the curiosity, the the desire for progress through effort and through focus. Those are music. They're not music irrelevant, but they're music independent.[0:53:45] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And and that actually brings me to a very important component of your work and and your life arc, which is, this notion of recreating and refinding identity in new endeavors. So, if I understand correctly, and hopefully you'll embellish on this, you had the unfortunate perhaps unfortunate. Alright? Yeah.[0:54:11] Andrew Huberman: Experience of playing the violin and then injuring your finger very badly to the point where it was, at least for Your music career, career ending.[0:54:19] Dr. Maya Shankar: Absolutely.[0:54:20] Andrew Huberman: And that happened when you were how old?[0:54:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: I was 15.[0:54:24] Andrew Huberman: So given how much of your identity and and energy was, put into violin, that that must have been devastating. And yet you've obviously, I don't wanna say recreated yourself because I like the idea that this essence within you, has many opportunities and forms, and I like it as an example for Everybody having some essence of many things that could give them delight, and that it's something about the feelings associated with A given choice of occupation or hobby or behavior or perhaps relationship. Right? Relationships end sometimes by decision death or otherwise. Yeah.[0:55:01] Andrew Huberman: You know? And people are devastated. Dated. Their identities are completely, at least in their minds, obliterated. And then people have this amazing ability to recreate themselves and new circumstances.[0:55:13] Andrew Huberman: So if you could take us back to the time when you you were 15, you have this injury, what was your initial mindset in the days weeks after that? Yeah. And then if you would, could you link that up to some of the what I see as incredibly important work that you've done, Helping people understand not just who they are, but how to identify the components of who they are that are that are truly indomitable. Mhmm. That they that just cannot go away[0:55:38] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[0:55:39] Andrew Huberman: Like your drive for curiosity Yeah. And hard work.[0:55:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: And human connection. Yep. Yeah. In the in the days weeks months year after, I felt terrible. It was awful because, I don't I think in my case, also, you just when you're a kid who's really, like, bubbly and energetic, you just kinda move forward and you don't always Think about how identity defining the thing you're doing is.[0:56:05] Dr. Maya Shankar: You just do it. And so it's it was really interesting. I think in losing the violin, that's actually when it became So salient to me how much the instrument had meant to me and and had defined who I was. And so I I felt a dampening of some of my more organic traits. Like, I was less curious for a long time.[0:56:27] Andrew Huberman: I could I I'm gonna interrupt you on purpose. I apologize, but at the same time, I'm not apologizing because there was something that you said in a prior discussion that just keeps ringing in my mind, which is that your body and your nervous system actually grew up around the violin. Yes. Like, that to me was just I I will never forget that statement. I wanna also thank you for it because that to me is perhaps the most Found way to describe, an experience of identity is that your your nervous system in your body Isn't growing up with something or alongside it, but that much like a a a relationship of of a humankind, human humankind, that your body is actually developing around this object.[0:57:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: It absolutely developed around the ergonomics of playing the violin. So To this day, my right shoulder is slightly elevated to my, relative to my left because of all the hours I spent doing this. It makes strength training really annoying because I always have this slight imbalance, and I have a light scoliosis in my spine as well, also from this posture. And, Yeah. It feels intimate in a way.[0:57:34] Dr. Maya Shankar: It's like, wow. The the shape of my body. Right? Like, my architecture was defined by this instrument. And so it it's left an it's like a it's left this indelible you know?[0:57:47] Dr. Maya Shankar: It has it's a lot of this, like, Imprints on me that will never go away, and, I think that a lot of us feel this This disorientation. Right? So it it's might not be that you lost the ability to do something you love. It could be that you lost someone that you love. Right?[0:58:04] Dr. Maya Shankar: It could be that you, you lost your mojo or whatever. Right? I mean, there's so many types of loss and so many kinds of grief we all experience as human beings. And I think in all those cases, again, it really feels like the rug has been pulled out from under you because this thing that Gave you so much meaning and so much purpose and so much energy in life no longer exists. And so I think for for a while, yeah, it felt kinda like lost at sea, and, I assumed I'll never find anything that I'm as passionate about, and, I think what my dad did for me at time so, you know, theoretical physicist.[0:58:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: So he's an academic, and he said, I think you should just read a lot. Just, like, read a bunch of stuff. And, I was like, okay. I mean, I'm supposed to be in China this summer touring with my classmates. I am at home in Connecticut with my parents, their bookshelves, so, like, slightly less cool summer situation, but, you know, I had a lot of time on my hands because I wasn't I wasn't in Shanghai.[0:59:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: So I started, you know, perusing the bookshelf, and then I came across this pop science book called The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker, and, that was a turning point for me. I mean, I was I was headed to college maybe later that year. I opened up this book, and it detailed our marvelous ability to comprehend and produce language. And up until this point in my life, I had completely taken Language abilities for granted, just like something that I did, and I just, like, kind of learned it along the way. And when Pinker Pulled the curtain back and revealed how sophisticated and complex the cognitive machinery is that's operating behind the scenes that gives rise to language.[0:59:55] Dr. Maya Shankar: My mind was truly blown. I was like, wow. I I never thought of that. It's not like we with 3 year olds, not like we sit down with them, and we're like, this is a gerund. This is a passport, whatever.[1:00:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: There's no they just learn because they have these kind of light switches in their brain that are, you know, activated on and off depending on what language they're learning, And it was so fascinating to learn about language development, about neurolinguistics, about Syntax and semantics, and and so I I just remember thinking language is fascinating. Cognition is fascinating, and I'm also now wondering about all these other systems that are in place. Right? So this is what's involved in language, what's involved in, you know, the complex Math equations our dads do. Right?[1:00:39] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, what's involved in, what what what's the mental processing behind a new discovery or an insight or an moment or falling in love or Falling out of love. I mean, it just it just lit up my imagination. And very similar to you, Andrew, I love that we have this connection. You said when you learned about, like, neurobiology and neuroscience, you you saw that there was a place for yourself in there. And I remember reading this book, and because it was a pop science book and I love pop science books because sometimes, know, even if they don't fully do justice to the science, they can take someone who's never had any exposure to the subject matter, and It's it's thrilling to learn about the thing.[1:01:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? I would never have gotten the same experience had I opened up an introduction to cognitive science textbook. Okay? It would not have had the same impact on So, like, shout out to pop sciaticos everywhere.[1:01:24] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for saying that. And, you know, and here, I'll just thank you because I think that many my colleagues in academic science at Stanford and elsewhere feel that way, but I think many don't. They think of it as, quote, dumbing down of things. But I'll tell you, Rarely, if ever, does somebody just wander into a university classroom and hear a lecture on accident. I mean, maybe if your mom was at the at the helm, They all would.[1:01:47] Andrew Huberman: So moms everywhere barge right in. But but I think it's, I actually, I'll I'll go a step further, and I'll I'll I'll, do this so that you don't have to, and that these are not your words. These are mine. I think that there's actually a a pretty intense arrogance to the idea Within the, established scientific community that pop science books, while they might not be exhaustive, provided they're accurate and they're making an attempt to educate and draw people in from all sectors.[1:02:17] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[1:02:18] Andrew Huberman: Like, amen to that. I just can't hear a counterargument in my head or elsewhere where that's not One of the best things that, people can do. So, regardless of, you know, People's motivations for picking them up in the 1st place, I mean, they brought a lot of people into the the curiosity and delight that is science or music or You know, I think that we the more, positive, benevolent, you know, safe sensory experiences that we can expose young people to, The greater probability that we're gonna flesh out those professions with the greatest number of diverse minds, we're gonna have the best ideas. Mhmm. I mean, it's really I I think that there's a ton of foresight in what in what you're describing that, you know, picking up a book is now what you're also now a PhD in, I mean, in cognitive science, and you did your postdoc at Stanford.[1:03:09] Andrew Huberman: I mean, you're a scientist.[1:03:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: Mhmm.[1:03:11] Andrew Huberman: Presumably because you went into the bookshelf and picked up That book.[1:03:15] Dr. Maya Shankar: 100%. And I and I think it was it was also role modeled for me because my dad, despite being in a very, very technical field, spent a large part of his career actually working on the translation of complex subjects and trying to convey them to general audiences. And I loved witnessing this because it's like, if you can figure out a way to communicate about theoretical physics physics To a general audience, I mean, wow. That's a masterful pursuit. Right?[1:03:42] Andrew Huberman: Well, Feynman, Richard Feynman.[1:03:43] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Richard Feynman. Exactly.[1:03:45] Andrew Huberman: No one really knows what Feynman did for his Nobel Prize work except physicist. You know that most people you ask them, what what was Feynman's Nobel for? And they're like, I don't know. I don't know. Said something about birds and taxonomy and how it's less interesting than, you know, quantum mechanics.[1:03:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:03:59] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. And I and I one of the reasons that I love and I I just love the work you do is that you are taking, concepts that might have been inaccessible to the average person, and you're making science accessible. And I feel so much gratitude to every scientist out there, every researcher out there who thinks that it's worth their time to be a practitioner of of their work, because ultimately I mean, think about how many lives you're changing through the show by trying to break down some of these more complicated things into, into concepts that people can, you know, understand and relate to and actually act on. And, it it also reminds me, you know, when part of my job when I was in When I was in the Obama administration, I was translating insights from behavioral science, from cognitive science into Interventions that my government agency colleagues could implement in the Department of Veterans Affairs, in the, you know, Department of Defense, Department of Education, And that same translation process was part of that effort too, and I I think it's really, really hard to do well. I respect it so much.[1:05:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: I respect pop science writers who do a good job so much, and it it yeah. I think it's a wonderful service. They don't have to spend their time writing these books. They could just publish more research papers that it which is the currency that academic institutions care about, and so I see it as just like a public good of what they're doing.[1:05:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I do too and right back at you because you're doing it as well, and so we're all better off for it. So thank you. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals.[1:05:37] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. However, with a lot of blood tests out there, you get information back about blood lipids, about hormones, and so on, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform that makes Very easy to understand your data, that is to understand what those lipids, what those hormone levels, etcetera, mean, and Behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health. InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both APO b and of insulin, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation. You'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.[1:06:27] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So I wanna, go back to this injury to summer at home to discovery of something new. Yeah. Was it at that point that you realize, the feeling of excitement that I'm getting from learning about neurolinguistics and related topics is somehow similar to the excitement that I was feeling about the violin or maybe even superseded that excitement. I mean, at what point did were you able to make the pivot, with confidence That, you know, this this is the new trajectory.[1:07:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And and an important component of that that I'd like to understand is you also had to cut ties with the past, Something that's very hard to do. I mean, I grew up with a number of kids who became very successful teen athletes, really. And some of them, once They ceased to keep up or they had an injury or something. Their identity stayed attached to the past in a way that did not allow them to move forward.[1:07:31] Andrew Huberman: Fortunately, Many of them, did find new identities in business or in other endeavors. Some became quite successful. But I've Seen very often that when people achieve early success Mhmm. And then they hit a cliff, that it's very hard for them to part with that former identity. That's one of the perils of early success.[1:07:52] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't say that it's superseded the excitement that I had with the violin. I would say the quality of the excitement felt very different, and that's actually important to convey because I think when someone loses the ability to have a passion, they're seeking exactly the same sensory experience, exactly same high that they experienced the 1st time around, and I think that's a really high bar, and sometimes it's more of an apples and oranges type situation.[1:08:19] Dr. Maya Shankar: So With the violin, there was a really deep sensory aspect to the experience. I mean, I I felt things. Right? You're playing, and then you're feeling things emotionally, and it it all felt super visceral. And that was where the passion emerged from.[1:08:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: It was just this, like, very visceral feeling of, like, this is so beautiful and awesome, and I love it. With the cognitive science stuff, My my intellectual brain was delighted, and it it's just like a different expression of passion. Right? I I think the big pressure test was not If I held myself to the bar of, do I love this as much as the violin, there's no way that I would have been confident enough to pursue anything at that point. So instead, I I really think the question I asked myself at that time, which was a service to me in in my more compromised psychology, was, Am I curious enough about this thing to ask more questions about it?[1:09:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: Do I want to learn more? And I found, naturally, 3 days later, I went to the, library, and I got another book on the cognitive science of language. And then I got a book on the science of decision making. So I was there was curiosity, and, honestly, that was all I needed. That was the little seedling that I needed to see if it could go somewhere more.[1:09:39] Dr. Maya Shankar: I took that as a very strong signal. Like, I care to learn more about this, and I don't to learn about everything. Right? And, I remember perusing the course book, of my of my undergrad institution, and they had a cognitive science major, was awesome because not all schools had 1 at the time. It was a very new major.[1:09:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: It's interdisciplinary. You approach Questions of the mind from multiple perspectives. So, from the perspective of neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, computer science, and anthropology. Right? So you're just, like, a bunch of different disciplines and but that was when I thought, oh, I can at least See if I can get into this major.[1:10:19] Dr. Maya Shankar: I remember it was like a selective selective, and so I freaked out, of course, and had super imposter syndrome. It's like, I'm not gonna get in to the program, but, thankfully, I got in. And I think that's, yeah, that's where I was able to connect, like, this little seedling of curiosity to To the actual pursuit of the thing. Right? And and that's a really important translation because there can often be a mismatch.[1:10:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: You're really passionate about something, but you actually hate the process. Right? Like, you hate the actual work that's involved in getting better at it. And I was lucky in my undergrad because I fought my way, my mom style, barging into classes that, like, really would only accept, you know, seniors or or juniors, and I was like, I'm a fresh lowly freshman, but, like, accept me. And I was able to run experiments on adults, and I was actually able to see what it would be like to be a researcher, to ask novel questions, and to get the delight that you that you feel, right, when you're in a lab and you're actually testing out new hypotheses.[1:11:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so it was really important that I saw that I not only was excited, but that I could actually enjoy parts of the process of getting better.[1:11:25] Andrew Huberman: I love your description of curiosity because it makes me think That in some way has something to do with a deep motivation and desire to figure out What's next or what's around the corner without an emotional attachment to the outcome? The curiosity is really just trying to figure out what's there as opposed to hoping that something Specific is there, and sometimes even the surprises are more exciting than our predictions. The I think the quote was initially from Dorothy Parker. Think this is debated, but I think it was, you know, the cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.[1:12:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. I I hadn't heard that.[1:12:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I believe it was Dorothy Parker, sometimes misattributed to, Agatha Christie, but I think it was Dorothy Parker. And what I love about it is that there's something about curiosity that when it's genuine, it's self amplifying. Mhmm. It's an upward spiral because there is no endpoint.[1:12:21] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, that's one of the the the the things that you learn Early in sciences, you know, you learn, you test hypotheses, you get answers, and you get more questions, and you form hypotheses, and you do that until you Basically and that can be a little bit dark. But when you think about it as a journey that it it's just so much fun along the way. If you're Just really interested in knowing what the answers are without getting too attached to the answers. It just feels like it just even as I'm describing it now, it's like, They just can just fill fill you up, and it provides more energy for the next round and the next round.[1:12:54] Andrew Huberman: And that really came through in your description of of Cognoscience. I also find it interesting that you couldn't read sheet music, at least not very well. You were So deeply, immersed in an endeavor violin playing that is not of verbal language. And then you went into a field that's about In in or initially, you're you were sparked an interest in a field through an understanding of verbal language. And earlier, you said that that the thing that bridges The violin and this, what came next as a as a passion and pursuit was this desire for human connection.[1:13:29] Andrew Huberman: At what point did you realize that? And and here, I just I do wanna emphasize that while we're talking about your story, I hope, I can only imagine that people are starting to think about, you know, what are the The the intrinsic points of motivation for what they're doing and what they've done, you know, asking the sorts of questions that, I hope everyone is asking. Like, you know, what What is it really that motivates me to love this and to see a place for myself in that? Because those are ultimately, I think, the questions that that everyone should and can ask.[1:14:02] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. I, It took me a really long time. It's actually only been in the last few years that I've discovered this. I discovered this as a result of creating a slight change of plan. So I, my desire to create the show, came from a very personal place, which is that I'm terrified of change.[1:14:22] Dr. Maya Shankar: So even though I've had these formative experiences with change, I'm a creature of habit. I'm willing to change my habits. For example, I now take caffeine 90 minutes after I get up.[1:14:31] Andrew Huberman: How's this going for you?[1:14:33] Dr. Maya Shankar: Very well. Even today. Okay? I'm a good I'm a good disciple.[1:14:36] Andrew Huberman: Well, there should well, I like to think that like to think that people afford themselves some flexibility. If you gotta run to the airport to[1:14:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: 90 minutes.[1:14:42] Andrew Huberman: 60 to 90 or the occasional, you know, you know, within 30 minutes if you if you have to. But Nobody's perfect nor nor should we strive.[1:14:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: Students. I'm willing to update my habits, but I'm a creature of habit. Appreciate it. And I There's a couple reasons why we as humans are scared of change, and I think one of them, which is incredibly relatable, is that, change is filled with a lot of uncertainty, and we hate uncertainty. We will go to irrational lengths to avoid uncertainty.[1:15:12] Dr. Maya Shankar: So one of my favorite studies coming out of, Cognitive Sciences is one involving electric shocks, and what they found is that People are far more stressed when they're told they have a 50% chance of getting an electric shock than when they're told they have a 100% chance of getting an electric shock. So we would rather be sure certain that a bad thing is going to happen than to have to deal with any feelings of uncertainty and ambiguity.[1:15:37] Andrew Huberman: Right? That result, I I I love that you brought up that result. It still is bewildering to me because if you think about it, a 100% Trial to trial shock, you means you just you'd have to take on the okay. Bring it. Just just bring it on kind of mentality.[1:15:55] Andrew Huberman: But if you did that for every trial and then half of the trials, you don't get shocked. You'd get the the we know there's a dopamine release from the lack of punishment. So the the ideal strategy is the same, and yet somehow people are averse to the uncertainty.[1:16:11] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. We just Yeah. We don't like uncertainty. Even though, again, the uncertainty is what drives that dopamine burst. Right?[1:16:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: And and yet we we bristle certainly, At at that at that uncertainty. And so I I definitely am like, please, status quo, everyone. Would love the status quo. Even when the status Quo has been suboptimal, Andrew. I've been fine with the status quo.[1:16:32] Dr. Maya Shankar: So part of it came from my desire to figure out, okay, how is it like, a slight change of plans. Right? It marries Science and storytelling to help us figure out strategies for better managing change. So I wanted to figure out how are people coming to terms with uncertainty. And one of the things that I realized, I learned from my, the guests on my show and also the scientists is there's this concept called cognitive closure, And it is the need to arrive at clear, definitive answers to things.[1:17:00] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay? It's basically opposite of this open ended curiosity that you just described, which is with cognitive closure, you have a need to you you aren't indifferent towards what the answers are. You aren't indifferent towards what the questions are. You care about everything. You care about micromanaging every part of the curious process from point a to point b.[1:17:19] Dr. Maya Shankar: And there's a lot of research showing that when we reduce our need for cognitive closure, right, when we we come a little bit more open to The unbidden. Right? Like, to mystery, more open to awe inspiring experiences. We can experience huge boosts in well-being, and we can become a lot more resilient in the face of change. So that's something that I'm working on, which is like, okay.[1:17:43] Dr. Maya Shankar: Maybe I can reduce my need for for cognitive closure. And the other thing, that I am starting to appreciate is one reason that we we kind of We get change wrong, and we maybe fear it more than we should, is that when we anticipate what a change will be like in the future, We tend to imagine how our present day selves will respond to that future change. Right? So it's almost like A magic mirror. It's Maya in present day going through this mirror, comes out the other side.[1:18:17] Dr. Maya Shankar: 2 years from now, the one who's overcoming the challenges of a diagnosis or some other life change. And what we forget is that the big changes in our lives can change us in pretty profound ways. Right? And when we recognize and and we all fall prey to this illusion. So it's called the end of history illusion.[1:18:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: So this is work by Dan Gilbert. Basically, what it says is we fully acknowledge that we've changed considerably in the past. So you think back to your skateboard days. Right? I think back to my high school days, and I think, oh my gosh.[1:18:48] Dr. Maya Shankar: Of course, I've changed. Like, I would be embarrassed to listen to any interview I gave when I was when I was younger. Right? Like, what were the thoughts I was even thinking? So we will see it absolutely.[1:18:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: We were totally different 10 years ago, 20 years ago. But when it comes to thinking about the future and projecting into the future, We are absolutely convinced that who we are right now in this moment is the person that's here to stay.[1:19:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:19:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: And that can lead us astray when it comes to thinking about how we will respond to change because we forget that there's actually a lot of wiggle room around who we become. And to your point, I mean, I love the point you you you made about curiosity. What that means is we wanna be curious not just about the things we do. We wanna be curious about ourselves. One huge lesson that I've learned from the interviews that I've had on a slight change of plans is that I need to constantly be auditing myself through my change experience to figure out how I have changed.[1:19:44] Dr. Maya Shankar: Because when we experience change, It doesn't happen in a vacuum. Right? So let's say I get a promotion or I enter into a relationship or I leave a relationship or some other, Again, narrow slice of my life is altered. We can think of that change as happening in a vacuum, right, as being confined to just the unique area of our life That that little that change exists in. But, of course, we are incredibly complex creatures.[1:20:09] Dr. Maya Shankar: Our psychology is incredibly complex. We live in these Remarkably complex ecosystems change in one area of our life will inevitably have spillover effects into all other parts of our lives in ways that are extremely hard to predict. And so, you know, we've I think a lot of your listeners are familiar with the research showing we're we're really bad cognitive forecasters. Right? We're bad at predicting What's gonna make us happy?[1:20:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: What's gonna make us sad? How long we're gonna be sad? How long we're gonna be happy? Well, one of the reasons for that is that we forget that we are a dynamic entity that might change as well. Right?[1:20:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: That our preferences might change. Our choices might change. We might change in these really profound ways that we don't realize, and, I think there's an inspiring message coming out of this, which is, 1, like, what we're capable of right now really might not be what we're capable of later. And what I found in my own experience is that, You know, when it comes to our it's interesting. When it comes to our self perception, because we have a first person perspective on who we are, we tend to think that we have a very, A comprehensive, like, vertical understanding of who we are.[1:21:15] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? Like, I have a pretty good grasp of who I, Maya, am and what I'm capable of and what I value and and what my identity is. But the reality is that that understanding is based on the random set of data points that I've happened to collect over the course of my lifetime based on the random set of experiences and opportunities and failures and successes that I've happened to have. Right?[1:21:40] Andrew Huberman: And we and if I'm not mistaken, there's a salience to the negative experiences often For for reasons that make sense according to nervous systems that wanna keep us safe, etcetera. But for instance, you remember the name of this child prodigy or your Rachel Lee. My sister still talks about I won't say their names because we know that these people are still around, fortunately. The names of some of the the, girls In junior high school that were particularly popular and perhaps not[1:22:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: kind Helen Lindsay.[1:22:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Perhaps. Not kind to her. Right? Exactly.[1:22:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: Perhaps not nice to me? Not super nice, but it's okay.[1:22:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's a lot of web searching nowadays for what these people are up to now. Anyway, Not by me. This is I anyway, I have a sister. We occasionally touch into this.[1:22:26] Andrew Huberman: She's doing great, fortunately. So, Yeah. There's an there's a salience to the negative experiences, but but I think what, hearing, and I totally agree with, is that, You know, we'd like to think that we have, complete or at least adequate self knowledge, but that we likely don't. And and so what are some of the ways that we can get better data on ourselves in ways that can help us. Is that through, the application of mentorship?[1:22:55] Andrew Huberman: Is it asking people for an honest assessment of us, with, of of course, the willingness to hear what they have to say? Yeah. You know, where what are some of the that I love zero cost behavioral, but, what are some of the zero cost behavioral sources that that people have around Then in order to ask these, what I think, are really fundamental questions.[1:23:17] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So there's true there's 2, information asymmetries, let's say, that we're trying to solve for. Right. So 2 areas where we might not have full knowledge of who we are for one of 2 reasons. So one is that We have an incomplete understanding of who we are just based on the random set of experiences, and the second is that going through this big change actually alters us in some way.[1:23:38] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay? So if we're trying to solve for the I think the 2nd problem is actually easier to solve for, in that we often just don't even know to look inwards during a big change to see how we've changed Because we think, oh, I'll just pay attention to how I'm performing at work because that was the new variable that was thrown into my life, and we forget to evaluate other parts of our lives. Like, What impact has this had on my relationship? What impact has this had on my overall well-being? Right?[1:24:02] Dr. Maya Shankar: Am I different? Do I have a different set of preferences? Do I care about different things? So in the 2nd category, Become very inquisitive about who you are over a longer time frame and assume that it's not a static state.[1:24:14] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:24:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: When it comes to the first, bucket, which is how do we develop a more complete and rich richer understanding of self? I think it's actually about Surrounding yourself with a diverse set of people, people that you wouldn't naturally gravitate towards. I think this solves for a bunch of social ills, which is that, again, we tend to live in our silos. Right? And we're really averse to talking to people who have different points of view.[1:24:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: But I will tell you, at times, I've learned the most about myself. I've learned the most about my weaknesses and sometimes my strengths from talking with someone that I vehemently disagree with, And it's a really hard thing to do. It's very painful. But in terms of, like, edifying experiences go, It's through those conversations that I almost see this, like, mirror reflected back on me. Right?[1:24:58] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, wow. I'm much more aware of how I'm coming across to that person because they disagree with me about something or not someone I would normally fraternize with, and, it's just bred more self awareness in me. And so I would encourage people to actually seek out connections In uncomfortable spaces because, that will allow you to fill in at least some of the gaps. Now some of the gaps will truly only be revealed to you because of life experiences. So I'm thinking in my own life.[1:25:25] Dr. Maya Shankar: So I I thought I grieved in a very particular kind of way. And then during COVID, my husband and I experienced Multiple pregnancy losses with our surrogate, and I found myself grieving in a way that was completely foreign to me. I don't think talking to anyone would have revealed to me that I was gonna grieve in this very in this way work. Usually, I would reach out to people, and I would wanna stay connected. And I became so Shut off and closed off, and I didn't wanna talk to anyone for days after the losses.[1:25:51] Dr. Maya Shankar: I was so disoriented. There I learned, oh, actually, You can respond in a diverse set of ways to grief. Right? Like, you don't have a singular experience with grief, but I might have only learned that from the actual experience of confronting it. That said, I do think there's a lot of value in trying to fill in gaps in knowledge or a self awareness through these more, you know, quotidian conversations you have with people.[1:26:15] Andrew Huberman: I love love love what you said about deliberately placing oneself into environments where we receive Critical feedback from people that we view as quite disparate from us, at least in terms of our experience of them. You know? It's great. It was the great Carl Deisseroth, another, incredibly accomplished neuroscientist, happens to be a colleague of mine at at, Stanford who he's a psychiatrist, and he said, you know, we think we know how other people feel, but we really have no idea how other people feel Yeah. Unless we ask them.[1:26:48] Andrew Huberman: In fact, most of the time, we don't even really know how we feel. You know? We're not very good at gauging our own emotions. So credit to Carl for making that statement. But with that said, I think getting a sense of how other people see us and disagreement in particular, can be incredibly informative.[1:27:06] Andrew Huberman: I[1:27:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: just wanna say one other point on this, which is I think getting feedback from others almost gets a bad rap these days in society because it's like, you should only care about Who you are inside, who you know yourself to be. And I'm like, dude, we are social creatures. It absolutely matters how I come off to others. I I think that should be a huge A huge part of my self identity should be how I impact others, and I I I think we should be shameless about integrating that into our understanding of self. If I Feel like I'm an excellent person inside, and I'm regularly wounding the people around me.[1:27:38] Dr. Maya Shankar: That matters. That's relevant to how I see myself. And so I do worry sometimes with the current the current cultural climate that we're pushing ourselves so much towards the space of, like, all that matters is Authenticity and being yourself. I mean, first of all, sometimes yourself isn't awesome. You might wanna actually optimize or, like, change some things about yourself to be better.[1:27:56] Dr. Maya Shankar: I think that's a good thing. And then second, you you it's okay to care what other people think. Usually, they're great barometers of things that you might not be aware of in terms of the impact you're having. So I just wanna, like, Be a lobbyist for caring what other people think. Just for a moment.[1:28:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I agree. This is one of the reasons why I say at the end of every episode that I do read all the comments on YouTube. You know, I think I was raised in a culture, an academic culture, where feedback on lectures, you know, student feedback was critical. I mean, it is important, I believe, to be a selective filter because, you know, when in the old days, we'll say, there was an opportunity to map statements to the grade that the student received, you can no longer do this.[1:28:37] Andrew Huberman: So you would often see that some of the worst, you know, some of the worst, feedback was, Hey. It's it's clear. Exactly. And then you'd look at their grade, and you'd say, well, okay. This helps us explain, and yet, it was also important to understand where that could have represented some failings on my part.[1:28:55] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And a classroom is one environment I think the online environment is where this gets tricky because of the way that, we all differ In our capacity to receive critical feedback, and sometimes the the harshness of one form of feedback sends people, you know, feeling, you know, back on their heels or feeling, you know, even ego or emotionally injured in ways that they actually feel is traumatic. And I think that's part of the problem is that we don't really have a, a a a way to gauge. I mean, we know inappropriate when we see it. We know appropriate when we see it, but all the stuff in between, because it's on a continuum really, is, is where it gets tricky.[1:29:38] Andrew Huberman: I I certainly think integrating the possibility that somebody might be right. What is it that they they say in, certain forms of personal developments? Like, you know, if somebody's coming with an argument about you, the best state of mind you could have is you might be right because that lets you hold your ground a bit. It's it still maintains a boundary, But you're not saying you're right, and you're not saying you're wrong. Mhmm.[1:29:59] Andrew Huberman: You you're sort of on you're in a in a kind of a flat footed stance where you could move either way. And I like that, this idea of, well, they might be right, and then you could say no or or yes. But in any case, I I just wanna throw out both hands and and, and as many Vote says I, can as 1 individual to say, yes. I totally agree. More, more direct Feedback and disagreement is great.[1:30:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's wonderful. And I think in science, you're used to people saying, harsh things about your work until they eventually say, okay. You can publish the paper.[1:30:32] Dr. Maya Shankar: That is true.[1:30:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. In the culture of skateboarding where, like, nothing's good enough, and then occasionally something's good. Yeah. And in the landscape of podcasting, I think the comment section is is a great way to, get feedback, and that's why I continue to encourage Feedback. It sounds like you do as well.[1:30:48] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:30:48] Dr. Maya Shankar: I think, you know, I I try to just every endeavor that I pursue, I try to approach with a lot of humility. And I think If I were to describe, you know, at work, right, I I lead this team, and I I think if you were to ask people, what my defining trait is as a leader, It's actually not like strong convictions. It's actually a willingness to update her opinions on things, her belief systems, her strategy Based on incoming information, I really, really pride myself on having a flexible mindset about stuff and not being stubborn. This is true in my marriage. Right?[1:31:20] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, my husband, Jimmy, and I really pride ourselves in, like, you know, saying, you know what? Based on what you just shared, I'm changing my mind. Like, you're right, and I'm wrong. Right? And if you can actually start to value that, You could start to see that as a a virtuous quality.[1:31:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: I think historically, right, when we think about leadership, we've thought about people who have are incredibly resolute in their convictions, but that doesn't allow the space to, again, beige and update. You know? Update your mindset when you get new information or you realize that you aired in some way in terms of the logic that you used or what have you. And, I've been extremely intentional in every sphere that I worked in to have this very open mind and to be very open to critical feedback. It does not mean that I take every piece of feedback.[1:32:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay? Obviously, I have some criteria I use to decide whether it's meaningful feedback or it's not meaningful feedback. Right? But the locus of my pride is not in have being right or having the strong conviction. It is actually in my willingness to have, a more dynamic state of mind regarding lots of issues.[1:32:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: Maybe that's maybe that's just what it means to be a scientist. Right? Like, you have to be willing to update In the face of new information.[1:32:37] Andrew Huberman: I am nodding. For those that are listening, I'm just nodding and thinking yes, yes, and and more yes because I think that, we all need more of that as individuals. And if we can't get it from our work setting or group setting, sometimes asking a friend can be Extremely so I have a friend. He happens to be a, professor at the University of Back East. I won't embarrass him by, disclosing where he's at.[1:32:59] Andrew Huberman: But I recall as a A junior faculty member because he knows me well. He's a few years behind me in our career trajectories, but asking him for an honest assessment, I asked for the most brutally honest assessment for me that He could give and some of it stung. Some of it stung. He was, relating some ways in which I show up as a friend and I'm super present, then I this tendency. I'm pretty introverted.[1:33:20] Andrew Huberman: I'll disappear for long periods of time. Mhmm. In college, they called me dart because I'd show up at parties. I'd be there, and then I would disappear for, like, 2 weeks and just be in my box, Say hi to people and just keep going. You know?[1:33:28] Andrew Huberman: Sort of in and out of connection. I I've worked hard to to change that over the years. I, I think I have, but who knows? In any event, a a friend who knows us well that you insist on alright. Don't give me any compliments.[1:33:42] Andrew Huberman: You know? Just give me the harsh stuff. That can be very useful.[1:33:46] Dr. Maya Shankar: And that reminds me of some research, by Ethan Cross. So he looks at how we can tame our mental chatter. And, if you don't have the friend available to you, there is a really easy distancing technique that you can use when you're in the of a problem where you are trying to actively re reframe something or maybe see where your blind spots are, and that's by thinking about your problem from a third person perspective versus a 1st person perspective. So you play the role of someone who's giving advice to a friend in your head, but that friend is actually you. And it actually promotes Some degree of objectivity and, like, emotional distance from that, again, that that fuzzy, hazy set of feelings that you have around the emotion.[1:34:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? You're trying to, like, get rid of that piece so that you can bring, a slightly more sober recommendation to the situation. So that can be really helpful. And then, the other thing to do is I think when we are when we're facing challenges, when we're going through a hard time, we do have an instinct to want to vent. Right?[1:34:46] Dr. Maya Shankar: And, again, in this era of vulnerability and whatnot, we're told, like, yes. Share everything that's on your mind. It can actually be counterproductive to vent. And the reason for that is that when you're venting about a hard situation that you're going through or something that you're frustrated about with yourself, Typically, the person you've invited into the conversation, they're a nice empathetic person. They wanna make you feel better.[1:35:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so what What do they do? They offer emotional balm in this situation. They're like, oh my god. That does sound terrible. You were so wronged.[1:35:15] Dr. Maya Shankar: I'm so sorry you went through that. Instead of playing the role of what Ethan calls, like, a cognitive adviser, which is actively trying to challenge the narrative you're telling about your situation, Actively trying to get you to, question whether the way you're portraying the situation is accurate and actually trying to get you to reframe aspects of the situation. And so when we think about venting, when it comes to, again, filling in those blind spots about ourselves, you you might wanna tell your friend at the outset. Like, you you even said, Lay off the, you know, the nice stuff. I just wanna hear the hard stuff.[1:35:48] Dr. Maya Shankar: You want you wanna tell your friend at the beginning, look. I'm having this challenge with my colleague at work, For this guy at the gym's giving me a really tough time. I don't know what's going on. I'm gonna have here here's the here's the situation. Rather than trying to make me feel better about the situation, I want you to actively find holes poke holes in the way that I'm thinking about this thing so that I can try and find Some reframing strategies to see the situation from a different vantage point.[1:36:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: So these are all called distancing techniques. Right? 3rd person versus first person. And, actually, there's some really interesting neuroscience, research showing that when we view our problems and our ourselves from a third person perspective, neural activity in areas associated with hostility and aggression actually decrease. And so that can be really helpful when it comes to, you know, resolving interpersonal conflict or trying to see where you might have been wrong.[1:36:37] Andrew Huberman: I love these examples because especially the one where One does it on their own. It truly doesn't require anything[1:36:43] Dr. Maya Shankar: except introverted Andrew. Still do this. You don't even have to go to the party and then ghost everyone.[1:36:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, I don't yeah. Back then, it would have been there were no cell phones, but, or smartphones rather, but it, yeah, it was a bit of ghosting. It was just I my my I can reset with small numbers of people that I'm close to, but, you know, I I found at that time a need to to go into An isolated space to do what I need to do to reset myself. And, but I realized there are certain forms of communication that are still required.[1:37:11] Andrew Huberman: Like, I'm alive. You know? I still get this. I still get this from my mother every once in a while. She's like, you know, if if you don't reach out, and not only do do I not know what's happening with you, but I also don't know if you're okay.[1:37:21] Andrew Huberman: And I'm thinking I'm a grown man. Of course, I'm a fine. And I and then I, of course, use the the worst possible response that any son or child could give, which is, listen. If something happened to me, like, someone, like, the police would contact you or They'll let you know. Yeah.[1:37:32] Andrew Huberman: The the hospital would contact you, which is not reassuring. So kids everywhere. Call your parents. Poor mother, Andrew. I know.[1:37:38] Andrew Huberman: I know.[1:37:39] Dr. Maya Shankar: Just call her a bit more. Come on.[1:37:40] Andrew Huberman: Well, you know, still working on it. I'm just kidding. It is a work in progress. Venting. It I'm so glad that you brought this up.[1:37:49] Andrew Huberman: You know, I think that there are these buzzwords now, you know, authenticity. You know, I do think that there are certain forms of communication that that can be injurious to people, and yet I think having some internal buffers to to that all that incoming stuff. I mean, it is important. I mean, you can't be online, and I think everyone is pretty much online these days, without having some policies for oneself and how you're gonna deal with this stuff. How am I gonna be a selective filter?[1:38:19] Andrew Huberman: I I think knowing the ends of the continuum, like, you know, This is clearly, benevolent, kind discourse. This is clearly bad. I'm gonna block this or get rid of it. But then Within that middle range, having some rules and policies for how to filter it, either by time of day that you look at it or getting input. But considering the You know?[1:38:41] Andrew Huberman: It might be true. It might not be true. Yeah. Right? What people are saying.[1:38:44] Dr. Maya Shankar: And like you said, you know, you were talking about memory and how we tend to overweight negative, experiences. And I did find myself, like, so I gave the speech, and it was posted. And I I I was looking at the comments, and I literally like, anytime my brain coded a comment as positive, I just skipped right past it. I was I was literally just searching for the negative Stop.[1:39:05] Andrew Huberman: As as if it's as if the positive is generic and the negative is is somehow genuine.[1:39:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes. And I had to make it a mental I had to make a mental note. Hey. It's okay to marinate in the the the messages that are saying that this really helped them in some way, and they really enjoyed the thing. And I hope you would.[1:39:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: People, I think it takes an extra step to remind yourself to also read the good stuff, and to allow that stuff to count too.[1:39:30] Andrew Huberman: Well, we did an episode on gratitude, and one of the, big surprises that came to me in researching for that episode was that, the best evidence for gratitude having positive effects on neurocircuitry, neurochemistry, 3 comes from when we receive gratitude as opposed to give gratitude. This is what's often lost in the discussion about gratitude. So all the more incentive give gratitude and and to be aware of when it's coming your way and internalize it. There is a small category of people out there, I think, Hopefully, small that, so, bask in positive feedback that it amplifies their narcissism, but it's clear that you are not, Oh, one of those people. So 0 minus 1 risk of of that happening.[1:40:13] Andrew Huberman: I wanna talk a little bit about Goals as it relates to motivation. Yes. Because you've done stuff. You've done a lot of, important, Work and and what I consider is organization of this what would otherwise be a pretty complex space. You know?[1:40:30] Andrew Huberman: What is more important to most people than being motivated and focused and excited, hopefully, on on endeavors that they enjoy and that inspire delight? But tell us about what cannot just initiate, but what can sustain motivation. Because we've talked about the dopamine system on this podcast many times before, but that's a pretty reductionist way to look at it. And you have a different perspective that I I've really benefited from learning a bit about.[1:40:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So when it comes to goals, I mean, it's first important to recognize that there's 2 parts of a goal. Okay? So there's the way that we define the goal, And then there's the way that we pursue the goal. And I think we tend to overlook the 1st category, how we define the goal, because oftentimes, Our goals seem like they should be so obvious to us.[1:41:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? I wanna lose weight. I wanna avoid sleeping late so that I get a good night sleep. Wanna build muscle mass. Right?[1:41:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, these are things that just seem like they should just be intuitive. Right? But what research and behavioral science shows is that not all Goal frames are made equal. In fact, really small tweaks to the way that we frame our goals can have an outsized impact on whether or not we're successful at reaching that goal. So one such framing is whether you frame your goals in terms of an approach Orientation or an avoidance orientation.[1:41:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: So let me talk about what this means. So an approach orientation would be, I want to eat healthier foods. Right? Avoidance would be, I wanna avoid unhealthy foods. Okay.[1:42:00] Dr. Maya Shankar: So in the context of, say, your social life, approach would be, I want to be in a relationship. I wanna enter a relationship. Avoidance would be, I want to avoid feeling loneliness. Okay? I wanna avoid feeling, isolated.[1:42:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: Now the reason why these 2 frames are important to consider is that they can have a different impact on our motivational states, And they can also have a different impact on the emotional response that we have to success and failure in these domains. So what we tend to find is that when you frame something in an approach orientation way, when you succeed, That success is met with feelings of pride and accomplishment. We find that it leads to a boost in motivation, boosts endurance, it burst boosts perseverance. Okay? When you frame something in terms of avoidance, success is met with feelings of calm and relief.[1:42:56] Dr. Maya Shankar: So kind of like a, Oh, wipe the forehead. Like, thank goodness I avoided that calamitous outcome or thank goodness I avoided doing that really bad thing.[1:43:03] Andrew Huberman: Back to neutral.[1:43:04] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Exactly. And so it is fine to frame goals in terms of avoidance, and, actually, sometimes it's just personality dependent. Like, some people are more driven by fear or they need a lot more urgency to drive them. But it is important to know that the approach orientation is on average more motivating.[1:43:24] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so you might wanna think of reframing your goal in terms of approach versus avoidant. The other advantage to approach is that When you frame something as avoidant, right, I wanna avoid doing x, I wanna avoid doing y, it's really hard to measure success. Right? It's like, Are you really tracking every time you're tempted by the chocolate chip cookie and you don't actually eat it? That's really hard to measure.[1:43:46] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? And we do better when we can measure success and failure. Right? It's much easier to track the number of times you approach a salad. Right?[1:43:54] Dr. Maya Shankar: You approach something that's healthy. And so, anyway so it's it's really interesting to see how they got this really subtle shift, and we see this across this the The board in behavioral science can have such a big impact on on behavior. And, on this framing thing, I'll just share one little anecdote from my time working in government. So We were trying to motivate veterans to sign up for a, employment and educational assistance program. So this is after their years of service.[1:44:21] Dr. Maya Shankar: And this is a really important benefit that the government offers for free because the transition from military to civilian life can be very fraught with a lot of, psychological and physical obstacle obstacles. And so I remember the Department of Veterans Affairs, they had almost no money to to fund a marketing program this, they said, Maya and team, we've got 1 email that we're gonna send to vets and, like, have at it, but that's all we're working with. And my teammates and I ended up changing just one word in this email message. Instead of telling vets that they were eligible for the program, We simply reminded them that they had earned it through their years of service,[1:45:00] Andrew Huberman: and[1:45:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: that one word change led to a 9% increase in access to the benefit. And it's, it's based in a psychological principle called the endowment effect, which says that we value things more when we own them or in this case have earned them. And so I shared this example only to say, like, that is such a small change. Right? But we we just know that, again, these small little tweaks the way that we talk to ourselves, the way that we frame our goals can have a really big impact on our behavior.[1:45:27] Andrew Huberman: I'm fascinated by that result. Some people hearing it might think, okay, 9%. Is that really that great? But we're talking about a one word change, and I'm[1:45:38] Dr. Maya Shankar: And the scale of the federal government.[1:45:40] Andrew Huberman: Right? So 9% of your organizations. Hard hard to hard to, Argue that things, change quickly in big organizations, a discussion for another time. But eligible versus earned. I mean, again, I come back to this possibility that there's something about words like earned that invoke a verb state within us that makes us more action oriented, similar to being able to see ourselves in some Landscape that can evoke delight or awe as opposed to just seeing the landscape that evokes delight or awe.[1:46:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm really hung up on this because I think, one of the major challenges it seems for behavioral change is that Most people do wait for the the stick as opposed to feeling into the carrot, so to speak. I mean, all you have to do is look at the enormous number of people who are struggling with health related, issues for which There's now a lot of active debate. Is it genetically determined or etcetera? And setting all that aside, it's just very clear that there are a number of behavioral things, Sunlight, sleep, exercise, social connection, nutrition, among among them that There's no pill for.[1:47:00] Andrew Huberman: There's no injection for. There's absolutely no replacement for. So getting people to change their behavior is hard. Yes. Telling people that they're capable sometimes helps but doesn't seem sufficient.[1:47:12] Andrew Huberman: So what what are some more of these, Verb states that people, you think can internalize that give them access to the real sense of possibility and get them Changing their behavior.[1:47:25] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. And behavior change is very hard. I sometimes bristle at some of the, like, hacks that I see online because I'm like, I think there's a lot of evidence that supports that this works. So, you know, what I'm sharing today is actually backed by, you know, really high quality research. One of my friends and, mentors Ayelet Fishbach has done a lot of this work at the University of Chicago on goal setting and motivation.[1:47:48] Dr. Maya Shankar: A a couple other things for people to consider and by the way, I love this space because I'm obsessed with goals. Right? So I love getting better at things, and I'm I I'm using all of these insights in my own life, so It is truly a delight to get to share them. Okay. Sidebar.[1:48:01] Andrew Huberman: Important sidebar, I would argue, because you live you live this stuff. Right? You don't just research it. You live it.[1:48:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes. It's it's totally me search or whatever they call it. So, who sets the goal matters? So a lot of us work with Coaches, trainers, mentors, bosses, that's great. It's really, really helpful for people in our lives to bring structure to our goals, to Push us along to motivate us.[1:48:26] Dr. Maya Shankar: But when other people are setting our goals, setting our targets for us, it undermines a really valuable source motivation, which is being in the driver's seat. We love steering in our lives. We love feeling agency. See, we love recruiting our own agency when it comes to achieving our goals. And so and and and and, you know, we talked about how people will go to irrational lengths to avoid, feeling uncertainty.[1:48:52] Dr. Maya Shankar: People also go to a rational lengths to preserve their agency and control over a situation. So there's some really interesting research that's come out just in the last few years showing that humans prefer to use their judgment over an algorithm that they know performs better than their judgment, but did not involve them. Okay? And they're much more satisfied with the outcomes when it when it's them that's in the driver's seat. Right?[1:49:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so, what this means, I think, in everyday context is not to do away with, like, trainers and coaches and whatnot. Every trainer and coach is listening. Don't hate me. Okay? You're you're sticking around.[1:49:27] Dr. Maya Shankar: But what they can do is they can build some something of a choice set into your day to day programming. Right? So let's say that at work, you have a certain skill that you're trying to build. Ask for a set of options to choose from. Own the targets more.[1:49:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: You will see a boost in motivation. Let's say you're working out with a trainer. They're like, it's leg day. Okay. I'm gonna own some of my targets.[1:49:49] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? Are we gonna go heavy hard on dead lifts? Are we gonna go squats, whatever it is. And so build some agency, into the experience because nothing supplants that kind of intrinsic drive and the feeling that You own the success or the failure, that again, I I think to your earlier point, what we're really trying to do with some of these behavioral insights is Capitalize on our natural state as humans. Right?[1:50:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, what drives us? And it turns out we really love being in control. Well, why don't we monopolize on that When it comes to, our goal pursuit. Right? So we're trying to figure out those areas of psychology that we can leverage.[1:50:25] Andrew Huberman: That's fantastic. The word agency is so key here. I think and it explains that earlier result, the shock experiment. People having agency over 100 their their response to 100% of the time, you know, at least it's it's giving them some sense of control and mitigating it. Whereas when When it's random, 5050 Yeah.[1:50:46] Andrew Huberman: For or rather, when it's random 50% of the trials, then, even though the outcome is better on the whole, It's a it's perceived somehow as a reduction in agency. There's something fundamental there for sure. When I started my laboratory and it there was, An additional pressure to publish papers. This is before getting tenure. I used to ask students and postdocs when the the paper would be ready.[1:51:11] Andrew Huberman: And then finally, I stopped asking and just said, why don't you tell me when the deadline is?[1:51:17] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes.[1:51:18] Andrew Huberman: And Not a single one failed, or rather I should put it in the positive light. Every single time, they succeeded in beating their estimate, because they were in control of that endpoint. Love that. So it was, at times, challenging for me. Yeah.[1:51:34] Andrew Huberman: You know? But they They set a date, and then if and also, by the way, if they need to extend that date outward, we did. That was their choice. Yeah. They said they need more time.[1:51:42] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The the rule in science that I think applies a lot of places is I always like the phrase, as fast as I carefully can because you don't wanna rush. Absolutely. But, but that sense of agency, I I like to think translated to, more joy for them. It certainly, there was a lot of productivity from them, if and they're might be listening to this, and so they can put in the comments whether or not I'm telling the truth here.[1:52:05] Andrew Huberman: They're all most of them are professors now,[1:52:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: So that's why probably means they succeeded.[1:52:08] Andrew Huberman: Well, they definitely succeeded. The question is whether or not I had anything to do with it. My adviser has always said, you know, the best thing you could do is support your students and postdocs and then just get out of their Way. Yeah. Because the really good ones are are you can't control them.[1:52:20] Andrew Huberman: You're just you're just trying to not screw things up for them. Yeah.[1:52:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So give you more information. Motivation there.[1:52:26] Andrew Huberman: Curious about the difference between loan pursuits and group pursuits because I know you understand a lot about groups, I wanna make sure that we talk about, groupthink, although that has such a negative connotation. But the way that we tend to, Kind of, revert to the mean when it comes to our thinking and our opinions and certainly our, explanations of who's right and who's wrong when we are in a collection of like minded people. Yeah. This could also be, you know, phrased as what are the dangers of being among like minded people? And and then we'll relate that back to motivation.[1:53:01] Andrew Huberman: But what are the dangers of being among like minded people?[1:53:05] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. I mean, well, in the context of Goals and motivation, it can be very, very helpful to be in the context of like minded people. And the reason for that is We often don't see failure up close when it comes to people pursuing their goals, but if we are in the presence of people whose values we share, who have a similar commitment to doing something, And we see up close that they sometimes have those days where they fail or we have the vulnerability to show when we failed, that can actually increase our resolve that the goals that we are trying to achieve are be possible. Okay? I think the danger of being in the the like minded spaces is around how it limits your your frame of mind.[1:53:41] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? So When it comes to the ideas that you have, when it comes to the convictions you have around your points of view, it can be very dangerous to only be in the in the echo chamber. And, again, because I wanna give people strategies to challenge their way of thinking without them having to socialize for all the introverts out there. I have a lot of compassion. I I have I have introverted tendencies, so I get it.[1:54:01] Dr. Maya Shankar: One helpful thought experiment you can use when you feel like maybe you're spending a little bit too much time around people who are just reinforcing whatever viewpoints you have is to ask how your belief system and your I your ideas and your opinions of things might have been different Had you been born during a different time period and in a different family or cultural landscape? And what Happens when it comes to our viewpoints is that they become so tethered to our identities that we feel like if we were to jettison a certain belief or value, we would be jettisoning ourselves, And that feels way too threatening. It's way too destabilizing to engage in that. But the minute you imagine what it would have been like to be to have been born in a family with a different religious belief system, with a different value system. All of a sudden, you transport your same self.[1:54:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? I'm still Maya into this new environment, and you start to see how nonprecious some of your beliefs are. Right? Maybe they don't have the sacred quality that you thought that they did, And so you might be more open to changing your mind, more open and receptive to challenging your own points of view if you engage in that that pot experiment.[1:55:09] Andrew Huberman: I recall you discussing a description of people watching a game of sport that involve bad calls.[1:55:19] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. Yeah. Controversial referee calls.[1:55:20] Andrew Huberman: Referee calls. Yeah. If you could share with us a little bit about that result because I find it really interesting, especially the part where, the experimenters can swap the identities of the teams in in theory, and then, well, basically, what people come to realize is that Our perception of the outside world is strongly informed by the group that we see ourselves in and often to our own detriment.[1:55:46] Dr. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. Yeah. So this is a study from the 19 fifties. And and to your point, you know, we tend to think, okay. We're human beings.[1:55:52] Dr. Maya Shankar: We're really enlightened. We're making decisions, and we're, engaging in judgments of things based on data and evidence and facts and, you know, surely my visual system wouldn't lie to me, so whatever I See, if it's gonna be true and vertical vertical representation of the world and, like, not true. Okay? A lot of our, beliefs, and these are these are strong beliefs. I mean, again, they're they're what we believe to be fact about the world is informed by our group membership.[1:56:19] Dr. Maya Shankar: So in this study, Loyal, fans of 2 opposing football teams watch these controversial, plays. Right? So where the referee made a call and they weren't quite certain if it was, like, in or out, let's say. And, depending on your loyalty to the team, to whatever sports team, right, whichever side you were on, You're much more likely to favor calls that were made on your teams, in in your in your team's favor. And, You know, when you ask people coming out of a study like this, it's not like, yep.[1:56:51] Dr. Maya Shankar: I knew I was biased. Like, I knew that I was basing my judgment of these referee calls based not my affiliation and my love of of team x or team y. You wouldn't think that. You think you were an arbiter of truth in this situation. You're just recalling what your visual system saw.[1:57:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I think that shows how powerful these social forces are, how powerful our group affiliations are because it can truly change The way that you see stuff. Right? Of course, it can then transform the way that you think about stuff. And so that to me is a powerful reminder that When we are in disagreement with someone else, and we just try to bombard them with facts. Right?[1:57:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: I mean, like, you're a scientist. Right? So if you're Hearing someone say something and you're like, that's not that's not accurate. That's not true. Your your instinct probably say, but have you heard about the 2017 study, the peer reviewed journal article that from PubMed.[1:57:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? And but when you recognize that actually a large part of our belief system, emerges from the groups that we identify with. It's I think there's there's an inspiring lesson that comes from this, so we shouldn't be too disheartened by the fact that this is true, But it helps round out our understanding of why it is that people believe the things they do. And as a result, we have more resources at hand to try to understand how we can change their minds. Right?[1:58:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: So one of the guys that I interviewed on my podcast, his name is Daryl Davis. He's a black jazz musician, And, he was confronted by a member of the Ku Klux Klan at one of his performances, and it led talk about a slight change of plans. I mean, he just went on a totally different life path and ended up, convincing dozens of people to leave white supremacy groups, including the Ku Klux Klan. And, you know, when it when it comes to Daryl and his approach, well, one, he recruited people's agencies. So he never imply to them, oh, I'm trying to change your mind.[1:58:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: He inspired he always says, like, I didn't convince them, Maya. They convinced themselves to change their mind, so he recruited their agency. But he also tried his absolute hardest to not question their fundamental and underlying humanity. Right? So he tried to understand, Like, why are you part of this group, this vile, vitriolic group?[1:59:04] Dr. Maya Shankar: And some people would share, well, you know, it's a family tradition thing. My father was in the clan. My My grandfather's in the clan. Look. None of this excuses being in a hate group.[1:59:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay? But at least gave Daryl an understanding of standing of some of the the factors that were pushing them towards the group so that he might offer that sense of community, that sense of belonging somewhere else, maybe outside of the hate group. Right? But if he thought that he was actually just fighting over facts over whether African Americans should be treated, equal to everyone else, then he would have lost that that, argument because he wasn't even fighting with the right currency. Right?[1:59:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: What was relevant? So, what was so I mean, this is my it was the 1st episode of A Slight Change of Plans we ever released and continues to be my favorite because What was so thrilling about this interview is that the strategies Darryl used to convince people to change their minds, again, of these deeply entrenched horrific views, We're totally corroborated by the science of how we change people's minds. So he did he used a lot of really effective strategies just intuitively. Like, he's just a mastermind behavioral scientist just by virtue of who he is, but he he showed genuine curiosity, for why it is they believe what they did, which is, again, Extremely hardens I would not have had the equanimity to show genuine curiosity for why someone is in the Ku Klux Klan, but he showed that curiosity. He increased, the his question to statement ratio, so it's really important to ask people a lot of questions.[2:00:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: And then and then he would ask people, a really important question, which is, well, what in theory could change your mind? Like, what evidence would I have to give you in order to change your mind about x, y, or z? And the reason that I love asking that question is that it presupposes that someone ought to be willing to change their mind in the face of new information. So this harkens back to the conversation we're having earlier about the importance of having a malleable state of mind and being willing to update in the face of new info. Now if the person in response says, literally, Nothing will change my mind.[2:01:02] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay. Well, then you know it's not worth your time to have the disagreement with them. Mhmm. But if they give you a little bit and say, well, maybe I would change my mind on Vaccines, if you were to tell me x, y, or z, maybe I would change my minds on my mind on immigration reform if you were to tell me, you know, this or that. Now you have an in.[2:01:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? But you do need to get them into the state of mind where they think, yeah. I guess, in theory, I could change my mind about this thing that I feel absolutely resolute about.[2:01:27] Andrew Huberman: I've never worked in public policy, but I feel very strongly that where I see failures, en mass of, you know, public health policy or educational policy, Almost always, there seems to be a failure of even interest in understanding what motivates the other side's position.[2:01:51] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[2:01:51] Andrew Huberman: And this is where I just this actually gets me, frustrated to the point of motivated where it's like people are saying you're wrong. You're wrong. No this. No that. To the point of It's almost maddening and far more seldom, do we see people saying, you know, Okay.[2:02:11] Andrew Huberman: I'm I'm gonna 3rd person myself, or I'm gonna put myself in the other person's shoes and say, like, you know, why might they feel that way? Why would this person be listening to this individual as opposed to this public health, individual. Yeah. And, look, you know, without taking any stance on this because it's a much bigger conversation than we wanna have right now, I could look at public health officials that just completely failed to understand the other side's position and vice versa. And that to me just says it's a communication failure.[2:02:43] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And I'll I'll take this out of the, COVID pandemic discussion as it's normally had and say that, you know, one thing that we know for sure is that in the 2020 to Really 2022, but still 2023, landscape, there were so many mental health concerns. Right? Everybody. Right?[2:03:03] Andrew Huberman: Regardless of where people were on the vaccine debate, mass debate, lockdown debate, regardless of any of that, everyone's stress level was elevated.[2:03:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: Absolutely.[2:03:11] Andrew Huberman: And there were Very, very few, top down from at the level of government's discussions about how to maintain circadian rhythm and sleep health, how to maintain Health in general in that landscape.[2:03:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: Mhmm.[2:03:24] Andrew Huberman: And that for for me was just really shocking. It was also one of the reasons why we launched the podcast, frankly, is that I really feel that the tools We're needed by everybody and should be zero cost to everybody. But what was clear is there was so much Pointing of fingers and name calling and and violence even that no one was saying, like, why would people feel this way? Why would people trust these sources as opposed to these sources. And we can only conclude if we're good scientists that, the the landscape was ineffective.[2:03:56] Andrew Huberman: Right? It was just in effect, and it continues. I mean, if you go if you have the, the desire to take a reduction in dopamine by going on Twitter and following this back and forth that continues today, It's it's pretty ugly still. None of it seems really solution oriented. There are few people out there who are trying to make it solution oriented, but, not really.[2:04:16] Andrew Huberman: And so I I don't wanna, you know, go into the the dark aspects here, but but it does seem like, this willingness to take a look at why others might feel the opposite of how we feel Mhmm. Is a very rare Quality. And this gentleman, Darryl, what was his last name?[2:04:33] Dr. Maya Shankar: Davis.[2:04:33] Andrew Huberman: I think I've I've seen a number of things with him. It's I mean, he's obviously extraordinary, but we call him that because People like him were exceedingly rare. So what can we do to cultivate that kind of mindset? Yeah. Because I'm not pointing fingers here.[2:04:47] Andrew Huberman: I mean, I think we all have this default tendency To gather evidence the way that we gather evidence, draw conclusions, and then stand our ground. And I think it's detrimental to to everyone.[2:04:59] Dr. Maya Shankar: So you're making me reflect on probably the greatest gift that being a cognitive scientist has given me in my life. Obviously, it's fed my curiosity. It's been a delight to study things and learn things, but the greatest gift it has given me is empathy towards people. It is the greatest driver of human empathy, to learn how our minds work, and I don't know if there's a substitute for that. Partly, that's why I started a slight change of plans.[2:05:26] Dr. Maya Shankar: We have story episodes where you hear from people like Daryl, but I interview scientists from all over the world about their areas of expertise. And I genuinely believe But the more we learn about how the mind works, the more we learn from my field of cognitive science about how we make decisions, how we develop our attitudes and beliefs about the world, How we come to be the people that we are, the more we can bridge these empathy gaps. And it's been profound for me. I mean, I feel so lucky to have been Steeped in this literature for decades now, but my hope is to invite people into the conversation because the more you learn about why people are the way they are, The more empathy you can extend and the more I'm not even saying you got it. You need to extend an olive branch.[2:06:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: I'm not saying that you need to compromise your own belief system, But at least you see that there might be an entry point, a reason to have a discussion with this person who believes things that are completely different from you. And I we talked about gratitude a bit in this conversation. I feel immense gratitude that I have a posture of empathy as I move around in this world because I reg I mean, I have I have strong beliefs on things. I care a lot. I care about reducing human suffering, and then I meet someone who I think is pro a policy that promotes human suffering.[2:06:37] Dr. Maya Shankar: And, of course, The visceral human instinct is like, to hell with you and your viewpoint. This is horrible. This is intolerable. But because I have this cognitive science hat on, It allows me to walk around with a slightly different viewpoint, and I really feel that I'm a better person as a result of that. And I and I've heard from listeners of a slight change of plans when they listen to these science episodes, whether it's the science of loneliness, the science of empathy, the science of meditation, like, we're I try to bring this empathetic spin to to understanding, again, neuroscience and psychology.[2:07:09] Dr. Maya Shankar: They have found that they are Kinder to others. And so that's that's probably the best feedback that I've ever received on the show. It's like people are like, I'm a nicer person to other people now, especially the ones I don't agree with.[2:07:21] Andrew Huberman: And presumably to themselves as well. I mean, I know, you've brought up the topic of empathy as a way to Prevent burnout. Mhmm. Right? That, and here, we're not just talking about job burnout.[2:07:32] Andrew Huberman: We're talking about the burnout that is Inherent to, like, any long term pursuit that's challenging, raising kids, being in a family. What is the great Ram Dass Quote, you know, think you're enlightened, go spend a week with your parents. You know, that like, that's, you know, like, no matter how enlightened you are, if I you know? I love that. That's always I remind myself that I love my parents.[2:07:53] Andrew Huberman: I love my parents, but when you, you know, you it's just a completely different I love that. Frame shift. So but also kind to oneself. I mean, I think There's starting to be some good neuroscience at the mechanistic level of of empathy. Mhmm.[2:08:06] Andrew Huberman: Clearly, it empathy is not the default State for most people, it's something that we need to cultivate as a practice and that we can cultivate as a practice along the lines of empathy, but Also returning to the topic that we opened today's discussion with, you know, we build these narratives about ourselves starting in adolescence, Maybe even earlier[2:08:27] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[2:08:28] Andrew Huberman: And through our teen years, and we have various experiences. But I'm curious how we can continue to build narratives about ourselves and the role of narrative, you know, the the I statements, the I am statements. Yeah. And whether or not you, and we should all spend some time, you know, doing this. I mean, these days, you know, people exercise because we know it's good for us.[2:08:51] Andrew Huberman: Hope people get sunlight because they know it's great for them, that people perhaps have a meditation practice or a therapy practice or a journaling practice. But How is it that we can continue to evolve our narratives about self in a way that promotes some or all of the things that we've been talking about today?[2:09:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So empathy is really interesting because I think, we have a lot of misconceptions about it, and we have misconceptions about how empathetic we actually are. I would argue people are more empathetic than they think, and let me tell you why. So this comes from research by my my friend, Jamille Zaki at Stanford. There's 3 distinct types of empathy a lot of people don't know about.[2:09:28] Dr. Maya Shankar: So the first kind is emotional empathy, and this is the one that feels very intuitive to most of So it's this visceral reaction I have. You tell me that you've had a really hard time. My eyes start to well up. I start I I can truly feel your pain, And, I just feel what you feel. Okay?[2:09:45] Dr. Maya Shankar: And that typically is the is what people think of when they think of empathy, period. They overlook 2 other types of empathy. The 2nd type is called cognitive empathy. This is the ability to accurately diagnose what it is that's causing You distress in this moment and what it is that I could offer up to you to try to help ameliorate some of your suffering. The third kind is called empathic concern or it's known as compassion as well, which is the actual desire to help you, the desire to help another person.[2:10:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: And what's so interesting about these 3 types of empathy is that they don't correlate within people. You can be really high in the emotional empathy scale. Right? You can have Tears streaming down your face as you hear about your friend's divorce, but you might be really bad at diagnosing what it is that's causing them distress. You might be really bad at actually offering up, a solution to their problem, or you might lack the will.[2:10:41] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? Like, if you're sociopathic, you might just not have the will to help someone. Right? And, what's so interesting is that I think in our society, and this this relates back to identity and and and the labels we give ourselves, I think our society puts a huge premium on emotional empathy, and we discount people who don't have that visceral response, and we just immediately say, oh, they're not empathetic. And this happens from the time that we're really little, by the way.[2:11:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: Like, the kid who's crying on the playground comforting their friend. They're like, wow. That that kid's got a ton of empathy. My older kid doesn't seem to really care about people, but they might excel in cognitive empathy. They might excel when it comes to compassion empathic concern.[2:11:20] Dr. Maya Shankar: So one of the things I was talking about with Jamille on a slight change of plans is, you know, maybe we ought to think about Empathy languages in the same way we think about love languages. People have different ways of expressing their empathy, and we ought to value them equally. And, that's been wonderful because I think even in the past, like, I would have had a really hard situation. And I go to one of my friends, and They just seem, like, a little bit more stoic, and I'm like, do you even give a shit? Like, why do you not care as much as I want you to care?[2:11:49] Dr. Maya Shankar: It turns out they're fantastic at wanting to help me and understanding what's wrong with me. And, I love the idea of giving a little more love to those second 2 buckets because I think it'll allow to better recruit more empathy from others and also to see ourselves differently. To maybe for those people out there who are like, I'm not a very empathetic person, you might actually be more empathetic than you think. The second thing I wanted to share is about burnout. Right?[2:12:13] Dr. Maya Shankar: So you talked a little about about burnout. People who rate really high on the emotional empathy scale tend to experience burnout at higher rates. So you can imagine health care workers, first responders. Essentially, what you're doing when you feel emotional empathy is you are you're you're Carrying the burden of the other person's pain so you can easily imagine how that can deplete you. And I think the instinct that we have when we're empathetic is to say, you know what?[2:12:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: I'm just gonna shut myself off. I had that experience in 2020. I was like, there's too much bad stuff happening around me. Like, I prefer to just not feel things. Thank you very much.[2:12:45] Dr. Maya Shankar: And so I tried to close myself off from natural emotional reactions I would have to things. But what Jamille's, research shows is that you don't actually have to. If you cultivate cognitive empathy and empathic concern, those can actually be protective against burnout. You don't have to do away with empathy altogether. You just have to shift gears and be more selective about the kind of empathy that you're investing in.[2:13:10] Dr. Maya Shankar: So I love this research. Again, it just, like, opens your mind up to this whole world of empathy that you might have thought of as more of this, like, the singular concept and allows there to be a little bit more grace space.[2:13:19] Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that there are different categories of empathy. It will also arm me with a response with ever hypothetically, someone says, I don't feel like really feeling what I'm feeling, and therefore, you're not empathic to my experience. I I I what where I rate on these scales isn't important, but, the snowshoe of cognitive empathy, I think, is really important and probably one that most people haven't heard of. I certainly haven't heard of it, But I like to think that it really does exist and that it's at least[2:13:47] Dr. Maya Shankar: And you might have it in spades.[2:13:49] Andrew Huberman: I I don't know.[2:13:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: You so.[2:13:50] Andrew Huberman: But you'd have to ask the people close to me, but, but that it is at least as important as the emotional empathy. Before we conclude, there is something that, I Unfortunately, pushed us past too quickly that I wanna return to because I think it's something that, so many people care about and live with each day, which is this issue of challenges with ongoing motivation. Mhmm. And forgive me for for, so a bit of an anachronism here. I'm sorry jumping back to this because I realized that I I pulled us off to another topic, but you've talked about the middle problem before.[2:14:23] Andrew Huberman: And it's and it's too important to, to not return to.[2:14:27] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[2:14:27] Andrew Huberman: So tell us about the middle problem and how we can overcome the middle problem.[2:14:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: And and before I do that, do you mind if I give just a couple short Strategies around goal setting, I just wanna make sure I round out that section.[2:14:38] Andrew Huberman: Not only would I not mind, I I I would be delighted.[2:14:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: I just wanna make sure again. I share the wisdom that's helped me so much in my personal life.[2:14:44] Andrew Huberman: Please do.[2:14:45] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay. So, I'll and I'll I'll try to be fast. So the first[2:14:48] Andrew Huberman: is Take your time. Yeah.[2:14:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: But people have these goals to reach. Right? I gotta get them got them out running. Yeah. So the first is to make sure that you are so we've already talked about approach versus avoidant goals.[2:14:59] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? We talked about how who sets the goal matters and how if it's you, it's better. Right? If you have some ownership over your targets. The third thing is to make sure that you're setting goals when you're in the same psychological and physiological state as the one you'll be in when you're actually pursuing the goal, because we tend to have what are known as this is again, Ayla Fishboxer.[2:15:21] Dr. Maya Shankar: We tend to have empathy gaps between our present day selves and our future selves, And that empathy gap can lead us to be very compassionate towards 4 PM on Sunday, watching TV, Maya. Right? And 6 AM, Maya, who I hope is gonna be at the gym, like, you know, killing herself with a really high intensity interval set or whatnot. And so If if it is 4 PM on Sunday, probably not the best time for you to say, I'm gonna go to the gym every day, 6 AM. If you actually are at the gym at 6 AM and you are Feeling viscerally the physiological pain, the psychological pain of having gotten up really early to do the workout, then it's reasonable for you to set that goal.[2:16:03] Dr. Maya Shankar: But it's kind of the opposite of, like they say, like, don't go to the supermarket hungry. Right? Actually, in this situation, you want to be in exactly the same physiological and and psychological state you'll be in when you're in goal pursuit. It'll make it much more likely that you set reasonable goals than you actually reach them. The second thing, that you might wanna think about is, So I don't know about you, Andrew, but I feel like I'm a goal purist by nature.[2:16:24] Dr. Maya Shankar: So when I set a goal, the minute I, Like, fall off even slightly, the goal is gone for me. Okay? And I'm like, I messed up. Like, let's start from the beginning. Let's start from scratch.[2:16:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: I need a new goal. I've already I've already messed up, and it doesn't matter. So I I feel like unless I I I achieve perfection in achieving my goals, I get very frustrated, and I just fall off the wagon completely. So one thing that researchers have shown is that it's really helpful to build in what's called an emergency reserve into your goal setting or Slack is another way of putting it. So let's say I have a goal.[2:16:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: I wanna go to the gym every single day this month. It's really important and helpful full to give yourself, and you're not going soft on yourself, I promise, to give yourself, for example, 3 get out of jail free cards. 3 days where for whatever reason, it's okay that you didn't go to the gym. You got sick. Maybe you have kids who got sick.[2:17:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: You're just not feeling motivated. It doesn't really matter what the reason is. You didn't go to the gym, but the important thing is that you're still on track to achieving your goal even if you miss those 3 days because you've built them into the system. Okay. And the final thing I'll say about, setting the goal is to try to capitalize on A phenomenon known as the fresh start effect.[2:17:36] Dr. Maya Shankar: So this is work by my friend, Katie Milkman. She's a professor at Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania. So what she's found is that In our lives, we have these big milestone moments where we break from the past and we're entering a new future. Okay? This might be Moving across the country.[2:17:53] Dr. Maya Shankar: It could be getting a new job. It could be getting married. It could be whatever. Okay? But it feels like a big change, And that's a wonderful moment to try to introduce a new set of patterns into your life in part because, again, you have a break in identity, but, 2, it's really easy to introduce new habits when a lot of your environmental circumstances are different.[2:18:17] Dr. Maya Shankar: So I take a new job. All of a sudden, I have a new route to work. Probably a good idea to not introduce a pastry stop every time I go to work because I no longer passing by that bakery every morning. So you wanna capitalize on fresh starts of that kind. There's also, more arbitrary fresh starts that exist for all of us, this is in the form of the 1st day of the year, so, of course, New Year's resolutions, the 1st day of spring.[2:18:40] Dr. Maya Shankar: Even the 1st day of the week can be very motivating because we all like clean slates. We like wiping away the past. We like embarking on a new future, that's that's clean of failure and stumbling and whatnot, and so that could be a really powerful motivator.[2:18:55] Andrew Huberman: I love these suggestions, because I do think that we like a clean start. There's something to that. Who knows why? But I think it's it's, a universal trait. And perhaps shortening the time domain over which we think about our goals and success and failure could help.[2:19:12] Andrew Huberman: Like, if you just say, You know, the the clean start is this afternoon because this morning wasn't you know, didn't go so well. Yeah.[2:19:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: You don't have to surrender the whole week just because you messed up a Monday morning.[2:19:21] Andrew Huberman: That's right. Yeah. I'm sensing the perfectionist in you. And I know that there's it's a continuum. You know?[2:19:25] Andrew Huberman: Some people don't, I wanna say suffer from perfectionism because I think it's a it's a great attribute in in certain domains and, can be challenging in others. But, I love the idea of, having a little bit of grace, with one's goals, and also what You said earlier of making the carrot compelling, you know, and not so much focusing on just the stick. Yeah. Making the carrot more compelling, so much there. What about the middle problem?[2:19:55] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes. Okay.[2:19:56] Andrew Huberman: Because I do think that people, do tend to go go hard out the gate as it were, and then people drop off.[2:20:05] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So, yeah, all the stuff we talked about so far has been around Finding the goal, and now we need to think about how we sustain our motivation to pursue the goal, and this can be super hard. Again, behavior change is Incredibly, incredibly hard to sustain. So the middle problem. So the middle problem refers to the fact that We don't have stable amounts of motivation over the course of goal pursuit.[2:20:30] Dr. Maya Shankar: We tend to have a boost in motivation at the beginning of the pursuit. We all feel this viscerally. Right? I've decided I'm gonna do intermittent fasting, or I'm gonna make sure I look at, you know, the sun every morning, the first Moment that I get up or what whatever the goal is in that 1st day, you are so motivated to get it done. Right?[2:20:46] Dr. Maya Shankar: In fact, the 1st few days, the 1st few weeks. And then you experience a a boost in motivation, a higher amount of motivation towards the end of the goal. So we experience at the end of a goal what's known as the goal gradient effect. So we tend to Experience monotonic increases in motivation the closer we are to the finish line. So we might even see in marathon runners.[2:21:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? They're like, okay. I only have this remaining Hard to go. I can expend all my energy now to try to get over the finish line. There's a lull though in motivation in the middle of goal pursuit, And that's something that we wanna get ahead of.[2:21:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: We wanna solve for. Now, obviously, we cannot eliminate middles. Mathematically impossible to eliminate middles. So what do we do? Well, we do something that you already alluded to, which is actually we shorten the time duration of our goals.[2:21:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: So rather than setting an annual goal, Right? Let's say that it's the new year. You're inspired to try to make 2023 the best year ever. But what the problem with that is when you set an annual goal, now your middle is months long, you're gonna experience that decrease in motivation for a healthy chunk of the year, which is not ideal. If you set a weekly goal by contrast, All of a sudden, your middle's a lot shorter.[2:21:52] Dr. Maya Shankar: Right? All of a sudden, you're dealing with, like, a few days, maybe a day or 2. And so you wanna be mindful of of the duration, of the goal. Another thing that can help, Keep motivation high is to do, what my friend Katie Milkman calls temptation bundling. So this has never one been The my go to strategy for having done every unpleasant activity in my life that I've had to do.[2:22:17] Dr. Maya Shankar: Okay? Folding laundry, Doing the dishes. I actually really like working out like you do, so I don't need as much motivation, but sometimes I still need the for high intensity days, I do need the motivation to do, like, the the hard cardio. So to get on to get on, into working out in that way. So what is temptation bundling?[2:22:35] Dr. Maya Shankar: You're pairing An unpleasant activity like folding laundry, doing dishes, taking out the trash with an immediately rewarding, enjoyable activity. That can be listening to your favorite podcasts, which are, of course, the Huberman Lab and a slight change of plans, obviously. It could be listening to your favorite pop music. But the really critical piece of the temptation bundling is that you have to forego the indulgence of enjoying that rewarding activity in all other spaces of your life. So for example, for me, I feel like a good pop song.[2:23:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: I have, like, 25 really good listens, and then it kinda becomes old hat. Just like, you know, the excitement of the song wears wears off a bit. So there have been times where I'll be, like, cooking with my husband, and he's like, hey. Why don't we play, you know, you love Kacey Musgraves. Why don't we play that album?[2:23:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I'm like, no. No. No. No. That's an album I can only listen to when I'm, like, lifting weights.[2:23:28] Andrew Huberman: Maintain the potency.[2:23:30] Dr. Maya Shankar: You have to maintain the potency. Right? You don't allow yourself to get the joy and edification of the Huberman Lab when you're not Taking a walk and getting exposure to that morning sunlight. And, you know, it's such a simple strategy when you think about it, but I have found myself looking forward to Really annoying tasks that I have to get done because I know I'm gonna get the enjoyment of something really fun that accompanies it.[2:23:53] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. Is it important that The thing that one enjoys be done simultaneously.[2:23:59] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah.[2:23:59] Andrew Huberman: So folding laundry while watching the Netflix thing or, Listening to a particular piece of music.[2:24:05] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yeah. You want them to coexist because then again, you get that immediately or most of the time, the things that we lament doing have really positive long term outcomes. Right? If I'm, you know, in the habit of keeping my house clean, there's long term benefits. If I'm in the habit of exercising or eating healthily, there's long term benefits, but I don't often feel the rewards in real time.[2:24:23] Dr. Maya Shankar: So what you're trying to do is give yourself that rush of joy and excitement that accompanies the immediately rewarding activity so that in your mind, Even just like neurally, the 2 things are coexisting.[2:24:34] Andrew Huberman: I love it because it has such firm grounding in the neurobiology of reward and aversion and how to overcome aversion. There's deep neuroscience around this, but I've never heard it presented that way. So Yeah. Thank you for those incredibly clear and actionable, tools for motivation because so many people struggle with that. Yeah.[2:24:53] Andrew Huberman: And and I hear that all the time.[2:24:55] Dr. Maya Shankar: And I think, you know, you talked about a version, and, actually, this is really important. So When we think about returning to our goals, which is often the hard thing, so you do it on a Monday, and you have that same goal on a Tuesday, and then on a Wednesday, on Thursday. And by Thursday, you're kinda like, oh my god. It was So hard the 1st few days. Do I really wanna go back and do that do the same workout on a Thursday?[2:25:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: What's really helpful here to avoid some of that aversion is to be mindful of the, the way in which our minds process memories. So when we reflect back On how much we enjoy or didn't enjoy an experience, we don't give equal weight to every moment. Each moment doesn't get uniform weight. Instead, we tend to, give more weight to what's called the peak of the experience, so the experience that was most emotionally intense, the part of the experience that was the most emotionally intense, And the end of the experience. So this is a this is work done by, Nobel laureate Kahneman, Daniel Kahneman and and his collaborator Amos Tversky.[2:25:53] Dr. Maya Shankar: So the peak end rule is what this is called. So you put a lot of weight on, again, that really emotionally intense moment of the experience and the end. Now researchers have studied this in the context of lots of unpleasant activities. So in some studies, people are are forced to plunge, you know, submerge their hands in, like, ice cold water, or they looked at colonoscopies, for example, and how unpleasant those are. And, what they found is that this is so interesting.[2:26:18] Dr. Maya Shankar: So okay. I'm nerding out a little bit because I just, like, think that this field is so cool. Okay. So tonight[2:26:25] Andrew Huberman: Nerdting out isn't just tolerated. It is encouraged on this podcast.[2:26:29] Dr. Maya Shankar: I'm having a moment with cognitive science, but this is such cool research because what these researchers did, it's so clever. If you elongate the unpleasant experience by a couple minutes, let's say. So the hands in freezing cold ice water or the colonoscopy. But you make those last few minutes of the unpleasant experience Slightly less unpleasant than the end of the experience would otherwise have been. Right?[2:26:53] Dr. Maya Shankar: Had you just ended the colonoscopy procedure as planned? Had you just taken, the hands right out of the ice bucket by, for example, increasing the temperature of the water by a degree Or use your imaginations, whatever they will.[2:27:06] Andrew Huberman: Say, how can I get a colonoscopy less[2:27:08] Dr. Maya Shankar: There there there are mechanisms by which the pain can be less[2:27:12] Andrew Huberman: Physicians everywhere know them, but we but we are we are oblivious to them?[2:27:16] Dr. Maya Shankar: Anyway, you you guys could do the mental work of figuring out what the figuring out what the Google. On Google. On Google. What they find is that people look back on the experience more favorably. They have a more positive impression of the experience.[2:27:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: Now, again, this is what's so miraculous about this finding. The overall duration of the unpleasant experience has been extended. There are more minutes of overall suffering. Right? But The last few minutes are less bad than they would have been otherwise, and so people are they they view the experience more favorably.[2:27:50] Dr. Maya Shankar: In the case of the colonoscopies, they were actually more likely to return for Follow-up visits for for their annual checkups. And so what does this mean in daily life? Well, what it can mean is, let's say You're, like, literally killing yourself at the gym. Okay? You have the hardest workout that you've ever had.[2:28:06] Dr. Maya Shankar: Tack on a few minutes to the end of the workout that are still unpleasant. So you're still coding coding them as being part of the unpleasant working out experience,[2:28:15] Andrew Huberman: but[2:28:15] Dr. Maya Shankar: are a little bit less intense and less painful Then the workout end would have been otherwise. You might be more likely to return and actually do the the hard workout.[2:28:24] Andrew Huberman: Can we also say if somebody really enjoys their training that The opposite would be effective as well that perhaps if they really wanna push it hard at the end because that's the sensation that they particularly enjoy, that that could serve Presumably, the memory systems and the reward systems of the brain such that they are more likely to return to the workout again.[2:28:42] Dr. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. You raise a fantastic point, which is when we talk about Enjoyment in these contexts, it is all subjective. So I actually kinda love the feeling like I'm gonna die because my heart is It's racing. So, I mean, for whatever reason, I'm just wired to love exercise. Right?[2:28:57] Dr. Maya Shankar: And, I love a heart strength training workout. Right? And so For me, what enjoyment might look like at the end is, like, really, really, really intense. Right? That might be what brings me back.[2:29:07] Dr. Maya Shankar: But in other domains, absolutely not. Like Colonoscopy situation, I do not want that to be an unpleasant experience. And so there are lots of other domains in life where if you just tack on a few of the few minutes onto something that's Really tedious or really hard or really painful, it can make you more likely to commit to it later. But it's an excellent point. In all of these studies, it you have to consider who the person is and what their natural psychology is like.[2:29:31] Dr. Maya Shankar: And for everyone listening, you wanna tailor these recommendations to who you are as a person.[2:29:36] Andrew Huberman: Well, there are Certain life demands that I find incredibly aversive, so I'm going to use this approach for those. I'm also going to use them in the context of things I really enjoy Because, if one has the opportunity, I believe, to further reinforce the things that bring us joy, why why wouldn't we?[2:29:52] Dr. Maya Shankar: Absolutely.[2:29:54] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic recommendations. So now I could ask you a 1,000 more questions, and my hope is that you'll come back so that I can ask Those 1,000 plus more questions, I have to say, it is exceedingly rare that I talk to somebody either on the podcast or elsewhere, frankly, in my life that has such a incredibly wide breadth of knowledge and yet has so much depth of knowledge as well. It's clear that your many experiences through music and cognitive science, podcasting and by the way, We're going to, provide links to your podcast in the show note captions so that people can hear more from you and as they should, and also your work in Policy. I mean, you've put yourself in a lot of different domains, and I think that itself is inspiring. And, whether or not it's by way of curiosity, human connection, or both.[2:30:44] Andrew Huberman: Presumably, it's both and many other things as well. I know I speak on behalf of many, many people. I just say, you know, thank you so much for Doing the work that you do for continuing along these pursuits, I'm excited to hear where it might evolve in the future still. And, frankly, just for being you because it's clear that, your enthusiasm, your curiosity, and your generosity[2:31:14] Dr. Maya Shankar: These these conversations, like the one we just had, I mean, they're it's why I do the work. It's so much fun and so interesting, and you've given me so much food for thought. It really was a conversation, not an interview, and that's such a gift. And so I just feel gratitude that I can share, you know, my body of work and all the insights I've learned along the way with with your listeners, and I really hope it's helpful to them.[2:31:34] Andrew Huberman: It certainly is, and it it's been an honor to have you here. So Let's do it again.[2:31:38] Dr. Maya Shankar: Yes. Let's do it again. Thanks so much.[2:31:40] Andrew Huberman: Thank you.
