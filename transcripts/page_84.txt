I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Charles Zuker. Doctor Zucker is a professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience at Columbia University School of Medicine. Doctor Zucker is one of the world's leading experts in perception.[0:00:28] Andrew Huberman: That is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli in the world into events within the nervous system that we come to understand as our sense of smell, our sense of taste, our sense of vision, our sense of touch, and our sense of hearing. Doctor Zucker's lab is responsible for a tremendous amount of pioneering and groundbreaking work in the area of perception. For a long time, his laboratory worked on vision, defining the very receptors that allow for the conversion of light into signals that the rest of the eye and the brain can understand. In recent years, his laboratory has focused mainly on the perception of taste, and indeed his laboratory is responsible for discovering many of the taste receptors Leading to our perception of things like sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami, that is Savoriness in food. Doctor Zucker's laboratory is also responsible for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst.[0:01:21] Andrew Huberman: That is How the nervous system determines whether or not we should ingest more fluid or reject fluids that are offered to us. A key feature of the work from doctor Zucker's laboratory is that it bridges the brain and body. As you'll soon learn from today's discussion, his laboratory has discovered a unique set of sugar sensing neurons that exist not just within the brain, but a separate set of neurons that sense sweetness and sugar within the body, and that much the communication between the brain and body leading to our seeking of sugar is below our conscious detection. Doctor Zucker has received a large number of prestigious awards and appointments as consequence of his discoveries in neuroscience, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Association For the Advancement of Science. He's also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[0:02:09] Andrew Huberman: For those of you that are not familiar with the so called HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators are selected on an extremely competitive basis, and indeed, they have to come back every 5 years and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed as Howard Hughes investigators. Doctor Zucker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 1989. What all that means for you as a viewer and or listener of today's podcast is that you are about to learn about the nervous system and its ability to create perceptions, In particular, the perception of taste and sugar sensing from the world's expert on perception and taste. I'm certain that by the end of today's podcast, you're not just going to come away with a deeper understanding of our perceptions and our perception of taste in particular, but indeed, you will come away with an understanding of How we create internal representations of the entire world around us, and in doing so, how we come to understand our life experience. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.[0:03:10] Andrew Huberman: We often talk about supplements on the Huberman Lab Podcast. And while supplements aren't necessary for everybody, Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing the quality and speed with which you get into sleep, or for enhancing focus, or for hormone support. The reason we partnered with Momenta supplements is several fold. First of all, their supplements are of the absolute highest quality. Second of all, they ship internationally, which important because many of our podcast listeners reside outside the US.[0:03:36] Andrew Huberman: 3rd, many of the supplements that Momentous makes and at most all of the supplements We partnered with them directly on our single ingredient formulations. This is important for a number of reasons. First of all, if you're going to create a supplement protocol that's customized for your needs, you wanna be able to figure out which supplement ingredients are most essential and only use those, and supplements that combine lots of ingredients simply won't allow you to do that. So in trying to put together a supplement protocol for yourself that's the most biologically effective and cost effective, single ingredient formulations are going to be the most useful. If you'd like to see the supplements that we partner with Momentous on, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.[0:04:13] Andrew Huberman: And there, you'll see many of the supplements that talked repeatedly about on the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes. I should mention that the catalog of supplements that are available at livemomentus.com/huberman is constantly Being expanded, so you can check back there, livemomentus.com/huberman to see what's currently available. And from time to time, you'll notice new supplements being added to the inventory. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer Our 1st sponsor is Thesis.[0:04:53] Andrew Huberman: Thesis makes custom nootropics. And for frequent listeners of this podcast, you may remember that I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics because the word nootropics means smart drugs or smart compound. And the reason I don't like that phrase is that the brain has many different circuits that it uses in order to perform things like focus or task switching or creativity. So the idea that there's a single that we would call a smart drug is simply not in concert with the biology. Well, Thesis understands this, and as a consequence, has developed Custom nootropic formulations that are tailored to your unique needs.[0:05:29] Andrew Huberman: So for instance, Thesis will allow you to try different blends over the course of a month and determine Which blends of specific ingredients work best for you to focus or for you to gain motivation and energy for workouts or for cognitive work of some sort? I've been using Thesis nootropics for well over 6 months now, and they completely transform the way that I do cognitive work and, indeed, the way that I do physical fitness. If you wanna try your own personalized nootropic starter kit, you can go online to take thesis.com/huberman. There, you'll just do a brief Three minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month. That's takethesis.com/huberman and use the code huberman at checkout to get 10% off your Company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind and with the biology of the visual system in mind.[0:06:26] Andrew Huberman: I spent my lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with a number of very important challenges in order to be able to see the world around you clearly. Things like adjusting for background illumination so that when you go from a sunny area to a shady area, you can see what's in front of you still with crystal clarity. ROKA takes all of that into account when designing their eyeglasses and sunglasses. Their eyeglasses and sunglasses also have some unique qualities. For instance, because they were initially designed for performance with things like running and cycling.[0:06:53] Andrew Huberman: If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face. Also, they're extremely lightweight. In fact, most of the time, I don't Remember that I'm wearing them. I wear ROKA eyeglasses at night, so I wear readers, and I wear sunglasses often during the day if it's very bright or if I'm If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code to save 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.[0:07:17] Andrew Huberman: Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs. I've talked repeatedly about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. So getting adequate deep sleep is absolutely essential. Now one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that the surface that you're sleeping on is the right one for you. Helix understands this, and they've created A sleep quiz, that is you go to their website and you fill out a brief quiz that asks questions like do you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach?[0:07:45] Andrew Huberman: Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night? Maybe you don't know the answers, in which case, you simply say you don't know. By taking that quiz, they will match you to a mattress that is ideal for your sleep needs. I took that quiz, and I matched the so called Dusk, d u s k, mattress. And I've been sleeping on that mattress for some time now, and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.[0:08:02] Andrew Huberman: So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress to one that's uniquely tailored to your sleep needs, you can go to helix sleep.com/huberman, take their 2 minute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress, and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and 2 free pillows. They have a 10 year warranty, and you get to try out that mattress for a 100 nights risk free. They'll even pick it up If you don't love it, but I do believe that you will love it because you'll be sleeping far better than you have before. Again, if you're interested, you can go to helixsleepdot com/huberman to get up to $200 off and 2 free pillows. And now for my discussion with doctor Charles Zuker.[0:08:36] Andrew Huberman: Charles, thank you so much for joining me today. My pleasure. I wanna ask you about many things related to taste and gustatory perception, but maybe to start off And because you've worked on a number of different topics in neuroscience, not just taste, how do you think about perception? Or rather, I should say, how should the world and people think about perception, how it's different from sensation, and What leads to our experience of life in terms of vision, hearing, taste, etcetera?[0:09:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: So, you know, the brain is An extraordinary organ that weights maybe 2% of your body mass, Yet it consumes anywhere between 25 to 30% of all of your energy and oxygen. And it gets transformed into a mind, and this mind Change is the human condition. It make it changes. It transforms, you know, fear into courage, Conformity into creativity, sadness into happiness. How how how the hell does that happen?[0:09:58] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now the challenge that the brain faces He said the world is made of real things. You know, this here is a glass, and this is a cord, and this is a microphone. But the brain is only made of neurons that only understand electrical signals. So how do you transform that reality Into nothing that electrical signals that now need to represent the world. And that process is we can is what we can operationally define as perception.[0:10:39] Dr. Charles Zuker: In the senses, let's say olfactory, odor, taste, vision, you know, we can very Straightforwardly separate detection from perception. Detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule, you put it in your tongue, And then a set of specific cells now sense that sugar molecule. That's detection. You haven't perceived anything yet. That is just your cells in your tongue interacting with this chemical.[0:11:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: But now that cell gets activated and sends a signal to the brain, and now detection gets transformed into perception. And he's trying to understand how that happens. That's been the the maniacal drive of my entire career in neuroscience. How does the brain ultimately transform detection into perception so that it can guide actions and behaviors. Does that make sense?[0:11:45] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. And is a very clear and beautiful description. A sort of high level question related to that, and then I think we can get into some of the, intermediate steps.[0:11:56] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[0:11:57] Andrew Huberman: I think many people would like to know whether or not my perception of the color of your shirt is the same as your perception[0:12:04] Dr. Charles Zuker: of the color of your shirt. Am I Okay. To interrupt you as you're as I'm guessing what you're going. Alright. Very[0:12:11] Andrew Huberman: Interruption is welcome on this podcast. The audience will always penalize me for interrupting you and will never penalize you for interrupting you.[0:12:19] Dr. Charles Zuker: Like the one way penalized. Now given what I told you before, the the brain is trying to represent the world based in nothing but The transformation of these signals into electrical, you know, languages That now neurons have to encode and decode, it follows that your brain is different than my brain. And therefore, it follows that the way that you're perceiving the world must be different than mine even when receiving the same sensory cues. Okay. And I'll tell you about an experiment.[0:12:59] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's a simple experiment yet brilliant that demonstrates why we perceive the world how We perceive the world different. So in the world of vision, as you know, Well well, no. We have 3 classes of photoreceptor neurons that sends three Basic colors. Red, blue, and green. Blue, green, and red if we go, You know, from short to long wavelength.[0:13:31] Dr. Charles Zuker: And these 3 are sufficient to accommodate the full visible spectra. I wanna take 3 light projectors. And then when I project 1 into a white screen, a red light And the other one, green light. And when I overlap the 2 beams, and on the screen, there's a be yellow. Okay.[0:13:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: This the superposition when you have Two beams of of red and green. And then I'm gonna take a 3rd projector, and I'm gonna put a filter that projects right next to that mix beam, a spectrally pure yellow. And I'm gonna ask you To come to the red and green projectors and play with the intensity knobs So that you can match that yellow that you're projecting to the spectrally pure next to it. Is this making sense?[0:14:28] Andrew Huberman: Perfect sense.[0:14:29] Dr. Charles Zuker: And I'm going to write down the numbers in those 2 volume intensity knobs, And then I'm gonna ask the next person to do the same. And then I wanna ask every person around this area of Battery Park in New York To do the same. And guess what? We're gonna end up with thousands of different number combinations. Amazing.[0:14:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. So for all of us, is yellow enough that we can use a common language? But for every one of us, that yellow is gonna be ever so slightly differently. K? And so I think that simple psychological Experiment beautifully illustrates how we truly perceive the world differently.[0:15:16] Andrew Huberman: I love that example. And Yet in that example, we know the basic elements from which color is created. If we migrate into a slightly different sense Let me pick a hard one. Like Sound. Sound or olfaction.[0:15:32] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. Very hard then to do an experiment That will allow us to get that degree of granularity and beautiful causality where we can show that a Produces and leads to be. If I give you the smell of a rose, you can describe it to me. If I smell the same rose, I can describe it also. But I have no way whether the 2 of us are experiencing the same.[0:16:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: But it's close enough that we can both pretty much say that it has The following, you know, features or other determinants, but no question that your experience is different than mine.[0:16:20] Andrew Huberman: The fact that it's good enough for us to both survive, that your perception of yellow and my perception of yellow, at least up until now is good enough for us both to survive. You got it. It raises a thought about a statement made by a colleague of ours, Marcus Meister at Caltech. It's never been on this podcast, but in a review that I read, by Marcus at one point, he said That the basic function of perception is to divide our behavioral responses into the Outcomes downstream of 3 basic emotional responses. Yum, I like it, Yuck, I hate it, or meh, whatever.[0:17:06] Andrew Huberman: What do you think about I'm not looking to establish a debate between you and Marcus without Marcus here.[0:17:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: I understand.[0:17:11] Andrew Huberman: But but what I like about that is that it seems like the we know the brain is a very economical organ in some sense despite its high metabolic demands. And this variation in perception from 1 individual to the next At once seems like a problem because we're all literally seeing different things, and yet we function. We function well enough for most of us to avoid death and cliffs and, eating poisons and so forth and to enjoy some aspects of life one hopes.[0:17:45] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[0:17:45] Andrew Huberman: So is there a general statement that we can make about the brain, not just as a, organ to generate perception, not just as an organ to keep us alive, but also an organ that is is trying to Batch our behaviors into general categories of[0:18:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: I think I think so. But but and, again, I think the role of of Marcus 2. And I think he's right that, you know, broadly speaking, you could categorize a lot of behaviors falling into this through categories, and that's 100% likely to be the case for animals in the wild We're you know, the choices are not necessarily binary, but They're very unique and distinct. Yeah? Do I wanna eat this?[0:18:37] Dr. Charles Zuker: Do I wanna kill that? Do I wanna go there, or do I wanna go here? We humans deviated From that world long ago and, you know, learn to experience life Where we do things that we should not be doing.[0:19:00] Andrew Huberman: Some of us more than others. Exactly.[0:19:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: You know, In in in my own world of taste, yeah, the likelihood that an animal in the wild We'll enjoy eating something bitter. It's inconceivable. Yet we, you know, love tonic water. We enjoy we like living on the edge. We love enjoying experiences that makes us Human.[0:19:40] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that goes beyond that simple set of categories, Which is yummy, yucky. Who cares? And so I think it's not a bad palette, but I think it's It's overly reduction is for certainly what we humans do. I[0:20:04] Andrew Huberman: agree. And, since we're here in New York, I can say that the many options, the extensive variety of Food, flora, and fauna in New York explains a lot of the more nuanced behaviors that we observe. Let's talk about taste because, well, you've done extensive work in the field of vision, and it's a topic that I love. You could spend all day on taste is fascinating.[0:20:32] Dr. Charles Zuker: First of[0:20:32] Andrew Huberman: all, I'd like to know why you migrated from studying vision to studying taste. And perhaps in that description, you could highlight to us why we should think about and how we should think about this sense of taste.[0:20:46] Dr. Charles Zuker: My goal is always been to understand, as I highlighted before, how the brain does its magic. You know, what part you might wonder? Ideally, I like to help contribute to understand all of it. You know? How how do you encode and decode emotions?[0:21:04] Dr. Charles Zuker: How do you encode and decode memories and actions? How do you make decisions?[0:21:10] Andrew Huberman: How do you transform[0:21:12] Dr. Charles Zuker: detection into perception? And the list goes on and on. But one of the key things in science, as you know, is ensuring that you always ask the right question so that you have an Possibility of answering it. Because if the question cannot be tractable or reduced to an experimental path that helps you resolve it, then we end up doing some really fun science, but not necessarily answering the important problem that we want to study. Makes sense?[0:21:50] Dr. Charles Zuker: Alright.[0:21:51] Andrew Huberman: From a first person perspective, yes. The the hardest question, the most important question is, What are you going what question are you going to try and answer?[0:22:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: Right? And so and so, for example, you know, I will have to understand the neural basis of empathy.[0:22:09] Andrew Huberman: It's a big market[0:22:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: for that. 100%. But but I wouldn't even know, I mean, at the molecular level. Yeah. That's what we do.[0:22:15] Dr. Charles Zuker: How do the circuits in your brain create that sense? I have no clue how to do it. I can come up with ways to think about it, but I'd like to understand what in your brain makes someone a great philanthropist. What is the neural basis of love? I wouldn't even know where to begin.[0:22:40] Dr. Charles Zuker: So if I wanna begin to study these questions about brain function that can cover so many aspects of the brain. I need to choose a problem that affords me that window, but in a way that it can ask questions that give me answers. And among the senses that, you know, have the capacity of transforming detection into perception of being stories memories of creating emotions, of giving you different The the the different actions and perceptions is a function of the internal state. You know, when you're hungry, things taste very differently than when you're sated. How?[0:23:23] Dr. Charles Zuker: Why? When you taste something, you now remember this amazing meal you had with your 1st date. How does that happen? Alright. So so if I wanna begin to explore all of these things that the brain does, I feel I have to Choose a sensory system that affords some degree of simplicity In the way that the input output relationships are put together, and in a way that still can be used to ask every one of these problems That the brain has to ultimately compute, encode, and decode.[0:24:05] Dr. Charles Zuker: And what was Remarkable about the taste system at the time that I began working on this is that nothing was known about the molecular basis of taste. You know, we knew that we could taste what has been usually defined as the bake the 5 basic taste qualities. Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Umami is a Japanese word that means yummy, delicious, And that's the in nearly every animal species, the taste of amino acids. And in humans, It's mostly associated with the taste of MSG, monosodium glutamate, one amino acid in particular.[0:24:50] Andrew Huberman: What are just by way[0:24:52] Dr. Charles Zuker: of example, some foods that are rich in the umami evoking, stimulation. Seaweed, tomatoes, Cheese. And it's a great, great flavor enhancer. It enriches our sensory experience. And so the beautiful thing of the system is that the lines of input are limited to 5.[0:25:17] Dr. Charles Zuker: You know, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. And each of them has a predetermined meaning. You are born liking sugar and disliking bitter. You have no choice. These are hardwired systems.[0:25:34] Dr. Charles Zuker: But, of course, you can learn to dislike sugar and to like beachers. But in the wild, Let's take humans out of the equation. These are 100% predetermined. You're born with that specific valence value for each taste of sweet, Umami and low salt are attractive taste qualities. They evoke Appetitive responses, I wanna consume them.[0:26:10] Dr. Charles Zuker: And bitter and sour are innately Predetermined to be a very safe.[0:26:17] Andrew Huberman: Could I interrupt you just briefly and ask a question about that exact point? For something to be appetitive to and some mother tastes to be aversive and for those to be hardwired, Can we assume that the sensation of very bitter of activation of bitter receptors in the mouth Activates a neural circuit that causes closing of the mouth, retraction of the tongue, and retraction of the body, and that The taste of something sweet might actually induce more licking.[0:26:51] Dr. Charles Zuker: A 100%. You got it. The activation of the receptors in the tongue The recognized sweet versus the ones that recognize bitter activate an entire behavioral program. And that program that we can refer as a repetitiveness or a version, It's composed of many different subroutines. In the case of beater, it's very easy To actually look at see them happening in animals, because the first thing you do is you stop leaking, then you put, unhappy face, Then you squint your eyes, and then you start gagging.[0:27:33] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that entire thing happens By the activation of a bitter molecule in a bitter sense in cell in your tongue.[0:27:41] Andrew Huberman: It's incredible.[0:27:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's it's it's it's again the magic of the brain. You know? How How it it's able to encode and decode these extraordinary actions and behaviors in response of nothing, but a simple very, you know, A a unique sensory stimuli. Now let me say that this palette of 5 basic tastes Accommodates all the dietary needs of the organism. Sweet to ensure that we get the right amount of energy.[0:28:12] Dr. Charles Zuker: Umami to ensure that we get proteins and not essential nutrient. Salt, the 3 appetitive ones to ensure that we maintain our electrolyte balance. Bitter to prevent the ingestion of toxic nauseous chemicals. Nearly all bitter tasting, you know, things out in the wild are bad for you. And sour, Most likely to prevent ingestion of spoil, acid, fermented foods.[0:28:43] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that's it. That is the palate that we deal with. Now, of course, there's a difference between basic taste and flavor. Flavor is the whole experience. Flavor is the combination of multiple tastes coming together, Together with smell, with texture, with temperature, with the look of it, That gives you what you and I would call the full sensory experience.[0:29:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: But but we scientists need to reduce the the problem into its basic elements so we can begin to break it apart before we put it back together. So when we think about the sense of taste And we try to figure out how these lines of information go from your tongue to your brain and how they signal and how they get integrated and how they Trigger all these different behaviors. We look at them as individual qualities. Yeah. So we give the animal sweet or we give them a bitter or we give them sour.[0:29:43] Dr. Charles Zuker: We avoid mixes because the first stage of discovery is to have that clarity as to what you're trying to extract so that you can hopefully, meaningfully make a difference by Being able to figure out how is it that a goes to b to c and to d. Does this make sense?[0:30:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're almost like the primary colors to create full array of the color spectrum.[0:30:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: Exactly.[0:30:12] Andrew Huberman: Before I ask you about the the first and second and third stages of taste and flavor perception,[0:30:18] Dr. Charles Zuker: Is there any idea that there may be more than 5? There is. For example, what about fat?[0:30:27] Andrew Huberman: I love the[0:30:28] Dr. Charles Zuker: Oh, you love fat too.[0:30:29] Andrew Huberman: And I love the texture of fat, especially if it's slightly burnt like the the In South America, when I visit Buenos Aires, I found that at the end of a meal, they would take a steak, the trimming off the edge of the steak, burn it slightly, And then serve it back to me, and I thought that's disgusting. And then I tasted it, and it's delightful.[0:30:49] Dr. Charles Zuker: It is.[0:30:49] Andrew Huberman: There's nothing quite like it.[0:30:51] Dr. Charles Zuker: This goes back to this notion before that we like to live on the edge. Mhmm. Yeah? And we like to do things that we should not be doing, Andrew. But on the other hand, look at those muscles.[0:31:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: The, the the,[0:31:06] Andrew Huberman: I don't suggest anyone eat pure fat. The listeners of this podcast will meet I'm sure there'll be a YouTube video soon that I like eating pure fat. I'm not in on a ketogenic diet, etcetera. But, but Fat is tasty. It is evidenced by So the obesity problem that exists in[0:31:23] Dr. Charles Zuker: this country. We'll talk about that, you know, in a little bit about the, You know, they got brain axis. I I think it'll be important to cover it because it's the other side of the taste system. And and so so missing taste. You know?[0:31:37] Dr. Charles Zuker: 1 is fat. Although, like, you Clearly highlighted, a lot of fat taste, in quotation marks, is really the feeling of fat rolling on your tongue. And so there is a a a a a a compelling argument that A lot of what we call fat taste is really mechanosensory. It's Somatosensory cells cells that are not responding to taste, but they're responding to mechanical stimulation of fat molecules rolling on the tongue that gives you that perception of fat.[0:32:20] Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that There is a perception of fat regardless of whether or not there's a dedicated receptor for fat. Mostly because it's make evoking Sensations and imagery of of the taste of slightly burnt fat.[0:32:34] Dr. Charles Zuker: For for example. And another one, You know, you could argue it's metallic taste. You know, I I know exactly what it tastes like. You know, if you ask me to explain it, I will have a hard time. You know what?[0:32:48] Dr. Charles Zuker: Whether the palettes of that color that can allow me to define it, I I I it wouldn't be easy, But I know precisely what it tastes like. You know, take a take a penny, put it in your mouth, and you know what it tastes like. Yeah? Or blood. Or blood.[0:33:02] Dr. Charles Zuker: That's another very good example. And is there really, you know, a receptor for metallic taste or it's nothing but This magical combination of the activation of the existing lines. Think of it as lines of information, just separate lines by the keys of a piano. Yeah? Sweet, sour, beat, resolve, umami, you play the key and you activate a 1 chord.[0:33:26] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that 1 chord, in the case of a piano, leads to a note, you know, a tune. And in the case of taste, lead to an action and a behavior. But you play many of them together and something emerges that it's different than Any one of the pieces. And it's possible that metallic, for example, Represents the combination of the activity, yes, in the right ratio. Makes sense.[0:33:55] Dr. Charles Zuker: These added lines.[0:33:56] Andrew Huberman: Makes sense. And it actually provides a perfect the your example of the piano provides a perfect segue for what I'd like to touch on next, which is, If you would describe the sequence of neural events Mhmm. Leading to a perceptual event of taste. And I'm certain that somewhere in there, you will embed an answer to the question of whether or not we indeed have different Taste receptors distributed in different locations on our tongue Yes. Or elsewhere in the mouth.[0:34:27] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes. So so let's let's start by by By the banking that that old tale and myth, who[0:34:36] Andrew Huberman: came up with that?[0:34:38] Dr. Charles Zuker: It the there are many views, but the the most prevalent is that there was an original drawing Describing the sensitivity of the tongue to different tastes. So imagine I can take a Q tip. This is a thought experiment. Yeah? And then when I dip that Q tip in salt and in quinine as something bitter and Glucose or something sweet.[0:35:06] Dr. Charles Zuker: And I'm gonna take that Q tip, ask you to stick your tongue out And start moving it around your tongue and ask you what do you feel. And then I'm going to change the concentration of the amount of salt or the amount of bitter and ask, can I get some sort of a map of sensitivity to the different tastes? And and the argument that has emerged is that there is a good likelihood that the data was simply mis Translated as it was being drawn. And, of course, that led to an entire industry. This is the way you maximize your wine experience because now we're going to Form the vessel that you're gonna drink from so that it acts maximally on the receptors which happen.[0:36:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: Alright. Now There is no tongue map. Alright? We have taste buds distributed in Various parts of the tongue. So there is a map on the distribution of taste buds.[0:36:17] Dr. Charles Zuker: But each taste bud has around a100 Taste receptor cells. And those taste receptor cells can be of 5 Types. Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, or umami. And for the most part, All taste buds have the representation of all 5 taste qualities. Now there's no question that there is a slight bias for some taste.[0:36:44] Dr. Charles Zuker: Like, bitter is particularly enriched at the very back of your tongue. And there is a teleological basis for that, actually, a biological basis for that. That's the last line of defense before you swallow something bad. And so let's make sure that the very back of your tongue has plenty of these bad news receptors So that if they get activated, you can trigger a gagging reflex and get rid of this that otherwise may kill you.[0:37:18] Andrew Huberman: K. That's good sense.[0:37:19] Dr. Charles Zuker: But but the notion that, you know, all Swede is in the front and salt is on the side, it's Not real. And they're go ahead.[0:37:31] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I was just gonna ask, are there it's first of all, thank you for dispelling that myth.[0:37:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[0:37:36] Andrew Huberman: And we will propagate that information as far and wide as we can, because I think that's the number one myth related to taste. The the other one is, are there taste receptors anywhere else in the mouth, for instance, on[0:37:48] Dr. Charles Zuker: the lips? The palate. Not the lips. So it's it's In the far range at the very back of the oral cavity, the tongue, and the palate. And the palate is very rich in sweet receptors.[0:38:02] Andrew Huberman: I'll have to pay attention to this the next time I eat something sweet.[0:38:05] Dr. Charles Zuker: Whether whether when you pull it up. Yeah? Now The the the important thing is that, you know, after the receptors for these 5, The the detectors, the molecules that sends sweet, sour, bitters, all tumami, these are receptors, Proteins found on the surface of taste receptor cells that interact with these chemicals. And once they interact, then they trigger the cascade of events, Biochemical events inside the cell that now sends an electrical signal that says there is sweet here or there is salt here. Now having these receptors and my laboratory identify the receptors for all 5 basic taste classes, sweet, bittersol, umami, and most recently, sour, Now completing the pilot, you can now use these receptors to really map where are they found in the tongue in a very rigorous way.[0:39:02] Dr. Charles Zuker: This is no longer about using a Q tip and trying to figure out what you're feeling, but rather what you have in your tongue. This is not a guess. This is now a physical map that says the sweet receptors are found here. The bitter are found here. And when you do that, you find that in fact, every taste bud throughout your oral cavity Has receptors for all of the basic taste classes.[0:39:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: Amazing. And as it turns out, and I'm sure you'll tell us, important In terms of thinking about[0:39:40] Andrew Huberman: how the brain computes and codes and decodes this thing we call taste.[0:39:45] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[0:39:46] Andrew Huberman: I'm going to inject a quick Question that I'm sure is on many people's minds before we get back into the biological circuit, which is many people, including myself, are familiar with the experience of drinking a sip of Tea or coffee that is too hot and burning my tongue is the way I would describe it. Horrible and then disrupting my sense of taste some period of time afterward.[0:40:07] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[0:40:08] Andrew Huberman: When I experienced that phenomenon, that unfortunate phenomenon, have I Destroyed taste receptors that regenerate, or have I somehow used temperature to distort the function of the circuit so that I no longer taste the way I did before.[0:40:26] Dr. Charles Zuker: Excellent question. And the answer is both. It turns out that your taste receptors Only leave for around 2 weeks. And this, by the way, makes sense because here you have an organ, the tongue, That is continuously exposed to everything you could range from the nicest to the most horrible possible things. Use imagination.[0:40:52] Dr. Charles Zuker: And and and so you need to make sure that these cells are always coming back in a way That I can reexperience the world in the right way. And this there are other organs that have the same underlying logic. Okay? Your gut, your intestines are the same way. Yeah.[0:41:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: Amazing. Again, they are receiving everything that you ingest. God forbid what's there. From the spiciest, you know, to the most horrible tasting to the most delicious. And, again, those intestinal cells whose role is to ultimately take all these nutrients and bring them into the body, Also renewal in a very, very fast cycle.[0:41:43] Dr. Charles Zuker: Olfactory neurons in your nose is the other example. So then, a, yes, you're burning a lot of your cells and it's Over for those, the good news is that they're gonna come back. But we know that when you burn yourself with tea, they come back, you know, within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour. And and these cells are not renewing in that in that time frame. They're they're not listening to your needs.[0:42:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: They have their own internal clock. K. It and so You are really affecting you're damaging them in a way that they can recover. And then they come back and you also damage your somatosensory cells. These are the cells that feel things, not taste things.[0:42:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: K. And then, you know, you wait half an hour or so, and then my goodness. Thank god. It's back to normal.[0:42:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And most of the time, I don't even notice the transition realizing as you told me. And I'll later, I'll ask you about the relationship between Odor and taste. But, as a next step along the circuit, let's assume I ingest some let let's keep it simple, A sweet taste.[0:43:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: Let's make it even simpler, but at the same time, perhaps more informative. Let's compare and contrast sweet and bitter as we follow their lines from the tongue to the brain. So the first thing is that the 2 evoke diametrically opposed behaviors. K. If we have to come up with 2 Sensory experience that represent polar opposites, it will be sweet and bitter.[0:43:31] Dr. Charles Zuker: There are no 2 colors that represent polar opposites because, know, you could say black and white, they are polar opposite to one that takes only one thing, the other one that takes everything. It but they don't evoke Different behaviors.[0:43:45] Andrew Huberman: Even political parties have some over and over.[0:43:48] Dr. Charles Zuker: Sweet and bitter are the 2 opposite ends of the sensory Ready? Now a taste can be defined by 2 features. Again, I'm a reductionist, so I'm reducing it in a way that I think it's easier to follow the signal. And the 2 features are its quality And it's valence. And valence with a little v, that's what we say in Spanish with a v, Means the value of that experience.[0:44:25] Dr. Charles Zuker: Alright? Or in this case of that stimuli. And you take sweet. Sweet has a quality, An identity, and that's what you and I will refer to as the taste of sweet. We know exactly what it tastes like, But sweet also has a positive valence, which makes it incredibly attractive and appetitive.[0:44:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: But it's attractive and appetitive, as I'll tell you in a second, independent of its identity and quality. In fact, we have been able to engineer animals where we completely remove the valence from the stimuli So these animals can taste sweet, can recognize it as sweet, but it's no longer attractive. Is just one more chemical stimuli, and that's because the identity and the valence are encoded in 2 separate parts of the brain. In the case of, again, it has, On the one hand, it's identity, it's quality, and you know exactly what bitter tastes like.[0:45:38] Andrew Huberman: I can taste it now even as you describe it.[0:45:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: But it also has a valence, and that's a negative valence because it evokes aversive behaviors. Are we on? Absolutely. Alright.[0:45:51] Andrew Huberman: And it comes to mind. I remember telling some kids recently that we're gonna go get ice cream, and it was interesting. They looked up and they started smacking their, like, You know, they'll actually vote[0:46:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: The anticipatory response. Absolutely. Yeah. When we talk about the gut brain, maybe we'll get there. If So then the signals, if we follow now these 2 lines, they're really like 2 separate keys at the two ends of this keyboard.[0:46:16] Dr. Charles Zuker: And you press 1 key and you activate this cord, so you activate the sweet cells throughout your oral cavity, And they all converge into a group of sweet neurons in the next station, Which is still outside the brain is one of the taste ganglia. These are the neurons that innervate your tongue and the oral cavity.[0:46:42] Andrew Huberman: Where do they sit approximately? Are they Around there. Yeah. Right here around the Yeah. Blood lymph nodes more or less.[0:46:47] Andrew Huberman: You got it.[0:46:49] Dr. Charles Zuker: And and and there are 2 main ganglia that innovate the vast majority of all taste buds in their oral cavity. And then From there, that sweet signal goes onto the brain stem. The brain stem is the entry of the body into the brain. And there are different areas of the brain stem, and there are different groups of neurons in the brain stem, and there's a unique area In a unique, a a a topographically defined location In the rostral side of the brain stem that receives all of the taste input. A[0:47:32] Andrew Huberman: very dense area[0:47:33] Dr. Charles Zuker: of the brain. A very rich area, yeah, of the brain. Exactly. And from there, the sweet signal goes to this other area higher up on the brain stem, and then it goes through A number of stations where that sweet signal goes from sweet neuron to sweet neuron to sweet neuron To eventually get to your cortex. And once it gets to your taste cortex, that's where meaning is imposed into that signal.[0:48:08] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's then and only then, this is what The data suggests that now you can identify this[0:48:18] Andrew Huberman: as a sweet stimuli. And how quickly does that all happen?[0:48:24] Dr. Charles Zuker: You know, the time scale of the nervous system, it's fast. Yeah? And so[0:48:31] Andrew Huberman: less than a second.[0:48:32] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.[0:48:33] Andrew Huberman: I rarely mistake bitter for sweet. Yeah. Maybe with respect to people and my own poor judgment. But But no. You've But not with respect to taste.[0:48:42] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. It's and and in fact, we can demonstrate this because we can stick electrodes at each of these stations Conceptually, yeah, and we can stimulate the tongue and then we can record the signals pretty much time log to stimulus delivery. You deliver the stimuli, and within a fraction of a second, you see now the response in this following stations. Now it gets to the cortex. Yeah?[0:49:08] Dr. Charles Zuker: And now in there, you impose meaning to that taste. There's an area of your brain that represents the taste of sweet in taste cortex and a different area that represents the taste of bitter. In essence, there is a topographic map of these taste qualities inside your brain. Now we're gonna do a thought experiment. Alright?[0:49:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now if this group of neurons in your cortex really represents the sense of sweet And this other different group of neurons in your brain represents the taste, the perception of bitter, Then we should be able to do 2 things. 1st, I should be able to go into your brain, somehow Silence those neurons. Find a way to prevent them from being activated, And I can give you all the sweet you want, and you'll never know that you're tasting sweet. And, conversely, I should be able to go into your brain, come up with a way to activate those neurons while I'm giving you absolutely nothing, And you're gonna think that you're getting that full percept. And that's Precisely what we have done, and that's precisely what you get.[0:50:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: This, of course, is in the brain of mice.[0:50:39] Andrew Huberman: But, presumably, in humans, it would work somewhat.[0:50:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: Absolutely the same. Zeroed out. I have no no questions. So so so this A test to 2 important things. The first, to the predetermined nature of the sense of taste.[0:50:55] Dr. Charles Zuker: Because it means I can go to these parts of your brain in the absence of any stimuli and have you throw the full Behavioral experience. In fact, when we activate in your cortex these bitter neurons, the animal can start gagging. But it's drinking only water, but the animal thinks That's getting a bit of stimuli. This is amazing. Yeah.[0:51:25] Dr. Charles Zuker: And so and the second, just to finish the line so that it doesn't sound like It teaches 2 things, and then I only give you 1 lesson. It is that, you know, it substantiates This this capacity of the brain to segregate, to separate in in these nodes of action, The representation of these 2 diametrically opposed percepts, yeah, which is sweet, for example, versus bitter.[0:51:54] Andrew Huberman: The reason I say amazing, and that is also amazing, is the following. You told us earlier, and you're absolutely correct, of course, that The end of the day, whether or not it's 1 group of neurons over here and another group of neurons over there, just the way it turns out to be, Electrical activity is the generic common language of both sets of neurons. So that raises the question for me of whether or not those Separate sets of neurons are connected to areas of the brain that create this sense of valence, or whether or not they're simply created connected, excuse me, To sets of neurons that evoke distinct behaviors of moving towards and inhaling more and licking or aversive, are we essentially interpreting our behavior and our Micro responses or our micro responses in our behaviors the consequence of the person.[0:52:46] Dr. Charles Zuker: Excellent. Excellent question. So so first, the answer is they go into a area of the brain where valence is imposed, And that area is known as the amygdala. And the sweet neurons go to a different area than the bitter neurons. Now I wanna do a thought experiment because I think your audience might appreciate this.[0:53:12] Dr. Charles Zuker: Let's say I activate this group of neurons And the animal increases leaking, and I'm activating the sweet neurons. And so that's expected because Now it's, you know, tasting this this this water as if it was sugar. Now this is Moses transforming water into wine. In this case, we're gonna And today's Passover, so then it's an appropriate, you know, example. We're transforming it into in into suite.[0:53:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah? But but how do I know how do I know that activating them is evoking a positive feeling inside, A goodness, a satisfaction, oh, I love it, versus I'm just increasingly leaking, Which is the other option because all we're seeing is that the animal is leaking more, and we're trying to infer that that means that he's feeling something really good versus, you know what? That piano line is going back straight into the tongue, and all he's doing is forcing it to move faster. Well, We can actually separate this by doing experiments that allow us to fundamentally distinguish them. And imagine the following experiment.[0:54:25] Dr. Charles Zuker: I'm gonna take the animal and I'm gonna put them inside a box that has 2 sides. And the 2 sides have features that make them different. 1 has yellow little toys. The other one has green toys. 1 has little, you know, black stripes.[0:54:43] Dr. Charles Zuker: The other one has blue stripes. So the animal can tell the 2 halves. I take the mouse, put him inside this arena, this play arena, and it will explore and pause around both sides With equal frequency. And now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna activate these neurons, these sweet neurons. Every time the animal is on the side with the yellow stripes, And if that is creating a positive internal state, What would the animal now want to do?[0:55:24] Dr. Charles Zuker: It will want to stay on this side with the yellow stripes. There's no leaking here. The animal is not extending its tongue every time I'm activating these neurons. K? This is known as a place preference test, And it's generally used.[0:55:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's just one form of many different tests to demonstrate That the activation of a group of neurons in the brain is imposing, For example, a positive versus a negative valence. Whereas, if they do the same thing by activating the bitter neurons, The animal will actively want now to stay away from the side where these neurons are being activated.[0:56:12] Andrew Huberman: And that's precisely what you see.[0:56:13] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that's precisely what we see.[0:56:16] Andrew Huberman: Many people, including myself, are familiar with the experience of going to a restaurant, eating A variety of foods, and then, fortunately, it doesn't happen that often, but then feeling very sick. I learned coming up in neuroscience that this Is one strong example of one trial learning that from that point on, it's not the restaurant or the waitress or the waiter or the date, but it's my notion of it had to have been the shrimp That leads me to then want to avoid shrimp in every context, maybe even shrimp powder. You got it for a very long time. I can imagine all the adapt, Evolutionarily adaptive reasons why this such a phenomenon would exist. Do we have any concept of where in this pathway[0:57:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: that exists? We we we know actually A significant amount at at at at a general level. Yeah? In fact, more than shrimp, oysters are even a more dramatic example. One bad oyster is all you need to be driven away for the next 6 months.[0:57:22] Andrew Huberman: I think Because the texture alone is something that one learns to overcome. I actually really enjoy oysters. I despise mussels, despise shrimp, Not the animal, but the taste. And and yet oysters, for some reason, I I've yet to have a bad experience.[0:57:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's like uni, by the way. You know? Texture is hard to get over, But once you get over, it's delicious.[0:57:43] Andrew Huberman: That's what they tell me. We were both in San Diego at one point, and I I'll give a plug to Sushi Ota. It's kind of the famous good old sis. And they have amazing uni, and I've I've tried it twice, and I it's a a I'm o for 2. It it's somehow the texture outweighs any kind of the deliciousness That's people report.[0:58:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: A very acquired taste. Yeah. It's like beer. You know, if you I grew up in Chile. That's where the accent comes from in case anyone wonder.[0:58:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: And, you know, by by the time I came here to graduate school, I was nineteen. Too old to, you know, overcome my heavy Chilean accent. So here I am 40 years 50 years late. Not quite. 40 class.[0:58:24] Dr. Charles Zuker: We appreciate it. Still sound Like, I just came off the boat. So in Chile, you don't drink beer when you're young. You drink wine. You know, Chile is a huge wine producer.[0:58:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: So when I came to the US, all of my, you know, classmates, you know, were drinking beer Because they, you know, they had finished college where they were all, you know, if you're drinking and, you know, graduate school, you're working 18 hours a day every day, The way they you know, relax. Let's go and have some beers. And beer[0:58:56] Andrew Huberman: is cheaper.[0:58:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: And beer is cheap. And we were being clearly underpaid, may I add? I couldn't do it. It's an acquired taste. It was too late by then.[0:59:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: And here I am, you know, 60 plus. And if you take all the beer I've drunk in my entire life, I would say they add to less than an 8 ounce Glass of water. Impressive.[0:59:21] Andrew Huberman: Well, your health is probably better for it.[0:59:23] Dr. Charles Zuker: I'm not sure. Your physical[0:59:26] Andrew Huberman: health anyway.[0:59:27] Dr. Charles Zuker: So, you know, it it goes back to, you know, Acquire taste. This is the connection to Uni and to oysters. Now going back to to the one trial learning, you know, this is the great thing about our brains. Certain things we need to repeat a 100 times to learn them. Hello, operator.[0:59:43] Dr. Charles Zuker: Can I have the phone number for Sushi Ota, please? And then she'll give it to you over the phone, at least in the old days. And then you need to repeat it to yourself Over and over and over over the next minute, so you can dial Sushi Ota. And 5 minutes later, it's gone. That's what we call working memory.[1:00:05] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. Then there is the short term memory. Yeah. We park our car, And if we're lucky, by the end of the day, we remember where it is. And then there is the long term memory.[1:00:16] Dr. Charles Zuker: We remember the birthdays of every one of our children For the rest of our lives. Well, there are events that a single event is so traumatic, yeah, That it activates the circuits in a way that it's a one trial learning. And the taste system It's literally at the top of that food chain, and there is a phenomenon known as condition taste aversion. You can pair an attractive stimuli with a really bad one, And you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike, for example, sugar. And that's because you've conditioned the animals to now be averse to these otherwise Nice taste because it's been associated with malaise.[1:01:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: And when you do that, now you could begin to ask what has changed In the signal, as it travels from the tongue to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal where you have now form sweet from being attractive to being aversive. And this is the way now you begin to explore how the brain changes The nature, the quality, the meaning of a stimuli as a function of its state.[1:01:43] Andrew Huberman: I have a number of questions related to that, all of which relate to this idea of context. Because you mentioned before that flavor is distinct from taste because flavor involves smell, texture, temperature, and some other features. Uni, sea urchin being a good example of, I can I can sense the texture? It actually is it's no. I won't describe what it what it reminds me of For various reasons, the ability to place context on into to insert context into a perception or rather to insert A perception into context is is so powerful, and there's an element of kind of mystery about it.[1:02:27] Andrew Huberman: But If we start to think about some of the more nuance that we like to live at the edge as you as you say, how how many different Tastes on the taste dial, to go back to your analogy earlier, the color dial. Do you think that there could be for something as, fixed as bitter? For instance, I I don't think I like bitter taste, but, I like some fermented foods that seem to have a little bit Sour and have a little bit of that briny[1:02:55] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[1:02:55] Andrew Huberman: Flavor. How much plasticity do you think there is there, and in particular, across the lifespan? Because I think one of the most salient examples of this is that kids don't seem to like certain vegetables, but they all are hardwired to, like, sweet tastes. And yet, you could also imagine that one of the reasons why they may eventually grow to incorporate vegetables is because of some knowledge that vegetables might be Good for you. Better for them.[1:03:21] Andrew Huberman: So is there a change in the receptors, The distribution, the number, the sensitivity, etcetera, that can explain the transition from wanting to avoid vegetables to being willing to eat vegetables, Simply in childhood to to early[1:03:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: development. I wanna take the question slightly differently, but I think it would illustrate the point. And and I wanna just It use the difference between the olfactory system and the taste system to make the point. Taste system, 5 basic palates. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.[1:03:56] Dr. Charles Zuker: Each of them has a predetermined identity. We know exactly what And valines. These are attractive. These are aversive. In the factory system, it's claimed that we can smell millions of different odors.[1:04:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yet, for the most part, none of them have an innate Predetermined meaning. In the olfactory system, meaning is imposed by learning and experience, Even the smell of smoke. So I'm gonna give you I'm gonna make it differently. There are a handful of the millions of others that were claimed that that you could immediately tell me these are aversive and these are attractive. Vomit.[1:04:42] Dr. Charles Zuker: So vomit, it's not correct because I can assure you that there are cultures and societies where things which are far Less appealing than vomit do not evoke an adverse reaction. Really? Really. Sulfur would be maybe a universal. I'm not talking pheromones.[1:05:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: Okay? Pheromones are in a different category that trigger innate responses, but nearly every other Is afforded meaning by learning and experience. And that's why you like broccoli[1:05:16] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:05:16] Dr. Charles Zuker: And I despise broccoli because I remember my mother forcing me to eat broccoli. I'm so sorry. Same sensory experience. Yeah? Alright.[1:05:28] Dr. Charles Zuker: This this accommodates 2 important things. In the case of taste, you have neurons At every station, they're there for sweet, for sour, for bitter, for salty, and umami. It's only 5 classes, so it's not gonna take a lot of your brain. If we can, in fact, smell a 1000000 others and everyone else of others had to had predetermined meaning, there's not gonna be enough brain just to accommodate That one sense. And so evolution in its infinite wisdom Evolve a system where you put together a pathway and a cortex, olfactory cortex, Where you have the capacity to associate every other In a specific context that now gives it the meaning.[1:06:19] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now Let's go back to the original question then. So other than clearly plastic, megaplastic, because It's it's fundamental basis and neural organization. But, Taze, we just told you that's, you know, predetermined hardwire. But predetermined hardwired doesn't mean that it's not modulated by learning or experience. It only means that you are born Like in sweet and dislike in bitter.[1:06:50] Dr. Charles Zuker: And we have many examples of plasticity, beer being one example. So why why do we learn to love beer is in coffee? It's because it has an associated gain to the system. And that gain to the system, that positive valence that emerges out of that negative signal is sufficient To create that positive association. And in the case of beer, of course, is alcohol.[1:07:22] Dr. Charles Zuker: The feeling good that we get after is more than sufficient to say, I wanna have more of this. I mean, in the case of coffee, of course, is caffeine activating a whole group of Neurotransmitter systems that give you that that that high associated with coffee. So, yes, this taste system is changeable, it's malleable, And he's subjected to learning and experience. But unlike the olfactory system, it's restricted, yeah, in what you could do with it because its goal is to allow you to get nutrients and survive. The goal of the olfactory system is very different.[1:08:02] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's being used not in our case, but in every animal species To, you know, identify friend versus foe, to identify mate, To identify ecological niches they wanna be in. So it plays a very broad role That then requires that it be set up, organized, and function in a very different type of context. Taste is about, Can we get the nutrients we need to survive? And can we ensure that we are attracted to the ones we need and we averse to the ones that are going to kill us? I'm being overly simplistic and reductionist, but I think it illustrates the huge difference between these 2 chemosensory.[1:08:50] Dr. Charles Zuker: Sam?[1:08:50] Andrew Huberman: No. I I don't think you've been overly simplistic. I think it it illustrates the the key intractable nature of This system and the way you've approached it, and I think it's important for people to hear that because everybody as we are mystified with empathy and love, etcetera. So in fairness to that, I'm gonna ask a sort of, high level question or abstract question. This This is based on a conversation I had with a former girlfriend where we're talking about chemistry between individuals.[1:09:21] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Very complicated topic On the one hand. But on the other hand, quite simple in that certain people, for whatever reason, evoke a tremendous sense of Arousal, for lack of a better word, between 2 people, one would hope. At least for some period of time.[1:09:42] Dr. Charles Zuker: I didn't know this was that kind of a podcast.[1:09:45] Andrew Huberman: No. Well, we're the reason I but this has to do with taste because she said something, I think, in part to, Maybe irritate me a bit, but but we were commenting not about our own experience of each other, but of someone that she was Now very excited about we're on good terms. Uh-huh. And she said, what do you think it is, this thing of chemistry? So maybe she was trying to, you know[1:10:12] Dr. Charles Zuker: warn you of what's coming. Warn me[1:10:14] Andrew Huberman: of what's coming. And she said, I have a feeling something about it is in smell, And something about it is actually in taste. Literally, the taste of somebody's breath. That's the way she described it. And I thought that it was a Very interesting example for a number of reasons, but in particular, because it gets to the merging of odor and taste, But also to the idea that, of course, the context of a new relationship, I'm assuming that and in fact, they're attractive people, etcetera.[1:10:45] Andrew Huberman: There's a whole context there, but I've had the experience of The odor of somebody's breath being aversive, not because I could identify it as aversive[1:10:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: Because you just didn't like it?[1:10:58] Andrew Huberman: But because it just didn't like[1:11:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: But but but that's because you associate it with other others[1:11:07] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:11:08] Dr. Charles Zuker: That Mhmm. Trigger that negative, you know, aversive reaction,[1:11:15] Andrew Huberman: by the way. Absolutely. There are certain perfumes to me that are aversive. You got it. And there there are other scents and, can recall scents of of skin, of foods, etcetera, that are immensely appetitive.[1:11:28] Andrew Huberman: So I I've experienced both sides of this equation myself, and she was describing this. And to me, More than tasting wine, which is the typical example where people inhale it and then they drink it. To me, this seems like something that More people might be able to relate to that certain things and people smell delicious. Even mothers describing the smell heart. Mother.[1:11:50] Dr. Charles Zuker: For us. I mean,[1:11:52] Andrew Huberman: you know,[1:11:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: our own babies when washing their necks. Rio, that's his name, smells like.[1:12:05] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So more beautiful examples. It's always more fun to think about the beautiful positive the, appetitive examples. Yes. The smell of the back of your grandson's neck.[1:12:15] Andrew Huberman: Yes. I mean, you couldn't you could get more specific than that, but not a lot more specific. So what is going on In terms of the combination of odor and taste given that these 2 systems are so different.[1:12:27] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes. And and they come together. Ultimately, there is a place in the brain where they come together To integrate the 2 into what we would call, you know, that sensory experience. And I'll tell you an experiment that you could do that demonstrates this. I think in in in I think it's good for the you know, for for for your audience here to get sense of how we approach these problems so that we can get in a meaningful scientific answers.[1:13:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain. We know where the taste cortex is in the brain. They're in 2 different places. We can go to each of these 2 cortices, Put color traces. We put green in 1.[1:13:17] Dr. Charles Zuker: We put red in the other, and we see where the colors go to. That's a reflection of where those neurons are projection are projecting to into their next targets. Once they get the signal, where do they send the signal to? And then we reason that if order and taste come together somewhere in the brain, We should find an area that now it's getting red and green color, and we found such an area. And next, we anticipated, we hypothesize that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse, Corresponding area in the brain of humans that integrates odor and taste.[1:14:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's known this the term normally used is multisensory integration. And if this is true, we could do the following experiment. We can train a mouse to click Sweet. And if they guess correctly that that is supposed to be sweet, they should go now to The right port to the right side to get a water reward. If they go to the left When he was sweet, then they're incorrect, and they get no reward, and they actually get a time out.[1:14:44] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now the mice are thirsty, so they're very motivated to perform. And if you repeat this task a 100 times, a 100 trials, Incredibly now, this animal learned to recognize the sweet and execute the right action. And by their action, We now are being told what that animal is tasting. We can make it more interesting and we can give Sweet and bitter and say if it's sweet, go to the right, and if it's bitter, go to the left. And after you train him these mice with 90% accuracy will tell you When you randomize now the stimuli, what was sweet and what was bitter.[1:15:24] Dr. Charles Zuker: Alright. We can now do the same experiment, But now mix taste with odor. And say, if you got Order alone, go to the right or push this lever In mice, if you get taste alone, go to this other part or push this other lever. And if you get the 2 together, do this something else. And if you train the mice, the mice are able now to report back to you When it's sensing, taste alone, odor alone, or the mix.[1:16:05] Dr. Charles Zuker: Make sense?[1:16:05] Andrew Huberman: Make sense.[1:16:06] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now we can go to the brain of these mice and go to this area that we now Uncover, discover as being the site of multisensory integration between taste and other and silence it. Prevent it from being activated experimentally. And if that area really represented the integration of these 2, the animals should still be able to recognize the taste alone. They still should be able to recognize the odor alone, but should be incapable now to recognize the mix. And exactly as predicted, that's exactly what you get.[1:16:48] Dr. Charles Zuker: Alright?[1:16:50] Andrew Huberman: The brain is basically a series of engineered circuits.[1:16:54] Dr. Charles Zuker: Complex. You got it. And our task is, you know, to figure out how can we extract, You know, this amazing architecture of these circuits in a way that we can begin to uncover the mysteries, You know, of the brain.[1:17:12] Andrew Huberman: And why certain people's breath tastes so good and other people's Exactly. Not so good.[1:17:18] Dr. Charles Zuker: So So I never answered that, but I told you how we can figure out where in the brain is happening. K?[1:17:25] Andrew Huberman: As we've been having this discussion, I thought a few times about similarities to the visual system or differences to the visual system. The visual system, there are a couple of phenomenon that I wonder if they also exist in the taste system. In the visual system, we know, for instance, that if you look at something long enough and activate the given receptors long enough, that object will actually disappear. We offset this with little micro eye movements, etcetera, but the principle is a fundamental one. This habituation or desensitization, everyone seems to call it something different, but You get the idea, of course.[1:18:00] Andrew Huberman: In the taste system, I'm certainly familiar with eating something very, very sweet for the first time in a long time, and it feel tastes very sweet. But a few more licks, a few more bites, and now it tastes not as sweet. With olfaction, I'm familiar with the odor in a room I don't like or I like and then it disappearing, so a similar phenomenon. Where does that occur? And can you imagine a sort of a system by which people could leverage that?[1:18:31] Andrew Huberman: Because I do think that most people Are interested in eating not more sugar, but less sugar.[1:18:37] Dr. Charles Zuker: I think we have better ways to approach that, and we can transition from taste Into this circuits that makes sugar so extraordinarily Impossible not to consume. Impossible. Exactly.[1:18:55] Andrew Huberman: Oh my.[1:18:56] Dr. Charles Zuker: So where does this This desensitizing happens. That's the term that we use. And It's I think it happening at multiple stations. It's happening at the receptor level, I e, the cells in your tongue that are sensing that sugar. As you activate this receptor and it's Triggering activity after activity after activity.[1:19:27] Dr. Charles Zuker: Eventually, you exhaust the receptor. Again, I'm using terms which are extraordinarily loose. For sake of this discussion sake of this discussion, the receptor gets to a point Where he undergoes a set of changes, chemical changes, where it now signals far less efficiently Or it even gets removed from the surface of the cell. And now what will happen is that the same amount of sugar will trigger far less of a response. And that is a huge side of this modulation.[1:20:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: And then the next, I believe, is the integrated, again, loss of signaling that happens by continuous activation of the circuit At each of these different neural stations, you know, there is from the tongue to the ganglia, from the ganglia to the 1st station in the brain stem, A 2nd station in the brain stem to the thalamus then to the cortex. So there are multiple steps that this signal is traveling. You might say, why? If this is a label line, why do you need to have so many stations? And that's because the taste system is so important to ensure That you get what you need to survive, that it has to be subjected to modulation by the internal state.[1:20:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: And each of these nodes provides a new site to give it plasticity and modulation, Not necessarily to change the way that something tastes, but to ensure that you consume more or less of differ or differently of what you need. I'm gonna give you one example of of of how the internal state changes the way the taste system works. Salt is very appetitive at low concentrations, and that's because we need it. It's our electrolyte balance requires salt. Every one of their neurons uses salt as the most important of the ions, You know, with potassium to ensure that you can transfer these electrical signals within and between neurons.[1:21:44] Dr. Charles Zuker: But at high concentrations, let's say ocean water, is incredibly aversive. And we all know this because we're going to the ocean and then when you get it in your mouth, it's not that great. However, If I salt deprive you, and we can do this in in experimental models quite readily, Now this incredibly high concentration of salt, 1 molar sodium chloride becomes amazingly appetitive and attractive. What's going on in here? Your tongue is telling you this is horrible, but your brain is telling you, I don't care.[1:22:26] Dr. Charles Zuker: You need it. And this is what we call the modulation of the taste system by the internal state.[1:22:37] Andrew Huberman: And presumably, if one is hungry enough, even uni will taste good. Just get[1:22:44] Dr. Charles Zuker: correct. Or if you're thirsty and hungry, you suppress hunger So that you don't waste water molecules in digesting food. Why? Because if you're thirsty and you have no water, You will die within a week or so, but you can go on a hunger strike as long as you have water For months because you're gonna eat up all your energy reserves. Water is a different story.[1:23:16] Dr. Charles Zuker: So you could see or or That that that there are multiple layers at which the taste system that guides, you know, our drive and our motivation to Consume the nutrients we need has to be modulated in response to the internal state. And, of course, internal state itself has to be modulated by the external world. And so that, I think, is a reason why What could otherwise would have been an incredibly simple system from the tongue to the cortex in one just wire, It's not. Because you have to ensure that at, you know, each step, you give the system that level of flexibility Or what we call in neuroscience, plasticity.[1:24:04] Andrew Huberman: I think we're headed into the gut. Alright. But I have a question that Has just been on my mind for a bit now because I was drinking this water, and it has essentially no taste.[1:24:16] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[1:24:18] Andrew Huberman: Is there any kind of signal for the absence of taste despite having something in the mouth? And here is why I ask. What I'm thinking about is saliva. Mhmm. And while it's true that if I eat a lot of very highly palatable foods, That does change how I experience more bland foods.[1:24:37] Andrew Huberman: I must confess, when I eat a lot of these highly processed foods, I don't particularly like them. Tend to crave healthier foods, but that's probably for contextual reasons about nutrients, etcetera. But I could imagine an experiment where[1:24:50] Dr. Charles Zuker: Is there a taste[1:24:51] Andrew Huberman: of no taste? Right. Is there a taste of no taste? Because in the visual system, there is.[1:24:55] Dr. Charles Zuker: Mhmm.[1:24:56] Andrew Huberman: Right? You close the eyes, and you start getting increases an activity in the visual system as opposed to decreases, which often surprises people. But there are reasons for that because everything is about signal to noise, signal to background. And It's a good question. I can[1:25:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: tell you that most of our work is trying to focus on how the taste system works, not how It doesn't[1:25:16] Andrew Huberman: work. Well, but, you know Yes.[1:25:18] Dr. Charles Zuker: We can.[1:25:18] Andrew Huberman: No. He's yeah. I know you're being playful, and I knew when inviting you here today, I was setting myself up for[1:25:23] Dr. Charles Zuker: Actually, on a on a on a different We're trying to learn things.[1:25:26] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I know. However Alright. Listen. I I was weaned in this system of, And I'll say it here for the 2nd actually, I recorded a podcast recently with a very prominent podcast, the Lex Fridman podcast, And I made reference to the so called New York neuroscience mafia.[1:25:41] Andrew Huberman: I won't say whether or not we are sitting in the presence of the New York neuroscience mafia member, but In any event, I know the sorts of a ribbing that they provide. For those listening, this is the kind of hazing that happens, benevolent hazing in academia. I'm I'm the target.[1:25:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: Of course. It's it's the it's It's[1:25:59] Andrew Huberman: a sign of love. Exactly. He's gonna tell me that.[1:26:02] Dr. Charles Zuker: And it's always about the science in the end. Right. But But it's it's it's an interesting question. Look. I, I don't know the answer, and And I don't even know how I would explore it in a way that it will rigorously teach me, But, here, let me tell you[1:26:26] Andrew Huberman: why I'm asking, and then I'll offer an experiment Yes. That I'd love to see someone[1:26:30] Dr. Charles Zuker: in here in the[1:26:31] Andrew Huberman: past too. I'm thinking about saliva[1:26:33] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[1:26:33] Andrew Huberman: Which it's No.[1:26:34] Dr. Charles Zuker: No. No. But that we know that we can figure it out nicely.[1:26:37] Andrew Huberman: But the question is whether or not the Saliva in a fed state is distinct from the saliva in an unfed state such that it modulates its sensitivity of the risk[1:26:49] Dr. Charles Zuker: has been done. No.[1:26:50] Andrew Huberman: It has been done. Yeah. Yeah. And so the answer is no.[1:26:52] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's no. Yeah. And you and then the way you could do the experiment is because we use artificial saliva.[1:26:58] Andrew Huberman: There's such a thing. I know there's artificial tears. But[1:27:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: No. No. Weed. I don't mean that you go to Walgreens that you get I mean, weed, my laboratory. Know the composition of saliva, and so you can make such a thing.[1:27:12] Dr. Charles Zuker: And and and and you can take, you know, taste, so as in culture Or in a tongue where you wash it out of and then you can apply artificial saliva. And what happens He said the system is being engineered to desensitize, to become Agnostic for saliva to become invisible. And there is no difference On the state of the animal. Great. Well, this[1:27:40] Andrew Huberman: is the reason to do experiments. Yeah. Absolutely. So it doesn't defeat any grand hypothesis. It's just[1:27:45] Dr. Charles Zuker: a pure curiosity. So you know that curiosity kills the cat?[1:27:49] Andrew Huberman: I do. But saves the career of a I understand.[1:27:56] Dr. Charles Zuker: Every single time. Drives us. Absolutely.[1:27:58] Andrew Huberman: Every single time.[1:27:59] Dr. Charles Zuker: Story of our lives.[1:28:00] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Okay. So if it's not saliva, and apparently, it is not, what about internal state, and what aspects of this the internal milieu are relevant? Because there's autonomic there's a sleep and awake. There's stress.[1:28:17] Andrew Huberman: One of the questions that I I got, from hundreds of people when I solicited questions in advance of this episode was, Why do I crave sugar when I'm stressed, for instance? And that could be contextual, but what are the basic elements?[1:28:29] Dr. Charles Zuker: Makes us feel good. By the way, we'll get to that. Soothing. The answer. It activates, what I'm going to generically refer to As reward pleasure centers in a way that it dramatically changes our internal state.[1:28:48] Dr. Charles Zuker: This is, you know, why do we eat a gallon of ice cream when we're very depressed? Yeah. In fact, this is a good segue to go into the into Into this entire different world, yeah, of of the body telling your brain What you need in in in in in important things like sugar and fat. Yeah? Okay.[1:29:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: But, anyways, go ahead. You were going to ask something.[1:29:13] Andrew Huberman: Well, no. I I would like to discuss the most basic elements of internal state.[1:29:19] Dr. Charles Zuker: Mhmm.[1:29:19] Andrew Huberman: In particular, the ones that are below our conscious detection. And this is a, of course, as a segue into this Incredible landscape, which is the gut brain axis, which I think 15 years ago was almost a, Maybe it was a couple of posters, end up meeting, and then now I believe you you and others, there are companies, there have companies, there are, active research programs, there's, and beautiful work.[1:29:48] Dr. Charles Zuker: Mhmm.[1:29:49] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you could describe some of that work that you and others have been involved in. And A lot of the listeners of this podcast will have heard of the gut brain axis, and there are a lot of misconceptions about the gut brain axis. Many people think that this means that we Think with our stomach because of the quote, unquote gut feeling[1:30:07] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[1:30:08] Andrew Huberman: Aspect, but I'd love for you to talk about the aspects of Gut brain signaling that drive our or change our perceptions and behaviors that are completely beneath our awareness.[1:30:18] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes. Excellent. So let me begin maybe by by stating that, you know, the brain needs to monitor The state of every one of our organs organs, it has to do it. This is the only way that the brain can ensure That every one of those organs are working together in a way that we have healthy physiology. Now this monitoring of the brain has been known for a long time, But I think what hadn't been fully appreciated that this is a two way highway where the brain is not only monitoring, But is now modulating back what the body needs to do.[1:31:10] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that includes all the way from monitoring the frequency of heartbeats and the way that inspiration and aspirations in the breathing cycle cooperate to what happens when you ingest sugar and fat. Now let me give you an example again of of of how the brain can take what we would refer to contextual associations and transforming into incredible changes in physiology and metabolism. You know, remember Pablo? So Pablo, in his classical experiments in conditioning, you know, associative conditioning, he would Take a bell. It will ring the bell every time it was going to feed the dog.[1:32:07] Dr. Charles Zuker: And, eventually, the Dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food coming. Now The first incredible finding he made is the fact that the dog now in the presence of the bell alone will start to salivate. And we will call that, you know, neurologically speaking, an anticipatory response. Okay. I could understand it.[1:32:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: I get it. You know, neurons in the brain that form that association now represent food is coming, And they're sending a signal to motor neurons to go into your salivary glands to squeeze them so you release, you know, You know, saliva because you know food is coming. But what's even more remarkable is that those animals are also releasing insulin. In response to a bell. Okay.[1:33:08] Dr. Charles Zuker: This illustrates one part of this two way highway, the highway going down. Somehow the brain created these associations and there are neurons in your brain now that no food is coming and send a signal somehow all the way down to your pancreas, then now it says release insulin because sugar It's coming down. Alright. This goes back to the magic of the brain. You know?[1:33:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's a never ending Source of both joy and intrigue. How the hell do they do this? Okay. I mean, the neurons. Yeah?[1:33:44] Dr. Charles Zuker: I share with you.[1:33:45] Andrew Huberman: I share your delight and fascination. There's not a day or a lecture or, Some talks are better than others or a talk where I don't sit back and just think it's absolutely amazing. Know.[1:33:58] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's amazing.[1:33:59] Andrew Huberman: It's amazing. Now[1:34:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now over the past, I don't know, dozen years, it and with great force over the last 5 years. Now the main highway that is communicating the state of the body with the brain, it has been And cover has been what we now refer to as the gut brain axis, and the highway is a specific bundle of nerves, You know, which emerge from the vagal ganglia, the nodal ganglia. And so is the vagus nerve That it's innovating the majority of the organs in your body. It's monitoring their function, Sending a signal to the brain, and now the brain going back down and saying, this is going alright. Do this, or this is not going so well.[1:34:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: Do that.[1:34:54] Andrew Huberman: And and I should point out, as you well know, every organ, spleen, pancreas,[1:35:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: lungs. Must they all must be monitored. In fact, you know, I now I have no doubt that diseases that we have dermally associated with metabolism, Physiology and even immunity are likely to emerge As diseases, conditions, state of the brain. I don't think obesity is a disease of metabolism. I believe obesity is a disease of brain circuits.[1:35:35] Andrew Huberman: I do as well.[1:35:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah? And and and so and so this this this view that we have, You know, been working on for the longest time because, you know, the molecules that we're dealing with are in the body, not in the head. You know, led us to, you know, to view, of course, these issues and problems has been one of metabolism physiology and so forth. They remain to be The carriers of the ultimate signal, but the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor of this orchestra physiology and metabolism. Alright.[1:36:12] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now let's go to the gut brain and sugar. May we please. Please. No.[1:36:20] Andrew Huberman: I I mean, the the the vagus nerve has, in popular culture, Has been, kind of converted into this single meaning of calming pathways, mostly because I actually have to tip my hat to the yogic community was among the 1st to talk about Vegas on and on and on. There are calming pathways that are, you know, so called parasympathetic pathways within the vagus. But I think that the more we learn about the vagus, The more it seems like an entire, set of neural connections as opposed to 1 nerve.[1:36:58] Dr. Charles Zuker: You got it.[1:36:58] Andrew Huberman: I just wanted to just mention that because I think a lot of people have heard about the vagus. Turns out experimentally in the laboratory, many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus. Firm mentally in the laboratory, many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus to create states of alertness and arousal When animals or even people, believe it or not, are close to dying or going into coma, stimulation of the vagus is one of the ways to wake up the brain Counter to the idea that it's just this way of calming oneself down.[1:37:22] Dr. Charles Zuker: And also, of course, I mean, one one has to be cautious there in that. So The the the the vagus nerve is made out of many thousands of fibers, You know, individual fibers that make this gigantic bundle. And it's likely, as we're speaking, that each of these fibers Carries a slightly different meaning. Yeah? Not necessarily 1 by 1, maybe 5, 5, or 10, 5, or 20 duty.[1:37:49] Dr. Charles Zuker: Alright. But they Carry meaning that's associated with their specific task. This group of fibers It's telling the brain about the state of your heart. This group of fiber is telling the brain about the state of your gut. This is telling your brain about its nutritional state.[1:38:13] Dr. Charles Zuker: This your pancreas. This your lungs. And They are, again, to make the same simple example, the keys of this piano. K. Yes.[1:38:27] Dr. Charles Zuker: You're right. There is a a lot of data showing that activating the entire vagal bundle Has very meaningful effects in a wide range of conditions. In fact, it's being used to treat untractable Depression.[1:38:48] Andrew Huberman: No stimulator.[1:38:51] Dr. Charles Zuker: Epileptic seizures. But, again, there are thousands of fibers carrying different functions. So to some degree, you know, this is like Turning the lights on the stadium Because you need to illuminate where you lost your keys under your seat, yet 10,000 bulbs Of a 1000 watts each have just come on. Only one of this is pointing to where And so I'm lucky enough that one of them happened to point to my site. So here you activate the bundle thousands of fibers.[1:39:39] Dr. Charles Zuker: I'm lucky enough that some of those happen to do something To make a meaningful difference in depression or to make a meaningful difference in epileptics, but It should not be misconstrued as arguing that this broad activation As any type of selectivity or specificity, we're just lucky enough that among all the things that have been done, Some of those happen to change the biology of these processes. Now the reason this is relevant Because the magic of this gut brain axis is the fact that you have these thousands of fibers really doing different functions. And our goal and along with many other great, you know, scientists, Including Steve Liverless that started a lot of, you know, this molecular dissection on this Vega gut brain communication line at Harvard is trying to uncover What are each of those lines doing? What are each of those keys of this piano playing?[1:40:59] Andrew Huberman: What's the latest there? Just as a brief update. I know Stephen Lee really is, I think I was there when he got his Howard Hughes, and I did not. That was, fun. Always great to to get beat by excellent people.[1:41:10] Dr. Charles Zuker: First of all, I'm happy you didn't because that way you can focus on this amazing podcast.[1:41:15] Andrew Huberman: That one thing. That's very gracious of you. It's always, feels better. It's not good to get beat out by excellent people. Steven Steven is, like, in his is second to none, and he is defining, as you said, the molecular, constituents of different elements of these many, many fibers.[1:41:33] Andrew Huberman: Is there an update there? Are they finding multiple parallel pathways?[1:41:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: They they are. They are. Some that control heartbeat, some that control the respiratory cycle, Some that might be involved in a gastric movement. You know, this notion that you are full, And you feel full in part because your gut gets distended, your stomach, for example. And then there are little sensors that are reading that and telling the brain, you're a fool.[1:42:05] Dr. Charles Zuker: That is. Yeah.[1:42:06] Andrew Huberman: So the textbooks will soon Change on the basis of the and other work.[1:42:11] Dr. Charles Zuker: In essence, I think we are learning enough about these these these lines, It that could really help put together this this holistic view of, You know, how the brain, it's truly changing body physiology, metabolism, and immunity. The part that hasn't been yet developed and that it needs a fair amount of work, but it's an exciting, Thrilling, you know, journey of discovery is how the signal comes back to now change that biology. You know, the example I gave you before with Pavlov's dog. Alright? I figure out, you know, How the association created this link between the bell, but then how does the brain tell the pancreas To release in the right amount of insulin.[1:43:07] Dr. Charles Zuker: Okay. So tell me tell me. Let me tell you About the gut brain axis and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat. Insatiable for sugar, unquenchable for fat. And this is a story about the fundamental difference between liking and wanting.[1:43:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: Like in sugar is the function of the taste system. And it's not really liking sugar, it's liking sweet. One thing sugar, our never ending appetite for sugar is the story of the gut brain axis. Liking versus wanting. And this Work it's work of, my own laboratory.[1:44:14] Dr. Charles Zuker: You know, that began long ago when we discovered the sweet receptors. And you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors. So In essence, these animals will be unable to taste sweet. A life without sweetness. How horrible.[1:44:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: Okay. And if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet, and we're gonna put either sugar or an artificial sweetener. Alright. They both are sweet. They have slightly different tastes, but that's simply because artificial sweeteners have some off tastes.[1:44:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned, they both activate the same receptor, Trigger the same signal. And if you give an animal an option of a bottle containing sugar or a sweetener versus water, this animal will drink 10 to 1 from the bottle containing sweet. That's The taste system. Animal goes samples. Each one leaks a couple of leaks, and then say, uh-uh.[1:45:22] Dr. Charles Zuker: That's the one I want because it's appetitive and because I love it.[1:45:27] Andrew Huberman: So it prefers sugar to artificial sweetener?[1:45:29] Dr. Charles Zuker: No. No. No. No. No.[1:45:31] Dr. Charles Zuker: In this experiment this experiment, I'm gonna put Only sweet in 1 bottle, and it could be either sugar or artificial sweetener. It doesn't matter which one. Okay. We're gonna do the next experiment Where we separate those 2. For now, it's sweet versus water.[1:45:46] Dr. Charles Zuker: Okay. And sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means anything that tastes sweet. Alright? And sugar is one example, and Splenda is another example.[1:45:59] Dr. Charles Zuker: Aspartame,[1:46:00] Andrew Huberman: monk fruit[1:46:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: Hello? Stevia. Yeah.[1:46:02] Andrew Huberman: You get Doesn't matter.[1:46:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. I mean, there's some that only humans can taste. Mice cannot taste Because their receptors between humans and mice are different, but we have put the human receptor Into mice, we engineer mice, and we completely humanize this mouse's taste world. Alright? But for the purpose of this conversation, we're only comparing sweet versus My goodness.[1:46:33] Dr. Charles Zuker: They will leak to know in in the from the sweet side, 10 to 1 at least versus the water. Makes sense? Alright. Now we're gonna take the mice, and we're gonna genetically engineer it to remove the sweet receptors. So these mice no longer have in their oral cavity any sensors that can detect sweetness.[1:46:56] Dr. Charles Zuker: Be that Sugar molecule, beat an artificial sweetener, beat anything else that tastes sweet. And if you give these mice an option between Sweet versus water, sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water. He will drink equally well from both because he cannot tell them apart. It doesn't have the receptors for sweets, so that sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense?[1:47:22] Dr. Charles Zuker: Makes sense. Very good. Now we're gonna do the experiment with sugar. From now on, let's focus on sugar. So I'm gonna give a mouse a sugar versus water.[1:47:34] Dr. Charles Zuker: Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar very little from the water. Knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them. Mouse can no longer tell them apart, and it will drink from both. But if I keep the mouse in that case for the next 48 hours, Something extraordinary happens when I come 48 hours later and I see what the mouse is leaking or drinking from. That mouse is drinking almost exclusively from the sugar bottle.[1:48:09] Dr. Charles Zuker: How could this be? He cannot taste it. Doesn't have sweet receptors. During those 48 hours, the mouse learn that there is something in that bottle that makes me feel good, and that is the bottle I want to consume. Now how does the mouse identify that bottle?[1:48:34] Dr. Charles Zuker: It does so by using other sensory features. The smell of the bottle, the texture of the solution inside, sugar, the high concentrations is kind of goopy. The sadness in which the bottle is in the cage. It doesn't matter what. But the mouse realized there is something there That makes me feel good, and that's what I want.[1:49:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: And that is the fundamental basis Oh, our unquenchable desire and our craving for sugar and is mediated by the gut brain axis. The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop. Immediately suggesting a post ingestive effect. So we reason if this is true and it's the gut brain axis that's driving sugar preference, Then there should be a group of neurons in the brain that are responding to post ingestive sugar. And lo and behold, we identify a group of neurons in the brain that does this, and these neurons receive their input Directly from the gut brain axis.[1:49:54] Dr. Charles Zuker: From other neurons. You got it. And so what's happening is that sugar is recognized normally by the tongue, Activates an repetitive response. Now you ingest it, and now it activates a selective group of cells in your intestines that now send a signal to the brain via the vagal ganglia that says I got what I need. The tongue doesn't know that you got what you need.[1:50:28] Dr. Charles Zuker: It only knows that you tasted it. This knows that it got to the point that it's going to be used, Which is the cat. And now it sends the signal to now reinforce the consumption of this thing Because this is the one that I needed. Sugar, source of energy.[1:50:48] Andrew Huberman: And these are these neurons in the gut? So these[1:50:52] Dr. Charles Zuker: are not neurons in the gut. So these are gut cells that recognize the sugar molecule[1:50:57] Andrew Huberman: I see.[1:50:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: Send a signal, and that signal is received By the vagal neuron directly. Got it. And this sends a signal through the gut brain access to the Cell bodies of these neurons in the vagal ganglia, and from there to the brain stem to now trigger the preference for sugar.[1:51:18] Andrew Huberman: Two questions. 1, you mentioned that these cells that detect sugar within the gut are actually within the intestine. You didn't say stomach, You Which surprised me. I always think gut as stomach, but, of course, your[1:51:31] Dr. Charles Zuker: your intestine because that's where all the absorption happens.[1:51:33] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[1:51:33] Dr. Charles Zuker: So you want the signal. See, you want the brain to know that you had successful ingestion and breakdown of whatever you consume into the building blocks of life. And, you know, glucose, amino acids, fatty. And so you wanna make sure that Once they are in the form that intestines can now absorb them is where you get the signal back saying, this is what I want. Okay?[1:52:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: Now Let me just take it 1 step further. And this now sugar molecules activates its unique gut brain circuit That now drives the development of our preference for sugar. Now A key element of this circuit is that the sensors in the gut that recognize the sugar Do not recognize artificial sweeteners at all,[1:52:33] Andrew Huberman: because of their nutrient value is uncoupled from the taste.[1:52:39] Dr. Charles Zuker: Generically speaking, one can make that but it's because it's a very different type of receptor. I see. Turns out that's not the tongue receptors being used in the gut. It's a completely different molecule that only recognizes the glucose molecule, not artificial sweeteners. This has a profound impact on the effect of ultimately artificial sweeteners In curbing our appetite, our craving, our insatiable desire for sugar.[1:53:13] Dr. Charles Zuker: Since they don't activate the gut brain access, they'll never satisfy the craving for sugar Like sugar does. And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners have failed in the market To curve our appetite, our need, our desire for sugar It's because they beautifully work on the tongue, the liking to recognize sweet versus nonsweet, but they failed to activate the key sensors in the gut That now inform the brain, you got sugar. No need to crave anymore. So the,[1:54:05] Andrew Huberman: the issue of wanting[1:54:06] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes.[1:54:07] Andrew Huberman: Can we relate that to a particular set of neurochemicals upstream of so the pathway is Stream of so the pathway is the so glucose is activating these cells in the gut that through the vagus that's communicated through the, Presumably, the nodal is ganglion and up into the brain stem. Very good.[1:54:21] Dr. Charles Zuker: And And from there, where does it go?[1:54:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Where is it going? What is the substrate of wanting? I, you know, of course, I think molecules like dopamine, craving. There's a book even called the molecule of more, etcetera, etcetera.[1:54:34] Andrew Huberman: Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know, because it evokes both a sense of pleasure ish, but also a sense of desiring more of craving. So, if I understand you correctly, artificial sweeteners are and I agree, are failing as a means to Satisfy sugar craving at the level of nutrient sensing, and yet if we trigger this True sugar evoked wanting pathway too much, and we've all experienced this, then we Eat sugar, and we find ourselves wanting more and more sugar. Now that could also be insulin dysregulation, but, can we uncouple those? Yeah. I mean, look,[1:55:20] Dr. Charles Zuker: If we have a mega problem with overconsumption of sugar and fat, In we're facing a unique time in our evolution where diseases of malnutrition are due to overnutrition. I mean, how nuts is that? I mean, historically, Diseases of malnutrition have always been linked to undernutrition. K? And so we need to come up with strategies that can meaningfully change The activation of these circuits that control our wanting, Certainly, in the populations at risk and This gut brain circuit that ultimately, you know, it's the lines of communication that are informing The brain, the presence of intestinal sugar in this example, it's a very important target In the way we think about, is there a way that we can meaningfully modulate these circuits?[1:56:38] Dr. Charles Zuker: So I make your brain think That you got satisfied with sugar even though I'm not giving you sugar.[1:56:47] Andrew Huberman: So that immediately Raise the question, are the receptors for glucose in these gut cells susceptible to other things that are healthier for us? That's Very good. Excellent idea.[1:57:01] Dr. Charles Zuker: And I think an important goal will be to Come up with a strategy and identify those very means that allow us to modulate the circuits In a way that certainly for all of those where this is a big issue, It can really have a, you know, dramatic impact in improving human health. I could be[1:57:28] Andrew Huberman: wrong about this, and I'm happy to be wrong. Yes. I'm often wrong[1:57:31] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah.[1:57:32] Andrew Huberman: And told I'm wrong. That we have cells within our gut that don't just sense sugar, glucose, to be specific, but also Cells within our gut that sends amino acids and fatty acids. I could imagine a scenario where One could train themselves to feel in immense amounts of satiety from the consumption of foods that Are rich in essential fatty acids, amino acids, perhaps less caloric or less, insulin disregulating than sugar. I'll use myself as an example. I've always enjoyed sweets, but in the last few years, for some reason, I've started to lose my appetite for them, Probably because I just don't eat them anymore.[1:58:18] Andrew Huberman: At first, that took some restriction. Now I just don't even think about it.[1:58:21] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. And you're not reinforcing the circuits. And so you're in essence are are are removing yourself from but you tend to be the exception. You know, we have a A a huge a huge a incredibly large number of people that are being continuously exposed to highly processed foods. Yeah?[1:58:43] Andrew Huberman: And hidden so called hidden sugars.[1:58:45] Dr. Charles Zuker: The the the they they don't even have to be hidden. You know, it's right there. Hiding[1:58:49] Andrew Huberman: in plain sight.[1:58:51] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah.[1:58:51] Andrew Huberman: I I agree. So much is made of hidden sugars that, we often overlook that they are there are also the overt Yeah.[1:58:59] Dr. Charles Zuker: I I mean, we can have a long discussion on the importance of coming up with strategies, You know, that could meaningfully change public health when it comes to nutrition. But I wanna, yes, go back to the notion of, you know, these brain centers that are ultimately The ones that are being activated by these essential nutrients. So sugar, fat, and amino acids are building blocks of our diets. And this is across all animal species. So it's not unreasonable then to assume The dedicated brain circuits would have evolved to ensure their recognition, Their ingestion and the reinforcement that that is what I need.[1:59:58] Dr. Charles Zuker: And indeed, you know, animals evolve these 2 Systems. Yeah. 1 is the taste system that allows you to recognize them and trigger this predetermined hardwired immediate responses. Yes? Oh my goodness.[2:00:18] Dr. Charles Zuker: This is taste so good. It's so sweet. I personally have a sweet tooth. And, you know, oh my god. This is so delicious.[2:00:25] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's fatty or umami recognizing amino acids. So that's The liking pathway. Yeah? But in the wisdom of evolution, That's good, but doesn't quite do it. You wanna make sure that these things get to the place where they are needed, and they are not needed in your tongue.[2:00:49] Dr. Charles Zuker: They are needed in your intestines where they are going to be absorbed as the nutrients that will support life, And the brain wants to know this, and he wants to know it in a way that he can now Form the association between that that I just tasted is what got word needs to be, and it makes me feel good. And so now next time that I have to choose, What should I eat? That association now guides me to that's the one I want. I want that fruit, not that fruit. I want those leaves, not those leaves Because these are the ones that activate the right circuits that ensure that the right nutrients got to the right place and told the brain, This is what I want and need.[2:01:52] Dr. Charles Zuker: Are we on?[2:01:53] Andrew Huberman: We're on. One thing that intrigues me and puzzles me Yes. Is that this effect took a couple of days, at least in mice. Yes. And the sensation, sorry.[2:02:04] Andrew Huberman: The perception of taste Is immediate. Is immediate, and yet this is a slow system. And so in a beautiful way, but in a Kind of mysterious way the brain is able to couple the taste of a sweet drink with the experience of nutrient extraction in the gut Under a context where the mouse and the human is presumably ingesting other things, smelling other mice, smelling other people, That's incredible.[2:02:30] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. But you have to think of it not as as humans. Remember, we inherited the circuits of our ancestors, and they through evolutionary from their ancestors. And we haven't had that many, you know, years to have fundamentally changed in many of these hardwired circuits. So forget As humans, let's look at animals in the wild.[2:02:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: Okay? Which is easier now to comprehend the logic. You know, why should this take a long time of continued reinforcement given that I can taste it In a second. You wanna make sure that this source of sugar, for example, in the wild is the best, is the richest. It's the one where I get the most energy for the least amount of extraction, The least amount of work.[2:03:32] Dr. Charles Zuker: I wanna identify rich sources of sugar. And if the system simply responds Immediately to the 1st sugar that gets to your gut, you're gonna form the association with those sources of food Which are not the ones that you should be eaten from.[2:03:52] Andrew Huberman: Don't fall in love with the 1st person you encounter.[2:03:55] Dr. Charles Zuker: Oh my goodness. Exactly. And so evolutionarily, by having the taste system giving you the immediate recognition, but then by forcing this gut brain access To reinforce it only when sustained in a repeated exposure has informed the brain, This is the one you don't wanna form the association before. And so, You know, when we remove it from the context of, you know, we just go to, you know, the supermarket. We're not hunting there in the wild where I need to forum.[2:04:36] Dr. Charles Zuker: And so what's happening is that highly processed foods are Hijacking, you know, co opting the circuits in a way that it would have never happened in nature, and then We not only find these things up appetitive and palatable, but in addition, we are continuously reinforcing, you know, the wanting In a way that, oh my god. This is so great. What do[2:05:04] Andrew Huberman: I feel like eating? Let me have more of this. You've just forever changed the way that I think about supermarkets and restaurants. It there are understanding this fast signaling and this slower signaling and the utility of having both Makes me realize that supermarkets and restaurants are about the most unnatural thing for our No system ever. Almost it almost the equivalent of of living in small villages with very few, suitable mates Versus online dating, for instance.[2:05:35] Dr. Charles Zuker: I'm not gonna make a judgment call there because they do serve an important purpose.[2:05:40] Andrew Huberman: I like restaurants too.[2:05:41] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. But and so do supermarkets. Thank god. I I think they're not the culprits. Yeah.[2:05:47] Dr. Charles Zuker: I think the culprits, of course, you know, our our our Our our reliance on on foods that are not necessarily healthy. Now Going back to the supermarket, the don't fall in love with the first. They need to work. You know, you take you you take, Tangerine. And you take an extract of Tangerine that you used to cook that spike, let's say, with sugar.[2:06:29] Dr. Charles Zuker: And you equalize in both where they both provide the same amount of calories. If you eat them both, they're gonna have a very different effect in your gut brain axis and your system. Once you make the extract and you process it and you add it processed sugar, you know, to use it now to cook, to add, to make it really sweet tangerine thing. Now you're providing now, fully ready to use broken down source of sugar. In the tangerine, that sugar, it's mix in the complexity Of a whole set of other chemical components, fiber, long chains of sugar molecules That need a huge amount of work by your stomach, your gut system To break it down.[2:07:29] Dr. Charles Zuker: So you're using a huge amount of energy to extract energy. And the balance, it's very different that when I take this process highly extracted Tangerine by the way, I use tangerines because I had a tangerine just before I came in. Delicious. They are delicious. And and and and and so And so this goes back to the issue of of supermarkets.[2:07:58] Dr. Charles Zuker: And then and so to to to some degree, you know, a, given a choice, You don't wanna eat processed highly processed foods because everything has already been broken down for you. And so your system has no work, And so you are co opting hijacking these circuits in a way that they're being activated at a time scale that normally wouldn't happen. This is why I I often feel that and I think a lot of data are now starting to support[2:08:27] Andrew Huberman: the idea that while indeed the laws of thermodynamics Why calories ingested versus calories burned is a very real thing. Right? That the Appetite for certain foods and the the wanting and the liking are phenomena of the nervous system, Brain and gut as you've beautifully described, and that that changes over time depending on how we are Receiving these new trends.[2:08:57] Dr. Charles Zuker: Absolutely. Look. We have a lot of work to do. I'm talking the society. I'm not talking about you and I.[2:09:09] Andrew Huberman: We also have a[2:09:10] Dr. Charles Zuker: lot of work to do. Now, I think understanding the circuits is giving us important insights and how ultimately, hopefully, we can improve Human health and make a meaningful difference. Now it's very easy to try to, you know, Connect the dots, a to b, b to c, c to d. And I think there's a lot more complexity to it, But I do think that the lessons that are emerging out of understanding how these circuits operate Can ultimately inform how we deal with our diets In a way that we avoid what we're facing now, you know, as a society. Yeah?[2:10:03] Dr. Charles Zuker: I mean, it's nuts that the overnutrition Happens to be such a prevalent problem.[2:10:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And I also think the training of people who are thinking about metabolic science and metabolic diseases Largely divorced from the training of the neuroscientists and vice versa. No one field is to blame, but I fully agree that the The brain is is the key over or the nervous system to be, more accurate is the one of the key overlooked Features.[2:10:32] Dr. Charles Zuker: It's the arbitrary. Ultimately, it's the arbiter of many of these pathways.[2:10:38] Andrew Huberman: As a final question and one which is Simply to entertain my curiosity and the curiosity of the listeners, what is your absolute Favorite food.[2:10:49] Dr. Charles Zuker: Oh my goodness.[2:10:52] Andrew Huberman: Taste, I should say. Yes. Taste to distinguish between taste and the nutritive value or lack thereof.[2:11:00] Dr. Charles Zuker: Look. We, unlike every animal and every animal species, Eat for the enjoyment of it. It doesn't happen in the wild. Most animals eat when they need to eat. Doesn't mean they don't enjoy it, but it's a completely different story.[2:11:21] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yeah. I have too many favorite foods because I enjoy the sensory experience. Rather than the food itself, to me is the whole thing. It's from the present look. We've been these experiments done in psychophysics.[2:11:39] Dr. Charles Zuker: Wanna take a salad made out of 11 components, and I'm gonna mix them all up in a Potpourri of greens and other things here. And in the other one, I'm gonna present it in a beautiful arrangement. And I'm gonna put it behind a glass cabinet, And I'm gonna sell them. And I'm gonna sell 1 for $2 and 1 for $8. Precisely the same ingredient, exactly the same amount of each.[2:12:06] Dr. Charles Zuker: Ultimately, you're gonna mix them. They're all gonna be the same. And people will pay the $8 because you know what? It evokes a different person. The it gives you the feel that, oh my goodness, I'm gonna enjoy that salad.[2:12:26] Dr. Charles Zuker: So going back to what is my favorite food. To me, eating is really A sensory journey. I don't mean the everyday, let me have some, you know, Chicken wings because I'm hungry. It but every piece, I think, As an important evoking sensory role. And so, you know, in terms of categories of food, you know, I grew up in Chile.[2:13:06] Dr. Charles Zuker: Yes. So meat It's always been. But I eat it so seldom now.[2:13:13] Andrew Huberman: Is that right? Yeah.[2:13:14] Dr. Charles Zuker: Because, You know, I know that's not necessarily the whole this thing. Red meat, I'm talking about. Yeah? And so I, you know, I grew up eating it every day. I'm talking 7 days a week.[2:13:26] Dr. Charles Zuker: Chile in Argentina, you know, that's Mhmm. The mainstay of our diet. Yeah? Now maybe I have red meat. I know.[2:13:37] Dr. Charles Zuker: Once every 4 weeks. And you enjoy it. Oh, I love it. Part of it is because I haven't had it in 4 weeks. But, you know, I love sushi, but I love the the the art of sushi.[2:13:53] Dr. Charles Zuker: You know, the whole thing, you know, the way it's presented, It changes the way you taste it. I love ethnic food in particular.[2:14:06] Andrew Huberman: You're in[2:14:06] Dr. Charles Zuker: the right place. You got it. That was the main reason I wanted to come to New York. No. I'm just kidding.[2:14:11] Andrew Huberman: There's also that Columbia University that's And[2:14:14] Dr. Charles Zuker: I came here because I wanted to be with, you know, people that are thinking about the brain the same way that I like to think, which, you know, can we solve this big problem? This big question.[2:14:26] Andrew Huberman: And, certainly, you're making amazing strides in that direction. And I love your answer because it really brings together The many features of the circuitries and the phenomena we've been talking about today, which is that while it begins with sensation and perception, ultimately, it's the context, and that context is Highly individual to person, place, and time, and many, many other things. On behalf of myself, And, certainly, on behalf of all the listeners, I wanna thank you, first of all, for the incredible work that you've been doing now for decades in vision, in taste, And in this bigger issue of how we perceive and experience life, it's, truly pioneering and incredible work. And I feel quite lucky to have Been on the sidelines seeing this over the years and hearing the talks and reading the countless beautiful papers, but also for your time today To come down here and talk to us about what drives you and the discoveries you've made, thank you ever so much.[2:15:22] Dr. Charles Zuker: It was great fun.
