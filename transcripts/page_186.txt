Kronikle AI - Dr. Robert Lustig: How Sugar & Processed Foods Impact Your Health - TranscriptDr. Robert Lustig: How Sugar & Processed Foods Impact Your Health - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is doctor Robert Lustig. Doctor Robert Lustig is an endocrinologist, that is he's a specialist in the function of hormones in the body, and a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco. He has authored more than 100 peer reviewed studies exploring how different types of nutrients, that is food, impact our cellular functioning, our organ functioning, and thereby our health.[0:00:38] Andrew Huberman: During today's discussion, we discussed the idea of whether or not a calorie is indeed a calorie, and whether or not our body weight and body composition only reflects the number of calories we eat versus the calories that we burn. We talk about how different food types, that is how the different macronutrients, protein, fat, And carbohydrates are processed in the body and the important role that fiber and the gut microbiome plays in that process. And we pay particular attention to the topic of how different types of sugars and fructose in particular can indeed be addictive to the brain and can modify The way that hormones in the body, in particular, insulin, impact our liver health, kidney health, and indeed the health of all of our cells and organs. Indeed, doctor Lustig is an expert in how sugar impacts the brain and body. We talk about how certain types of sugars can indeed be addictive in the Same way that certain drugs of abuse and behaviors can become addictive.[0:01:34] Andrew Huberman: So in other words, how sugar actually changes the way that the brain works. And we discuss how the food industry, that is the commoditization and sale of particular types of food, has altered the way that we eat and indeed, the foods that we crave. Today's discussion covers all of that. And by the end of today's discussion, you'll have a thorough understanding of how foods are processed when they enter your body and how those different food choices are impacting your immediate and long term health. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:02:06] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is 8 Sleep. 8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.[0:02:31] Andrew Huberman: Now a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees. One of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the Appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment, And that's what 8 Sleep allows you to do. It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized. I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for almost 3 years now, And it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep, so much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my 8 Sleep, I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my 8 Sleep mattress cover.[0:03:26] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8 sleep.com/huberman To get a $150 off their Pod 3 mattress cover, 8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, That's 8 sleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors in your immediate and long term health is your It's very easy to use.[0:04:08] Andrew Huberman: You just put the monitor on the back of your arm, and then you take your phone and you scan it over that monitor now and again, and it downloads the data about your blood sugar levels in the preceding hours. Using Levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about what works best for me in terms of nutrition, exercise, work schedules, and sleep. If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor, you can go to levels.link/huberman. Levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous version. Right now, they're also offering an additional 2 free months of membership.[0:04:42] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's levels.link/huberman to try the new sensor and 2 free months of membership. Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress. AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee, but is in fact a much better way to make coffee. I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago,[0:05:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: And I've been using 1[0:05:02] Andrew Huberman: ever since. AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford. And I knew of Alan because he had also built The so called Aerobe Frisbee, which I believe at one time, perhaps still now, held the Guinness Book of World Records for furthest Thrown object. And I used to see Alan, believe it or not, at parks around Palo Alto testing out different Aerobie Frisbees. So he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products.[0:05:31] Andrew Huberman: Now I love coffee. I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day, usually about 90 a 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning, although not always. Sometimes if I'm going to exercise, I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning, but I love, love, love coffee. And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee. I don't know what exactly it is In the AeroPress that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other Form of brewing that coffee, even the traditional French press.[0:06:04] Andrew Huberman: The AeroPress is extremely easy to use, and it's extremely compact. In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel, and I use it on the road, in hotels, even on planes. I'll just ask for some hot water, and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane. If you'd like to try AeroPress, You can go to aeropress.com/huberman. That's aeropress.com/huberman To get 20% off any AeroPress coffee maker, AeroPress ships anywhere in the USA, Canada, and over 60 other countries around the world.[0:06:33] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's Aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off. And now for my discussion with doctor Robert Lustig.[0:06:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: Doctor Robert Lustig, welcome. Pleasure. Truly, just being here, being invited, high honor. Really appreciate it. And it's not doctor who's, just Rob.[0:06:55] Andrew Huberman: Okay, Rob. I've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time. I've seen your now famous, We also say infamous, but famous YouTube video about sugar. We'll put a link to it in the show note captions. It's been viewed many, many millions of times.[0:07:09] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. And I still can't figure out why that is. You know?[0:07:12] Andrew Huberman: Well, I[0:07:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: didn't think my mother would watch it, and she didn't, but 24 and a half 1000000 people[0:07:17] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think people are very interested in what to eat, what not to eat, and we'll start off Simply talking about what most everyone believes and understands, which is that a calorie is a form of heat energy that's given off during the processing of some food bit or something. If that's mysterious to people, just understand that a calorie is a unit of energy. And I was taught and still many, many people worldwide believe that a calorie is a calorie. Meaning, If I consume more calories in whatever form than I metabolize by thinking, feeling, moving, exercising, etcetera, then I will gain weight. And if I consume fewer calories than I burn, I will lose weight.[0:08:08] Andrew Huberman: And We could talk a lot about where that weight loss comes from. Does it come from adipose body fat stores or from muscle or from Protein or muscle, of course, is protein, etcetera. But let's start off with, is a calorie truly a calorie when it comes to the processing of different types of calories.[0:08:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Everyone thinks that obesity is about energy balance. That is Calories in, calories out. Therefore, 2 behaviors, gluttony and sloth. Therefore, If you're fat, it's your fault. Therefore, diet and exercise.[0:08:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: Therefore, any calorie can be part of a balanced diet. Therefore, don't pick on our calories. Go pick on somebody else's calories. This is actually what the food industry uses to assuage their culpability For the change in the food supply and the rise in obesity and chronic disease like diabetes. Now it is true That a calorie is that unit of energy that raises 1 gram of water 1 degree centigrade.[0:09:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: And so therefore, a calorie burned is a calorie burnt. I don't argue that. That's true. That's, you know, the first law of thermodynamics. But that doesn't mean a calorie eaten is a calorie eaten.[0:09:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's not the same, and that's where people get it wrong. So let me give you some examples of how that calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten. You like almonds? I do. Me too.[0:09:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Almonds are great. You eat a 160 calories in almonds. How many of those do you absorb? 130. You eat a 160, absorb a 130, where'd the other 30 go?[0:10:05] Andrew Huberman: In the processing of that food energy?[0:10:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Nope. Turns out the fiber in those almonds, Both soluble and insoluble fiber, and by the way, fiber's sort of the key to the kingdom in this story, forms a gel On the inside of your intestine, the insoluble fiber, the cellulose, forms a fishnet, if you will, a lattice work On the inside of your duodenum, the soluble fiber which are globular plug the holes in that fishnet. Together, they form a secondary Barrier, you can actually see it on electron microscopy, a whitish gel, and that prevents absorption of those 30 calories. So, yes, a 130 get absorbed, but many of them don't. They end up going further down the intestine To the next part called the jejunum, and that's where the microbiome is.[0:10:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now everyone knows about the microbiome nowadays. You know? It's all the bacteria. You know, we always say when women are pregnant, you're eating for 2. Well, we're always eating for a 100 trillion.[0:11:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now they have to eat. Well, what do they eat? They eat what you eat. The question is how much did you get versus how much did they get? Well, if you ate almonds, They're getting those 30 calories.[0:11:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: So even though you count the calories at your lips, that doesn't matter. What really matters is Counting the calories at your intestinal brush border. K? And they're not the same. So if you feed your gut, That's a good thing because then your gut will take those calories and turn it into things like short chain fatty acids, which end up being protective against Chronic metabolic disease, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, those are actually good.[0:11:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're anti inflammatory, anti Alzheimer's Because you fed your microbiome. So even though you ate a 160, you absorbed a 130. So a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten because if you ate it Fiber, it wasn't for you. It was for your bacteria, but that's not the way you count them up. So that's problem number 1.[0:12:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: Problem number 2, amino acids. So we all eat protein. Let's say you eat too much protein. You have, you know, The porterhouse steak. Alright?[0:12:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now if you're a bodybuilder, those amino acids might go to Muscle. And you might increase your muscle mass because you're a bodybuilder, because you're putting, excess, force on those muscles and you're growing those muscles. Okay. But let's say you're not a bodybuilder. Let's say you're a mere mortal like me.[0:12:46] Andrew Huberman: Or let's say you're a kid going through puberty who's synthesizing a lot of muscle, Not because they're lifting weights because[0:12:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: they're Because testosterone's making it happen. Yeah. Absolutely. But let's say you're not. Let's say, you know, you're just, you know, Just slump off the the street like, you know, Joe Schmoe, and you eat that porterhouse.[0:13:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: You've taken on all these amino acids. There's no place to store it other than muscle, so your liver takes the excess and deamidates That amino acid takes the amino group off to turn it from, amino acid into an organic acid, and then that organic acid Can then enter the Krebs cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, what goes on in the mitochondria in order to generate ATP, the chemical energy that your body needs in order to power itself. Okay. Now that's a good thing. It takes double the amount of energy To prepare that amino acid for burning as it does to prepare a carbohydrate for burning Or fruit.[0:13:49] Andrew Huberman: If because when I asked about when you asked about almonds, why the the 160 versus 130? I thought it was the process. I entered out it was fiber. You're saying for protein, Let's let's make it realistic for a a really nice big porterhouse steak, which I love, by the way. Let's say 2.[0:14:05] Andrew Huberman: Let's say 800 calories.[0:14:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Well, 2 weeks[0:14:08] Andrew Huberman: How much of that is is, so that's what goes in your mouth.[0:14:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[0:14:12] Andrew Huberman: My mouth.[0:14:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[0:14:14] Andrew Huberman: How much of it is actually Yeah. Eaten in, to stay with the your calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten. In the processing of that, what percentage is actually goes into your total Caloric intake.[0:14:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. So about 10% of everything you eat goes to just maintaining body temperature. It's called the thermic effect of food. But when you're eating protein, you actually generate more heat, and the reason is because it takes 2 ATP to phosphorylate that organic acid as opposed to 1 ATP to, phosphorylate that carbohydrate for, consumption. So you actually have a net loss of energy because it was an amino acid versus A monosaccharide, a a sugar.[0:15:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now you you brought up fat. Fat doesn't need to be phosphorylated, so it actually doesn't have any, Thermic effect of food at that point. So depends on what it is as to whether or not you have loss.[0:15:19] Andrew Huberman: K. So but with this, Let's make it actually realistic. A 1600 calorie[0:15:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[0:15:25] Andrew Huberman: Porterhouse with a nice slab of of, butter. Grass fed butter on there.[0:15:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: I do[0:15:30] Andrew Huberman: this every once in a while, not not often, but[0:15:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: some creamed spinach and maybe some mushrooms along the side.[0:15:35] Andrew Huberman: Honestly, I see it. When I'm eating a porterhouse, I don't want To adulterate the taste[0:15:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay.[0:15:40] Andrew Huberman: With anything else except maybe some some butter, maybe a salad Okay. Afterwards. But Alright. But let's say 1600 calories of of, It's got some fat in there for sure. Mhmm.[0:15:50] Andrew Huberman: Let's say, a 1,000 of those calories is protein. Mhmm. The other 600 are fat. Something like that. Something like that depending on how marbled it is.[0:16:00] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. K. So based on what you just said about the thermic effect of food and protein in particular.[0:16:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[0:16:06] Andrew Huberman: Of that 1,000 calories, how much actually is can we count? I'm not a calorie counter, but does one include as calories truly ingested?[0:16:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, if you ingested 1600[0:16:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, that's what went in the mouth, but but but what is is gonna go against your your, Burn deficit.[0:16:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. So I would have to actually do the math to figure that out. But, yeah, as a guess Yeah. Back of the envelope. Back of the envelope calculation, You're gonna lose about 25% of that.[0:16:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: Wow.[0:16:36] Andrew Huberman: So we're talking 750 calories.[0:16:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[0:16:39] Andrew Huberman: You know? So for and to translate this a bit, so what we're saying here is if you're somebody who is trying to lose weight or maintain weight or perhaps even gain weight, you eat A 1600 calorie porterhouse with a slab of butter on it, 600 of those calories we're saying in this instance is fat with the remaining 1,000 calories, That's that all went in your mouth.[0:17:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: So counted at your mouth.[0:17:02] Andrew Huberman: Right. But 700 but then when you compare it against your energy burn for that day To maintain temperature, brain activity, physical activity, really, it's only 750 calories.[0:17:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right.[0:17:13] Andrew Huberman: That's a huge difference.[0:17:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. And another reason why a calorie is not a calorie. Now let's take the 3rd. Let's take fats. So here we have omega threes, Heart healthy anti inflammatory, anti Alzheimer's, save your life.[0:17:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: And over here, we have trans fats, the devil incarnate, Consumable poison because you can't break the trans double bond. You don't have the desaturase to break that trans double bond. So It basically accumulates, lines your arteries, lines your liver, causes chronic metabolic disease, causes insulin resistance. Omega threes don't even get broken down for energy because they're so important. They Stay intact because your brain needs them.[0:18:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: Your heart needs them. Whereas, trans fats can't be broken down because of that trans double bond. 1, save your life. Other 1, kill you. They're both 9 calories per gram if you explode them in a bomb calorimeter Because a calorie burned is a calorie burned, but a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten because 1 will save your life, 1 will kill you.[0:18:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: And finally, the big kahuna, the one that blows everything else out of the water, fructose and glucose. Alright. Now glucose is the energy of life.[0:18:32] Andrew Huberman: So here we're talking carbohydrates. I think most of our audience will be familiar with the so called macronutrients. So we talked about fat and, This case, almonds. There's so much fiber in there, probably a little bit of carbohydrate.[0:18:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: A little bit.[0:18:42] Andrew Huberman: Little bit. Talked about the porterhouse with butter. Right. You can be hungry already. That's protein and fat.[0:18:48] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Very little, if any, carbohydrate. I should be 0, essentially. Maybe[0:18:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: 1. 0.[0:18:53] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And then now we're talking about carbohydrates, and we're gonna subdivide that into glucose and fructose.[0:19:01] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. Galactose basically becomes glucose in the liver, So we we can dispense with that unless you have a disease called galactosemia, which is about 1 in 20,000, and causes Neonatal meningitis and, you know, it's a disease as a pediatric endocrinologist I would take care of, but we can dispense with that for the moment. Alright. So glucose fructose. Glucose is the energy of life.[0:19:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: Every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy. Glucose is so damn important That if you don't consume it, your body makes it. So it will take an amino acid and turn it into glucose.[0:19:36] Andrew Huberman: That's gluconeogenesis? Gluconeogenesis.[0:19:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. It will take a fatty acid and turn it into glucose, and specifically, the glycerol portion of the, triglyceride will turn into glucose. So the Inuit, they didn't have any place to grow carbohydrate. They had ice. They had whale blubber.[0:19:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: They still have serum glucose level. And the reason is because you had to. You have to have a serum glucose level in order to power your brain, in order to power your heart. Yes. You you can use ketones.[0:20:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Of course, you can. But, you know, Only if you're in a ketogenic state will you use exclusively ketones, and you also need glucose For structural changes in specific proteins and particularly hormones, so glucose molecules will stud TSH, LH, FSH, different pituitary hormones in order to increase their potency. It's one of the reasons why aging leads to defective hormonogenesis. For instance, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism is the loss of glycosylation On individual, peptide hormones because of, the inability to add glucose, Because those insulin No. No.[0:20:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: Just it's an aging phenomenon.[0:20:58] Andrew Huberman: Okay. We'll come back to this because I think it's really important. Yeah. The idea that ingestion of carbohydrates And the as you called it, the studying of carbohydrate molecules on hormones can augment the function of those hormones. And with aging, that's a less efficient process.[0:21:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: So less efficient process, but it's not because of consumption. It's[0:21:18] Andrew Huberman: Right. People are still I I see the The, plenty of folks who are, 65 and older eating plenty of carbohydrates, you're saying a lot of them Have deficient thyroid, testosterone, estrogen[0:21:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[0:21:32] Andrew Huberman: Prolactin, etcetera because of The way those those carbohydrates are not studying the, the hormones.[0:21:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. So they're all of those are Glycoprotein hormones.[0:21:43] Andrew Huberman: Let's tee that up for later because I think that's an interesting avenue to go down. Okay.[0:21:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: And there's a and there's a disease in children, in in babies called Congenital disorders of glycosylation where you can't put, glucose molecules on Specific proteins, and it causes severe mental retardation, all sorts of metabolic havoc, and a lot of those babies die for that matter. So that's an important thing. Alright. But that's how important glucose is. Fructose, on the other hand, this sweet molecule, the molecule we seek, the reason Why the food industry studs every food in the grocery store, you know, 73% of all items in the American grocery store Have added sugar on purpose for the food industry's purpose is not for yours because fructose is addictive, activates nucleus accumbens the reward center of the brain in the same way that cocaine, heroin, nicotine, alcohol do and drives dopamine receptors down just like nicotine, you know, alcohol, you know, cocaine, heroin do.[0:22:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: That molecule, fructose, is, number 1, completely vestigial to all vertebrate life. There is no biochemical reaction in any vertebrate that requires dietary fructose. That's number 1. Number 2[0:23:09] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Sorry. I'm gonna just add so you're saying that even though we can process fructose,[0:23:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: we have a limited capacity to process it in the same way, we have a limited capacity to metabolize alcohol. Mhmm. Now if you have 1 drink a day, Yeah. You're okay. If you have 2 drinks a day, depends on how big you are.[0:23:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: You know, you and I can probably[0:23:30] Andrew Huberman: I would argue 2 drinks a week is the maximum, but but let's not go there. K. The, But but in terms of you're saying when you say fructose processing of fructose is vestigial, what you're saying is that we don't need to do it. That's right. It's like the appendix.[0:23:44] Andrew Huberman: It's an organ for which it has no function.[0:23:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. And fructose has no function in the human body, Period. You don't need it. You don't need it. You don't need it.[0:23:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: But our diet is replete with it. In fact, our fructose consumption's gone up 25 fold since the beginning of the last century.[0:24:06] Andrew Huberman: I have to ask this now. I love fruit. I eat Mhmm. Berries galore. Yeah.[0:24:11] Andrew Huberman: Especially since the price of berry seems to have come down. Mhmm. It used to be that you only get them certain times a year. I'm what you call a drive by Blueberry eater. So I'll just walk past and just take a fistful.[0:24:20] Andrew Huberman: You can't put them in front of me without me eating them. This is even difficult for me when other people I don't know are eating them. So, I eat lots of blueberries. Mhmm. Strawberries, blackberries if they're in season.[0:24:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[0:24:32] Andrew Huberman: I love them.[0:24:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: No problem. Loaded with fructose?[0:24:34] Andrew Huberman: No. Plenty of fiber,[0:24:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: low fructose? Low fructose. And berries berries are the lowest fructose, of[0:24:41] Andrew Huberman: all different fruit about asking me this today. Not a kid. Okay.[0:24:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: And fruit is okay because of the fiber. So the molecule the fructose molecule's the same Whether it's in a berry or in in banana or, for that matter, in Coca Cola, The fructose molecule is the same molecule. The difference is that in the berry, it comes with a whole lot of fiber. In the banana, it comes with a whole lot less fiber. And in the Coca Cola, it doesn't come with any fiber.[0:25:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the fiber is what mitigates the absorption. So when you consume the fructose with fiber, so your blueberries, you're feeding your microbiome. That fructose wasn't for you.[0:25:25] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Such a relief, and, I I must say, recently, I had a whole body MRI as a Okay. Preemptive thing.[0:25:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: So when's that?[0:25:34] Andrew Huberman: It was it was great. I got to watch a Netflix in there, and, I never had a whole body MRI. I learned a few things that were useful to me. K. I've got a clean bill of health, so that's great.[0:25:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Bless you.[0:25:43] Andrew Huberman: One of the pieces of feedback I got is, that my gut was filled with this very high contrast, stop.[0:25:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[0:25:51] Andrew Huberman: And they asked, you know, do you consume a lot of blueberries? And I said, indeed, I do. Why? And they said, because That high contrast of it shows up white on the scan Yeah. Is, high concentrations of magnesium[0:26:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[0:26:05] Andrew Huberman: That we see in people that ingest Large amounts of blueberries, which is pretty rare, and yours are comparable to a bear in blueberry season.[0:26:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Wow.[0:26:15] Andrew Huberman: And, basically, my entire gut was filled with blueberries, I suppose I need to cut back a little bit. But now I know that fruit is okay, especially if the fruit has a lot of fiber. Yep. But fructose itself, especially if it's not partnered with fiber[0:26:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[0:26:28] Andrew Huberman: Is, first of all, not required for survival at all, But you're telling me is, problematic.[0:26:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. And let me tell you why it's problematic. We haven't gotten to that yet. We're just talking about whether it's vestigial versus needed. Now let's talk about what fructose does.[0:26:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Turns out, fructose inhibits 3, count them, 3 separate enzymes necessary for normal mitochondrial function. Now your mitochondria make ATP. Your mitochondria have to work at peak efficiency. That's what metabolic health is. Is mitochondria working at peak efficiency?[0:27:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, there are 3 enzymes that are inhibited by fructose. Number 1, AMP Kinase. Alright. Now AMP Kinase is the fuel gauge on the liver cell. It's the thing that tells the liver to make more mitochondria fresher mitochondria.[0:27:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: Because if your AMP levels are high, that means you've dephosphorylated a bunch of ATPs and you have to regenerate them, so you need some more mitochondria. So it's a Negative feedback pathway. Well, you need that AMP kinase to generate that mitochondrial biogenesis signal, except That fructose a metabolite of fructose called Methylglyoxal, MGO, sits in the active site of the gamma subunit of that AMP Kinase and actually binds to arginines in that active site rendering that enzyme now dead. It's an irreversible inhibition because of the covalent bonding of that methylglyoxal, that aldehyde to the arginine, And now that enzyme is dead.[0:28:11] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So it basically acts like a key that doesn't turn the lock, but prevents the the key that you want in that lock from entering the the lock.[0:28:20] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's like it's like gluing a lock shut.[0:28:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Got it. Alright. So that's one of the enzymes.[0:28:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's 1. Okay. Second one, ACAD L, Acetyl CoA dehydrogenase long chain. So this is necessary to cleave 2 carbon fragments off fatty acids to prepare them for, metabolism. So inhibits that one.[0:28:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: And then finally, it inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase one. Now CPT one. Now that's the enzyme that regenerates carnitine. Carnitine is the shuttle mechanism by which you get the, fatty acids from the outer mitochondrial membrane through to the inner mitochondrial membrane so that they can be beta oxidized for energy. So if you don't have that c, CPT 1, you're basically carnitine less, and therefore, you can't generate, Beta oxidation.[0:29:14] Andrew Huberman: You said fructose inhibits all 3 of these enzymatic pathways.[0:29:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yep.[0:29:17] Andrew Huberman: As a biologist, I have to ask you, how potently does it inhibit them? I mean, because there's there are Drugs that block receptors, and then there are drugs that block receptors with unbelievable affinity. So, you know, I mean, mechanistically in a dish, meaning in vitro, you can See all sorts of things, but how how significant is this for, like, for obesity, for mitochondrial function in vivo in us?[0:29:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alright. So, you know, The the dose determines the poison. Right? Paracelsus 1537. There are toxins that are Parts per billion and will kill you like sarin, ricin, cyanide.[0:29:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: By the way, cyanide is a good analogy because it's working On mitochondria, it's basically causing mitochondrial to be completely defective. Alright? Then there are, Intermediate toxins like arsenic and carbon tetrachloride, parts per million, and they take a little longer to work. They're not gonna Kill you on the spot.[0:30:18] Andrew Huberman: That's why I can eat an apple seed that has a little bit of arsenic in it, but I'm not gonna die.[0:30:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. And then finally, there and by the way, tobacco smoke goes in there. And then finally, you have, weak toxins. Alright? You know, where it's not 1 exposure that will kill you.[0:30:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's, you know, 10,000 exposures exposures that'll kill you, like alcohol. Poor toxic people. Yeah. Toxic well, sometimes it doesn't take 1.[0:30:43] Andrew Huberman: Couldn't resist. Sorry. Sometimes they don't mildly toxic people.[0:30:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: Anyway, the point is that fructose is in that last category. So it's not what you do One day that kills you. It's what you do every day that kills you. And if you basically eat ultra processed food High in sugar for 10 years in a row, it's gonna show up in terms of your comorbidities. And ultimately, yeah, it will kill you.[0:31:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: And we have the data to show, you know, how many years you will lose. So right now in America, we Pay an 8 year longevity tax. If you look at Japan who, they have a mean age of death of 88. We have a mean age of 80. K?[0:31:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: We're paying an 8 year longevity tax just by living here, And we're talking about the healthy people. Now if you have metabolic syndrome, it's a 15 year longevity tax. And, sorry. If you have obesity, it's a 15 year longevity tax. If you have metabolic syndrome, it's a 20 year longevity tax.[0:31:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: That is primarily, Not completely, but primarily sugar. It's also, you know, omega sixes. It's also trans fats, you know, left over because now they're gone, but, you know, People are still suffering the ravages of the trans fats, you know, from the previous generation.[0:32:07] Andrew Huberman: Are they gone? I mean, I do remember as a kid when we had margarine in our Refrigerator. This is actually a big debate in my home. Yep. 1 parent, I won't identify which, was pro margarine.[0:32:18] Andrew Huberman: The other was pro butter, anti margarine. Right. The marriage did last, but there were other reasons.[0:32:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's probably why. Yeah. I went butter. Butter butter is fine. In fact, time declared, you know, front cover butters back.[0:32:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: You know? Margarine was the bad guy without question, and we know now, but, you know, back when we thought it was a calorie was a calorie, we thought, oh, margarine. You know? It's the same, you know, 9 calories per gram, and we said it lowers your triglycerides. Bad idea.[0:32:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: It was because what it did was it lined your liver because you couldn't break that trans double bond. And, you know, so they're they're now gone from our, food supply. They're illegal. They're illegal. They're banned, but You can make trans fats in your own kitchen by taking olive oil and heating it to beyond the smoking point.[0:33:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: So They're not completely gone. They're just gone from ultra processed food. So now sugar is the big problem because of these 3 enzymes that you are inhibiting. Point is we were we started this with a calorie is a calorie. Well, if you are inhibiting mitochondrial function, then a calorie is not a calorie, is it?[0:33:36] Andrew Huberman: You're reducing the, intensity of the furnace.[0:33:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Exactly. So this whole calories a calorie just makes no sense, And it hasn't worked at any level, and there is no study that actually shows that cutting calories makes a difference. And I can show you, You know, voluminous data that shows that virtually every weight loss study that caused that led to, you know, caloric restriction Basically didn't work, not for any length of time.[0:34:05] Andrew Huberman: Just to round out our earlier discussion because I find it fascinating, and I know other people will as well. Talked about that 160 calories. That's actually a 130 at the business end of things. Yep. Of almonds.[0:34:16] Andrew Huberman: We talked about the porterhouse steak with butter And the 25% reduction in what's actually, quote, unquote, eaten. And I'll get back to this because this quote, unquote Issue. I think the problem is there's a there's a lack of useful language to dissociate this stuff. Yeah. You know, even just calling fat fat, people think it meat it's gonna make Gain body fat.[0:34:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: Totally.[0:34:38] Andrew Huberman: If we call the adipose tissue and lipids, we would have avoided this confusion. So I I don't wanna get there just yet, but I I wanna make sure with[0:34:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: the The food industry does this on purpose. You know? Oh, absolutely. So they tell you a sugar is a sugar, which is not true. They tell you a calorie is a calorie, which is not true, and they tell you a fat is a fat, which is not true.[0:34:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: K? This is very So when you're talking about sugar, are you talking about dietary sugar or are you talking about blood sugar? Because blood sugar is blood glucose.[0:35:08] Andrew Huberman: Right. Or cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol or circulating cholesterol or,[0:35:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: you know Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. So we we've done this, You know, to ourselves, but the food industry has really promulgated it because we farmed out nutrition Policy and information to the food industry. So they actually use this for their purposes.[0:35:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's one of the problems in this field.[0:35:33] Andrew Huberman: As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course, our physical health, but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning, our memory, our ability to learn new things, and to focus. We know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality, unprocessed, or minimally processed sources, as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically all the cellular functions in our body, including the gut microbiome. Now I, like most everybody, try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods. Ideally, mostly from minimally processed or nonprocessed foods. However, one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and probiotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.[0:36:20] Andrew Huberman: That's why way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG one. And so I'm delighted that AG one is sponsoring the Huberman Lab Podcast. The reason I started taking AG one and the reason I still drink AG one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, And fiber to ensure optimal mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to try AG one, you can go to drinkagone.com/huberman to claim a special offer.[0:36:54] Andrew Huberman: They're giving away 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two. Again, that's drink a g one.com/huberman to Claim that special offer. For the 3rd category of macronutrients, carbohydrates, you differentiated, glucose and fructose. Mhmm. If I ingest, let's say, a half a bagel, since we were talking about New York, Your city of origin, they have great bagels on the West Coast.[0:37:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[0:37:22] Andrew Huberman: I know. Yeah. It's it's it's pretty pitiful. Same with the pizza dough. It's like they claim it's the the The water, what whatever it is, it's different back there, and it's better.[0:37:30] Andrew Huberman: Indeed. Half a bagel, let's say, 250 calories, mostly carbohydrate.[0:37:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[0:37:38] Andrew Huberman: This is an an unlined no cream cheese, no schmear as they call back there. No no cream cheese, no butter, none of that thing. Just half of the table. 250 calories. So that's what I ate.[0:37:47] Andrew Huberman: You're saying that a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten. How much of that carbohydrate given that it's probably most let's assume it's mostly glucose. Let's do it this way.[0:37:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. It is it's polymerized glucose.[0:37:56] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Polymerized glucose. How much of that is actually utilized or burned versus, you know, the the original 250.[0:38:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: So if you look at what happens to energy in the body, 65% of that which is ingested goes to resting energy expenditure just to power the body. 10% goes to the thermic effect of food, and then 25% goes to activity. That's the breakdown of where the, energy goes.[0:38:28] Andrew Huberman: And that's calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrate.[0:38:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. From everything together. And, you know, glucose is a perfectly good example of how that works. The point is though that when you ingest glucose, You're getting a big glucose excursion in your bloodstream, so you're getting a big glucose spike. And that glucose spike has to come down.[0:38:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, what makes it come down? The hormone insulin. Insulin is the bad guy in this story. The Higher your glucose goes, the more your pancreas will release insulin in order to bring that glucose down. Well, turns out that glucose rise was not benign.[0:39:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: That glucose rise led to endothelial dysfunction. Transient, but nonetheless, endothelial dysfunction. Could[0:39:14] Andrew Huberman: you just, remind people what endothelial cells are?[0:39:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: Inside of your arteries. K. And it will change blood pressure. We've got plenty of data to demonstrate how it changes blood pressure, and over time, That will cause coronary artery disease. That will cause kidney disease, etcetera, but it's the insulin response that is really the bad Now people think insulin is good because it lowers blood glucose.[0:39:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: After all, diabetics take insulin, you know, to lower their blood glucose. Okay. Let's take a diabetic, a patient with diabetes. Blood sugar's 300. That's bad.[0:39:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: We give him a shot of insulin in the arm. Blood sugar goes down to 100. Blood sugar went from 300 to 100.[0:40:00] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Where did[0:40:01] Dr. Robert Lustig: the 200 points of blood glucose go?[0:40:08] Andrew Huberman: I'm assuming that the insulin Sequestered it to where? I'm assuming to[0:40:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: the liver. To the fat. Interesting. For storage. That's insulin's job.[0:40:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Insulin takes whatever you're not burning and puts it into fat for storage. Insulin is not the diabetes hormone. Insulin is the energy storage Hormone.[0:40:27] Andrew Huberman: How quickly does it do that? Because quick. Because if I'm, you know, having a a very busy day[0:40:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[0:40:33] Andrew Huberman: Or the diabetic person is having a very busy day and they're moving around a lot Mhmm. Then you got insulin bound glucose in the bloodstream, for how long[0:40:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Insulin doesn't bind glucose. Insulin binds to its receptor[0:40:46] Andrew Huberman: Sure. Sorry. Sorry.[0:40:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Allows for glucose transfer[0:40:48] Andrew Huberman: to work. So so but for some period of time while that person is active, There's an opportunity to utilize that glucose.[0:40:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: Oh, yeah.[0:40:55] Andrew Huberman: Right? Yeah. But so how quickly is insulin managing that glucose? We know that the spike comes down quickly, But the glucose is not available for energy utilization after what it's or it's or it's sequestered to the the adipose, to the fat tissue, within An hour?[0:41:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: Is that about So about 90 minutes. Yeah. But Okay. I mean, if you if you're if you're active, if you eat, you know, a muffin And you're active. K.[0:41:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Your muscles are going to take up that glucose irrespective of insulin. In fact, muscles are insulin independent. They have glucose transporters, but they are insulin independent because if they weren't, then every patient in diabetic ketoacidosis would be paralyzed. K. So glucose will end up in muscles irrespective of energy status and, insulin status.[0:41:48] Andrew Huberman: And in muscles, it's used as immediate fuel and glycogen?[0:41:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: Both. Okay. Mediate fuel and glycogen storage Okay. In the muscle. Absolutely.[0:41:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alright. Now if you're active, then you will clear glucose into muscle. Therefore, your blood glucose won't rise as much because it went into muscle, and therefore, your pancreas will put out less insulin because it doesn't have to clear as much from the bloodstream. And that's okay. That's good.[0:42:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right? But let's say you didn't exercise. So you've got a big glucose excursion. Now you have a big insulin response. And that insulin is going to take the excess that's in your blood.[0:42:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: It has to clear it, and it will go to fat for storage. That insulin rise turns out to be particularly egregious in terms of metabolic disease, and I can prove it. There is a mouse, My favorite mouse. I love this mouse. This mouse turns medicine on its head and teaches every doctor why they have to go back to medical And learn it right.[0:42:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: This mouse is called the poderko mouse, p o d I r k o. Is it discovered by poderko? No. No. It's, discovered in Ron Kahn's lab.[0:43:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: It was manufactured in Ron Kahn's lab. So this is a tissue specific insulin receptor knockout mouse. Okay. I r k o.[0:43:10] Andrew Huberman: Insulin the insulin receptor in the specific kidney. In the kidney.[0:43:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: Interesting. Derkop, Glomerular podocyte insulin receptor knockout caps.[0:43:20] Andrew Huberman: We haven't talked too much about transgenic models and knock ins and knockout. So, just In 10 seconds or less, basically, these are mice that are genetically engineered to lack the receptor for Insulin specifically in the Glomerulopoetocyte, the kidney. In the in the kidney. And everywhere else in this mouse, insulin does its thing normally.[0:43:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. Great. So these animals are euglycemic, normal blood glucose levels. These animals are normally glucose tolerant. They, you know, Go up.[0:43:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: They go down just like every other mouse. These mice are not fat. These mice are not thin. These mice are mice, except they have the worst diabetic nephropathy on the planet.[0:44:08] Andrew Huberman: So their oh, their kidney is degenerative.[0:44:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: Their kidneys degenerate to nothing. Yikes. Now they have normal blood glucose levels. They have normal glucose tolerance. They have normal insulin tolerance whole body, but Their kidneys are dying.[0:44:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: How come? Can't be the glucose. It's the insulin because insulin's the bad guy. Insulin's actually making the kidney disease. And so these animals that are insulin resistant, They have diabetic nephropathy without diabetes.[0:44:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the insulin is having a negative Clearly negative effect on the kidneys without binding to the receptor. Exactly.[0:44:54] Andrew Huberman: So circulating insulin can do stuff without binding to its receptor.[0:44:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, it's no. It binds to its receptor in different parts of the body.[0:45:02] Andrew Huberman: Other parts of the body.[0:45:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: Oh, the parts[0:45:03] Andrew Huberman: of the body. Kidney, it can't because[0:45:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: it's a knockout. Because it's knockout. Right. The point is insulin does stuff by itself, and it turns out insulin drives growth. Now Every cell in your body wants to burn at one time in its life and wants to grow at another time in its life.[0:45:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: Every cell has those 2 pathways, burning, growth, burning, growth. What determines whether a cell should be burning or whether a cell should be growing?[0:45:40] Andrew Huberman: I don't know what makes it, burning, but presumably, it's in the has something to do with mitochondria.[0:45:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: It has everything to do with mitochondria. Alright. So Every cell needs to burn and needs to grow at a different time in its life. Here's a way to think about it. We all start out as a zygote, a single cell.[0:46:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: We end up an adult. Now that single cell had to become 2 cells. Those 2 cells had to become 4 cells. Those 4 cells had to become 8 cells and on and on and on and on. So every cycle, there's a doubling.[0:46:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: How many doublings To get from a zygote to an adult.[0:46:24] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's an exponential growth. So Yeah. I don't I don't know it off the top of my head.[0:46:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: 41. 41. 41. 2 to the 41 doublings Gives you an organism. 10 trillion cells.[0:46:37] Andrew Huberman: We're 10 trillion cells?[0:46:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: We're 10 trillion cells. Do we[0:46:39] Andrew Huberman: know that?[0:46:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Okay. 2 to the 41. Okay? Okay.[0:46:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now of those 41 doublings, some of them had to occur in utero. Some of them had to occur postnatally. So I need two numbers that add up to 41. How many in utero? How many postnatally?[0:47:02] Andrew Huberman: Well, way more you start off with a lot more than you end up with, but then you have cells that turn over throughout the lifespan. So this is a tough one.[0:47:10] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay.[0:47:11] Andrew Huberman: Because skin cells turn over Sure. I I'm with neurons, it's it's pretty straightforward because you're gonna somewhere between 3 and 10. Right. Well, you're and you're born with somewhere between 3 and 10 x of what you end up with depending on the brain structure. Yeah.[0:47:24] Andrew Huberman: So but for whole body wide, I don't know how you'd come up with that number.[0:47:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: 36 and 5. Okay. 36 doublings prenatally, 5 doublings postnatally. I can prove that to you too. Typical baby weighs 7 pounds.[0:47:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: 1st doubling, 14 pounds. 2nd doubling, 20, 8 pounds. Sex doubling, 56 pounds. Next doubling, £112. Next doubling, £224.[0:47:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: Hopefully,[0:47:49] Andrew Huberman: it stops there.[0:47:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: Obesity division.[0:47:50] Andrew Huberman: Hopefully, it stops there. Not not all people, £212 are obese. But some people who are of certain heights or below are Yeah. 212 are obese.[0:47:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay. Point is the cell has to know when To grow and when to burn. It turns out that the signal for that is oxygen Because oxygen's necessary for mitochondria to be able to burn. In the absence of oxygen, the cell only knows how to grow. This is actually why Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize in 1931 for the Warburg effect.[0:48:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: He asked the question, how come cancer cells Don't need oxygen to grow. And the answer is because no cell needs oxygen to grow. In fact, oxygen is the thing that prevents growth. Famous article from the New England Journal of Medicine, 1951, Mount Everest in utero, because every fetus Is oxygen deprived? So normal partial pressure of oxygen, 100 Millimeters of mercury out here.[0:48:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right? You if you if I checked your blood, it'd be about a100. Right?[0:49:03] Andrew Huberman: I hope[0:49:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: so. How about a tumor cell?[0:49:06] Andrew Huberman: Guessing tumor cells probably is it double? About 44.[0:49:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Wait. Just told Partial pressure of of, oxygen in a tumor cell is about 44.[0:49:17] Andrew Huberman: But you just told[0:49:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: me that tumor cells which grow like wild. Right. They grow like wild because they don't have oxygen.[0:49:27] Andrew Huberman: But they but there's some of the so here's what's peculiar about it. Tumor cells are some of the most vascularized cells or tumors are are[0:49:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: heavily vascular.[0:49:37] Andrew Huberman: I mean I mean, one way to one way to try and kill one to to devascularize the tumor itself.[0:49:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yes. And and, you know, angiogenesis inhibition, etcetera, as soon as a big deal, you know, due to Folkman and all Mhmm. That from Harvard. You know?[0:49:50] Andrew Huberman: So the excess blood to a tumor is the attempt to bring in oxygen that it's not getting[0:49:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right.[0:49:54] Andrew Huberman: As opposed to delivering lots of oxygen, and that's why it's growing.[0:49:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right. Okay. But a fetus, what's the partial pressure in the placenta? I don't know. 6 to 31.[0:50:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: So it's actually like a mile above Mount Everest. That's how much oxygen the fetus gets, and it's the for that reason That you've got 36 doublings. And then as soon as you're out, you know, and you cut the cord and you start breathing and now your Partial pressures at a100, that's when growth slows down.[0:50:26] Andrew Huberman: Has there been any effort to treat tumors by oxygenating tumors? Yes. What does that look like?[0:50:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It's a thing.[0:50:33] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We we'll probably do an episode on hyperbaric chambers. It's the The the reason we haven't yet is it's pretty niche into it, but there are people who own these things, who sit in these things.[0:50:46] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So we got here by way of by way of car by the bagel. Right. So I just wanna orient us that You just got 250 calories of the the bagel. We talked about glucose excursion[0:51:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: But it's that insulin rise that's driving The adiposity is also driving the growth, okay, in the absence of oxygen. Because if you have oxygen, then you don't need that much insulin. Okay. So Because you're gonna burn instead of store. Got it.[0:51:21] Andrew Huberman: In terms of the the, the raw metabolism of carbohydrate, though, that glucose[0:51:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm. If[0:51:29] Andrew Huberman: I eat 250 calories of glucose, how much of that did I, quote, unquote, actually eat? How much is is used?[0:51:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: How much is used?[0:51:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Let's assume that I'm I'm at my desk working or I'm walking around a little bit. I'm not I'm not exercising hard in the in the subsequent hour.[0:51:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: So used for what is the question?[0:51:46] Andrew Huberman: Used for the calories is the calorie a calorie? Clearly, the answer is no. Be based on the processing of different types of calories, we established it for fat. The almonds, we established it for protein. Right.[0:51:55] Andrew Huberman: The porterhouse with butter. And now we're we're trying to establish that for the 250 calories of a bagel, which is glucose.[0:52:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. So the glucose has to be phosphorylated, so you're gonna lose, an an ATP in the process. So you're gonna go ATP goes to ADP, and then that ADP will go to AMP, adenosine monophosphate, which will then go to IMP, inositol monophosphate, which will then go to uric acid. K? And that uric acid will be then Released from the cell, circulate in the bloodstream, and hopefully go out in the kidney.[0:52:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: In the process, that uric acid can inhibit mitochondrial function, And it can also inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which is the enzyme in your vasculature That is your endogenous blood pressure lower,[0:52:44] Andrew Huberman: right, by expanding blood vessels and capillaries.[0:52:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[0:52:47] Andrew Huberman: Right. This is the mechanistic's, foundation of The drugs that were originally used for, improving prostate function but are used to treat erectile dysfunction, which are the are they p d p d five inhibitors, which Allow nitric oxide to be, around longer and more of it. Right? People use it for other purposes too. Right.[0:53:06] Andrew Huberman: Now no one will forget if I queue it up that that example[0:53:09] Dr. Robert Lustig: We we, you know, in the neonatal intensive care unit, it closes patent ductus arteriosus, which is a big deal in, in the, neonatal world.[0:53:19] Andrew Huberman: Well, okay. I'll I'll I wanna ask you about that, but but, so I heard 2 things. 1 is that, glucose and the insulin that goes with it increases uric acid.[0:53:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[0:53:29] Andrew Huberman: Uric acid, while it has certain important Functions in health, too much of it, you said, can inhibit nitric oxide?[0:53:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Can inhibit nitric oxide.[0:53:38] Andrew Huberman: Means that the blood vessels and capillaries are gonna stay more constricted, so blood pressure is gonna be Higher than it would be normally. Right. And then uric acid is also inhibiting mitochondrial function.[0:53:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right.[0:53:48] Andrew Huberman: Okay. But eating half a bagel isn't necessarily a terrible thing if it's within your caloric requirements.[0:53:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. And it it all depends on how much, you clear and how high your insulin goes.[0:54:04] Andrew Huberman: Now let's compare that 250 calories of glucose to 250 calories of fructose. Right? Let's let's come up with a food example. 250 calories of fructose would be trivial to, consume in the form of high fructose corn syrup. Right?[0:54:20] Dr. Robert Lustig: So remember that high fructose corn syrup is Half glucose, half fructose. Okay. So let's not use 125, 125.[0:54:25] Andrew Huberman: So let's not use that. Well, so let's assume, so we can talk about a soda For, to get that that, 250 calories easily. Right. Yep. Especially if it's not a can or a European sized bottle or two.[0:54:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: Ounce 8 ounce can of Oh, soda.[0:54:40] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So 8 ounce can of soda, and maybe let's include a food item. Let's talk, like, a store bought packaged cookie. Couple Oreos. 2 Oreos.[0:54:49] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Probably get you to that 250 or maybe 4 Oreos.[0:54:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Maybe 3 Oreos.[0:54:52] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Okay. Oreo lovers everywhere celebrating. 3. 250 calories of fructose.[0:55:00] Andrew Huberman: What's the effect on uric acid? What's the effect on caloric burn? What's the effect on anything for that matter that, we should be aware of?[0:55:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alright. So first of all, the Oreo has plenty of fructose in it, so keep that in mind. Okay. The, if, let's say, you consumed, 250 calories in a bagel because that's pretty much polymerized glucose versus, say, the soda. So the bagel versus the soda.[0:55:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's what[0:55:24] Andrew Huberman: you're Equivalent calories. Right.[0:55:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: Equivalent calories.[0:55:26] Andrew Huberman: Or the the bagel versus, Let's say 2 Oreos and a little bit of, and, yeah, 2[0:55:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Oreos. K. So number 1, there's only half the glucose in the soda because the other half is the fructose. So 125, 125. So your glucose rise won't be as High.[0:55:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: Your glucose excursion will be lower. This is actually one of the reasons why there's this thing called glycemic index. The glycemic index is a canard. It's garbage. It is complete and utter BS.[0:56:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: The glycemic index? Absolute BS. Nothing nothing is more, egregious in terms of, Argument than than than the glycemic index. And this is one of the things dietitians promote and espouse, one of the things that's gotta go. Okay.[0:56:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well This is an idea that must die.[0:56:20] Andrew Huberman: Okay. We'll get back to why the glycemic index has gotta die. But so so the 250 calories and actually, can we can we make these equal just for sake of of simplicity? Can we say 250 calories of glucose from the bagel Versus 250 calories of fructose. How do we get 250 calories of pure fructose?[0:56:40] Andrew Huberman: We don't. You can't. Okay. You gotta bring[0:56:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: the glucose with. Lab lab fructose. You have to make it crystal clear, which[0:56:46] Andrew Huberman: is half glucose, half fructose.[0:56:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right. That I mean, there is no fructose alone in nature.[0:56:50] Andrew Huberman: Even crackers, some of the ones Our salty are also sweet. They have fructose in[0:56:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: them. Yeah. Absolutely. High fructose corn syrup.[0:56:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's why it's impossible to eat just 1. Indeed. And, so What's happening biochemically with as a consequence of the fructose component specifically?[0:57:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the fructose will, first of all, Go into the intestine. The intestine will metabolize some of that fructose through what is known as intestinal de novo lipogenesis. About 10% of that fructose will be turned into fat right in the intestine.[0:57:24] Andrew Huberman: And that's because fructose, it wants to be fat.[0:57:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Fructose wants to be fat. Fructose is the lipogenic substrate.[0:57:31] Andrew Huberman: Here, we're not talking about body fat. We're talking about Fat molecules that can potentially be used as energy.[0:57:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right. Triglyceride molecules. Okay. K. So so 10% of that fructose will Turned into triglyceride right in the intestine and be released into the bloodstream, and it is the reason for a postprandial triglyceride[0:57:49] Andrew Huberman: Postprandial is, and I'm including myself in this group, is nerd speak for after eating lunch. Typically, it's lunch.[0:57:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: So that's actually one of the drivers of cardiovascular pathology, that intestinal de novo lipogenesis, turning That fructose into triglyceride right in the intestine. Now there's a limit to how fast and how much the intestine can do that. The rest of the fructose will be, absorbed into the portal vein, but not before Some of that fructose will make it further down, and it will nitrate tight junction proteins. Okay. Portal vein of the kidney.[0:58:29] Andrew Huberman: So Portal[0:58:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: vein goes to the liver. Portal vein goes from the visceral, from the intestine to the liver.[0:58:35] Andrew Huberman: No kid it doesn't feel kidney.[0:58:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay. No kidney. Intestine to liver.[0:58:40] Andrew Huberman: Okay?[0:58:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: K? But fructose nitrates, tight junction proteins. Now let me explain that to your audience. Your intestine is a sewer. Definition of a sewer, a pipe with shipment.[0:58:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay? That's its sewer. Our intestines are sewers. There's junk in the center, and the job of the intestine is to move the junk Through to the anus, absorbing the good stuff while you can. The intestine is made up of cells, intestinal epithelial cells, that are bound together, and they're bound with proteins that basically form a barrier.[0:59:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Those barriers are called tight junction proteins.[0:59:26] Andrew Huberman: It's like cloudins and things like that.[0:59:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Zonulin is the main one. K. There are others, but zonulin is the one that goes is defective in the celiac disease.[0:59:35] Andrew Huberman: What defines a tight junction? Is it that is, like, completely impermeable or Semi permeable?[0:59:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: Completely impermeable[0:59:41] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[0:59:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Unless its function is inhibited. Turns out if you alter The, phosphorylation status or the nitrate status of that tight junction, it will become transiently permeable. Okay. And so fructose nitrates tight junction proteins causing them to be transiently Permeable, allowing some of the junk in your intestine to get through Into your bloodstream. So this is leaky gut.[1:00:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: This is leaky gut. This is what causes leaky gut. Fructose is a driver of leaky gut.[1:00:19] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[1:00:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: That causes inflammation at the level of the liver, which ultimately leads to systemic inflammation. One of the reasons why High sensitivity CRP, sensitivity CRP is high in patients who eat ultra processed food.[1:00:33] Andrew Huberman: CRP is c reactive protein, which is a marker of a, Essentially, inflammatory immune response.[1:00:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. Yeah.[1:00:39] Andrew Huberman: You don't want it too high.[1:00:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: And 93% of Americans today are inflamed.[1:00:44] Andrew Huberman: Does that mean that 93% of Americans have leaky guts?[1:00:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. It does because that's where it comes from.[1:00:51] Andrew Huberman: So In addition to limiting fructose intake[1:00:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[1:00:57] Andrew Huberman: What are things that Support the tight junctions of of the intestinal pathway.[1:01:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: So there are 3 barriers in your intestine to keep the junk where it belongs in the center so that it can get pooped out the you're behind. Alright? Three separate barriers. 1 is a physical barrier called the mucin layer. So it's a layer of mucus that actually sits on top of the intestinal epithelial cells.[1:01:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now that mucin is a polysaccharide, and the bacteria can use that Mucin layer for its own purposes. It will eat your mucin layer if you don't feed your bacteria. You must feed your bacteria or back your bacteria will feed on you. Mhmm. K.[1:01:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: So you are in concert with your microbiome. If you deprive your microbiome of the food that it needs, it will use you as its food. And that's one of the reasons why fiber is so important.[1:01:56] Andrew Huberman: So fiber to build up this mucin layer is one way to reinforce the The, the fence that that is the tight junctions, etcetera[1:02:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[1:02:04] Andrew Huberman: Between your intestine and and the bloodstream. Exactly. This raises an interesting point about fasting. Many people, including myself, do a sort of pseudo intermittent fasting. I eat my 1st meal somewhere between 11 and noon.[1:02:16] Andrew Huberman: I'm not Tricked about this. Mhmm. The 11 versus noon thing and probably eat my last bite of food somewhere around 8 PM, and occasionally, it's outside that window. I've I've done this for a long time. It just feels best to me.[1:02:25] Andrew Huberman: Right? But other people use a shorter eating window. One thing that I learned from a colleague at Yale who studies the gut microbiome that was surprising to me is that When you do when you eat in that way, there's a long stretch of time, sometimes longer for people that have a shorter eating window. Mhmm. Longer fasting window, that is Yeah.[1:02:44] Andrew Huberman: Where you're actually eating up your own intestinal lining. The so this idea that fasting is so great for us, on the one hand, Might be true. On the other hand, you're you're actually consuming components of your you're not feeding your gut microbiome and you deplete it, but then here's where was positively surprised. When you do eat, provided that you eat enough fiber and, in particular, high quality fermented foods, low sugar fermented Mhmm. It seems that the the lining of the gut and the gut microbiome is replenished to a level that is greater than if had eaten for longer periods of the 24 hour cycle.[1:03:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[1:03:18] Andrew Huberman: Do I have that right?[1:03:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: We do you do have it right, and I don't know why that is true, but it does seem to be the case. And fermented foods bay in part because they've got already short chain fatty acids in them. Is that the preferred[1:03:32] Andrew Huberman: food of the microbiome?[1:03:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, it's what the microbiome actually turns fiber into. So it's probably helping Your intestinal epithelial cells in the same way what the microbiome turning fiber into short chain fatty acids helps. So it's what we call a postbiotic. So you have prebiotic, which is the food for the bacteria. You have the probiotic, which is the bacteria itself, and then you have the postbiotic, which is what the bacteria make in order to heal you.[1:04:01] Dr. Robert Lustig: God. Okay? And so short chain fatty acids are postbiotics. And there are a lot of people selling short chain fatty acids, you know, Drinks and supplements and what have you. Whether they work or not is another story.[1:04:13] Andrew Huberman: If I consume fructose in the, form of, let's say, highly processed food, has minimal antioxidants, but[1:04:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: it's got[1:04:22] Andrew Huberman: plenty of calories typically. Yep. And it's Disrupting the tight junctions, making my gut leaky. Right. But I'm also eating fiber.[1:04:30] Andrew Huberman: Yep. You know, I'm having a, you know, a meal that includes a salad. I'm having having some probiotics. Right. And then I want a like, a couple Reese's peanut butter cups, like, and the dark chocolate ones in particular.[1:04:40] Andrew Huberman: I don't do this anymore, but I used to eat like that more often. As as time has gone on, I've it becomes, I don't like to call it stricter, but more I I tend to like healthier foods over time, and I think you can get away with different things Different stages of life. Although you work with young people, so we'll, we'll get to very young people, so we'll get to this. But how How much damage am I doing by ingesting any fructose in the form of a highly processed food?[1:05:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: So I'll make it very simple, Andrew. I am for dessert for dessert. I am not for dessert for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. K. So if you wanna have a couple of Reese's peanut butter cups as your dessert In the same way as you might have a cognac for dessert, that's fine.[1:05:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: I have no problem with that. The question is, are you gonna eat Reese's peanut butter cups for breakfast?[1:05:37] Andrew Huberman: No. I don't eat breakfast. Well No. By gosh. But I do see your point.[1:05:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: The National School Breakfast Program, which 29% of schoolchildren today consume, is a bowl of Froot Loops and a glass of orange juice. That is 41 grams of sugar. American Heart Association says that the upper limit for children should be 12 grams of added sugar per day. That's 41 grams of added sugar, and it's just breakfast.[1:06:08] Andrew Huberman: And that's fructose rich.[1:06:10] Dr. Robert Lustig: Totally. Right. Completely. So the question is, which dessert are we talking about?[1:06:15] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And right. And can we Can we adjust that morning meal, to a different reality? Because I agree that there are plenty of kids eating that or a muffin that might be the equivalent. Indeed.[1:06:27] Andrew Huberman: But what about the parent who's as okay. Let's come up with a healthier option that the kid still likes, like, I'm thinking back to my childhood, like a Honey Nut Cheerios or something. So not Froot Loops, which is kind of the extreme.[1:06:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: Take a look at the side of the package.[1:06:43] Andrew Huberman: No difference. And now let's say they go with, some, like, waffles that are made. So with a with a premade, mix, Some milk, some butter, you know, so mom or dad is making waffles. Great. It sounds healthier, but then if you do the breakdown or we're still up at very high are we basically eating dessert for breakfast?[1:07:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: Are we eating Eggo waffles or we make making waffles, de novo, you know, from scratch In your own kitchen. Let's say Big difference. K? Because the Eggo waffles, you know, replete With sugar on purpose because the food industry knows when they add it, you buy more because it's addictive. K?[1:07:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: And we actually have the, Demographic, the mechanistic, the imaging, and also the economic data to demonstrate That sugar's addictive and the food industry knows it. So have you ever heard of a phenomenon called price elasticity? K. Price elasticity is an economic term that is used to ask the question, If the price of a given good goes up by 1%, that should result in reduction in Purchase or consumption because price influences consumption. How much does it influence it?[1:08:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: So If it's if something's price elastic, when the price goes up, consumption goes down equivalently. A food that is price elastic, the most price elastic food is eggs. So when the price of eggs goes up 1%, Consumption of eggs goes down 0.68%, meaning that eggs have a price elasticity of point 32. Got it? Got it.[1:08:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now what's the most priced inelastic food? The top 3 most priced inelastic foods are fast food,[1:08:47] Andrew Huberman: cereal,[1:08:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: 0.81[1:08:49] Andrew Huberman: I like a good quiz.[1:08:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's with 0.81, soft drinks at 0.79 and juice at 0.77. Meaning people will pay not whatever, but they'll they're willing to pay more, more more readily willing to pay more. Because of the sugar, because it's addictive, because it's hedonic. So many, many years ago, Andrew, you probably remember something called Keynesian economics. Mhmm.[1:09:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: And Keynesian economics was based on this concept of the rational actor, And the rational act can determine value, which is utility over cost. And if you're a rational actor, you should be able to say, yeah. I'll buy that, but I won't buy that. Right? Okay.[1:09:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Nobel Prize winner, Daniel Kahneman, Describe the irrational actor. Now the irrational actor cannot determine value, and the reason is because he is risk averse. So the cost is always too great. So the utility may be the same, but the cost goes up because that's why they have, you know, Aversive tendencies, the irrational actor. Jeffrey Sachs has described the hedonic actor who also cannot determine value because it doesn't matter what it costs.[1:10:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: They need their fix. And this is what's going on, and the food industry knows it. And that's why every food in the store has been spiked.[1:10:28] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor, LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you that means 0 sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium. And that correct ratio of electrolytes is Function properly. So when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system, your mental functioning and your physical Functioning is improved. I drink 1 packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning, As well as while I exercise, and if I sweat a lot during that exercise, I often will drink a third LMNT packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.[1:11:14] Andrew Huberman: Element comes in a variety of different flavors, all of which I find really tasty. I like the citrus. I like the watermelon. I like the raspberry. Frankly, I can't pick just 1.[1:11:23] Andrew Huberman: It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint, which I find tastes best if they are put into water, dissolved, and then Heated up. I tend to do that in the winter months because, of course, you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months, but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element spelled l menti.com/huberman to try a free sample pack. Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman. We talked about dessert for breakfast in the form of cereals.[1:11:54] Andrew Huberman: Yep. Some of which are disguised or couched as healthier. You know? I think of, like, Honey Nut Cheerios. It seems healthier than Froot Loops.[1:12:03] Andrew Huberman: It looks healthier like the just by way of color, it looks kinda weedy, you know, color. So but let and in terms of lunch, I mean, one of the things that I love about Europe is that the breads are amazing.[1:12:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. The breads are terrific. And I like[1:12:16] Andrew Huberman: and I like them because they're not as Sweet. Exactly. And so a sandwich from not every deli, but from a typical sandwich shopper that one makes with store bought bread, sliced bread in the US Has a lot of fructose. I looked at I looked this up prior to to the discussion today. So in some ways, dessert is being woven into foods that are That parents and or kids, everyone, thinks are savory are we're actually eating sweets.[1:12:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly right.[1:12:43] Andrew Huberman: But we can't but we don't taste them as sweet at a conscious level necessarily.[1:12:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right? But our but our taste buds do. Right. That's exactly right. So the question is why do they do that?[1:12:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: So question for your audience. You buy a loaf of bread at the local bakery. How soon before it snails?[1:13:02] Andrew Huberman: 2 days at best. Yeah. If it's really great bread.[1:13:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right. The the better the bread, the quicker it stalls. You buy a loaf of bread at the, neighborhood grocery store. How soon before it snails?[1:13:16] Andrew Huberman: You've got probably a week, and then there's the moldy pieces at the end that you you know, if you're in college and you were me, try and scrape that off.[1:13:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: That can last up to 3 weeks depending.[1:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Right. You could throw it in the freezer. Yeah. You probably do that with the bakery bread, but it's never the Never the same. Never the same.[1:13:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the question is why is that? And the answer is sugar. The answer is sugar. So the Grocery store bread had sugar added to it on purpose because when you bake it, The sugar does not evaporate. It stays in the bread, and the sugar is hygroscopic, meaning it holds on to water.[1:13:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: This is a phenomenon that the food industry uses called water activity. K? And so it will hold on to water, and so it will stay spongy and will not stale as quickly as the bakery store bread, which did not have that sugar added to it. So even something as benign as bread has been turned into something that ultimately leads to chronic metabolic disease.[1:14:19] Andrew Huberman: We've pivoted somewhat from Carbohydrate divided into gluk glucose and fructose to a discussion of sugar. Could you tell us the link between sugar and fructose? So table sugar, what percentage of table sugar is fructose? What percentage of brown sugar is fructose? What percentage of the sugar that's added to food is High fructose corn syrup on average.[1:14:40] Andrew Huberman: You know, just because here what we're talking about is, what you're describing as an intentional lacing of Food Indeed. Was something that's addictive, but that's also processed very differently at the level of the kidney, at the level of the liver.[1:14:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[1:14:54] Andrew Huberman: And It's bad. It's a bad it's a bad situation. Absolutely. So when we talk about sugar, I think we need to be as careful in describing what we really mean as when we talk about a calorie.[1:15:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: I completely agree. So let for your audience, Let's be very, very clear on definitions. K. Let's not use the word sugar because it has Multiple definitions. Let's use sucrose.[1:15:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: Sucrose is what You put in your coffee. It's the crystals. Alright? It's cane sugar, beet sugar, you know, The, you know, the stuff that teaspoons of. Right?[1:15:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: This was all that was available for many, many years. That is 1 molecule of glucose, 1 molecule of fructose bound together, for the chemists out there, an O glycosidic linkage. K. The enzyme in your intestine called sucrase cleaves this O glycosidic linkage in about a nanosecond. You absorb the 2 molecules separately.[1:16:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: The glucose goes to the entire body, generates an insulin response. The fructose goes straight to your liver, generates fat. That's sucrose. High fructose corn syrup is essentially 1 molecule of glucose, One molecule of fructose not bound together. No o glycosidic linkage.[1:16:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: So they're free. The enzyme, sucrase, doesn't care because the blonde's already broken. Ultimately, they do the same thing, And that's why high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are indistinguishable metabolically. What they are is they're very different economically. And the reason is because high fructose corn syrup's half the price of sucrose.[1:16:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Because sucrose, we get from importing, And high fructose corn syrup, we make at home. Sucrose is in bags. High fructose corn syrup is in barrels. Sucrose, you can sell at the store. High fructose corn syrup, you sell to the, you know, ultra processed food manufacturer.[1:17:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: You can't buy high fructose corn syrup at the, you know, at the grocery store. So they're very different in terms of what they're used for. High fructose corn syrup is particularly egregious because it's so miscible, because it's already a liquid. So You probably remember Chips Ahoy cookies in the old days. K.[1:17:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: They would often would seem like the Sugar in the, cookie had crystallized because the sugar content was so high.[1:17:43] Andrew Huberman: It's been a while since I've had one that they weren't particularly good.[1:17:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[1:17:47] Andrew Huberman: Like now But you eat 2 of them, and then you think they're good, and then you wanna eat 4. Yeah. That's what's so odd. The first bite is kinda like the and then It's bombs away.[1:17:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: There you go. Well, now it's with Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies. Oh, I remember the reason. Chips are always Remember Chewy Chips? Well, that, That's high fructose corn syrup because because the 2 molecules are free, they don't crystallize.[1:18:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: So you can actually up the dose. Several[1:18:17] Andrew Huberman: times throughout today's discussion, you've been talking about the quote, unquote food industry. Mhmm. K. So I'm not a conspiracy theorist.[1:18:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: I am.[1:18:24] Andrew Huberman: But I Now. But I understand, you know, that Most businesses exist to make money.[1:18:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[1:18:33] Andrew Huberman: Many businesses start off with good intentions and drift in order to stay, to stay competitive, and many, many businesses as we know, not all of which are entirely bad, such as the pharmaceutical industry. Right? You they're bad. They're instances of, like, the opioid crisis, but then there are drugs the pharmaceutical industry that help save lives. I mean, that's my my stance.[1:19:00] Andrew Huberman: The food industry, I think there are good actors and there are bad actors, but we're talking about Food industry. Okay. Well, we can talk about the exercise industry. We talk about the podcast industry. I mean, you got good actors and bad actors.[1:19:11] Andrew Huberman: Indeed. But what you've alluded to several times here, and you're more To lace food with a form of sugar that makes people crave more of that food and that is causing metabolic illness, disrupting mitochondria, and on and on.[1:19:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[1:19:32] Andrew Huberman: And you're the physician, not me. You've worked with patients who struggle with obesity and for various reasons, not me. And, so we could probably spend hours, if not days, talking about all the terrible things that the, quote, unquote, food industry has done, but What do you think is the the pure motivation? Right? I don't think that they want people to be sick, but they wanna sell product and this sells more product.[1:20:00] Andrew Huberman: So then it raises 2 questions. If why is it that more people don't know about know this information? Although many more will know after today's conversation, but and certainly in government, it's a it's a mix regardless of what side of the aisle you're on or if you're right in between. They're they're clearly people that care about the health of themselves and others. So I can understand how things might have gotten to this point, But what do you think are the barriers to getting people to appreciate just what a problem this is and and getting people to change their choices in terms of what the they're eating.[1:20:36] Andrew Huberman: Are they truly addicted to the point where they are sick? They can't make good decisions like a Like, a drug addict who's highly addicted to heroin is a sick person. They have an illness, and they need treatment. But until they get that treatment, they can't make good decisions. Let's take an analogy.[1:20:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alcohol. 40% of Americans or teetotalers Never touch a stuff.[1:20:58] Andrew Huberman: 40% don't drink.[1:20:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: 40% don't drink.[1:21:00] Andrew Huberman: Great. I'm not a big fan of alcohol. I've never seen it make anyone better at anything that really mattered. No. Because drinking.[1:21:06] Andrew Huberman: It's also[1:21:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: completely vestigial. There's no, biochemical reaction in the body that requires alcohol. K? For the same reason, by the way, fructose. 40% are social drinkers.[1:21:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. You can pick up a beer, put it down. I'm in that category. 10% are binge drinkers and 10% are chronic alcoholics. K?[1:21:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now Do you deprive the 40% of social drinkers because of the 20% of binge drinkers and chronic alcoholics.[1:21:40] Andrew Huberman: No. I believe people should be in choice, but I believe people should know what they are doing so that they can be in choice.[1:21:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well[1:21:47] Andrew Huberman: Right? Like, do as you I always say, and I said this about the alcohol episode, which turned out to be one of our most prolific episodes Where I said that, you know, more than 2 drinks, 0 is better than any and more than 2 drinks per week, you you need to do other things to offset that, and it's problematic. That's what those are what the data say, but I but I would say do as you want, but know what you're doing.[1:22:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, so I would say that that's exactly what The food industry wants you to think. That's it. That is the food industry's mantra is you have your own choice, Personal responsibility. So the question is does personal responsibility work? And the answer is no.[1:22:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: It doesn't. Every, public health debacle in the history of mankind Started out as a personal health issue be before it became a public health crisis. And you can pick your, you know, personal responsibility issue, Whether it be exposures, whether it be addictions, whether it be infections, bottom line is, ultimately, it required a societal response. K. We can talk about syphilis.[1:22:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: We can talk about tuberculosis. Ultimately needed a public health response. We can talk about, teen pregnancy, we can talk about Tobacco. Tobacco ultimately needs a public health response because the sheer enormity of it And the, the egregiousness of it requires that public health response. Well, turns out this is no different.[1:23:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: In order exercise personal responsibility, 4 criteria have to be met. Those 4 criteria are the following. Number 1, knowledge. You have to have the knowledge because if you don't have the knowledge, then how can you exercise personal responsibility? Well, in fact, The public's being kept from the knowledge.[1:23:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: We're doing this now in part to in you know, to entrain that knowledge, to to get people to understand What the problem is.[1:23:48] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, I consider myself pretty informed about nutrition and health, but already today, I've learned Two dozen facts about processing of fructose and calories generally that I had no knowledge of prior.[1:24:01] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, that's good. Okay? Because it's not about the math. It's about the science. K?[1:24:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: They want it to be about calories. So we have this thing called food science. We have this thing called nutrition and we have this thing called metabolic health. They are not the same. Food science is what happens to food between the ground and the mouth.[1:24:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: Nutrition is what happens to food between the mouth and the cell. Metabolic health is what happens to food inside the cell. But all of the chronic diseases that we are suffering from, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, cancer dementia, Fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian disease, those 8 diseases which make up 75% of health care expenditures in this country today are all inside the cell because they are all mitochondrial dysfunction, And there is no medicine that gets to the mitochondria.[1:24:56] Andrew Huberman: Although you and others at Stanford, Harvard, etcetera, Are starting this with the metabolic psychiatry being one instance. Right? Indeed. And UCSF as well. Forgive me.[1:25:06] Andrew Huberman: I should mention UCSF upfront. Your your wonderful institution right up the road from Stanford. So, you know, things are changing. People are starting to think about mitochondrial health.[1:25:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: They are.[1:25:15] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So you you list off the first the first thing. You said there are things that stand as bare[1:25:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: first 1 was knowledge. Okay. Second, access. Because if you don't have access, then how can you exercise personal responsibility?[1:25:27] Andrew Huberman: Access to healthier alternatives[1:25:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[1:25:30] Andrew Huberman: Which means cost effective. I mean, I love Berries from the farmers market more than I love berries from the store. I love the farmers markets generally, but it takes time, energy to go there, and The cost is actually lower at the level of what you hand the vendor, typically.[1:25:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[1:25:47] Andrew Huberman: But, volume is tough to achieve.[1:25:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[1:25:50] Andrew Huberman: They actually have me at a at a quota. I'm not allowed to buy as many berries as I want because, obviously, there are other people who want berries. Yep. So there's that. Right?[1:25:57] Andrew Huberman: People have to feed their family that, You know? And Well we're used to eating a lot of volume,[1:26:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: but you're able to at least go there sometimes. K. Yeah. We're talking about people who live in, quote, Food deserts. We're also talking about people who live in food swamps.[1:26:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: K. And when we're talking about food swamps, we're not talking about And plethora of healthy foods, we're talking about all the junk. That's what they they live in the swamp of junk. So If you live in the swamp of junk, how are you supposed to exercise personal responsibility? Number 3, affordability.[1:26:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: So you have to be able to afford your choice, and society has to be able to afford your choice. And right now, we can't afford that choice because health care costs right now are at $4,100,000,000,000 a year.[1:26:47] Andrew Huberman: But like so many things in, Behavioral economics and health. It's so hard for people to see that the the immediate choice is leading to a higher cost down the road. There are just too many nodes of separation for people to realize, hey. When I'm reaching for this cereal as opposed to Making waffles for my kids from scratch or, you know, they're thinking time efficiency, cost efficiency, volume, the the kids not throwing tantrums because they're not no longer getting the cereal. And it's very difficult to see this is the reason why health care costs are going up.[1:27:20] Andrew Huberman: There are just too many nodes of separation.[1:27:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: Couldn't agree more, but, Ultimately, it's because the government separates and silos, food industry profits from health care costs. If you actually combine those because they ultimately are the same, you would see the problem. So globally, the food industry grosses $9,000,000,000,000 a year. Health care costs globally cost $11,000,000,000,000 a year, dietary related health care costs. Environmental costs cost $7,000,000,000,000 a year, and productivity costs cost $1,000,000,000,000 a year.[1:28:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: So when you do the math, 9 minus 11 minus 7 minus 1 means that there is a $10,000,000,000,000 a year deficit because of Us cleaning up the mess that the food industry makes.[1:28:16] Andrew Huberman: And while numbers like[1:28:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: that not affordable.[1:28:18] Andrew Huberman: Right. I agree. And while numbers like that land really hard, I find that for myself and for many people, statistics like that are hard to keep in mind in a way there's something about the human brain that hears that and goes, woah. We're like, that war cost that much, and this food issue cost that much. Yep.[1:28:36] Andrew Huberman: And then we go to the store, and we're hungry. Right. And the kids are are are are hungry, and and you're and so the those nodes of separation, it's it's almost like a neural slash memory slash prefrontal cortex issue to me. And, of course, I look at everything through the lens of neurobiology. Me too.[1:28:51] Andrew Huberman: You know, not everything, but most everything. And so how how could I not? How could we not? But Then it like, the issue is, well, there's still food on the shelves, and, you know, and so it's very what do we do to connect To bring closer together these notions, what would the government do?[1:29:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the question is, is there food on the shelves? Let me finish the 4th one, and then I wanna come back to that Point. Let me just, you know, finish a concept. So affordability. And number 4, externalities.[1:29:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: Your choice can't hurt anybody else. But what if your choice does hurt somebody else? So, like, for tobacco, secondhand smoke. Right. 4, alcohol, drunk driving.[1:29:32] Andrew Huberman: What was the argument for teen pregnancy that someone else was gonna have to raise the kids?[1:29:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. Alright. But what about for Food. K? Well, how about the fact that your employer, Stanford University, has to pay $2,750, per year in obesity related health care expenses that they have passed on to you even though you're not obese.[1:29:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: That is affecting you. So that guy's obesity right there, that is affecting you.[1:30:04] Andrew Huberman: But there, nowadays, it's especially tricky even to have the conversation. I'm willing to have it now Yeah. Which is that You know? There's this whole concept of fat shaming. Right?[1:30:14] Andrew Huberman: So if somebody is obese, whose fault is it? And if we even talk about it, is, are we subject to, attack, legitimate attack? You know? So, like, so calling something Someone obese at a clinical level. Like, I mean, you're you're an expert in Don't talk about[1:30:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: don't talk about obesity. Let's talk about diabetes.[1:30:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So talk about the consequence of obesity.[1:30:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Let's talk about the metabolic health issue itself. K. The fact is that diabetes is now 11.4% of America.[1:30:50] Andrew Huberman: What was it 20 years ago?[1:30:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: It was 20 years ago, it was about 8%.[1:30:55] Andrew Huberman: I was wondering this earlier. 20 years ago, there was a lot more margarine in refrigerators, But people were thinner, and there was less diabetes. Yeah. Everything you told us about margarine and trans fats is that it's bad, bad, bad. Now butter is back as Time magazine and you[1:31:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: said. Right.[1:31:09] Andrew Huberman: So Clearly can't be the transition away from trans fats that's increased obesity. Well, no. No. So it's gonna be the increase in sugar and hidden[1:31:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: The increase in sugar.[1:31:18] Andrew Huberman: And and these Hidden sugars in[1:31:20] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. That's right. Alright. The the the the key, though, is Pakistan and India because and China. They are not fat, but they have 14% diabetes rates, and they're thin.[1:31:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the reason is because of ultra processed food. Are there any countries in the world that Don't allow high fructose corn syrup or[1:31:45] Andrew Huberman: at least not at the level that that we do.[1:31:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Oh. They're free to use. Okay. There are boatloads of countries that, don't import high fructose corn syrup or don't make it. So, Scandinavian countries?[1:31:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: Scandinavian countries, most of Europe. The, other than the Asia Pacific rim so, Japan has it. In fact, it was invented in Japan, 1966, Saga Medical School, Takasaki, at all. Korea has it, but Australia does not have it. Thailand does not have it, But they have just as much of an, obesity and diabetes problem as we do because they have sucrose, because high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are no different metabolically.[1:32:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: So it doesn't really matter.[1:32:28] Andrew Huberman: It's that one to 1[1:32:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's the one to 1 thing. Exactly. Of glucose and fructose. So here's the question, Andrew. K.[1:32:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: So I wanna go back to that. You said all this food is still on the shelves. Is it food? What is the definition of food?[1:32:46] Andrew Huberman: Can I give the definition I think most people would give? That's not necessarily the one I would I would give, but Something that has contains caloric energy. Right? Like, I I could eat this microphone, but it's not gonna provide much useful energy.[1:33:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: The definition of food Straight from the dictionary and believe me, I looked it up and memorized it. I believe you. Substrate that contributes to either growth or burning of an organism. Interesting. That is the definition of free.[1:33:15] Andrew Huberman: Some free scientific[1:33:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: 100% correct. Growth or burning. So any substrate that passes your lips that contributes to either growth or burning, that's food. Okay. Let's do it.[1:33:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Let's do burning first. I just showed you that sugar, which is the marker of ultraprocessed food, and 73% of the items in the grocery store Our spike with sugar inhibits burning. It inhibits those 3 enzymes involved in mitochondrial function. Now let's do growth. My colleague, doctor Efraat Monsonigo Ornan, who is the chairman of nutrition at Hebrew University Jerusalem, Actually, looked at this question and showed that ultra processed food actually inhibits growth.[1:34:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: It inhibits cortical bone growth. It inhibits, trabecular bone growth. It inhibits, cancellous bone growth. It inhibits linear bone growth. It hijacks growth for cancer because it inhibits mitochondria, and so you have to then grow instead of burn.[1:34:20] Andrew Huberman: And this was work that was done in In vivo or in vitro?[1:34:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: In vivo.[1:34:23] Andrew Huberman: In vivo. So these are people that are eating high amounts of highly processed food. Exactly. How did you find those in the in the Middle East?[1:34:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: They they found in Israel, they found it. So bottom line is if a substrate does not contribute to growth and does not contribute to burning, is it a food?[1:34:43] Andrew Huberman: I see. Answer is no.[1:34:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, that's 73% of what's in the grocery store. So I would argue, you said the food's there. No. It's not. That's not food.[1:34:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: In fact, it's consumable poison.[1:34:57] Andrew Huberman: So this leads to an important question of what's left. Right? You remove all that, what's left? Just anecdotally and what I sometimes call, anecdata. You know, I've had several friends in their Mhmm.[1:35:11] Andrew Huberman: Forties and early fifties say they want to lose weight and get in shape, and that Right. The thing that's worked every every single time for them to Lose significant amounts of weight quickly and keep it off. And many of them were already exercising, but then also increase their exercise. Mhmm. Was I just Since I'm not a dietitian, nutritionist, or anything, I just say eat meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits.[1:35:37] Andrew Huberman: You're not gonna eat starches. You're not gonna drink alcohol. You're not gonna drink soda. You can still have coffee, tea. You can still have artificial sweeteners.[1:35:45] Andrew Huberman: I will go to artificial sweeteners in a little bit.[1:35:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: We we have to go there.[1:35:48] Andrew Huberman: But, and the reason I say no starches even though I personally eat Rice, oatmeal, pasta, things of that sort. Some in in moderation depending on Mhmm. On what sort of exercise I'm doing and how much Mhmm. Is because of the fact that Nowadays, many of those things contain fructose.[1:36:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[1:36:07] Andrew Huberman: And inevitably, every one of those people is blown away by the fact that it quote, unquote works and assumes that it's all because of reduced calorie intake overall. Nope. And they lose, like, anywhere from 30 to 55 Pound and keep it off, and they're like, hey. This is great. I can actually still eat rib eye steaks and salads and, the but they're not eating croutons.[1:36:28] Andrew Huberman: They're. And so in some sense, it looks extreme. It it sounds ketogenic, but it's nothing like that. You're just saying, basically, stay away from you're eliminating processed foods. You're eliminating Liquid calories in in general, you and on and on.[1:36:42] Andrew Huberman: And so there's nothing sophisticated about it. And my question to you is, How much of that weight loss effect do you think is a calories in versus calories out effect? Because they're eating a lot of food And in some cases and how much of it do you think is the elimination or near elimination of this fructose or this Glucose, fructose combination.[1:37:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's nothing to do with the calories. It has everything to do with the insulin. If you get the insulin down, you're not shunting energy to fat. You can lose weight. Your fat will give up the the, the the triglycerides stored in it as soon as your insulin goes down.[1:37:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Insulin is pushing on your fat cell all the time. And as long as your insulin's up, your fat cell can't release it. The minute your insulin goes down, you can now engage in what we call lipolysis. Hormone sensitive lipase is An enzyme in the fat cell that is, inhibited by insulin. As soon as the insulin's gone, hormone sensitive lipase can turn that Store triglyceride into free fatty acids and glycerol and release it, and you can lose weight.[1:38:01] Dr. Robert Lustig: So get the insulin down, And it all works. So the question is, what makes insulin go up? Well, 2 things, refined carbohydrate and sugar. Those are the 2 things that make insulin go up. In addition, branch chain amino acids make insulin go up as well.[1:38:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Leucine isoleucine valine, which is in corn fed beef, chicken, and fish, processed food. Alright. Here's here's here's the deal. In one concept, my colleague, doctor Carlos Montero, who is a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo has done the world a great service. He has developed a system for categorization of food processing.[1:38:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: It is called the NOVA system. Just means new. But he has Basically, categorized every food anywhere in the world into 1 of 4 classes. The easiest way to explain this would be, an example. Let's take an apple.[1:38:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: Nova class 1 would be an apple picked off a tree. Nova class 2 would be apple slices, destemmed, deseeded, deskinned, maybe. Nova class 3 would be apple sauce, Cooked, macerated, possibly a preservative added, maybe some extra sugar, maybe not. Nova class 4 would be a McDonald's apple pie. Now does that McDonald's apple pie look anything like that apple?[1:39:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: No. Is there even any apple in it? Maybe a tiny not.[1:39:32] Andrew Huberman: Maybe a tiny bit.[1:39:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: You know, it's it's all flavor enhanced, etcetera. K. Turns out, logic data, but nonetheless, prospective epidemiologic data, so it's not useless. That NOVAClass Four, that ultra processed food category, which is 73% of the American grocery store, is the class that is associated with all of these chronic metabolic diseases. Nova class 1 through 3, no problem.[1:40:02] Andrew Huberman: Now when you say associate, what percentage of one's Daily total intake needs to come from NOVA class 4 before that statement you just made is true. Because I love the recommendation you made earlier or the, let's just say, the the contour of a You don't have to avoid dessert. You can enjoy dessert, but don't eat dessert at other times of day. Right. And maybe you don't eat dessert every single night.[1:40:27] Andrew Huberman: Right. And is there a rule that people would have to eat dessert every single night?[1:40:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the answer is about 7 to 10% would be at the upper limit.[1:40:36] Andrew Huberman: So So you can get 7 to 10% of your caloric intake daily caloric intake from these nova class 4 foods and still And[1:40:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: still be okay.[1:40:44] Andrew Huberman: And still be okay. Yeah. So this is, I know But that's not what's happening. Right. I know some very healthy physicians who I used to Observe how people, a, move, because I I would pay attention in my in our field.[1:40:58] Andrew Huberman: Right? I I was like, oh, you know, People all around me at Stanford, UCSF, etcetera, were successful or else they wouldn't be there. Right.[1:41:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: I was[1:41:04] Andrew Huberman: like, you know, who looks healthy? Who can make it up the stairs and doesn't have to take the elevator? How much exercise are people doing at a given age? Mhmm. Are they fanatic you know, like 4 in the morning runners.[1:41:13] Andrew Huberman: I'm not gonna do that consistently unless I have to. And I and I observed that, you know, many of the healthiest people I know, they move a lot during the day. They ate very well. Many of them skip breakfast or lunch, Not always. And then I also noticed that they would drink very little or no alcohol, and then but they would enjoy, like, there's 1 physician at UCSF in particular I'm thinking of who really enjoyed his dark chocolate Kit Kat after lunch, and he's sort of very, ceremonial about the unraveling of that, The foil and the end of the day, and I was like, okay.[1:41:45] Andrew Huberman: So you're talking about that small percentage of calories.[1:41:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: If that if that's if that's all you do, hey. You know, god bless you. But that's not what people are doing. That's the problem. Bottom line, that NOVA class 4 is where all the action is in terms of chronic metabolic disease.[1:42:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the question is, how can you avoid that? How do you know which is which? We have a solution. So my colleagues and I have developed a web based tool That is available to the entire world right now, and you'll put it in your show notes. Yeah.[1:42:21] Andrew Huberman: We'll put a link to this.[1:42:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: Absolutely. It's called Perfact, perfact, and you can find it at perfect.co. And what it is is it's a recommendation engine, Not AI. We're gonna talk about AI in a minute, but it is a recommendation engine based on the science of human metabolism That categorizes foods based on not their nutrient Content but on their metabolic effect.[1:42:54] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[1:42:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: And so there is a NOVA filter which will filter out all the NOVA class four stuff, and it will go to your grocery store and will tell you what you can buy that will be a nova class 1 through 3, Which turns out to only be 20% of the grocery store. I mean,[1:43:13] Andrew Huberman: it means basically sitting on the periphery of the grocery Well, that's that's in general.[1:43:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: In general. Yeah.[1:43:17] Andrew Huberman: Yes. The produce, the meat, the dairy, the[1:43:20] Dr. Robert Lustig: All the things you mentioned, in fact. So I'm not low carb. I'm low insulin. And there are a lot of ways to get to low insulin. Get rid of the refined carbohydrate, get rid of the sugar, Increase the fiber.[1:43:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: Get rid of the branched chain amino acids. K? So eating fish is a good place to be. Even eating a a steak is okay if it's a, pasture fed steak. So let's talk about Your steak.[1:43:48] Andrew Huberman: Right. Which is also better for the animals. Right?[1:43:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: It is. Absolutely. So you mentioned marbling before. We love our marbling. Right?[1:43:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: We can cut our US grade a steaks with a butter knife because they're so tender. Right? You ever been to Argentina?[1:44:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. My father's Argentinian.[1:44:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right. You're Argentinian.[1:44:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They only know Of course. They only know grass fed steak. The on the idea that the cows would eat anything but grass is sort of like the idea that, those fish would would fly.[1:44:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Absolutely. New Zealand, same thing. Yeah. K. The meat is gorgeous.[1:44:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's homogeneous. It's pink. It's delightful. I've been to Argentina. The the the meat is fantastic, you have to use a steak knife.[1:44:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: You can't use a butter knife.[1:44:29] Andrew Huberman: And it takes more chewing.[1:44:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: It take and it takes[1:44:31] Andrew Huberman: more chewing[1:44:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: to produce sinew. The you know, it's a it's a different experience entirely. It's delicious, But it is kind of a little bit, you know, tougher. Mhmm. Alright.[1:44:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Turns out that marbling is intramyocellular lipid. That animal has metabolic syndrome.[1:44:50] Andrew Huberman: The American corn fed.[1:44:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: The American corn fed animal because that corn is filled with branched chain amino acids, Leucine isoleucine valine. Branched chain amino acids are what's in protein powder. That's what, you know, bodybuilders, You know, putting their smoothies, you know, to build muscle. And if you're building muscle, that's okay because 20% of the amino acids in muscle are branch chains. So, you know, if you've got a place to put them, you know, have at it.[1:45:18] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There's a need there. There's a breaking down model.[1:45:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Fine. But if you're not, if you're, you know, again, a mere mortal like me, you consume those excess branched chain amino acids. They're gonna go to the liver. They're gonna be deamidated like we talked about earlier, And they're gonna end up as branch chain organic acids.[1:45:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're gonna flood the mitochondria. The mitochondria are not gonna be able to deal with the volume, And so they're gonna divert the excess and turn that into fat. And so now you've got hypertriglyceridemia and chance for fatty liver disease and insulin resistance. So what kind of meat you eat has a lot to do with your metabolic health.[1:46:00] Andrew Huberman: What about the egg, the whole egg? Near near perfect protein score in terms of its, bioavailability.[1:46:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Eggs are terrific. Okay. There's nothing wrong with eggs. Now there are better eggs than others. Mhmm.[1:46:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: So there So well, there's yellow, yolk eggs, and there are orange yolk eggs. What's the difference between a yellow oak egg and an orange oak egg?[1:46:23] Andrew Huberman: I'm guessing that something about the, the feed of the the mother chicken, and I'm guessing it probably also has something to do with Choline content?[1:46:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: Omega threes. Interesting. K. The orange, yolk egg has a lot of omega threes in it.[1:46:43] Andrew Huberman: What are other great sources of omega threes? I I've I know some off the top of my head, but I'd like to hear it from you.[1:46:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay. So marine life is number 1. Okay? You know, fish.[1:46:53] Andrew Huberman: Provided you're not bringing heavy metals[1:46:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: with them. Well, yes. So, I mean, that's always the the the argument. You know, the question is, you know, is it the mercury, or is it the omega threes? Ultimately, I think it's the omega threes that is more important, but, yes, I do understand the mercury issue.[1:47:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: Ultimately, there are 3 omega threes. There's ALA, alpha linolenic acid, which you can get in vegetables. There is EPA, Eicosapentaenoic acid, which you can only get in marine life. Fish oil, cod liver oil. Right?[1:47:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: And finally, DHA, docohexanoic acid, which you also get from marine life, but you can get from algae. So you can get algal oil, in which, you know, the vegans will use.[1:47:42] Andrew Huberman: Do you, personally take anything to increase your omega three intake? Yeah.[1:47:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: I I[1:47:47] Andrew Huberman: know that there's even prescription omega threes.[1:47:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: I take fish oil.[1:47:50] Andrew Huberman: You take a fish oil. Yeah. Yeah. The the threshold take 3[1:47:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: I only take 3 supplements.[1:47:55] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I'd like to know what those are. I will say that I always, always, always say behaviors first. Right? Dos and don'ts.[1:48:00] Andrew Huberman: Yep. Behaviors, nutrition, then Only if needed and one can afford it, then supplementation and prescription drugs. And I'm a big consumer of supplements and always have been, frankly. Okay. So what are the 3?[1:48:11] Andrew Huberman: So you take[1:48:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Fish oil?[1:48:13] Andrew Huberman: Fish oil. And do you take to get above a certain threshold of EPA?[1:48:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. About a 1000 milligrams.[1:48:17] Andrew Huberman: Let's say about a gram a day.[1:48:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Gram a day. Okay. Vitamin c.[1:48:21] Andrew Huberman: How much of vitamin c do you have?[1:48:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: A 1000 milligrams a day. You and Linus Pauling. Yeah. Well, it's actually for my rosacea. I've got, a Skin issue.[1:48:30] Andrew Huberman: And the vitamin c helps with[1:48:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Helps with that. Interesting. And finally, vitamin d. Now I will tell you vitamin d is a complicated one. Alright?[1:48:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: Let and we can talk about vitamin d and how either important or nonimportant it is because there's a there's a quirk to vitamin d. And, it it's important for your audience to know about it because everybody and his brothers, you know, Touting vitamin d. Well, it's just a cure for everything.[1:48:57] Andrew Huberman: It's sort of funny because in that you have your supplement lovers, haters, and agnostics, But vitamin d somehow made it through the chute. Like, everyone's, like, provitamin d. It's really interesting. Somehow vitamin d, People are comfortable taking a gel a vitamin d gel cap, but, like, other supplements where you say, oh, like, maybe, this might be good for, You know, like, omega threes and fish oil, then people are a little bit, like, more standoffish. It's really interesting that the kind of psychosocial stuff around this.[1:49:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. How much vitamin d do do you personally take?[1:49:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: I take 5,000 units a day. Okay. So do I. Vitamin d is complicated, though. Here's the problem.[1:49:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: If you look at the literature, Vitamin d deficiency is associated with all these chronic metabolic diseases. However, supplementation With vitamin d has not fixed any of those. So if you're vitamin d deficient, why wouldn't supplementation Fix it. Couple of reasons. One, one of the reasons for vitamin d deficiency is because everyone's drinking soft drinks.[1:50:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's one reason, but there's a more important reason.[1:50:05] Andrew Huberman: Sugar and artificially sweetened soft drinks[1:50:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[1:50:08] Andrew Huberman: Can deplete vitamin d, utilize it[1:50:10] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, you're not consuming dairy because you're consuming soft drinks.[1:50:14] Andrew Huberman: But I can't tolerate milk anymore.[1:50:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well Yeah. Then you take vitamin d. But here's the here's the real nugget of truth. And this is a little complicated, but the endocrinologists in the audience will will get it. Vitamin d is a pre pro hormone.[1:50:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's not it's not active at all. Vitamin d is converted in the liver, first step, to a compound called 25 hydroxyvitamin d. That is a prohormone. It also is inactive. It has no activity whatsoever.[1:50:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: From there, 25 hydroxyvitamin d can be metabolized one of 2 ways. It can either be 1 alpha hydroxylated in the kidney To the active form 1 alpha it's 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin d, which will then do all of the business A vitamin d.[1:51:10] Andrew Huberman: Such as?[1:51:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: Calcium absorption from the gut, suppression of the immune system, Methotol like receptor 4.[1:51:17] Andrew Huberman: That sounds like a bad thing.[1:51:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: No. That's a good thing.[1:51:19] Andrew Huberman: I know, but I had to bring that up because when you say suppression in the immune system, people are, I'm immunosuppressed. Nobody that sounds like Aids.[1:51:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: A good it suppresses inflammation. Got it. It's a good thing. K. Suppression of the inflammation.[1:51:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: And that's actually the point that we're we're getting to. So there are a lot of good things about 125 dihydroxy vitamin d. However, That 25 hydroxy d that came out of the liver can be metabolized a different way. It can be 24 hydroxylated In inflammatory tissue, like tuberculosis, sarcoid, gut inflammation. And so you will end up taking your 25 hydroxy d, which is a pro hormone, and turning it into the inactive 24, 25 dihydroxy d, which then just gets excreted out.[1:52:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: So in other words, you consumed all this vitamin d and it didn't go where you needed to go. And the reason was because you're inflamed. You have to fix the inflammation Before the vitamin d can be effective, and 93% of Americans are inflamed. So giving them vitamin d is not gonna do a damn thing.[1:52:37] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Is reducing fructose intake the one of the primary ways to reduce systemic inflammation?[1:52:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Absolutely. What are some others? Reducing oxidative stress in general, so heavy metals like cadmium. You know, cadmium is very high in chocolate, Especially South American chocolate. Sorry.[1:52:54] Andrew Huberman: No. I I'm not a fan of chocolate. I occasionally like a little dark chocolate, but Okay. But, so if people are going to Chocolate, they should be careful how much chocolate they[1:53:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, especially if it's South American chocolate and and processed chocolate. I mean, the really good[1:53:08] Andrew Huberman: We're gonna be on the hit list of many industries out[1:53:10] Dr. Robert Lustig: there Yeah. That's true. Comes out. All I can tell you is I've been on the hit list for a decade, and I'm still[1:53:16] Andrew Huberman: You're you're just one big target.[1:53:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Right.[1:53:17] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[1:53:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: I got a I it's on my back. You know? It kicked me. I already got that. The the the main thing is to make that gut work right.[1:53:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: So fiber, short chain fatty acid Production from fiber, is a huge, you know, boon and reduce inflammation. Reduce inflammation.[1:53:42] Andrew Huberman: How about improving sleep? Is there any evidence that, you know, chronic slight sleep deprivation can increase inflammation?[1:53:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, what it will do is increase cortisol, and Chronically increased cortisol will definitely lead to increased inflammation. You know, which is funny because cortisol is usually considered the anti inflammatory, but only acutely.[1:54:00] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:54:01] Dr. Robert Lustig: Chronic Cortisol elevation does the opposite.[1:54:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. If if we can contribute to I have this secret, agenda, which is not which is not a secret, which is that People think cortisol is bad when in fact, acutely, cortisol does wonderful things provided it's happening at the right time of day. Right. Late shifted cortisol, bad. Right.[1:54:21] Andrew Huberman: Too much or too frequent cortisol, bad. But cortisol, you you need it. It's so essential. And I think most people just hear cortisol, and it's been associated with all things bad, and and maybe we can help shift that narrative.[1:54:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. I'm I'm very happy. I mean, as an endocrinologist, you know, this is, you know, where this is my wheelhouse. It's where I live. Cortisol is a good news, bad news deal like so many things.[1:54:43] Dr. Robert Lustig: Short term gain for long term pain. K? So when you are in what we call allostasis, That is perturbation of homeostasis. That is a stress an acute stress. Cortisol is one of the things that helps you manage that bodily and mental stress.[1:55:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: So an English test, A car accident, running away from the lion, you know, the famous, you know, pygmy running away from the lion. All of those require Cortisol in order to manage and mitigate that stress. The upcoming 2024 election. That's chronic stress. That is not acute stress.[1:55:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Didn't mean to lie. That's the worst.[1:55:31] Andrew Huberman: That'll be that'll be the only mention of politics[1:55:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: on this podcast. And we don't have to go there, but we're all chronically stressed. And we can talk about why that is and what's going on, And I'm actually very interested in that, and a colleague of mine in Paris and I have built a computational model of the limbic system, which focuses on the stress center of the brain, the amygdala, to understand how chronic stress is different From acute stress and how that chronic stress ultimately leads to metabolic and mental health disaster.[1:56:07] Andrew Huberman: Very interested in learning more about that. But before we touch on that, you've worked a lot with kids. Mhmm. People age, as you put it, 0 to 19. I don't know about the the exact numbers, but when I was growing up, there were some kids in school that were overweight, it was the occasional kid.[1:56:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[1:56:28] Andrew Huberman: Now it seems depending on where one draws the threshold for overweight, it seems that there are a lot of Kids that are overweight.[1:56:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: How about 25% obese and 40% overweight?[1:56:41] Andrew Huberman: K. So, obviously, a serious problem Serious problem. Now and going forward. Indeed. What about adults in the US?[1:56:47] Andrew Huberman: I remember seeing At a meeting, a map of obesity in the US and, over time, and it very quickly filled in from very few people were obese to very many. Colorado was this, was this, like like, beacon of of of fit people, but now it's no longer[1:57:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: And that's bullshit too.[1:57:05] Andrew Huberman: Oh, okay. Cool.[1:57:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: I'll tell you why. There there are 4 things that could increase mitochondrial, biogenesis.[1:57:12] Andrew Huberman: You can tell me altitude is Cold? Yeah.[1:57:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Cold? That's why Colorado is less obese. Altitude. That's why Colorado says obese. And, what were the other 2?[1:57:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: I forgot. But and those were the reason. It had nothing to do with being more fit. It had to do with cold and altitude. Example, Switzerland compared to Germany.[1:57:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: They got the same crappy food, but Switzerland has half the obesity that Germany does. I love Switzerland is higher.[1:57:39] Andrew Huberman: Oh, I love the food. When I go to Munich, I love the schnitzels and the schnitzels.[1:57:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're wonderful.[1:57:43] Andrew Huberman: Sauerkrauts and[1:57:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: They got that in Switzerland too.[1:57:46] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So they have great food.[1:57:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Switzerland's less obese. Alright. Same way Colorado's less obese. It's because of the altitude.[1:57:54] Andrew Huberman: You you mentioned cold. Many listeners of this podcast are at Least interested in some, also practice deliberate cold exposure, cold showers, cold plunges, mainly for the, I think the best data are the increases in catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine that are long lasting. People feel a big state shift. They feel better. Yep.[1:58:12] Andrew Huberman: But when one looks at the effects on metabolism, they're pretty slight. They are. They're slight. However, Studies like that to me always seem, shortsighted in the sense that if there's a longer arc of effect on the Chondria that's affecting other things in terms of how calories are processed or how calories are feeding into, mitochondrial function or dysfunction, there I could see how it might shift the, shift the scale, so to speak. I mean, cold is is an amazingly powerful stimulus.[1:58:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: It is. It is.[1:58:45] Andrew Huberman: And, I think of light, cold, food, movement. It's kinda like the core for ways in which you can shift physiology easily.[1:58:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: All of these things are eminently manipulable and for almost $0. Mhmm. K? But you have to know what you're doing. And right now, we've been actually kept from that knowledge.[1:59:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: And, You know, if you're addicted, it's really hard to unaddict yourself. So that brings us back to this thing about, Food[1:59:17] Andrew Huberman: industry conspiracies, government conspiracies, and the rest. Boy, this is gonna be an interesting[1:59:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: We can go.[1:59:24] Andrew Huberman: Section. But what do we do? Like, so if you and I go up to cap Capitol Hill[1:59:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: Which I've done.[1:59:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Which you've done, and and maybe I'll join you someday. And, you know, you're at UCSF. I'm down at Stanford. You're a clinician.[1:59:40] Andrew Huberman: I'm a scientist and and A public health advocate, podcaster.[1:59:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[1:59:45] Andrew Huberman: And we explain to people, hey. Listen. Like, there's the the food is laced with a drug. It's might it's not even really Food[1:59:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: is That's right. It's not food.[1:59:51] Andrew Huberman: It's an aggregate of food and nonfood parts that make you think it's food. It's sort of like telling people, hey. Your kids are, you know, they're swimming in a swimming pool, looks like water, but it's actually part poison, and it's and it's harming them. It's giving them you know, if you say those kinds of things I mean, congressmen and women are They're, like, reasonably smart people. Right?[2:00:10] Andrew Huberman: I mean, are are they gonna do something about it? No. So where is the conflict? Is it that the food industry has, the government by the short hairs?[2:00:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's exactly right.[2:00:20] Andrew Huberman: And they have them by the short hairs where? I mean, is it are they lining their pockets? I mean, where where Where is the leverage actually exerted?[2:00:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay. So they're they are lining their pockets. That's number 1. That is absolutely true. We have the data to Support that.[2:00:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: Blanche Lincoln, who was a senator from Arkansas, who was the chairman of the nutrition committee, you had to see her campaign contributions Every time she was up for reelection.[2:00:42] Andrew Huberman: So it's all about getting reelected or it's about them, like, having a, like, a third home in the Hamptons?[2:00:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's I think it's the 3rd home in the Hamptons Okay. Okay. More than anything.[2:00:50] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So it's really as bad as as as some of the documentaries Without question. Make us believe.[2:00:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: Without question. Goodness. And we and we and we have the data. There is a, an organization that I absolutely wanna call out because they are, you know, the most egregious Oregon, you know, a political organization on the face of the earth. They're called the American Legislative Exchange Council, ALEC or ALEC, and they write bills.[2:01:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: They are a bill mill. K? And they are for whoever gives them money. And who gives them money? Big pharma, big agra, big oil, and, Not big food.[2:01:29] Andrew Huberman: And you're so you're including big pharma. You're a physician. You've written scripts before. You've written prescriptions for patients before. Isn't that pharma that provides drugs that allows your patients to feel better.[2:01:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, the question is, do they? Do they feel better? This is a big question. Let's you wanna go But you're writing the script.[2:01:44] Andrew Huberman: But you're writing the script. Mean I mean, I'm just trying to I'm not trying to to challenge you, but I see. So so you don't, there have to be instances where someone's thyroid deficient and you give them, You know? Absolutely.[2:01:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: So if so if if you've got a disease and a medicine will replace what's missing, sure. K. So for deficiency diseases, which as an endocrinologist, that's what I do, absolutely. And I did that, you know, With no compunction of, of impropriety whatsoever, but that's not what we're talking about here. Let's talk about what we're really talking about.[2:02:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: Let's start with statins. Statins lower LDL. Okay. Do statins reduce heart disease? Yes or no?[2:02:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: You know, I seem to[2:02:36] Andrew Huberman: be whiffing today on all the quizzes, and it's kind of becoming fun for me at this level. I'm I'm gonna go with no. But but I will say, you know, my friend, and I think is an expert, physician as well, you know, Peter Attia[2:02:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: and others, you[2:02:50] Andrew Huberman: know, has Talked about some of the positive attributes of statins in certain cases for certain[2:02:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: In certain cases, that's exactly right. And I completely agree. By the way, Peter's a friend and, you know, we someday we'll we'll, you know, all, you know, go out drinking together.[2:03:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, I won't drink with any Alright. Well How about we share Dave.[2:03:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: Share absolutely. Okay. You got it. You guys[2:03:10] Andrew Huberman: I don't I don't know if you drink it.[2:03:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: He drinks a little bit. If you're listening, k, he[2:03:13] Andrew Huberman: drinks a little bit.[2:03:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Have sun me. Yeah.[2:03:15] Andrew Huberman: I don't do the dessert or the or the alcohol anymore, but I'm but I'm and it's not so I can live to be a 120, so I can wake up the next morning and and, Keep up with you guys.[2:03:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's fine. Yeah. I I get it. The so for primary prevention, that is your LDL's high. You need a statin.[2:03:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's primary prevention. You haven't declared yourself. You haven't had an event. For primary prevention, the mean increase in life span For being on a statin is 4 days. 4 days.[2:03:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: 4 days. 4 days.[2:03:48] Andrew Huberman: Some bathtub. That's that's, and the[2:03:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: risk for Diabetes is 20% increase.[2:03:55] Andrew Huberman: What about any improvement in in quality[2:03:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: of life? None For primary prevention. Now for secondary prevention for secondary, in other words, you've already declared yourself. You already have a problem. For secondary prevention, that's where statins shine.[2:04:10] Dr. Robert Lustig: So there's a value to them. I'm not arguing that. And if you have familial hypercholesterolemia, which is 1 in 500. K. Not only do you need a statin, but you need a low fat diet and a priest.[2:04:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay? So There is definitely a value to statins, but not for primary prevention. But that's what every what every doctor's doing. Oh, your LDL. It's over 80.[2:04:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: You know, you need a statin. That's ridiculous. That is absolutely a joke, and the data show that. In fact in fact, my colleague, Asim Malhotra, in the UK participated in an analysis where they took the entire UK population, and they took out everybody under age 65. So looking at people 65 to 90, And it turned out that the LDL level correlated with longevity.[2:05:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: The higher the LDL, the longer they lived When you took out all the people who had problems. So LDL is not really the problem, and the reason is because there are 2 LDLs. There's one called large buoyant, and there's one called small dense. Turns out dietary fat raises your large buoyant. Your large buoyant is irrelevant.[2:05:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: It is cardiovascularly neutral, but that's the one that statins affects. The small dense, That's the atherogenic particle. When your small dense LDL is high, that means you are not clearing Triglyceride peripherally because that's what small dense show you. That's that that's what happens to triglyceride is they become small dense.[2:05:48] Andrew Huberman: Can I take a guess and say that the best way to reduce small dents is to reduce insulin?[2:05:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yes. By reducing sugar because that triglyceride is made in the liver. It's all polymitate, and that's the only Fat that the liver knows how to make. And so triglyceride is your liver output of carbohydrate. That's how you have to look at triglyceride.[2:06:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: So triglyceride turns out to be much more important as a cardiovascular risk factor than LDL ever was.[2:06:23] Andrew Huberman: So does the Does big pharma and big food, do they know all of this?[2:06:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yes. I know they know because they've told me so. And But they have statins to sell.[2:06:35] Andrew Huberman: And foods in the, the nova class 4.[2:06:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm. They know this too.[2:06:40] Andrew Huberman: So, you know, I'm an optimist or, you know, what what's it gonna take to really move the needle. I mean, you described the 4 barriers. We're trying to add to the knowledge component now. You know, what's it gonna take? Is it going to take, you know, having a president in an office or congresspeople in office that really understand and care about this stuff?[2:07:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[2:07:05] Andrew Huberman: I mean, to really revamp the whole system. Yeah.[2:07:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: So right now, the system is completely and utterly broken. Completely and utterly broken. And there's a reason why it's completely and utterly broken because the food industry likes it that way.[2:07:19] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's profitable for them, Obviously.[2:07:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: There are 51 different federal agencies that manage our food. 51. And none of them know what the other one's doing, And the food industry likes it that way.[2:07:33] Andrew Huberman: So communication across these 5th 51 organizations would help?[2:07:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, if we had a centralized Food, czar or food, you know, if we split the food off the FDA because, you know, it's like It's not the FDA. It's the DA. Or the FDA is not the Food and Drug Administration. It's the Federal Drug Administration. They spend a lot of time on drugs.[2:07:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: They spend almost no time on food.[2:08:00] Andrew Huberman: Well, let's think about where there's been success. So I can recall when people smoked on planes. I actually recall going to a gym in Europe, and there was an ashtray molded into the squat rack.[2:08:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yep.[2:08:11] Andrew Huberman: That was telling.[2:08:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yep.[2:08:13] Andrew Huberman: I don't see people smoking cigarettes around Stanford Hospital anymore, but I remember when they initially said that People couldn't smoke anywhere except in with this one little designated area.[2:08:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:08:24] Andrew Huberman: And that's typically what you see nowadays. And my understanding of the Antispoken campaign, at least for kids, for people 18 and younger, was that telling people it was bad for their health didn't work. Showing them lungs that were decrepit didn't work. Did not. What worked was showing them commercials of cackling, handwriting, White guys who were talking about how much money they were making Yeah.[2:08:50] Andrew Huberman: Off of these, naive kids who are buying cigarettes and other tobacco products. So it became a a the the effective campaign to end smoking in young people was to hijack their inherit rebelliousness of youth Mhmm. And then they were like,[2:09:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: no. Yeah. Stick it to the man's. Right?[2:09:09] Andrew Huberman: Stick it to them. Like, give it you know, the the as my friend calls it, like, the 2 bit the 2 finger business card. Like, no. And so that worked. That worked.[2:09:18] Andrew Huberman: And vaping's making a comeback. We vaping's a separate episode. We won't get into that. But Yeah. Because Nicotine is still addictive, but you don't see a lot of people smoking cigarettes.[2:09:28] Andrew Huberman: So it worked. Like, something that you would never imagine could ever work worked.[2:09:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well so yes, no. I mean, that's part of it. I'm not gonna tell you that it's not. It is part of it. And we actually have an example of how that could be applied another, toxic substance, sugar.[2:09:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: We had Berkeley versus Big Soda. You know, that's how Berkeley ended up with its soda tax That dates back to 2015. Of Berkeley? City of Berkeley. It we just celebrated the 5 year anniversary Of the Berkeley soda tax, and we've been able to actually look, gestational diabetes way down, Obesity down slightly, not a lot, but a little bit.[2:10:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Cardiovascular disease down. Dean Schillinger and Chris Madsen At, UCSF and UC Berkeley just presented at San Francisco General just, 3 weeks ago.[2:10:22] Andrew Huberman: So a soda tax like the cigarette tax. Like this makes soda expensive.[2:10:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[2:10:26] Andrew Huberman: So you're telling me that a can of Coke that I buy on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley costs more than a can of Coke that I buy In on University Avenue in Palo[2:10:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alto? It does. Okay. By a by a dime.[2:10:40] Andrew Huberman: And that was and sufficient enough to to create this kind of change?[2:10:43] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, in yes. It is. Because money hurts. Because money hurts. Exactly.[2:10:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: So, Andrew, there have been 4, count them, 4 cultural tectonic shifts in America in the last 30 years, And they're all undeniable. Here they are. Number 1, bicycle helmets and seat belts.[2:11:03] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. Everybody uses those.[2:11:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: 2, smoking in public places. Nobody does that. 3, drunk driving.[2:11:13] Andrew Huberman: Hopefully, fewer people are doing that.[2:11:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: 4, condoms and bathrooms. Condoms in bathrooms? In bathrooms. In public bathrooms.[2:11:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You see those more available. Okay. Yeah.[2:11:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alright. 30 years ago, if a legislator stood up in a state house and proposed Legislation for any one of those 4, and I don't care if it's in the state house or in congress or in parliament or in the Duma or anywhere else in the world. K. Then it got them laughed right out of town. Nanny state, liberty interest, get out of my kitchen, get out of my bathroom, get out of my car.[2:11:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: K. Today, we're all facts of life. Right? Nobody's bellyaching about any of those. The point is We were able to solve those 4 public health debacles.[2:12:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: How did we do it? How did we solve those 4? No one could imagine that we would ever solve smoking. Right? But we did, sort of.[2:12:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: And then we brought Consumption down by half. K. That's pretty good Mhmm. When you think about it. Right.[2:12:18] Andrew Huberman: Predictive substance. How many fewer people are dying of lung cancer nowadays in the US?[2:12:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's like 80% lower. Wow.[2:12:25] Andrew Huberman: Well, there's also been improvements in treatment.[2:12:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: But Yeah. But no. It's but it's it's[2:12:29] Andrew Huberman: the diagnosed with It's incidence. Incidence[2:12:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: gone down. Amazing. K? Because tobacco's gone down. So the question is, how did that happen?[2:12:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the answer is very and why did it take 30 years to do it? We taught the children. The children grew up, and they voted. And the naysayers are dead. That's how you make a cultural tectonic shift.[2:12:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: So we now have this real food movement. We have people who are arguing against ultra processed food. We have kids who are demanding different in their schools. And by the way, what is the biggest fast food franchise in the United States.[2:13:17] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna get this wrong. So Try me again. I don't know. I've never tried it, but I've heard of, is it Chick Fil A? Nope.[2:13:25] Andrew Huberman: Is it McDonald's? I don't know.[2:13:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: It is this nation's public schools. You can add up. McDonald's, Subway, Burger King, Chipotle, and, Wendy's and every other, fast food franchise. Jack in the Box, every fast food franchise in the entire country and would only be half Our nation's public schools.[2:13:53] Andrew Huberman: Wow. So could you imagine a world where there were no Class 3 or class 4 nova foods allowed in, in public schools.[2:14:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: And we're doing it. So I am the chief science officer of a nonprofit and put this in the show notes called Eat Real.eatreal.org, And we have a new business model for public schools. So in 1971, The Department of Education issued an administrative ordinance called resolution 242, And they did this purely on monetary issues reasons. This was under Nixon. And what this resolution 242 said was that all School cafeterias all throughout the country had to make book.[2:14:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: They had to basically cover their costs. They couldn't be lost leaders for the school. They had to fend for themselves. Well, this sent every food service director in the country Scurrying for, you know, how am I gonna do this? Because I got all these, you know, you know, lunch ladies, you know, which you know, personnel and and and food preparation equipment and and and costs, you know, that they're, you know, mounting.[2:15:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: How am I going to Breakeven. They couldn't do it. So in walks, you know, Aramark and, Cisco and, Guggenheim and McDonald's, and they say, hey. We'll do it for you. We'll provide every kid in America with a nutritious meal Every single day Hot lunch.[2:15:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, they didn't say hot. Okay. They just said lunch.[2:15:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[2:15:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Nutritious. They said nutritious. And I put that in air quotes too because it wasn't nutritious. And here's the added benefit. You can take your food preparation facilities and your, footprint in the school and you can turn that into classrooms because you're gonna need them.[2:15:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: And that was the goal. Because as soon as you've moved the food preparation facilities out of the school, you are now hostage to the food industry for the rest of your life.[2:16:05] Andrew Huberman: And I could also see how that allows room for them to use these commoditized foods, foods that have very long shelf life.[2:16:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[2:16:12] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because you wanna make sure that, you know, if you only sold, you know, 2 thirds of the lunches that were prepared that on Next Tuesday, after the weekend, you could still give them food that isn't moldy.[2:16:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly right. And I will tell you. So that's how it happened, And you can actually trace IQ scores and reading and math scores in this country Down from 1971 to today. When I went to school, I was allowed to get I called it hot lunch because it was usually hot.[2:16:44] Andrew Huberman: It was, allowed to get the school lunch one day a week. One day[2:16:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: a week.[2:16:49] Andrew Huberman: The other days, I had to bring my lunch.[2:16:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[2:16:51] Andrew Huberman: That one day was pretty special. Like, you felt like you were getting a treat. It was usually like a corn dog or a hamburger.[2:16:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: The hamburger was Pretty paltry, but the, It's a commoditized hamburger.[2:17:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Commoditized hamburger. You had to go looking for the patty portion, And the bread was sweetened. And so it was it was different.[2:17:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:17:09] Andrew Huberman: But, I don't remember nearly as much obesity. I went to to high school in the early nineties.[2:17:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[2:17:15] Andrew Huberman: So you're saying that now if I went to a high school, it would be a lot more sodas and donuts and Totally. Pizza and got it.[2:17:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Pizza's a vegetable. Didn't you know?[2:17:26] Andrew Huberman: It's they claim it's a vegetable?[2:17:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: Congress said pizza's a vegetable. Amy Klobuchar made pizza a vegetable.[2:17:31] Andrew Huberman: Maybe they need their eyes.[2:17:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Because the biggest frozen pizza, producer is in Minnesota.[2:17:38] Andrew Huberman: Hey. I mean, the ketchup is a vegetable was was a was a stretch, but at least it it made sense on the novice system of going from tomato all the way to, to, to To ketchup.[2:17:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: To ketchup. Since high fructose corn syrup is the primary ingredient and ketchup, indeed. So the point is that our kids are suffering under the weight, the burden of this Chronic disaster of ultra processed food, which is not food, and no wonder they're all obese And, sick and, you know, doing so poorly in school, and by the way, Also depressed, ultra processed food has now been shown in 3 separate studies to correlate with depression in teenagers.[2:18:25] Andrew Huberman: So what is the relationship between processed food or maybe we call it NOVOSYSTEM level 3, 4 foods and depression and other psychiatric challenges. And if you could, you separate out metabolic syndrome from obesity, in answering that, like like, is there something inherently depressing about carrying excess adipose tissue? Setting aside any kind of aesthetic, stuff. You know, how how people want to look or are perceived. You know, just is there anything bad about carrying a lot about body fat Independent of the metabolic syndrome for mood and and overall sense of well-being.[2:19:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: No. I'm really glad you asked that, Andrew. We should have actually covered this earlier. Everyone thinks fat is fat. As we've learned, fat is not fat, and a fat is not a fat, but, body fat is not body fat.[2:19:20] Dr. Robert Lustig: There are 3 fat depots, and they are metabolically different. The first Is the does this bathing suit make me look fat fat? By the way, never answer that question. That's called subcutaneous fat or big butt fat, if you will. So here's a question.[2:19:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: How many Pounds or kilos of subcutaneous fat do you have to gain before you become metabolically ill? I have no idea. About 10 kilos, about £22. K. Why?[2:19:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: The reason is because that subcutaneous fat drains into the systemic circulation. So you have to have a lot of cytokines coming from those Subcutaneous adipocytes, to raise the blood level of cytokines to the point where it starts doing damage at the level of the liver.[2:20:20] Andrew Huberman: So fats are releasing cytokines,[2:20:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: which are pro inflammatory? Exactly.[2:20:24] Andrew Huberman: They're doing that at rest. Any fat cell?[2:20:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: Any fat cell. Okay. Any fat cell. But if it's going to the systemic circulation, you have a volume of distribution of 6 liters. So you have to lose you know, you have to have a lot of cytokines to get the concentration up.[2:20:39] Andrew Huberman: Now just out of fairness to the fat, How many cytokines does a muscle cell release? I mean, are are we unfairly picking on adipose tissue? Because why would adipose tissue be pro inflammatory? I mean, a Single fat cell. Wait.[2:20:55] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I've got a fat cell sitting at, you know, on my shoulder or someplace. Right? Or, I mean, I'm not zero fat at my shoulder. Why would it be pro inflammatory?[2:21:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: So in fact, the fat cell itself is not. Here's what happens. The fat cell has a fat vacuole. It has a storage place for this lipid droplet. You stuff it.[2:21:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: You stuff it. You stuff it. The fat vacuole gets bigger, bigger, bigger. The perilyipine border that, encompasses that fat vacuole that borders the the this the space, ultimately can't get any bigger, and it starts breaking down. When that happens, it spills the grease into the fat cell.[2:21:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: The fat cell dies, becomes necrotic. That calls macrophages in to clean up the grease. And it's the macrophages that release the cytokines. Alright? So in fact, the fat cell is not the problem.[2:21:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's the breakdown of the grease That leads to the macrophage activation. That's the problem. But when you do it in subcutaneous fat, It's going into this 6 liter tank, and so the concentration doesn't go up very much. So 10 kilos before you start seeing some effect. Fat depot number 2, Visceral or big belly fat.[2:22:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now how many pounds or kilos of big belly fat they have to gain before you get metabolically ill?[2:22:38] Andrew Huberman: I don't know, but I'm guessing it's less than £22.[2:22:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's way less. Oh, for[2:22:41] Andrew Huberman: once, I got an answer right today.[2:22:43] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right. About 5 about £5. Now question is why? Number 1, the visceral fat does not drain into the sub into the systemic circulation. It drains into the portal vein, which goes straight to the liver.[2:23:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: So you're getting a bigger load going straight to the liver of cytokines.[2:23:04] Andrew Huberman: Not to the kidney. The good thing about getting an answer wrong, folks, is that you never forget the correct answer. That's what I always tell my students. Right? So I'll[2:23:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: never forget that. Indeed.[2:23:14] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[2:23:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the question is, what made the visceral fat in the 1st place? Was it calories? Nope. It's cortisol. It's stress.[2:23:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's the combination of the sympathetic nervous system and cortisol. And the reason we know this is because you can take patients with major depressive disorder, with endogenous depression, who are suicidal, who have to be admitted to the hospital to keep themselves from killing themselves, stick them in a scanner, And they are losing subcutaneous fat like crazy because they're not eating, but they're gaining visceral fat because of the high cortisol and the stress.[2:23:54] Andrew Huberman: So there's something about the adrenocorticoid receptors in that area that just preferentially depot fat there when cortisol is high.[2:24:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: Indeed. Because that's the metabolically active fat. Right? And 5 pounds will do it. And then finally, the 3rd fat depot, The liver.[2:24:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now how many pounds of fat can the liver store before you become metabolically ill?[2:24:21] Andrew Huberman: I Gotta be even less because the liver is not nearly as large as the sort of abdominal region.[2:24:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: Half a pound. Quarter of a queue. How much does a healthy liver weigh? Healthy liver weighs 1500 grams. K.[2:24:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: K. So, you know, it's not very[2:24:43] Andrew Huberman: I'm trying to translate quickly the pound. So we're going metric we're going as The standard[2:24:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: So 1500 grams would be £3. So, you know, basically, half a pound. K? So not very much because that's where the action is. And so when you have fat in your liver, it causes metabolic dysfunction right away.[2:25:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the question is where did that fat come from? That came from alcohol or sugar. So alcohol and sugar, most metabolically egregious it affects the liver directly. Stress, 2nd most because it affects the visceral fat. And subcutaneous fat, the least important in terms of metabolic derangement.[2:25:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: So, yes, it may not look good in a bathing suit, But from a metabolic standpoint, it is actually the least important. So the question then becomes, alright, what Are you trying to fix? If you're trying to fix liver fat, it's really easy. Get rid of the alcohol and the sugar, except, of course, they're both addictive.[2:25:49] Andrew Huberman: Will that also liberate any fat that's already in the liver?[2:25:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: Absolutely. And that's one of the reasons why intermittent fasting works is because it gives your liver a chance to Basically, offload what it's already stored. That's one of the things that intermittent fasting will buy you is a little, less liver fat. So that's a good thing. Right?[2:26:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now stress, on the other hand, as you know and as We've talked about and as, you know, you've had, doctor Liz Appel on your, podcast before, you know, stress is tough. You know, trying to mitigate stress, especially in today's environment, and I hope you'll invite me back sometime to talk about The the role of stress on, the amygdala. Yeah. Gladly. Okay.[2:26:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: And then finally, you know, subcutaneous fat. So When people go on diet sweeteners, what are they doing? Are they really reducing the fat? And the answer is no.[2:26:53] Andrew Huberman: Wayne, you're talking about artificial sweeteners.[2:26:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: Artificial diet sweeteners of any You can pick your artificial sweetener. So aspartame or, you know, Sucralose. Sucralose. Stevia. Stevia, monk fruit, the new ones, you know[2:27:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The one that people are more excited about nowadays is allulose. Allulose. Yeah. It's expensive.[2:27:12] Andrew Huberman: It tends to have less of an artificial sweetener taste that people can detect.[2:27:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:27:17] Andrew Huberman: So you're saying that regardless of oh, and we should I'm remembering from the comment section. I do read them. Artificial sweeteners and noncaloric sweeteners.[2:27:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yes.[2:27:29] Andrew Huberman: Because in when the moment you say artificial, people say, what about stevia? What about allulose? So so let's just say, noncaloric sweeteners Mhmm. Can wrap our arms around all that entire category Sure. Unless we need to distinguish among the different participants in that category.[2:27:44] Andrew Huberman: So you're saying that even though people can, lower their total caloric intake pretty effectively, I've seen the studies that show if, you know, Dieters who consume, water only as their, you know, main liquid versus Diet sodas Mhmm. With aspartame typically or stevia, the diet soda drinkers actually lose more weight. We we know that, but you're saying there may be deposition of fat in the liver in those individuals Specifically, because of the artificial sweetener?[2:28:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Because of the insulin. Turns out there's still an insulin response. So fair very famous study done in, Copenhagen, a 100 normal individuals, 25 in 4 different groups. 1 group, 1, 1 liter of sugared soda per day for 6 months.[2:28:38] Andrew Huberman: One liter. That's a lot of sugared soda. Yeah.[2:28:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: One group, 1 liter of diet soda per day for 6 months.[2:28:44] Andrew Huberman: I probably did that in graduate school.[2:28:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: One group, 1 liter of milk per day for 6 months.[2:28:50] Andrew Huberman: I probably did that when I was an infant.[2:28:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: And finally, one final group, 1 liter of water per day for 6 months.[2:28:56] Andrew Huberman: I do that now. I do more than that, but yeah.[2:29:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: The 1 liter of soda per day in 6 months gained 10 kilos.[2:29:05] Andrew Huberman: The sugary soda.[2:29:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: The sugary soda.[2:29:07] Andrew Huberman: Ten kilos.[2:29:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Ten kilos. No surprise. The 1 liter of water per day lost 2 kilos. Also no surprise. Those were the easy ones.[2:29:17] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now let's do the ones in the middle. One liter of milk per day. No change.[2:29:25] Andrew Huberman: Presumably, that was full fat milk. You're talking about full[2:29:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: fat milk. Full fat milk.[2:29:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They like their their[2:29:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: full fat milk. No change. Why is that? They're taking on an enormous increase in total caloric intake.[2:29:39] Andrew Huberman: I'm guessing that there is a Blunted insulin response due to the fat in the milk.[2:29:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: And also because lactose is not a very, big driver of insulin response and because There's a satiety effect.[2:29:53] Andrew Huberman: That's like food. Eat less. Yeah. It's like food.[2:29:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: Like food. And finally, the key, the kicker to the whole thing, Diet soda. The 1 liter of diet soda. What what would you predict their weight would do?[2:30:08] Andrew Huberman: More weight loss been in the water group based on my understanding of the literature.[2:30:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: They gained 2 kilos. Wild. Because they ate more. Well, you tell me. Why did they gain 2 kilos if they were consuming a liter of diet soda, which are 0 calories?[2:30:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: The answer is because they still generated an insulin response.[2:30:29] Andrew Huberman: And that insulin response generated more hunger?[2:30:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: More more weight and more hunger. Exactly. And that's the key. So they didn't gain the 10 kilos. They gained 2 kilos.[2:30:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: So it looks better compared to the sugared, version. But it looks like, you know, a problem compared to the water version or even the milk version.[2:30:51] Andrew Huberman: So unless you bootstrap calories and hold that constant, you're gonna see a weight gain due to artificial sweetening.[2:30:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly right. And that's been shown 50 ways from Sunday in a whole bunch of different studies. So compared to sugar, yeah, it's better, But compared to water, it's way worse, and the reason is the insulin response. You put something sweet on the tongue. Message goes tongue to brain.[2:31:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Sugar's coming. Message goes brain to pancreas through the vagus nerve. Sugar's coming. Release the insulin. And so tongue doesn't know if it's sugar or not.[2:31:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: It releases the ins the pancreas releases the insulin, which drives energy into fat whether it was, you know, from the, diet sweetener or not.[2:31:33] Andrew Huberman: I I saw some really interesting data from Dana Small's group at Yale Yep. Showing that when people have a diet soda with food, So this is like the diet coke with the sandwich or with the burger, maybe even with the pasta. The insulin response from the food And the insulin response from the diet soda are compounded, but there's a classical conditioning effect, Pavlovian effect[2:31:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[2:31:54] Andrew Huberman: Such that then later, if they Just drink the diet soda, they get an even bigger insulin response just to the diet soda than they would have originally if they'd only had the diet soda separate from food. So in other words, the the insulin the food induced insulin response is conditioning a greater insulin response from the diet soda.[2:32:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: And we actually have another study that demonstrates the same thing out of Singapore. Tay et al, in American Journal Clinical Nutrition 2018, I believe, that looked at a similar paradigm. Here's what they did. They took a bunch of people, And they admitted them to their clinical research center 4 times a week apart, and they did them in random order. And each time, They, started the morning, they're fasting, and they did either a sucrose tolerance test Or an aspartame tolerance test or a sucralose tolerance test or a monk fruit tolerance test.[2:32:55] Dr. Robert Lustig: So 2 hours, you know, ingesting 1 of the 3 1 of the 4 and measuring glucose and insulin over the course of the next 2 hours. Fasted. Fasted. Okay. K?[2:33:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: Then it was time for lunch, and they let them have whatever lunch they want. It was a metabolic buffet. They could eat whatever they wanted off the buffet, except that they were being clocked. And the same for dinner. They were being clocked, But they could eat whatever they want In[2:33:25] Andrew Huberman: a given period of time.[2:33:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: In the 24 hours. Okay. And, you know, or, you know, from 7 AM to 7 PM whenever they went home. K. Turns out the sucrose tolerance test generated an insulin response as you'd expect.[2:33:38] Dr. Robert Lustig: The monk fruit, the steep the sucralose and the aspartame did not. But then when they ate lunch. They if they'd had one of the 3 diet sweeteners in the morning, they ate more at lunch and more at dinner and generated an increased insulin response both at lunch and dinner so that the area under the curve for the whole day was exactly the same. So they ate a Significantly more. Yeah.[2:34:09] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Because they had the diet soda in the morning.[2:34:12] Andrew Huberman: Wild. Well, I drink Drinks that contains stevia, and I don't worry about it too much. But what you're saying is even if I Bootstrap my calories. There's a possibility that the insulin response could have direct effects on the liver[2:34:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly right.[2:34:30] Andrew Huberman: And not for the better.[2:34:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: And not for the better. Now having said that, we have undertaken an interesting project, which I don't know if you know about. In 2020, during the pandemic, I was approached by a food company in the Middle East Called Kuwaiti Danish Dairy Company, KDD. It's the Nestle of the Middle East. Now they make all sorts of junk, Frozen yogurt, flavored milks, ice cream, confectionery, biscuits, tomato sauce.[2:35:06] Dr. Robert Lustig: K? Kuwait has an 18% diabetes rate and an 80% obesity rate. 80 80. Wow. In the adults.[2:35:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Alright? Now the company recognized That they wanted to be a metabolically healthy company, and they knew they weren't. They contacted me and said, Would you put together a scientific advisory team to advise us what we need to do to change the food In order to be a metabolically healthy company, and we wanna lead. And I said, we'd be hap I'd be happy to do that with 1 proviso. We get to publish what we did so that it can serve as a road map for the rest of the food industry, and they said fine.[2:35:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: And so I convened a scientific advisory team with my colleague, Wolfram Alderson, who started the very first farmer's market in Los Angeles and is now actually the director Sustainability and nutrition for KDD. Tim Harlin, who is the head of culinary medicine at George Washington University, Rachel Gau, who is a fatty acid expert who ran the, omega 3 for ADD trial at the NIH, and Andreas Kornstadt, who's actually a computer scientist From Stanford. And we basically stripped down every single thing that KDD did In terms of procurement, in terms of ingredients, in terms of packaging, we submitted every single ingredient to biochemical analysis because you couldn't trust What the vendors were basically telling KDD was in the food, we had had to actually know what was in the food, and that was a Half $1,000,000 all by itself. I mean, this was not a cheap little, you know, you know, sojourn into the woods. This was a big deal.[2:37:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: We basically Reengineered their entire 180 item portfolio, and they have now turned over 10% of their products to be metabolically healthy. And the precepts that we set in this Paper, which is in frontiers in nutrition in March of this year 2023. Three things, three principles. If you adhere to these 3 principles, you can turn any food healthy, including ultra processed food. Number 1, protect the liver.[2:37:34] Dr. Robert Lustig: Number 2, feed the gut. Number 3, support the brain. If you have a food that does all 3 of those, it is healthy. If you have a food that does none of those 3, then it's poison because it's not food.[2:37:49] Andrew Huberman: It's I I was gonna say, it doesn't sound like food is the is the right, The right descriptor in that case.[2:37:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. And if it's does 1 or 2 but not all 3, then it's gonna be somewhere in between. So the goal was to take all of KDD's products and move them From, you know, the lowest tier up to the highest tier by adhering to these 3 principles, And we came up with some very simple things. Number 1, gotta get rid of the sugar. Number 2, gotta add fiber.[2:38:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: Number 3, gotta add omega threes. Number 4, gotta do something about the emulsifiers Because the emulsifiers are causing the gut inflammation. Because after all, emulsifiers are detergents. They hold fat and water together. They burn a hole in the mucin layer.[2:38:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: So they're actually contributing to that gut inflammation, and emulsifiers are, you know, strewn throughout ultra processed fooddom.[2:38:42] Andrew Huberman: We've heard about hidden sugars a lot, during today's episode and elsewhere, but based on everything you told us of About artificial excuse me, low calorie sweeteners. Yep. It makes more sense to me now why foods that are not touted as diet foods would be laced with things like sucralose because it should drive the craving for that food through increases in insulin and craving of other foods Later that day and later that evening. Is that why noncaloric sweeteners are added to all sorts of foods now? That Because, typically, one thing's non caloric sweeteners probably only added to, quote, unquote, diet foods, low calorie foods, but that's not[2:39:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's their own You're right. It's that that's not the case, and they are Adding diets, diet sweeteners to foods that you didn't know had diet sweeteners in them. That's right. There are two reasons that this happens. One is insulin because insulin blocks leptin signaling at the level of the hypothalamus and the nucleus accumbens.[2:39:43] Dr. Robert Lustig: So if it blocks leptin leptin is the hormone that your fat cells make that tells your brain you've had enough. So if insulin blocks leptin, It makes you hungrier, and it also extinguishes it it stops the extinguishing of reward by that food so that you want more of it. So it does both because leptin normally suppresses food intake and reduces craving.[2:40:08] Andrew Huberman: The analogy that comes to mind is, a slot machine that encourages you to feed more money and hit go to pull the lever, But that also blinds you to the outcome. So even if you win, you don't even know that you have wins. It's also blinding you to your losses. You're effectively becoming a a Tomatan Yeah. Of just eating without any kind of conscious understanding of what you're You're bringing in or tasting the food any longer.[2:40:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly.[2:40:36] Andrew Huberman: Right? It's not this, like in Anna Lemke, when she came on the podcast, author of Dopamine Nation and, obviously, head of our dual diagnosis addiction clinic at Stanford[2:40:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: went well.[2:40:44] Andrew Huberman: Talked about, you know, these these, consumptive behaviors where People are scrolling social media or consuming porn or, consuming drugs or alcohol in a way that, like, they're not in touch with the pleasure of the of the substance or behavior anymore.[2:40:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:41:00] Andrew Huberman: They become automatons. But they've but if they don't do it, they feel lousy. So the pleasure is gone. The pain is definitely awaiting.[2:41:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: Tolerance and dependence, that's the definition of addiction. So dopamine It's an excitatory neurotransmitter. It excites the next neuron always. There is no such thing as dopamine inhibiting a postsynaptic neuron. Dopamine stimulates the next neuron, and it doesn't matter which dopamine receptor it is, 1 through 5.[2:41:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's always excitatory. Now neurons like to be excited. That's why they have receptors. But neurons like to be tickled, not bludgeoned. Chronic over Stimulation of any neuron, and you know this, leads to neuronal cell death.[2:41:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the reason is because the neuron needs energy. The neuron is the most energy dependent, tissue in the body. It needs those mitochondria to be pumping out ATP like crazy to engage in neurotransmission. Well, When you're firing nonstop, you risk cell death. So the Excitatory neuron, the the postsynaptic neuron has a plan b.[2:42:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: It down regulates the receptor. It down regulates the dopamine receptor, So there's less chance that any stray dopamine molecule will find a receptor to bind to, and this is its plan b in order to try to mitigate The risk of dying. Well, what does that mean in human terms? It means you get a hit, you get a rush, Receptors go down. Next time you need a bigger hit to get the same rush, receptors go down.[2:42:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: And you need a bigger hit and a bigger hit and a bigger hit until finally you need a huge hit to get nothing. That's called tolerance. And then when the neurons do start to die, that's called addiction. That's what we've got, And that's what's happened in terms of food addiction. So the question is, what's addictive?[2:43:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: Is fat addictive? No. Because if fat was addictive, then all the people on the Atkins diet or on the ketogenic diet would be gaining weight, not losing it.[2:43:12] Andrew Huberman: And I'd be craving rib eyes all day. I like a rib eye pretty often, actually, but I know I know. People say no. But, hey, look. My lipids are in In line, and I I don't eat many starches, and I certainly avoid sugar.[2:43:23] Andrew Huberman: Right. Although now I'm thinking I might wanna really reduce my, low calorie sweetener intake. Don't see myself reducing my stevia intake to 0 because it's in some things I really like. Andrew, I am not[2:43:35] Dr. Robert Lustig: the food police. You know?[2:43:37] Andrew Huberman: I I always say that to you. I'm not a cop. But the, but but but data are data and and and health data are The the the[2:43:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: data say that and that's not helping you any. That's what the data say. Mhmm. Point is that the fat's not the problem. The salt's not the problem.[2:43:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: The caffeine's a problem. Really? Caffeine's classic, Addictive substance at every level.[2:44:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But And the sugar's a problem. But if if one can cut out caffeine by the early afternoon or even sooner in the day, And it's not consumed to excess, and it's in the form of coffee, yerba mate, some other form that's healthy. You know? Is it really that much of a problem?[2:44:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: I love coffee in your mouth. That's my addiction. Like, with[2:44:26] Andrew Huberman: a capital l, underline bold face.[2:44:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: I I I I I feel your pain. And the answer is no one has shown that coffee is toxic. It is addictive, but it's not toxic. Now if you mix the coffee with alcohol, now you got Four Loko. Now it's toxic.[2:44:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: But in and of itself, caffeine is not, toxic. And that's why there's a Starbucks on every street corner.[2:44:51] Andrew Huberman: But it is highly reinforcing. I did an episode on caffeine where, it covered some data that was Publishing the journal Science, one of the 3 Apex journals, and if you put caffeine, unbeknownst to the consumer, into plain yogurt. Mhmm. People will crave plain yogurt indeed much more. I mean, people like the feeling of being caffeinated as long as it's not creating anxiety levels of of energy.[2:45:14] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. I'm gonna stick with caffeine.[2:45:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's fine. Yeah. And so will I.[2:45:18] Andrew Huberman: We've been talking about a little bit about the hypothalamus as well as some peripheral gut based Mechanisms for hunger and satiety. Right. This is a great opportunity to talk about some of the GLP one agonists that are now Widely used. So thing typically call those empic, but GLP one, glucagon like peptide 1. Right.[2:45:39] Andrew Huberman: Originally discovered in the Gila monster, which eats very seldom and some really smart biologist. I love biology like this. Said, how come they don't have to eat very much? Well, they their Blood is loaded with GLP one.[2:45:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:45:50] Andrew Huberman: And so they only have to eat 1 whatever gila monsters, Delight in per year or something outrageous like that. Humans make GLP one as well. My understanding is that GLP one that that not that's injected, but that one, makes naturally is acting on both the brain and the gut to increase satiety.[2:46:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: So it is acting on the brain, no argument, but the primary action is on the gut. GLP one decreases the rate of gastric emptying. That is its primary driver. Yes. It does affect the brain.[2:46:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: I'm not arguing that it does, but the primary effect is to reduce the rate of gastric emptying. So you stay fuller longer because the food doesn't move through the stomach and the intestine.[2:46:43] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. In South America, in Uruguay and Argentina, it was long thought that Yerba mate consumption, which we know very modestly increases GLP one. Like and by the way, a lot of other things do too. That people were taking it for its, after meals for its laxative effect, partially, but that's you know, it's not pleasant for But that's[2:47:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: but that's also at Colon. That's at the level of the colon, but rather than stomach.[2:47:07] Andrew Huberman: But it is used fairly effectively for people to space their meals without snacking That you're you know? And maybe it's the GLP one. Maybe it's something else.[2:47:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah.[2:47:15] Andrew Huberman: But people are injecting themselves with GLP one analogs now.[2:47:19] Dr. Robert Lustig: I can assume dollars a month. Yeah.[2:47:21] Andrew Huberman: Is that what it costs?[2:47:22] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's what it costs[2:47:23] Andrew Huberman: right now. And it seems to be pretty effective at Inducing weight loss, although a significant amount of that weight loss seems to be from, skeletal muscle tissue.[2:47:31] Dr. Robert Lustig: And we're gonna we need to talk about that.[2:47:33] Andrew Huberman: So what are your thoughts on Ozempic as a as a primary? Earlier, you talked about primary and secondary control. I you refer to it a little bit differently in the context of statins. Right. So a kid comes in who's obese or slightly overweight[2:47:45] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:47:46] Andrew Huberman: And it's like,[2:47:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: I don't[2:47:47] Andrew Huberman: know what to do. I'm trying to eat better exercise or a person comes in and says, hey. I've I've had a really hard time getting that last £29 off for so many years. Yep.[2:47:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: Will you prescribe me Ozempic? So the short answer is number 1, I'm retired, so I'm not prescribing anything, But let's let's let's go with there. The data show that GLP one analogs like, semaglutide And now Tirzepatide, which is, Lilly's version. Manjaro is the diabetes version. Zepbound is the Obesity version in the same way that Ozempic is the diabetes version for, Novo Nordisk, and Wegovy is the obesity version.[2:48:28] Dr. Robert Lustig: So[2:48:28] Andrew Huberman: But they're all GLP one animals.[2:48:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're all g p GLP one animals.[2:48:31] Andrew Huberman: Synthesized in a lab. It looks like GLP one. Smells like GLP one. Acts like GLP one when injected.[2:48:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Tirzepatide, the, lily one actually has a dual function. It, binds to the GIP Receptor. So it might have double duty, and the data show that it's actually even slightly more effective at weight loss than the Novo Nordisk version, so we'll be seeing a shift in terms of consumer preference soon. No doubt. But here's the thing.[2:49:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: You look at the data, 1 year, of treatment, 16% weight loss. Now that sounds great. And I'm not saying it's bad.[2:49:12] Andrew Huberman: It's good. People are not craving food all the time. Is that because people are Feeling full longer. Right. So they're eating less.[2:49:20] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're eating less. This is the[2:49:21] Andrew Huberman: calorie in, calorie out model.[2:49:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're eating less. Mhmm. And so they are losing weight. I'm I'm not arguing that.[2:49:27] Andrew Huberman: And they might be craving alcohol less according to some recent reports.[2:49:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Well, we we can go there for a minute too in a second. Here's the problem. When you look at that 16% weight loss, as you just said, when you put people in a DEXA scanner, they have lost Equal amounts of fat and muscle. Now is it good to lose muscle?[2:49:49] Dr. Robert Lustig: No. It is not good. Ask any little old lady who breaks her hip if she wishes she had a little bit more muscle.[2:49:54] Andrew Huberman: Or somebody who dieted lost a lot of muscle because they weren't offsetting the weight loss with resistance training or some other form of exercise. And the amount of food that they can eat in order to maintain that weight, to put it in scientific terms, sucks.[2:50:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: And, you know, we mentioned Peter Attia earlier. Okay? In Outlive, he's made it very clear that sarcopenia, lack of muscle mass, is one of the drivers of mortality. So losing muscle is not A a good idea, but you lose equal amounts of fat and muscle. What else causes loss of equal amounts of fat and muscle?[2:50:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: Starvation. In fact, the reason that all these GLP one analogs work is because you stop eating.[2:50:39] Andrew Huberman: Like the hill monsters? Yeah.[2:50:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: Just like the gila monster.[2:50:42] Andrew Huberman: The gila monsters look pretty chubby to me.[2:50:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, ask another gila monster.[2:50:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I did. But, unfortunately, whatever answer it Provided was not interpreted.[2:50:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: The point is that starvation is not so good. And if you Think about why it's working. It's reducing gastric the rate of gastric emptying. Alright? Well, it turns out That that's the reason for its side effects, the reduction in gastric emptying.[2:51:10] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's why you get nausea. That's why you get vomiting. That's why you get pancreatitis and, most importantly now, gastroparesis. Your stomach turns to stone. And you can't move any food through your intestine at all.[2:51:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: And worse yet, When you stop the medicine, the gastroparesis doesn't get better. This is not a good idea.[2:51:38] Andrew Huberman: This is like the opposite of the Yerba Mate induced effect, which has a sort of prolapse of gastric emptying, maybe GLP one agonism. Gosh. Okay. So It's obvious why people who've struggled to lose weight like it. Yeah.[2:51:51] Andrew Huberman: Especially if their struggle to lose weight was, at least in their mind, the consequence of being hungry all the time and needing to[2:51:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: eat more. Or was it because of the reward and, you know, their dependence? Mhmm. Because in fact, yes, these GLP one analogs reduce reward, and that's one of the reasons why they've noticed that, you know, thing, reduction in alcohol consumption, as well, and that sounds like a good thing except There are also numerous cases now of major depressive disorder in response to these drugs.[2:52:28] Andrew Huberman: It's almost like or something for the treatment of addiction, which which sometimes can be useful, but now but the attempting to remove the The, the amplitude of that reward signal I mean, on paper, it makes sense, but the but it doesn't always play out.[2:52:43] Dr. Robert Lustig: Practice, it doesn't play out. That's right. And so I'm gonna Refer you now to an old, literature that, was from 2006. There was a drug that was approved in Europe called rimonobant. K?[2:53:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: A trade name, Accomplia. And it was approved in, Europe for weight loss, and it was pretty good at weight loss. It caused about 20% weight loss. It also caused severe depression and 21 suicides.[2:53:14] Andrew Huberman: So it's no longer available?[2:53:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Because It was the end yeah. It was pulled from the European market, never approved in the United States. And the reason this happened was because this was the anti marijuana drug. This was the anti munchies drug. This was an endocannabinoid antagonist.[2:53:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, when you reduce reward, You also reduce your desire to live, and that's why this concern about reduction in alcohol consumption, We've already seen major depressive disorder in patients receiving Ozempic. So are we gonna see the same thing play Play out as we did for romanobant. I'm worried about it.[2:53:53] Andrew Huberman: Or Fen[2:53:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: Phen. Well, Fen Phen didn't have, No. It's cardiac. It was cardiac. Yeah.[2:53:59] Dr. Robert Lustig: We had cardiac problems, due to the Fenfluramine, because of the serotonin one b Receptor, agonism.[2:54:06] Andrew Huberman: Right. I'm just referring to the fact that these these quote, unquote blockbuster drugs for obesity, they tend to follow a contour of, You know, very promising, very exciting. A lot of people losing weight. Suicides are very promising. A lot of people losing weight.[2:54:21] Andrew Huberman: Cardiac issues, very promising losing weight, and now you're saying the stomach turns to stone. Sound it sounds so biblical.[2:54:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, indeed. So that's the question. And then finally, we can really talk biblical. If everyone in America who qualified for Ozempic got it, That would be 2,100,000,000,000 to the health care system, which is currently at 4,100,000,000,000. So that'd be a greater than 50% increase in health care costs, k, at 1300 a month.[2:54:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: Conversely, if we just got Sugar consumption down to USDA guidelines by basically, you know, putting some limits on how much Added sugar, the food industry can put into any given product like Froot Loops. We could reduce Weight by 29% and save $3,000,000,000,000. So we'd get better weight loss And we'd save $5,100,000,000,000, which makes more sense to the US government.[2:55:28] Andrew Huberman: Well, earlier, you were alluding to government, big food, big pharma relationships. I mean, there's a huge win here for whoever's manufacturing these, GLP one analogs. Indeed. But the question is who's paying the tab?[2:55:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, we are. Now the question is why can't the government see that? The answer is because the government's on the dole too, because the government, through tariffs on US made foods, k. Gross is, $56,000,000,000 a year. So they're a player.[2:56:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're not just a regulator. They're an actor.[2:56:08] Andrew Huberman: To play devil devil's advocate a little bit. Listen. I'm gonna be the last person who'd step in and try and defend government as a as a unified body. I'm not qualified to do that, but you could see how it if you looked at it like checkers instead of chess, you'd say, okay. Here's a drug that's going to allow Many millions of people to reduce their overall body weight.[2:56:29] Andrew Huberman: Overall body weight is a risk factor for a number of things, and there will be savings on the back end as a consequence of that weight loss. I mean, so that's the checkers version.[2:56:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: Right.[2:56:39] Andrew Huberman: The chess version is how you're describing it, and I think that, I mean, clearly people in government are are well, most, some Perhaps are smart enough to play chess, not checkers, or to at least understand it, but there's very little incentive for the chess model. So, what would Quote, unquote solve this problem is the same thing that happened to fen phen or this rom romantic which is if Suddenly, there's a major issue with the drug, then everyone stops taking it. And, traditionally, that's how it's gone. It sounds like these GLP one analogs are gonna make it through the chute, Though[2:57:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: yeah. I mean, there is a very clear downside to these medicines. On the other hand, You know, there's an upside. And so I'm not sad that these medicines exist. I'm for them.[2:57:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: I'm not against them. I'm for them for the right patient. Mhmm. And right now, it's not the right patient who's getting them[2:57:37] Andrew Huberman: just like the statins. So what if somebody who's taking, one of these analogs Makes it a point to do resistance training. And here, you know, you mentioned bodybuilders early. I'm not I'm not suggesting they become bodybuilders, but we now know. And I think Peter, Atia, and others would agree that Everybody should be doing some form of muscle loss offsetting resistance exercise.[2:57:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: Agreed.[2:57:56] Andrew Huberman: At least past, you know, their reaching their adult height or something. You know? Know there are those that say weight training doesn't blunt your height. But, anyway, let's just say that from Hit your own early twenties onward, just something[2:58:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Especially if you're on these medicines. Right. In order to maintain muscle mass.[2:58:12] Andrew Huberman: Right. So that's a different picture. Right? People are drinking less alcohol. Again, I'm playing devil's advocate here.[2:58:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[2:58:19] Andrew Huberman: So if we look at these These compounds not in a vacuum, but okay. The person who's been carrying that extra 30 pounds is now only carrying a few extra Pounds of adipose tissue. They've lost a lot of muscle, but now they feel well enough to exercise.[2:58:33] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[2:58:34] Andrew Huberman: The depression part worries me. Yeah. But, anyway, I'm just I'm just trying to round the contour of it. What we've seen[2:58:40] Dr. Robert Lustig: in children, because that's who I took care, Was that often they needed a jump start. Mhmm. K? And there were different ways to get them to jump start. Stomach stapling.[2:58:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, that's not jump start. That's[2:58:53] Andrew Huberman: But that was what a lot of people did. I know I have a friend. He's he was and sadly still is really big. And he always talked about the stomach saving, like, if I could just get[2:59:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[2:59:03] Andrew Huberman: 50 pounds down quickly, then I could Exercise, but exercise is painful, this kind of thing. And and sadly, he's he's continued to maintain or creep up in in a very excessive weight.[2:59:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: And that's the point Is you know, that this concept of jump start actually if you're only doing it yourself, doesn't really work. And the question is, why is his weight Creeping up if he's had the stomach stapling. The answer is because he's a sugar addict.[2:59:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. He's definitely addicted to the super big gulp Soda and You if you drink your calories, it doesn't really matter, does it? No. And and he's got such terrible psoriasis and joint pain and all this that The prospect of exercising is like a it you you might as well tell him to to, like, flap his wings and go to Mars.[2:59:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: You know, fructose is a driver of immune dysfunction. If he got off, You can tell him from me, if he got off the sugar, his psoriasis would get better, his weight would get better, his arthritis would get better, and he could have then That jump start.[3:00:02] Andrew Huberman: This is a perfect example to bridge to the brain component of all this because I've long wondered based on What I understand about neurocircuitry and neuroplasticity, I know we share in this knowledge that at some point, carrying a lot of adipose tissue means that the brain sort of represents the body differently. I mean, we know there are these these somatotopic maps of self, You know? But that the neural machinery in the hypothalamus, sure, which is responsible for motivated states[3:00:30] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[3:00:30] Andrew Huberman: Etcetera, but but also just the entire mapping of The self Yep. Changes. In other words, if one is fat long enough[3:00:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[3:00:40] Andrew Huberman: That It becomes increasingly hard to get to a a healthy weight because of the way that the neural is impacted. It basically remaps to maintain that that, fat person. Not necessarily even just at the level of appetite, But just in terms of what do you what do big animals do? I had a bulldog that weighed 90 pounds, bulldog mastiff. He was very economical with his movement.[3:01:04] Andrew Huberman: Right. He's extremely powerful. He could run at least in when he was younger, but if he could be still, he was still as opposed to Yeah. Certain smaller animals that are, like, peripatetic. Right?[3:01:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: Because because he was leptin resistant. So leptin, as we talked about briefly, is, the hormone that tells your brain you've had enough. If you are leptin sensitive, You are happy to burn. If you are leptin resistant, your brain thinks you're starving. And if your brain thinks you're starving, it's going to affect Your behavior in 2 ways.[3:01:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: It's gonna make you wanna eat, and it's also gonna make you wanna conserve because the goal is to try to Increase the leptin levels in order to overcome that resistance, which, of course, you can never do because all you're gonna do is lay down more fat and make more leptin.[3:01:51] Andrew Huberman: That makes so much sense because leptin comes from the adipose tissue.[3:01:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. So that leptin resistance is what you have to be able to break through. You have to fix the leptin sensitivity. Well, what's the driver of the leptin resistance? Insulin.[3:02:08] Dr. Robert Lustig: Insulin inhibits leptin signaling, And it does it at 3 separate places in the pomcine neuron, the proopiomelanocortin neuron in the hypothalamus. It does it at, IRS 2, insulin receptor substrate 2, it does it at SOX 3, suppressor cytokine signaling 3, and it does it at PIP 3 phosphatidylinositol triphosphate. Those 3 separate arms of the, leptin receptor are all basically put to sleep by high insulin. Insulin blocks leptin signaling. So the higher the insulin goes, the more your brain thinks you're starving.[3:02:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the more your brain thinks you're starving, the hungrier you get and the less you wanna move. So the gluttony and sloth that we've been talking about all All, you know, podcast is really biochemical. It is secondary to this phenomenon of insulin blocking leptin signaling. You gotta fix that first. Get the insulin down any way you can.[3:03:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: And the best way, Get rid of the refined carbohydrate and sugar. That's where you start.[3:03:24] Andrew Huberman: It makes so much sense.[3:03:26] Dr. Robert Lustig: It works too. How about that? That's always good.[3:03:29] Andrew Huberman: It is. I once heard you say I think it was in a conversation with Peter Attia on his podcast, and this really stuck in my mind that when a person consumes Glucose that it activates a number of different brain sites. You know? Neurons loving glucose.[3:03:48] Dr. Robert Lustig: Mhmm.[3:03:49] Andrew Huberman: But that when one Ingest fructose that it preferentially activates neurons in the reward pathway[3:03:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: That's right.[3:03:57] Andrew Huberman: At maybe 7 times the The magnitude or or something like that?[3:04:02] Dr. Robert Lustig: Glucose activates the basal ganglia. This is work from Wollnerhausen in, Switzerland and also Eric Stice at[3:04:10] Andrew Huberman: movement and planning and execution.[3:04:13] Dr. Robert Lustig: Exactly. Okay. Fructose Basically stimulates the nucleus accumbens, the reward center. It is just like heroin, just like cocaine, just like, nicotine. It activates the reward center.[3:04:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: It doesn't do anything for the basal ganglia. So it is addictive. Anything that stimulates the reward center in the extreme is addictive. So we have chemical addictions, heroin, cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, Sugar, we have behavioral addictions, shopping, gambling, Internet gaming, social media, pornography. Doesn't matter.[3:04:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: They all Stimulate dopamine in the reward center, and in the extreme, they are all addictive. So the question is, If you were addicted, is that personal responsibility?[3:05:01] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's, a very It's a question I think about a lot because, I know a lot of people in the addiction recovery community, both from the treatment and in the addicting.[3:05:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yep.[3:05:16] Andrew Huberman: And this always comes down to this question when somebody is suffering from an addiction of any kind and they're resistant to getting treatment. If you look at it them as a as being sick, at least in that moment, is a sick person in the Best or worst or at least diminished position to guide their own treatment. So for instance, somebody with dementia, would you ask them, do you wanna go see a neurologist? You might ask them that, but are they the best person to make that decision?[3:05:44] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, this is the problem. So the this is this is where personal responsibility falls down. So personal responsibility as we you know, we talked about 4 criteria have to be met. None of them are met. That's the first issue.[3:05:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: Second 1 is a little bit, shall we say, cheekier. Who invented personal responsibility? Any idea? I'm definitely[3:06:05] Andrew Huberman: gonna get this this one wrong.[3:06:07] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. You're gonna get this one wrong. Are you ready?[3:06:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I don't know. The tobacco industry. The notion of personal responsibility.[3:06:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: They invented it. There was no personal responsibility until tobacco in 1962 because they were getting killed on the science, and they needed to invent another reason for you to smoke. In fact, There's a paper that came out, Dorfman et al, that looked at the New York Times and the Washington Post, and they did a The entire lit search of the entire of, you know, the all the output of those 2 newspapers For decades, to look for the term personal responsibility, and the very first time it was ever mentioned was 1962, And it didn't pick up in speed until 1986, which was the same year as Cipollone v Liggett, in this at the Supreme Court, which basically said that the, you know, that, the cigarette industry was, was guilty of, of, applying people with an addictive substance. So this is very specifically Industry driven, and we have the data to prove it. Amazing.[3:07:25] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, I wonder[3:07:29] Andrew Huberman: Along the lines of personal responsibility. Given that many listeners to this conversation are going to be thinking about their own Food intake and food choices and that of their children and other relatives. Now we could play a little a little, not a game, but a little Rapid ish fire q and a. Never done this before in this podcast, but I think it's particularly appropriate for a discussion like this that Weeks out into so many areas, and I absolutely will invite you back and and perhaps a lot[3:07:57] Dr. Robert Lustig: of pleasure. Pleasure.[3:07:58] Andrew Huberman: Melissa Eppold to talk about some of the exciting work you guys are doing because there's so much we could cover. But People are going to wonder in a very practical sense whether or not they should or should not be consuming certain things, and I know you're not the food police.[3:08:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: I'm not the pho poos.[3:08:12] Andrew Huberman: And I'm not a cop, and I do believe people should are should be in choice about these matters. But I also believe that Because you're a guest on the podcast and you're highly informed and and have done clinical work and research for so many years in this area, And you have such a clear stance on the role of big food, and and we really, really appreciate your your honesty and directness. But now you'd be willing to provide a comment about a couple of different terms that I'll throw out. And if you choose to say really nothing to say about that, fine. That would be a quick pass.[3:08:43] Andrew Huberman: So Okay. Here we go. And we covered a little bit of this earlier, but, fruit in whole form. So has fructose, but has fiber. So, thumbs up, thumb sideways, or thumbs down for fruit consumption.[3:08:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: Fruit is fine. Fruit juice is not.[3:09:01] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you. White rice versus brown rice. And among the white rices, the sticky rice, and the rices with added sugars, which you find in a lot of, in a lot of restaurants.[3:09:14] Dr. Robert Lustig: Brown rice because of the fiber. White rice, polished, You know, number 1, all the vitamin b one gone, and, of course, a much larger glucose excursion. That glycemic index Thing which, of course, I hate is it's glycemic load that matters, and that is a very high glycemic load, so brown rice.[3:09:35] Andrew Huberman: So brown rice is better than white rice? Yes. Okay. In a meaningful way?[3:09:39] Dr. Robert Lustig: In a meaningful way.[3:09:41] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Earlier you mentioned tomato sauce. I love tomato sauce That's made from just tomatoes. Canned so is are most tomato sauces filled with sugar?[3:09:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Perfect. Our little, recommendation engine looked at this question, and it turns out that only 10% of the available tomato sauces out on the market Don't have added sugar. So you have to know which ones where you can look yourself or you can look up perfect, and it will tell you which ones you can buy.[3:10:12] Andrew Huberman: If people chose to consume bread, which many people do, is there a way to just Across the board without just baking your own or see or looking at the ingredients list to make a better choice, is it like sourdoughs tend to have less sugar than blank?[3:10:29] Dr. Robert Lustig: Well, sourdough has been fermented, so it will have actually consumed some of the sugar. So it would be a better choice. But, really, the best choice is the highest fiber breads. Now if you look at a wheat berry, It is 25% of fiber. The husk is 25% of the weight of that wheat berry.[3:10:50] Dr. Robert Lustig: That means that the carbohydrate To fiber ratio of a wheat berry is 3 to 1. So a good bread Should have a carbohydrate to fiber ratio of somewhere between 3 to 1 to 5 to 1 tops. Anything above that means that they've Strip the fiber away. So that's something you could do, but the easier way is to actually look it up on perfect.[3:11:16] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned meat and meat sourcing, egg and chicken sourcing earlier. Maybe we just revisit that. Meat, fish, and eggs, thumbs up, thumb sideways, thumbs down, or it depends?[3:11:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: It depends. It depends on where the meat came from. It depends on whether it was pasture raised. Depends on whether it's organic or not. If they, animal was injected with antibiotics, stay away from it because those antibiotics are in the meat.[3:11:42] Dr. Robert Lustig: They're gonna basically sterilize your gut and then the bad bacteria are gonna take over. We haven't really talked much about the microbiome today, But that's a whole podcast all by itself.[3:11:53] Andrew Huberman: We can touch on it a little bit more, from low sugar fermented foods, thumbs up, thumb sideways, thumbs up. Foods?[3:12:00] Dr. Robert Lustig: Short chain fatty acids, all good.[3:12:03] Andrew Huberman: What are your favorite sources of fermented food?[3:12:05] Dr. Robert Lustig: I like kimchi.[3:12:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I like him, Chito. I like some of the live sauerkrauts.[3:12:11] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. That's also good, but with the right, you know, with the right, accoutrement. The one thing I would be, careful about is yogurt. K? So there are yogurts with live cultures, there are a whole lot of yogurts with dead cultures.[3:12:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: And if it's a yogurt with dead cultures, it's kind of irrelevant, and the chances are They've actually covered up the sourness with sugar. So, you know, large commercially available yogurt, Be very, very careful. Okay? If it's, you know, artisan yogurt, you know, made by, you know, people you know or trust, You know, that's a very different story. You know, yogurts with live cultures.[3:12:54] Andrew Huberman: Intermittent fasting, do you practice it, and what do you think about it?[3:12:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: I don't practice it, but I am for it, for the right patient. Turns out who's the right patient? The patient with liver fat Because the reason it works is because it gives the liver a chance to basically burn off the fat that it's stored.[3:13:13] Andrew Huberman: Zero calorie soda. Got it. It's definite no. And I don't even have to ask about sugary soda because that's that's[3:13:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: That that's Basically, just poison in a can.[3:13:25] Andrew Huberman: Food combinations. I have a feeling I know what your answer is, but the glycemic index, which we know your feelings on now, asserts that if you combine some fat with a sugary like like eating ice cream, you have a more blunted insulin response than if you were to eat pure sugar of equivalent calories. But, what what are your thoughts on food combinations as a way to blunt the insulin response?[3:13:47] Dr. Robert Lustig: Food combinations are great if there's some fiber associated with it.[3:13:52] Andrew Huberman: It comes back to fiber again.[3:13:53] Dr. Robert Lustig: And by the way and by the way, I you know, full disclosure, I am the chief medical officer of a fiber company. What is it? It is called BioLumen, and it is a proprietary fiber. It is a microcellulose Sponge, 7 microns in diameter, so the size of a red blood cell. You swallow it.[3:14:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: It goes to your stomach. It expands 70 fold over its original size, and so it'll give you a feeling of fullness because it's taking up space in the stomach. But more importantly, when it expands, the nooks and the crannies in the sponge become available. And embedded in those nooks and crannies are a set of proprietary hydrogels, soluble fiber, which sequester glucose, fructose, sucrose, simple starches, and render them unavailable for early absorption in the duodenum, thus reducing the glucose response, reducing the insulin response, protecting the liver, and moving it through the intestine so that microbiome can chew it up for its own purposes, feeding the gut. We can reduce glucose absorption by 36%, fructose absorption by 38%, sucrose absorption by 40%, Simple starch absorption by 9% and increase short chain fatty acid production by 60% without an increase and guess.[3:15:19] Andrew Huberman: When do people take this?[3:15:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: With meals. Okay. So it it comes as a sachet. 1 teaspoon, sprinkle it on your food or take it as a you know, in a drink. You know, just mix it in and slug it down, and then eat Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it will basically act like you ate real food.[3:15:43] Dr. Robert Lustig: It will turn processed food into real food in the intestine, and we have clinical trial data that demonstrates that.[3:15:51] Andrew Huberman: Is it available as a commercial[3:15:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: product? It is available. It is called Munch Munch. Now I hate that name. I didn't make it up.[3:15:57] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm gonna[3:15:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: need to you need to market get it.[3:16:00] Andrew Huberman: Your marketing team sucks, but the product sounds amazing.[3:16:03] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. So BioLumen dot tech.[3:16:05] Andrew Huberman: Great. Thank you for that. Sorry, Munch Munch marketing team, but you gotta munch munch to a new product name. But it sounds like a a very interesting product, and it Actually answered my next question which was about fiber supplements.[3:16:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: Fiber is good, but there are 2 kinds of fiber. There's soluble and there's insoluble. They are not the same. So soluble is what goes into fiber one bars, you know, the psyllium, inulin, pectin, like, what holds jelly together, that's good. I'm not saying it's bad, but you need the insoluble fiber, the cellulose, the stringy stuff in celery, the cardboard, if you will.[3:16:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Together, they form this gel that we talked about earlier. If you only consume the soluble fiber, which is what the food industry will add to to food because the insoluble fiber is not miscible. If you only add the soluble fiber back, you're not getting the benefits of the entire fiber complement.[3:17:10] Andrew Huberman: Earlier when talking about the NOVA system and, how Most all of our foods are 9 let's say, I know it's 7 to 10%. Let's say 95%. Let's say on the side of better. 95% of our food should come from NOVA system class 1 or class 2 foods. Or 3.[3:17:27] Andrew Huberman: Or 3. Okay. Staying away from those, NOVA class 4 foods. Could you give us some examples of NOVA class 1 and class 2 foods? Just broad broadly speaking.[3:17:37] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay. NOVA class 1 is any food Without a label, period. If you see a label on a food, it's a warning label.[3:17:46] Andrew Huberman: Well, there's ground ground beef has a label. Okay. So that's Well Does it so you're talking about apple. Well, when I buy it, it has a label. I'm asking this because people are gonna wonder.[3:17:56] Andrew Huberman: So Well,[3:17:56] Dr. Robert Lustig: it does have a nutrition facts label. Is there a nutrition facts label on a thing of ground beef?[3:18:01] Andrew Huberman: I buy that's that, ground beef where I consume venison, Where if you flip it over, it says how many calories, how many protein. So there's a label. But but it's just b for venison.[3:18:12] Dr. Robert Lustig: Okay. Okay. Then that's class 1. Okay. Egg?[3:18:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: Egg is class 1.[3:18:17] Andrew Huberman: So and then, of course, fruit, apples, orange. Okay. So it doesn't matter if it has a has a name a name tag as long as it It doesn't have an in[3:18:24] Dr. Robert Lustig: an agreement with label. Got it. Real food does not need a label. It's only if they did something to it that it needs a label. So you have to look at every label as a warning label.[3:18:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: Now the problem with the label is it only tells you what's in the food. What you really need to know is what's been done to the food because it's the ultra processed food that's the problem. They don't wanna tell you that. That's secret. Secret from a proprietary standpoint, but also secret because if you knew what they did to it, you wouldn't eat it.[3:18:54] Dr. Robert Lustig: You would never buy it. And they don't want you to know. So they only tell you what's in the food. That's not what's important. It's what's been done to the food that's important.[3:19:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: And that's why This noble class 4 is so important, and that's why perfect is so important because it'll do the work for you.[3:19:11] Andrew Huberman: Great. We'll definitely, provide links to all of these. So if you could pick one thing to recommend to people that want to improve their health.[3:19:23] Dr. Robert Lustig: Get rid of the sugar. K. Period. Very clear. That's number 1.[3:19:27] Dr. Robert Lustig: Number 2, go for a walk.[3:19:30] Andrew Huberman: That's the exercise piece.[3:19:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: Yeah. Go for a walk.[3:19:33] Andrew Huberman: And if you could recommend one thing that the general public can do to try and Assist in this advocacy for not redefining, but actually clearly defining what is food and what isn't and making people aware, at the level of policy and change and school lunches, I mean, if there were one thing, what can we do? I mean, I I you've clearly activated my neurons surrounding, Like, the the the set of problems that exist and the the the paths to correct them, but should we be writing to our congresspeople? Should we be, Getting angry at hospitals because they've got all these fast food machines and that the cafeteria food is like is like is like illness promoting.[3:20:15] Dr. Robert Lustig: At UCSF, we've gotten rid of all sugar beverages. We have the healthy beverage initiative. So No coke machines at UCSF? Coke machines at UCSF. Wow.[3:20:23] Andrew Huberman: Stanford. Check that out because, you know, people always send me pictures of the the Coke machines in the school of medicine, I'm like, listen. I didn't put them there, but I I I, We[3:20:32] Dr. Robert Lustig: have to model for the public, You know? I mean, where where was the 1st place the smoking was banned? Hospitals. K? Because we knew.[3:20:41] Dr. Robert Lustig: So if you get rid of the, You know, soda, if you get rid of the sugared soda at the hospital, you're telling people something. So, yeah, I think that every hospital And, really, every public venue in America needs to clear out the junk.[3:21:00] Andrew Huberman: So post photos of Junk that are supposed to be in, in health promoting institutions, and, I guess, we're trying to cancel junk food. We're trying to cancel culture, but here we go. Gonna cancel. Marvelous. It's actionable.[3:21:15] Andrew Huberman: It's straightforward. It's low cost, low time investment. Zero cost, very low time investments. Thank you for that.[3:21:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: And look up Eat Real because we're doing it for your kids, so you need to help support it. Any school district in America can do it. So what do we do? We have a business model whereby The, food services director, either purchases or rents a dilapidated factory in the center of the district, Repurposes it into a food preparation facility. They can make 27 to 3000 meals a day, k, with a, you know, skeleton crew, And then they, and and you control what's in it.[3:21:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: And because you're buying in volume, it actually reduces the cost, So it's cheaper than buying it from Cisco or Aramark or Sodexo or wherever, and then you farm it out via, you know, Truck or bus to all the different schools so every kid gets a hot meal made from scratch each day, And we can solve this problem.[3:22:25] Andrew Huberman: Can't help but ask this 1 last question. For people that wanna cut out sugar, which you clearly stated is the most important thing to do for one's health, How do we know how much sugar is in something? I so should people be looking at labels and just looking for how much sugar, how much carbohydrate, or Could we even go so far as to say if it says, high fructose corn syrup, then it's it's on the no fly list. Don't don't don't eat it.[3:22:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: So the problem the problem is that there are 262 names for sugar, and the food industry uses all of them. And the reason they use all of them is because they can include a different sugar as number 5, number 6, number 7, number 8, number 9 on the list. When you add it up, it becomes number 1. They hide it in plain sight, and they do it on purpose. Now Do I expect everybody to memorize all 262 names?[3:23:21] Dr. Robert Lustig: No. Of course not. Can you figure it out yourself? Well, the answer is no unless they have the line where it says added sugars. If it says added sugars, it is either sucrose or high fructose corn syrup.[3:23:36] Dr. Robert Lustig: No one's adding lactose. Okay? That's not Or glucose. They're not even adding glucose because glucose isn't that sweet. Glucose is not that interesting.[3:23:46] Dr. Robert Lustig: You don't see people going around chugging Karo syrup, do you? K. That's glucose. Who cares? Yeah.[3:23:51] Dr. Robert Lustig: Might be good in the molasses cookie, but that's it. Alright. So it's fructose. So you need to know what's been added. So if it says added sugars, that's a good place to start.[3:24:04] Dr. Robert Lustig: No greater than 1 teaspoon per serving. No greater than Four grams per serving of added sugars. Anything greater than that, leave at the store.[3:24:16] Andrew Huberman: And aim for those nova type[3:24:18] Dr. Robert Lustig: Type 1. Aim for no aim for NOVA types 1, 2, and 3. And if you don't know whether it's NOVA type 1, 2, or 3, you can use perfect. And if you don't look at that, then go look at the nutrition facts label, and anything that has more than 4 ingredients is noble class 4.[3:24:36] Andrew Huberman: Robert Lustig, thank you so much. You've provided such an incredible education in nutritional biochemistry, the processing of Fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, fructose in particular, the clear detriments of consuming fructose on so many different organ systems. I love, love, love that you separated out food science, nutrition, and metabolic health Or that yourself that's just I that's a, you know, that's a gazillion dollar delineation for people to understand And to shape their understanding of all the information that's out there and bins into these different categories, you've given us so many actionable tools, Deep new conceptual frameworks. You've given us a real tour de force today in, a a just it's oh so clear language. So, I wanna thank you.[3:25:27] Andrew Huberman: I I've learned a ton, and, and I know everyone else has as well. And if people have questions, they can, Of course, put them in the comment section on YouTube. That's the best place. We'll provide links to all the the companies and, websites that that you referenced and some of your other work. And listen, I just I'm so so grateful that you exist and that you've done the work that you've done and and your passion and your advocacy For health is, it's just oh, so clear.[3:25:57] Andrew Huberman: So thank you so much.[3:25:58] Dr. Robert Lustig: So I wanna I wanna thank you, and the reason I wanna thank you Is first of all, you know, inviting me. That's nice. You know, that's good, but the reason is because people need to understand science. I am completely in agreement with you. The public needs to understand science.[3:26:16] Dr. Robert Lustig: They listen to you Because you, number 1, provide the science, and number 2, you don't talk down to them. You treat them as equals. And that is truly remarkable, and so I wanna thank you for your service.[3:26:31] Andrew Huberman: Well, you're Most welcome. It's a labor of love, and, I think it was the great Max DelBrook that said, when teaching, assume Zero knowledge and infinite intelligence, and I do believe that humans are infinitely intelligent. Although sometimes as a whole, we mask it. People deserve the the knowledge, so thank you so much for sharing that knowledge today, and let's absolutely have[3:26:52] Dr. Robert Lustig: you back.
