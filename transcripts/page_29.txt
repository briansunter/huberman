I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing the 1st guest of the Huberman Lab Podcast. My guest is doctor Carl Deisseroth. Doctor Carl Deisseroth is a medical doctor.[0:00:24] Andrew Huberman: He's a psychiatrist and a research scientist at Stanford School of Medicine. In his clinical practice, he sees patients dealing with a range of nervous system disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, Attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia, mania, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. His laboratory develops and explores tools with which to understand how the nervous system works in the healthy situation as well as in disorders of the mind. Doctor Dysaros' laboratory has pioneered the development and use of what are called channel opsins, proteins that come from algae, which can now be introduced to the nervous systems of animals and humans in order to precisely control the activity of neurons in the brain and body with the use of light. This is a absolutely transformative technology because whereas certain drug treatments can often relieve certain symptoms of disorders, they often carry Various side effects.[0:01:22] Andrew Huberman: And in some individuals, often many individuals, these drug treatments simply do not work. The channel opsins and their related technologies Stand to transform the way that we treat psychiatric illness and various disorders of movement and perception. In fact, just recently, Time. We also discuss doctor Deisseroth's newly released book, which is entitled Projections, A Story of Human Emotions. This is an absolutely remarkable book that uses stories about his interactions with his patients to teach you how the brain works in the healthy and diseased state and also reveals The motivation for and discovery of these channel opsins and other technologies by Carl's laboratory that are being used now to treat various disorders of the nervous system And that in the future are certain to transform the fields of psychiatry, mental health, and health in general.[0:02:20] Andrew Huberman: I found our conversation to be an absolutely fascinating one about How the brain functions in the healthy state, and why and how it breaks down in disorders of the mind. We also discuss The current status and future of psychedelic treatments for psychiatric illness as well as for understanding how the brain works more generally. We also discuss issues of consciousness, And we even delve into how somebody like Carl who's managing a full time clinical practice and a 40 plus person laboratory And a family of 5 children and is happily married, how he organizes his internal landscape, his own thinking in order to manage that immense workload and to progress forward for the sake of medicine and his pursuits in science. I found this to be an incredible conversation. I learned so much.[0:03:07] Andrew Huberman: I also learned through the course of reading Carl's book, Projections, that not only is he an accomplished psychiatrist and, Obviously, you're an accomplished research scientist and a family man, but he's also a phenomenal writer. Projections is absolutely masterfully written. It's just beautiful, And it's accessible to anybody even if you don't have a science background. So I hope that you'll enjoy my conversation with Carl Dyseroth as much as I did, And thank you for tuning in. Before we begin, I want to point out that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:03:39] Andrew Huberman: In my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public, I'd like to acknowledge the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that, in my opinion, are the very highest quality out there. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about the eyeglasses and sunglasses was developed with performance in mind. One of the things I really love about ROKA sunglasses is that unlike other sunglasses that make it hard to see when there's a lot of cloud cover or when the shadows change or environmental conditions change.[0:04:14] Andrew Huberman: With ROKA sunglasses, they clearly understand the science of the visual system. Because when I put them on for the 1st time, I noticed that as I moved into shadows or the cloud cover changed or the day got brighter or dimmer, Everything was still crystal clear, and that's also because the lenses are tremendously high optical clarity and the glasses are really lightweight. You don't even notice that they're on. The other thing is that the eyeglasses, I wear readers at night, they're incredibly lightweight. And for both the sunglasses and eyeglasses, the aesthetic is terrific.[0:04:44] Andrew Huberman: Unlike a lot of performance eyewear, which frankly can look kind of cyborg like and kinda ridiculous, the aesthetic of the glasses is such that You could really wear them anywheres, indoors or outdoors. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, And enter the code Huberman to save 20% on your 1st order. That's Roka, r o k a, dot com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals.[0:05:20] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done. And now with the advent of good genetic DNA tests, I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA. The simple reason for this is that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health can only be measured and evaluated with a quality blood test. And now the DNA test further inform our immediate and long term health. One of the problems with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests out there, however, is that you get the information back, and you don't know what to do with that information.[0:05:49] Andrew Huberman: With InsideTracker, you get the numbers back of different metabolic factors, hormones, etcetera, but it also provides simple directives as to how perhaps you might wanna change your nutritional intake or your exercise regimen or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers into alignment with where you'd like them to be. InsideTracker also makes this really easy. They have a dashboard that makes organizing that all very simple, and they can even have someone come to your house to take the blood and DNA test. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code Huberman Check out.[0:06:25] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in 1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, and I've taken it ever since, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and that I continue to take Athletic greens is that it covers all my vitamin and mineral basis, and it covers my probiotic needs. There's now a wealth of data showing That probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome and that a healthy gut microbiome supports the gut brain axis for healthy mood.[0:06:56] Andrew Huberman: It also supports Metabolism, immune function, endocrine, that means hormone function, and a host of other important biological functions. I drink it Once or twice a day, I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice or some lime juice, and it's absolutely delicious. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/ Huberman. And if you do that, you can claim a special offer where they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three. In addition, they'll give you 5 free travel packs.[0:07:24] Andrew Huberman: Vitamin d 3, as we all know, is very important for a huge range of biological functions and health. Again, that's athletic greens.com/huberman For your athletic greens, the 5 free travel packs, and the year's supply of vitamin d three. And now my conversation with doctor Carl Deisseroff. Well, thanks for being here.[0:07:42] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Thanks for having me.[0:07:44] Andrew Huberman: It's been a long time coming for me, because, you may not know this, but One of the reasons I started this podcast was actually so I could have this conversation. It's it's but one. There are other reasons. But one of the goals is to be able to hold conversations with colleagues of mine that Are doing incredible work in the realm of science. And then here, we also have this really special opportunity because you're also a clinician.[0:08:11] Andrew Huberman: You see patients and have for a long time. Yep. For people that might not be so familiar with the fields of neuroscience, etcetera, what is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?[0:08:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, you know, I'm I'm married to a neurologist and I am a psychiatrist and we make fun of each other all the time. So this is, a lot of neuroscientists and a lot of BRAIN clinicians actually think these 2 should be the same field at at some point in the future. They were in the past, they started together. Psychiatry though, focuses on disorders where we can't see something that's physically wrong, where we don't have a measurable, where there's no blood test That makes the diagnosis. There's no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia, this is depression for an individual patient.[0:08:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so psychiatry is is much more mysterious and the only tools we have are words. Neurologists are fantastic physicians, they see the stroke on brain scans, they see the seizure And the pre seizure activity with an EEG, and they can measure and treat based on those measurables. In psychiatry, we have a harder job I think. We use words, we have rating scales for symptoms, we can measure depression and Autism with rating scales, but those are words still. And ultimately that's what psychiatry is built around.[0:09:37] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It's it's an odd situation because we've got The most complex, beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered, object in the universe, and yet all we have Our words to to find our way in.[0:09:52] Andrew Huberman: So do you find that if a patient is very verbal or hyperverbal, Do you have an easier time diagnosing them as opposed to somebody who's, more quiet and reserved, or it's can imagine the opposite might be true as well.[0:10:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, it because we only have words, you put your finger on a key point. If they don't speak that much in principle, it's harder. The lack of speech can be a symptom. We can see that in depression. We can see that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.[0:10:19] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: We can see that in Sometimes by itself that is a symptom, reduced speech. But ultimately, you do need something. You need some some words to help guide you and that in fact, There's there's challenges that I I can tell you about where patients with depression who are so depressed they can't speak. That makes it a bit of a challenge to distinguish depression from some of the other reasons they might not be speaking, and this is a sort of the art and the science of psychiatry.[0:10:47] Andrew Huberman: Do you find that there are, patients that have well, let's call them comorbidities or conditions where they would land in both psychiatry and neurology. Meaning, there's damage to a particular area of the brain, and therefore, they're depressed. And how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist?[0:11:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. This happens all the time. Parkinson's disease is a great example. It's a it's a it can be debilitating in so many ways. People have trouble moving, I have trouble walking, I have trouble swallowing, and they can have truly severe depression.[0:11:25] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And this is You might say, oh, well, they've got a life threatening, illness. But there are plenty of neurological disorders where depression is not a strong Strongly comorbid, symptom, like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease for example. Depression is not a strong, Strongly comorbid in that disease, but in Parkinson's it is extremely common. And, as you know in in Parkinson's disease we have loss of the dopamine neurons in In the in the midbrain. And this is a very That leads to both the movement disorder and the depression.[0:12:03] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: There are many examples of that where these 2 fields come together, and You really need to work as a team. I've had patients in my clinic that I I treat the depression associated with their Parkinson's, and a neurologist treats the movement associated with the Parkinson's, and we work together.[0:12:19] Andrew Huberman: Do you think we will ever have a blood test For depression or schizophrenia or autism, and would that be a good or a bad thing?[0:12:29] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I think, ultimately, there will be quantitative tests. Already efforts are being made to look at certain rhythms in the brain using external EEGs, Let's look at brain waves effectively, look at the ratios of certain frequencies to other frequencies, and there's some progress being made on that front. It's not as good as it could be. It doesn't really give you the confidence for the individual patient that you would you would like. But ultimately what's going on in the brain and psychiatric Gastric disease is physical, and it's due to the circuits and the connections and the projections in the brain that are not Working as they would in a a typical situation.[0:13:08] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And I I do think we'll have those measurables at some point now. Is that good or bad? You know, I I think that will be good. One of the challenges we have with, psychiatry is it is an art as well as a science to elicit These, symptoms, in a precise way, it does take some time. And it would be great if we could just do a quick measurement.[0:13:31] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Could it be abused or or or misused? Certainly, but that's, I think, true for all of medicine.[0:13:38] Andrew Huberman: I wanna know and I'm sure there are several, but What do you see as the biggest challenge facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness today?[0:13:49] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I think we have, we're making progress on what the biggest challenge is, which I think there's still such a strong stigma for psychiatric disease that patients often don't come to us, and, they feel that they should be able to handle this on their own. And that that can slow treatment, it can lead to, you know, worsening symptoms. We know for example, patients who have, untreated anxiety issues. If you go for a year or more with a a serious untreated anxiety issue, that can Convert to depression, you can add another, problem on top of the anxiety. And so it would be, You know, why do people not come for treatment?[0:14:32] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: They they they feel like this is something they should be able to master on their own, which which can be true, but Usually, some help is is is a good thing.[0:14:43] Andrew Huberman: That raises a a question related to something I heard you say many years ago At a lecture, which was that, this was a scientific lecture, and he said, you know, we don't know how other people feel. Most of the time, we don't even really know how we feel. Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit and the the, dearth of of ways that We we have to talk about feelings. I mean, there's so many words. I don't know how many, but I'm guessing they're more than a dozen words to describe The state that I call sadness, but as far as I understand, we don't have any way of comparing that in a in a real objective sense.[0:15:20] Andrew Huberman: So how as a psychiatrist when your job is to use words to diagnose, words of the patient to diagnose, do you Maneuver around that, and and what is this landscape that we call feelings or emotions?[0:15:33] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: This is, really interesting. People Here we have a there's a tension between the words that we've built up in the clinic that mean something to the to the physicians, and then there's the Colloquial use of words that may not be the same, and so that's the 1st level we have to sort out. When someone says, you know, I'm I'm depressed, what exactly do they mean by that? That may be different from from what we're talking about in terms of depression. So part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word and to get into how they're actually feeling.[0:16:05] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Get get rid of the the jargon and Get to real world examples of of how they're feeling. So, you know, how do you what how much do you look forward into the future? How much, hope do you have? How much planning are you doing for the future? So these here now you're getting into actual things you can talk about that are unambiguous.[0:16:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: If someone says, I I can't even I can't even think about tomorrow. I I'm not I don't see how I'm gonna get to tomorrow. That that's a nice precise thing that, you know, it's it's sad, it's tragic, but but it's also that means something, and we know what that means. That's the hopelessness symptom of depression. And and that is what I try to do when I do a psychiatric interview.[0:16:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I try to get past the jargon and get to what's actually happening in the patient's life and and in their mind. But as you say, ultimately, you know, this shows up across I I I address this issue every day in my life whether it's in the lab where we're we're looking at Animals whether fish or mice or rats, and studying their behavior or when I'm in a conversation with just a friend or colleague, Or when I'm talking to a patient, I never really know what's going on inside the mind of the other person. I get I get some feedback, I get words, I get behaviors, I get actions, but I never really know. And as you said at the very beginning of the question, know, often we don't even have the words and the insight to even understand what's going on in our own mind. I think a lot of psychiatrists are pretty introspective, that's part of the reason they end up in that Specialty, and so, maybe we spend a little more time than the average person thinking about what's going on within, but that doesn't mean we have Answers.[0:17:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Mhmm.[0:17:49] Andrew Huberman: So in, this area of trying to figure out what's going on under the hood through words, sounds like certain words, would relate to this, this idea of anticipation and hope. Mhmm. Is it fair to say that that somehow relates to the dopamine system in the sense that Dopamine is involved in motivated behaviors. I mean, is that in if I say, for instance and I I won't ask you to run a session with me here for, for free. We'll do that off camera.[0:18:19] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Right. If I were to say, you know, I I just can't imagine the Tomorrow. I just it I I just can't do it. So that's that's not action based.[0:18:31] Andrew Huberman: That's purely based on my my internal narrative. But I could imagine things like, you know, I I have a terrible time sleeping. I'm not hungry. I'm not eating. So statements about Physical actions, I'm guessing, also have, validity.[0:18:46] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Absolutely.[0:18:47] Andrew Huberman: And there are now ways to measure The accuracy of those statements like, for instance, if I gave you permission, you could know if I slept last night or whether or not I was just saying I had a poor night's sleep.[0:18:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yes. That's right.[0:18:59] Andrew Huberman: So In moving forward through 2021 and into the next 10 a 100 years of psychiatry, do you think that The body reporting some of the actions of a human, are going to be become useful and and mesh with the words a way that's gonna make your job easier.[0:19:18] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I do think that's true. And these the 2 things you've mentioned, eating and sleeping, those are additional, criteria that we use to diagnose depression. These are the vegetative signs, we call them depression, poor sleep and poor eating. And if you have a baseline for somebody, that's the real challenge though. What's different in that person?[0:19:35] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Some people with depressed, they sleep more. Some people with who are depressed, they sleep less. Some people who are depressed, they're more physically agitated And they move around more. Some people who are depressed they they move less even while they're awake. And so you need here's the challenge is you you can't just look at how they are now.[0:19:53] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Have to get a baseline, and then see how it's changed. And that can be a challenge that raises, you know, ethical issues, and how do you do you collect that baseline information from someone healthy? I don't I don't think that's something we have solved. Of course, you know, with phones and accelerometers phones, you could in principle collect a lot of baseline information from people. But that would have to be treated Very, carefully, for privacy reasons.[0:20:21] Andrew Huberman: And in terms of measuring one's own behavior, you know, I I've heard of work that's going on. Sam Golden up at the University of Washington, who works on aggression and animal models was telling me that there's some efforts that he's making and perhaps you you're involved in this work as well. I don't know of, devices that would allow people to detect, for instance, when they're veering towards a depressive episode for themselves That they may choose or not choose to report that to their clinician. Maybe they don't even have a clinician. Maybe this person that that you referred to at the beginning, this person who doesn't feel comfortable coming to talk to you, they, maybe something is measuring changes in the inflection of their voice Mhmm.[0:21:01] Andrew Huberman: Or the Bead at which they get up from a chair. Do you think that those kind of metrics will eventually inform somebody, hey. You know, you're in trouble. This is getting to this question of, the back to the statement that I heard you make and it rang in my mind now, I think, for more than a decade, which is oftentimes we don't even know how we feel.[0:21:17] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. You know, that that I do like Because that gives the patient the agency to to detect what's going on. And even separate from modern technology, this has been part of the the art of psychiatry is to Help patients realize that sometimes other people observing them can give them the earliest warning signs of depression. We see this very often in in And family, they'll notice when the patient is changing before the patient does. And then there are things the patient may notice but not Correctly ascribed to the onset of depression, and a classic example of that is what we call early morning awakening.[0:21:51] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And this is something that can happen very early as people Start to slide into depression. They start to wake up earlier and earlier, you know, just inexplicably, they're awake.[0:21:59] Andrew Huberman: So this is like 2 AM, 3 AM to wake in?[0:22:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It could Yeah. It could start at 5 AM, could go to 4.[0:22:05] Andrew Huberman: And unable to fall back asleep.[0:22:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Unable to fall back asleep, exactly. So that's and that They may not know what to do with that, it could just be from their perspective it's just something that's happening. But if you put enough of that information together that that could be a useful warning sign for the patient, and it could help them seek treatment. And I think that is something that could be really valuable.[0:22:24] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. So in This framework of, you know, needing words to self report or machines to detect how we feel or and maybe inform of a psychiatrist, how a patient feels. Wanna, touch on some of the technologies that you've been involved in building. But As a way to march into that, are there any very good treatments for psychiatric disease? Meaning, are there currently any Pills, potions, forms of communication that reliably work every time or work in most patients.[0:23:01] Andrew Huberman: And could you give a couple examples of Great successes of psychiatry if they exist. Yes.[0:23:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. We are fortunate. And this coming back to my, you know, the the Joking between my wife and myself in terms of neurology and psychiatry, we actually in psychiatry, Despite the depths of our the mystery we struggle with, many of our treatments are actually, you know, we're we're we may be doing better than other specialties in terms of actually causing, you know, therapeutic benefit for patients. We do help patients, you know, patients who suffer from, By the way, both medications and talk therapy have been shown to be extremely effective in many cases. For example, people with panic disorder, Cognitive behavioral therapy, just working with words, helping people identify the early signs of when they're starting to move toward a panic attack, what are the cognitions that are happening.[0:23:51] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You can train people to derail that and and you can very potently treat panic disorder that way.[0:23:57] Andrew Huberman: How long does something like that take for on average.[0:24:00] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: For a motivated, insightful patient, you can have a a a very, you know, cookbook y series of sessions, you know, 6 12 sessions or or even less for someone who's very, insightful and motivated, and it can have a very powerful effect that quickly. And that's just with words. There are many psychiatric medications that are very effective for, the conditions that treating, antipsychotic medications, they have side effects, but boy do they work. They really can clear up particularly the positive symptoms of of Schizophrenia, for example, the auditory hallucinations, the paranoia. People's lives can be turned around by these.[0:24:39] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Clarify positive symptoms, you mean not positive[0:24:42] Andrew Huberman: in the in the qualitative sense. You mean positive meaning that the appearance of of something abnormal.[0:24:46] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Exactly. And thank you for that clarification. When we say positive symptoms we do mean the addition of something that wasn't there before like a hallucination or a paranoia. And that stands in contrast to the negative symptoms where something is taken away. And these are patients who are who are withdrawn.[0:25:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: They they have, what we call Thought blocking that can't even progress forward in a sequence of of thoughts. Both of those can be part of schizophrenia. The The hallucinations and the paranoia are more effectively treated right now, but they are effectively treated. And then you know this is a a frustrating and yet Heartening aspect of psychiatry, there are treatments like electroconvulsive electroconvulsive therapy which is for depression. We have patients who nothing else works for them, or they can't tolerate medications, and under a very safe controlled condition where the patient's body is not moving, they're put into a very safe situation where the body doesn't move or sees.[0:25:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It's just an internal, a process that's triggered in the brain. This is an extraordinarily effective treatment for treatment resistant depression. At the same time, I find it As as heartening as it is to see patients respond to this with with, who have severe depression, I'm also frustrated by it. By it. Why why can't we do something more precise than than this for these very severe cases?[0:26:11] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And people have sought for decades to Understand how is it that a seizure is leading to the relief of of depression and we don't know the answer yet. We would love to do that, people are working hard on that, But that is a treatment that does work too. All in all of these cases though in psychiatry, the the frustrating thing is that we don't have The level of understanding that a cardiologist has in thinking about the heart, you know, the heart is, we now know, it's a pump, it's Pumping blood, and so you can look at everything about how it's working or not working in terms of that frame. It's clearly a pump. We don't really have that level of what what is the circuit really there for in psychiatry.[0:26:54] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And that's that's what is missing. That's what we need to find so we can design truly effective and specific treatments.[0:27:02] Andrew Huberman: So What do you what are the pieces that are gonna be required to cure autism, cure Parkinson's, Cure schizophrenia, I I would imagine there are several elements and bins here. Understanding that the natural biology, understanding What the activity patterns are, how to modify those. Maybe, you could just tell us what you think. What is the the bento box of the perfect cure?[0:27:29] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. I think the first thing we need is understanding. We need we need, almost every psychiatric treatment has been serendipitously identified. Just noting by chance that something that was done for some person also had a side effect.[0:27:44] Andrew Huberman: Like lithium or something.[0:27:45] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Lithium is a is a good example.[0:27:46] Andrew Huberman: Is it true that it was the The urine of guinea pigs given lithium that was given to manic patients that made them not manic. Is that true?[0:27:53] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I don't have firsthand knowledge of that, but, I would I would defer that. But it's it's true for essentially every treatment, you know, the the antidepressants originally, you know, arouses anti tuberculosis drugs for example I did[0:28:05] Andrew Huberman: not know that.[0:28:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. And so this is a it's a classic example for, and this this is across all of of psychiatry. And, of course, there's the seizures as well that was noticed that patients who had epilepsy, they or or had a seizure there and also had depression that they became much, At least for a while, they were improved after the seizure.[0:28:23] Andrew Huberman: That's amazing. I don't wanna take you off course of the question that, answering the question I asked, but, I've heard before that if autistic children get a fever, that their symptoms improve. Is that true?[0:28:33] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I've, I've done a fair bit of of work with Autism, I'm in my clinical practice, I work with adult autism, and I have heard, statements like that and and descriptions like that from from patients and their their families. It's, it's that is very hard to study quantitatively because often with the children you have this, not as quantitative as you'd like collection of symptom information, from from, from home. But I have heard that enough that I think there there may well be something to And you know, what is anytime you have a fever, what's going on? Well, we know all the Cells in the brain, and I know this as an electrophysiologist, if you just change the temperature by a few degrees, everything changes about how neurons work. And that's even just a single neuron, it's even more Likely to be complex and different with a circuit of neurons that are all affecting each other, just elevate the temperature a little bit, everything's different.[0:29:27] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so it's it's plausible for sure that things like that could happen and do happen. Now, but And yet, when you think about autism, to take your example, yes, we see changes, but What is the element in the brain that's analogous to the pumping heart? When we think about the symptoms of depression, That's maybe, you know, we think about motivation and dopamine neurons. When we think about autism, it's a little more challenging. You have there's a a deficit in, social interaction and in communication.[0:30:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so where is that? Where is this where is that situated? What is the key principle, governing the social interaction? This is where we need the basic science to bring us a step forward, so we can say okay, this is the process that's going on, this is what's needed for the incredibly complex task of social interaction, where you've got incredibly rich data streams of sound meaning, eye contact, body movement, and that's just for 1 person or if there's a group of people. This is overwhelming for people with with autism.[0:30:39] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: What's the what's the unifying theme there? It's a lot of information, and and that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology, the amount of information coming in through a social interaction, particularly with words and and language. And so then that turns our attention as neuroscientists, we think okay, let's think about the parts of the brain that are involved in dealing with Merging complex data streams that are very high in bit rate that need to be fused together into a unitary concept. And that starts to guide us and maybe we can and we know other animals are social in their own way, we can study those animals. So that there's that's how I think about it.[0:31:21] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: There's hope for the future, thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might and Trying to identify the circuits that are likely working, to make this typical behavior happen, and that will help us understand how it becomes atypical.[0:31:35] Andrew Huberman: So that seems like the first To me, the 1st bin of this, what I call the Bento box, for lack of a better analogy, that we need to know the circuits. We need to know the cells Yeah. In the various brain regions and portions of the body, and, and how they connect to one another, and what the patterns of activity are under a Normal, quote, unquote, healthy interaction.[0:31:57] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[0:31:59] Andrew Huberman: If we understand that, then it seems that The next step, which of course could be carried out in parallel. Right? That that work can be done alongside work where various Elements within those circuits are tweaked just right. Like the tuning of a piano in the subtle way or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys if the Piano is lacking keys, so[0:32:20] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: to speak.[0:32:21] Andrew Huberman: You've been very involved in trying to generate those tools. So, tell us about Channel options, why you created them, and where they're at now in the laboratory and Perhaps also in the clinic.[0:32:38] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, this is a first of all, I give nature, the credit for for creating channelrhodopsins. These are beautiful, Little proteins that are made by algae, single celled green algae. And it's a great story in basic science That our understanding of animal behavior, sensation, cognition, and action in our brains, all the way Back to a botanist in the 18 fifties and 18 sixties in Russia is where the story begins. So this was a a botanist named Andrei Faminsen who, worked at Saint Petersburg, and he, had noticed in the river, near his laboratory that were algae that he could look at in a dish, in a saucer. He could put them there, and we had light shining from the side.[0:33:29] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: The green, tinge in the saucer of water, would move to a particular distance from the light that he was shining from the side, which was an amazing thing. If he made the light brighter, the green tinge would back off a little bit to a more optimal location, so just the right light level. So this was plant behavior. It was light driven plant behavior and he delved into this a little bit. He identified that with mic microscopy, he could see that there were little single celled algae with flagella That we're swimming, to the to the right light level.[0:34:05] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: So behaving plants, and this has been the secret that's that's helped us unlock, so many principles of animal behavior. So, turns out, you know, these algae achieve this amazing results With a single gene that encodes a single protein what's a protein? It's just a little biomolecule that does a job in a cell. And these are proteins that sit in the surface of cells, in their surface membrane, and when a photon, a light particle hits them, they open a little pore, a little hole in the membrane, and charged particles, ions, like sodium, rush across the pore. Now, why do they do that?[0:34:49] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: They do that to guide their flagella. That signal coming in, those ions coming in through the pore in response to light Guide their flagellar motor that guides them to a particular spot, in the saucer. Okay. Now, that's plant behavior, but it turns out As you know, this movement of ions across the membrane, this happens to also be neural code in our brains for on or off. Sodium ions rushing into cells turns them on, makes them fire away, fire action potentials communicate to the next cell down the the chain.[0:35:24] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And this is an amazing opportunity because we can borrow these proteins. In fact, we can take the gene that directs the creation of the protein, and we can use genetic tricks, modern genetic tricks to put that gene into neurons in the brains of of mammals, and then use light to turn those cells, the specific cells that we put this gene into, turn them on. There are other, options we call them that you can use to turn cells off. It's all fast, real time. You can play in patterns of activity in real time into cells or kinds of cells.[0:36:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Just as a conductor, it elicits the music from the orchestra, the strings, and the woodwinds, and and and you can see what matters. What matters for sensation, what matters for cognition, what matters for action, and we call this optogenetics. Beautiful. And I must say it was quite An honor and a privilege to watch[0:36:20] Andrew Huberman: optogenetics move from idea to discovery To the laboratory, I think we were postdocs at the same time Yeah. Which is living proof that, people move at different rates That's a that's a joke at my expense, by the way. But it's We[0:36:38] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: end up in the same spot.[0:36:40] Andrew Huberman: More or less. Physically, if not, professionally, but nonetheless, it's been a marvelous story thus far. And I'd like to, maybe you could give us I'd like to just touch on couple examples of where the technology resides in laboratories now. So maybe the range of animals that it's being used in And some of the phenomenon that, channel op channelrhodopsins and, and their related genes and proteins are Starting to elicit what you've seen. Mhmm.[0:37:10] Andrew Huberman: And then I'd like to talk about their applicability to the clinic, which is, I think the the bigger mission, if you will.[0:37:17] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. So this is, you know, this this, whole thing, you know, it's been about Now going on, 17 years that we've been putting channelrhodopsins into neurons, it started just like Andrei Formincen's work in a in a dish, by 2000 that was in 2004. In 2007, we were putting these into behaving mice and we were able to to with the Like, if a a switch caused them to move one direction or another, by 2009[0:37:45] Andrew Huberman: So it basically can you're controlling the mouse's behavior.[0:37:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. Exactly. In real time. So we could make a mouse that was just sitting there doing nothing to then turn left very consistently. In fact, go around in a circle and as soon as we turn off the light it would stop.[0:37:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That was an eye opening moment. It took really a few years to make optogenetics work. There was a lot of Putting all the there are a lot of problems that had to be solved. These these channel reductions actually don't move many ions. They're they have a small current, Small conductance as we say, and so we had to figure out ways to pack a lot of them into cells without damaging cells, And still make them targetable, so we don't want them to just be in all the cells because then it becomes just like an electrode.[0:38:29] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You're just stimulating all the cells that are nearby. We had to keep that Specificity, make them targetable to just one kind of cell or another, while still packing in large numbers of them into those cells. And we had to get in the light and safe in specific ways, and so it took probably about 4 or 5 years to really create optogenetics between 2004 and 2009. By the end of that time though we had, all the basic light delivery, gene delivery Those worked out, and people started to apply the technology to, to fish, to rats, to mice, to non human primates, like monkeys. And just a couple months ago, my colleague, Botan Vroska in Switzerland, succeeded in putting channelrhodopsins into the eyes human beings and making a blind person see, and so that's pretty, cool.[0:39:27] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: This was a Patient, patient with retinal degeneration, and he was provided a channel rhodopsin into the eye of of this patient and was able confer some light sensitivity onto this patient that wasn't there before.[0:39:38] Andrew Huberman: An amazing paper in discovery. I realized it was 1 patient, but it's such an important milestone[0:39:44] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, it's a as you say, it's a very important milestone, and and the the history of that is is very deep. Almost 10 years earlier, Botond, Roska, And I had published a paper in Science in human retina, but explanted taken from cadavers from someone who had died, living retina taken out, opsins put into this, retinal tissue and showing that it that it worked, recording from the cells, showing that in these human Retinal neurons that you could get light responses. But then from that moment, you know, almost 10 years of, you know, how clinical Development goes, and this is a gene therapy, so you've got all all the regulations and concerns and all that. It took almost 10 years to get to To this point now where a living, human being, has a new functionality that that wasn't there before. Now that's incredibly inspiring, you know, and It's a it's a it's a beautiful thing.[0:40:39] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I would say though that the the broader significance of optogenetics is really still understanding because once you understand how the circuitry works, and which cells actually matter, then any kind of treatment becomes grounded, and logical, and specific, and principled. And whether it's medication, or talk therapy, or brain stimulation treatment with Electrical or magnetic means. If you actually know what matters, that is incredibly powerful. And I think no no, you know, Not intended to disparage this the beautiful, you know, retinal work and and conferring, you know, vision on on someone who who couldn't see. Of course, that's wonderful.[0:41:19] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: But and that's direct, what you might call direct optogenetics in patients. Indirect is everything that comes from understanding, you know. Okay. We know these cells matter now for the symptom. Well, how can we target those those cells and help them work better in patients by any means?[0:41:35] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And I think that's the the broader significance genetics clinically.[0:41:39] Andrew Huberman: You and I know Botan well. And, you and Botan share, this incredible, big vision that, I think only a clinician can really understand. You know, being in close contact with and, Oh, the suffering of patients as a ultimate motivator of developing technologies, which makes me have to ask, Did you decide to become a scientist to cure find cures for mental disease?[0:42:08] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: No. I didn't. It's a it's a really important question to actually look back and and see the steps that brought you to a particular place, and That was not, what brought me, initially to science. And and it's okay to, I think, to embrace the twists and turns that life, brings to you. But I was always interested in the brain, and so, that was something that for me started from a a very early age.[0:42:34] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I was you know, we talked about being introspective. I I noticed very early on, I had a a deep love of of poetry and and stories, And I I was a voracious reader, and I was amazed by how words could Could make me feel in particular ways just the even even separate from their, you know, of of course, dictionary meanings, the the rhythm and how they work together, Even separate from meaning. And I was stunned by poets that could use words in new ways that were even Divorced from their meaning at all, and yet could still trigger specific emotions. And I was that was this was always fascinating to me. So, You know, I I wanted to understand that, and so I was interested in in in I became interested in the brain.[0:43:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And I thought, well, I'm gonna have to study the human brain, because enough. So in in college, I began to steer myself toward, medicine and with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon. And so I I came here, to medical school, and did an MD PhD program, planning neuro surgery all the way through. The 1st rotation I did at the end of medical school as you know, you do rotations, you go through Different specialties and some of these are required rotations that everybody has to do, some are elective where you can you can pick what you wanna do. I elected to do neurosurgery first even before regular surgery.[0:44:09] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I was that sure I wanted to do it and I loved it. I had a Fantastic time. There was an amazing patient who had a a thalamic damage, and there was a neglect syndrome where patient, you know, was not able to be aware of something that was, you know, right in front of him.[0:44:24] Andrew Huberman: Even though their vision was perfectly fine.[0:44:25] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Even though their vision was perfectly fine. Exactly. And so I was in and I loved the operating room, I loved, the rhythm of suturing and the precision of it, and I loved being able helped patients immediately, but then a required, rotation was in psychiatry, Which I was not looking forward to, at all. And that, completely reset my my whole life, that that experience in psychiatry, and and it was it was at that moment that I saw this is first of all the greatest need, the the depth of suffering and the And the depth of the mystery together, and also it was I also feel a little guilty about this. It's so interesting too, you know.[0:45:11] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yes. Yes. There's yes. We can Help. Yes.[0:45:14] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: There's need, but as a scientist, this is amazing that someone's reality can be different from my own. You know, with with Everything physically, as far as we can tell, the same, with the measures we have, and yet we've got a different reality. That is an amazing Thing. And if we couldn't understand that and help these people, that would be, just, you know, more than anybody could ask for. And so that's that's how I ended up, Taking this path, just a a a required rotation in psychiatry.[0:45:46] Andrew Huberman: It all started with poetry.[0:45:47] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And it started with Poetry.[0:45:49] Andrew Huberman: Out of out of, respect for poetry, are are there any favorites that you spend time with, on a regular basis?[0:45:57] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I mean, the the ones who who got me down this path early on, I remember in in childhood in high school, Borges had an immense influence on me. I I I studied Spanish all the way through and and and, reading his work. He was a A great writer. He wrote both in in English and in Spanish, and and being able to appreciate his poetry both in English and in Spanish was was a pretty amazing thing. Not many, poets can can do that.[0:46:25] Andrew Huberman: You're bilingual.[0:46:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I I I'm not I I wouldn't say now. I I became at one point, I was effectively fluent in And I have I'm pretty good with medical Spanish still because, you know, we use, Spanish all the time in the in the in the clinic here. I I wouldn't claim full fluency, but it's something I can I definitely use all the time? Yeah. And it's been very helpful in the clinic.[0:46:46] Andrew Huberman: Borges is wonderful. He's the son of an Argentine. I grew up hearing about it, and I learned that Borges' favorite city was Geneva. So I spent time in Geneva only for that reason. It also turns out to be an interesting city.[0:46:58] Andrew Huberman: Yes. So you developed methods To control neurons with these algae proteins using light. Yeah. In 2015, there was this, what I thought was a very nice article published in the New Yorker, describing your work and the current state of, Your work in in the laboratory, in the clinic, and an interaction with a patient. So this says, I recall a woman who was severely depressed, And you reported in that article some of the discussion with this patient.[0:47:32] Andrew Huberman: And then in real time, increase The activation of the so called vagus nerve, this 10th cranial nerve that extends out of the skull and innervates many of the the viscera and and body. What is the potential for channelrhodopsins or related types of algae engineering to be used to manipulate The vagus, because I believe in that instance, it wasn't channel ops and stimulation. It was electrical stimulation. Right? Or to manipulate, instance, a very small localized region of the brain.[0:48:04] Andrew Huberman: Let me frame it a little bit differently in light of what we were talking about a couple minutes ago. My understanding is that if somebody has severe depression and they take any number of the available Pharmaceutical agents that are out there, SSRI, serotonin agents, increased dopamine, increased whatever, that Sometimes they experience relief, but there are often serious side effects. Sometimes they don't experience relief. But as I understand it, Channel options and their related technology in principle would allow you to turn on or off the specific regions of the brain that lead to the depressive symptoms or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit or an or a, a positive anticipation circuit. Where are we at now in terms of bringing this technology to the nervous system?[0:48:55] Andrew Huberman: And let's start with the body And then move into the skull.[0:48:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep. So starting with the body is a good example because it it, highlights the opportunity and and how far we have to go. So let's take this example of vagus nerve stimulation. So the vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve, it comes from the brain, it goes down, it innervates the heart, innervates the gut. By innovate, I mean, it sends little connections down to help, guide what happens in these these organs in the in the abdomen and chest.[0:49:25] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It also collects information back, and and there's information coming back from all those organs that go also go through this vagus nerve, the 10th cranial nerve back to the brain. And so this is somewhat of a of a of a superhighway to the brain then was the idea. And maybe the idea is maybe we could put a little cuff, A little electrical, device around the vagus nerve itself, and maybe have just like a pacemaker battery, have a little Power source here under the clavicle, everything under the skin and have a little, cuff and and drive signals and maybe they'll get back the brain. So a way of getting into the brain without putting something physical into the brain.[0:50:03] Andrew Huberman: And why the vagus? I mean, it's there, but and it's accessible. That's the reason?[0:50:08] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's the reason. Yes.[0:50:09] Andrew Huberman: Really?[0:50:09] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[0:50:09] Andrew Huberman: You're not kidding?[0:50:10] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I'm not kidding.[0:50:11] Andrew Huberman: So stimulating the vagus to treat depression simply because it's accessible?[0:50:15] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It started as actually as a as an epilepsy treatment, and it it can help with epilepsy. But, yes,[0:50:21] Andrew Huberman: simply because of the substance. As a scientist, I get this is where I get to chuckle and just say, I'm in the field of medicine from that perspective. From from the perspective of a Scientist and outsider. The field of medicine as a field that goes in and tickles pathways because they're there. It's, I don't know what to say.[0:50:42] Andrew Huberman: It's a little shocking. Yeah. And We all at least in my laboratory, I always say you never do an experiment because you can. You you do an experiment to test a specific hypothesis.[0:50:56] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we there are there are stories people tell. So the the sol the the vagus nerve lands on a particular spot on the brain called the Molotary tract nucleus, which is just 1 synapse away from the serotonin and the dopamine and the norepinephrine.[0:51:10] Andrew Huberman: So there's a link to Chemical systems in the brain that make it a rational choice.[0:51:14] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yes. It's not it's not irrational. But I can tell you that even if that were not true, the same thing would have been Tried, you know. You know?[0:51:21] Andrew Huberman: You asked you would've done it anyway.[0:51:22] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Because it's accessible.[0:51:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I see. Yeah. Okay.[0:51:25] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And and but and and why? Well, it's it's And not to again, not to disparage, what what's been happening in this branch of medicine. There's immense suffering, Treatments, many treatments don't work and and we try things. And and this is how so many advances in medicine happen. You think about kidney dialysis just kept many people alive.[0:51:46] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That that was just started by someone saying, hey, let's let's try this. Maybe there's something going up in the blood, maybe we can dialyze something and help them. Yeah. It worked. And and it was just sort of a test pilot mentality.[0:51:57] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: We can we can access the blood, let's run it across the dialysis membrane, put it back in the body. Oh my god, that actually works. And sometimes you do need that that test pilot mentality, of course, to do it in a in a rigorous, safe, controlled way which is what we do. And so, Anyway, that's how we we ended up, with but but still with the vagus nerve stimulation. Okay.[0:52:16] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: So what is it? Does it work? It has it's FDA approved for depression, this vagus nerve stimulation. But on a population level, if you average across all People the effect sizes are pretty small. Some patients, it has an amazing effect in, but some patients, it doesn't work at all.[0:52:35] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And average across everybody, the effect size is pretty small.[0:52:38] Andrew Huberman: How do you think it's working when it does work? Is it triggering the activation of of neurons that release more serotonin or dopamine?[0:52:44] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It could be, but I would say we don't have evidence for for that, and so I I I I just don't know. But, what is clear is that it's dose limited, in how high and strongly we can stimulate. And why? It's because it's an electrode, and it's stimulating everything nearby. And when you turn on the vagus nerve stimulator, the voice patient's voice becomes strangulated and hoarse.[0:53:07] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: They can have trouble swallowing. They can have Trouble speaking for sure, even some trouble breathing. Because everything in the neck, every electrically responsive cell and projection in the in the neck is being affected by this And so you can go up just so far with the intensity, and then you have to stop. So, you know, To to your initial question, could a more precise stimulation method, like optogenetics help in this setting? In principle, it could because Causes symptom relief of a particular kind, then you're in business.[0:53:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You can have that be the only cell that's light sensitive. You're not gonna affect any of the other cells, the larynx and the pharynx and projections passing through. So that's the hope, that's the opportunity. The problem is that we don't yet have that level of specific knowledge. We don't know Okay.[0:54:04] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It's the cell starting in point a going to point b that will release this particular cell.[0:54:09] Andrew Huberman: Wanna fix this key on the piano. Yeah. And then I see 2 other, steps that are required. 1 is to get the channel opsin gene into the cell. In the case of Botan, Roscoe and colleagues, rescuing vision in this patient, They did that by an injection of a virus that doesn't damage the neurons.[0:54:27] Andrew Huberman: The virus itself is fairly innocuous, but carries a cargo, and it's a one time injection. The cells express, and then they used light to stimulate. So, let's say, I'm depressed, which I don't think I am. Although now sitting in front of a psychiatrist, you probably can see signs that maybe I am or maybe I'm not. But, let's say we put channel opsin into my, a specific branch of the Vegas that we understand is responsible for mood.[0:54:56] Andrew Huberman: How are we gonna get it in there, and then how are we gonna deliver the light? Because we're not talking about sunlight or standing in front of a light bulb necessarily.[0:55:03] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Okay.[0:55:04] Andrew Huberman: But what are what are the mechanisms For the body.[0:55:07] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep. So we had to solve exactly these questions you're saying. How do you get the light in? How do you get the gene in in a in a Potent and robust and safe way. And it that's now solved and that's not a challenge.[0:55:20] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: So there are very safe, well tolerated, gene delivery mechanisms that are called adeno associated viruses, AAVs. And these are, things that are are associated with the common cold. They themselves don't cause, any symptoms. They've been engineered and there's been a broad community of of viral engineering that's been going on for decades making these, safer, well tolerated and and so on. We can put the channelrhodopsin gene into these, viral vectors, that deliver the The gene, and we can have little bits of additional DNA that govern expression only in one kind of cell, but not another.[0:56:00] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: These are called promoters and enhancers, all genetic tricks built up by a very broad community of of great scientists over the decades. We can put these different bits of DNA, package them into this AAV, this little virus, and that can be then injected, into a particular part of The body, and sticking with this vagus nerve example, we know that there are particular clumps of neurons. There's one called the nodose ganglion, that has A clump of cells related to the vagus nerve, and you could, for example, target a little injection into that ganglion.[0:56:35] Andrew Huberman: Would that be an outpatient procedure?[0:56:37] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep.[0:56:37] Andrew Huberman: Yep. So you come in in the morning, get your injection, maybe walk out a few hours later?[0:56:41] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep. That's right. And so that's the gene. Then the light delivery, this is also something that that, we worked out. We worked on making very very light sensitive options.[0:56:52] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: One challenge, and and Botan, would be the the 1st to state this in fact in solving this problem for the patient. He had to build goggles that created much bright much brighter light than normal ambient light, delivery because as I mentioned earlier you have to pack a lot of these Channel rhodopsin's in, they don't have much current. You have to really make sure that you've got a tense enough light to enough of them to cause a stimulation.[0:57:21] Andrew Huberman: It has[0:57:22] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: to be[0:57:22] Andrew Huberman: the right wavelength. It has[0:57:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: to be[0:57:23] Andrew Huberman: the right wavelength. And going back to your example of the algae moving toward or away Yeah. The light, it it has to be tuned just right. So could you or could I'm imagining in my mind as a non engineer. I know you're also a bioengineer.[0:57:37] Andrew Huberman: The I'm imagining a little tiny blue light emitting, thing object that's A little bigger than a clump of cells or maybe about the size of a clump of cells. And for those who don't know, you know, your credit card is about 200 Micron's thick on the side, and, micron is a thousandth of a millimeter. And so we're talking about a little tiny stamp, that's basically, half a millimeter in size all around. Yeah. Each edge half a millimeter in size.[0:58:12] Andrew Huberman: Could imagine that being put under my skin.[0:58:14] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. And[0:58:15] Andrew Huberman: then I would what? I'd hit an app on my phone, and I'd say I'd say, doctor Dysarthe, I'm not feeling great today. Can I increase the stimulation and you say go for it, and then I ramp it up? Is that how it would go?[0:58:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I mean, that's effectively what we already do with the vagus nerve stimulation, the the doctor in this case. And I I have this some of my patients in the clinic, I do vagus nerve stimulation. I talk to them. I say, hi. I I go through the symptoms.[0:58:37] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I I use the psychiatric to elicit their internal states. And then I have a radio frequency controller that I can dial in[0:58:46] Andrew Huberman: in real time. Right there in real time. You're holding the remote control to essentially to their brain, although it's remote remote control.[0:58:51] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Through a couple steps. Yeah.[0:58:52] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah.[0:58:53] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And I can I can turn up I can turn up the frequency, I can turn up the intensity, all with the radio frequency and, control, and then it's it's reprogrammed or redosed, and then the patient can can then leave at this altered[0:59:08] Andrew Huberman: So this is happening now?[0:59:10] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: This is happening right now, electrically.[0:59:11] Andrew Huberman: You do this routinely?[0:59:12] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I do it routinely in my clinic, electrically. Yeah.[0:59:14] Andrew Huberman: And you're getting the Verbal content, which as you described earlier, is the indication of how well something is working in real time.[0:59:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yes.[0:59:23] Andrew Huberman: So this maybe you could just describe a little bit of the interaction with that particular patient or or another patient. What's a typical arc of, narrative as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation.[0:59:36] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: In most in most patients, the actual Therapeutic effects, the benefits actually take, many days to weeks. And so what I'm mostly focusing on in the office in real time is the stimulation for weeks or or or longer. And I I I talked about symptoms, how were things over the past, month, is your hope? How is your energy level, sleep? You know, how what is your mood?[1:00:07] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And and then we talk with the patient, we This is this is not yet where we'd like to be, and so then I can turn up the intensity of the stimulation real time in the office. I don't in most patients, I don't expect an immediate Mood change, what I do is I increase the the dose until to a next level up while asking the patient for Side effects, can you still breathe okay? Can you still swallow okay? And I can hear their voice as well, and and I can get a sense And[1:00:33] Andrew Huberman: you're looking at their face. And I'm[1:00:34] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: looking at their face. Yeah. And so I can get a sense is there a, am I in a still on a safe side effect regime? And I and and and then, you know, I I I stop at a particular point It looks safe, and then patient goes home, comes back a month later, and I get the report on how things were over that month.[1:00:53] Andrew Huberman: I asked, if you're looking at their face because in your book, you describe the incredible complexity of social interactions. And At one point, you described the incredible amount of information that the eyes Inform about the brain and and the context of somebody's inner experience, whether depressed or happy or otherwise.[1:01:16] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[1:01:17] Andrew Huberman: I wanna make sure that we get back to how to Maneuver them and manipulate the nervous system for sake of mental health. But what are you looking for? So as a vision scientist, I think, you know, pupils dilating is a sign of arousal, but that could be a positive arousal, positive valence, Like excitement or it could be terror. Yeah. You're gonna get the same dilation of the pupils.[1:01:42] Andrew Huberman: And and I'm always reminding people that these 2 little goodies are 2 pieces Brain, basically. They're just outside the cranial vault. So they're not unlike the Vegas in that sense, but they're more of a report than a control knob. Although, they I like to think they could be used as control knobs too. So without putting you on the spot, again, to diagnose me, not something I would never ask you to do, with the cameras rolling.[1:02:04] Andrew Huberman: But, what are you looking for that the patient might not be aware of? In other words, can you see depression in somebody's eyes? And if you know a patient or if you don't, can you see it in their body posture when they walk in? Realizing, of course, that a trained psychiatrist like yourself develops an intuitive sense that's aggregating lots of different features of a patient. Yeah.[1:02:28] Andrew Huberman: But what about the eyes? What's what's going on there? Yeah.[1:02:31] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: The eyes are incredibly rich in information, and, as you as you alluded Though it's not as if any one measurable conveys all the information you need, it's what we, you know, what an engineer would say, joint statistics. It's it's it's Many things all at once whether they're in synchrony or out of synchrony that that actually turns out to matter. And, you know the eye contact question, we all know eye contact is incredibly important. You don't feel you've connected with somebody unless There's eye contact, but eye contact can go awry too. It it can be, it can be too intense or it can be mistimed Or if there's, someone with autism, it can be barely there at all.[1:03:17] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And and this is one of the most Striking symptoms of autism is the, avoidance of of eye contact as if it's Almost as if it's a harmful quantity. And so there's an immense amount of information you get from the eyes. But it's It's the pairing of what's going on in the eyes with everything else going on, the body language, the verbal content What's what's coming out. All that together is is is is the art of psychiatry and and social interaction. But you know sometimes you don't have the eye contact.[1:03:55] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: This is an amazing thing and I do talk about this in the book as well. In in many cases, you know, in psychiatry sometimes it's over the phone that you have to make key decisions. And as a and I I recall vividly being as a resident, very often you have to take these Phone calls from, people who are not in the hospital. People you can't see. You know, you can't see their eye, you can't see their body, anything about them.[1:04:21] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: The sound of their voice, and you can ask them questions, and you have to make, in some cases, life or death decisions. You know, is this person truly Suicidal, something like that as it comes up all the time. And so I developed over the course of training, And I think all all psychiatrists do this is you develop a way to to whatever data stream you have, whether it's the eyes or whether it's just the sound of a voice coming over the phone, You learn to home in on that data stream you have and focus on it and identify changes, and It's quite amazing. I I found that you you can actually, if you know a patient, you can detect very it changes in mood just from the sound of the voice, and and you can have a a realization that, oh, this Depression has improved, you know, by by about half, just by the tone of their of their voice. And Same with eyes, you can with enough practice you can get enough information from a single data stream to give you some information.[1:05:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: But when you do have the whole picture, that, of course, is best.[1:05:29] Andrew Huberman: So, so many theories out there about, Excessive blinking and lying, lack of blinking and sociopathy. I like to remind people that, People have varying degrees of lubrication of the eyes, which also influence the frequency of blinking and presumably have nothing to do with, Whether or not what they're saying is true or not. But in incredible, nonetheless, that it's that the eyes are a portal to Overall arousal state, I'm fascinated by the effects of light on circadian biology and just overall desire to be awake or asleep, etcetera. So the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault. The Vegas is outside, the, the cranial vault, obviously.[1:06:11] Andrew Huberman: What about the goodies In here, Parkinson's, we know the at least one of the major sites of degeneration and failure that lead to those symptoms. Yeah. I can name off any number of other things. In your book, you talk about the beautiful work done with optogenetics of active versus passive coping. That there are areas of the brain like the Benula that make, when active, make animals and presumably people, passive and unwilling or uninterested in fighting back against pressures of life.[1:06:42] Andrew Huberman: Whereas another region, the raphe, you stimulate that, and and they actively cope. They they get their grit going, and they and they are able to lean into life. So how do how does one get to those structures in a in a focused way? And, What what is the next 2 to 5 to 10 years look like?[1:07:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. Well, this is the this is the promise on that, and it is on that Timescale, that I think things may start to play out. You know, the the specificity of optogenetics, It's really only useful if you have some idea of how to use that specificity. And It's an actually, it's a frustrating aspect of psychiatry that in many cases the most effective treatments we have Have the least specificity. Electroconvulsive therapy being a great example where you're causing a brain wide[1:07:34] Andrew Huberman: Which looks barbaric, but as you mentioned is effective.[1:07:37] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Mean, it is it it these days, it's it's much more clinically, you know, it's like[1:07:42] Andrew Huberman: look like 1 flu they're last seen in 1 flu over the cuckoo's nose.[1:07:45] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Now it's a very clinically safe and will procedure but I I what where I I I would say, yeah, it is it is it's got this almost medieval lack of of Specificity. Even if the procedure is well controlled and and clinically safe and stable, it it has a it's not very specific. You're causing a brain wide seizure. TJ, how how could you be less specific than that?[1:08:06] Andrew Huberman: And we don't know the the the source of the relief. We don't Presumably, it's a dump of neuromodulators like Dopamine and serotonin, but we don't[1:08:13] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: There certainly is a dump of neuromodulators. We don't know that that's the the the cause for the relief. And Likewise with medications, this is also an interesting thing. Some some of the most effective antidepressants, of the most effective anti psychotics are the ones that are have the most side effects and many examples of this. For example, the most effective anti psychotic It's something called Clozapine, which has it's unquestionably has the most side effects.[1:08:39] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It had terrible, terrible[1:08:40] Andrew Huberman: side effects. D four antagonist?[1:08:42] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It has Yeah. Basically every receptor.[1:08:44] Andrew Huberman: Does it really?[1:08:45] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. It acts Interesting. Yeah. It it has prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts on dopamine receptors, but, it causes, you know, blood, blood cell, counts[1:08:58] Andrew Huberman: to change. People feel So if if if, if I were schizophrenic and, I was getting auditory hallucinations, etcetera, and I took Clozapine, What could I expect to feel?[1:09:10] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, so you would notice, side effects, and you would notice resolution of of symptoms both.[1:09:16] Andrew Huberman: And So the voices would go away Yep. If in in a good situation, that's right. The voices would go away[1:09:21] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's right.[1:09:21] Andrew Huberman: But I would feel not good in my body?[1:09:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You would have, you might have dizziness. You might have drooling. You might have, any number of of, physical sensations that that would be due to these off target effects, the medication acting on these other receptors that[1:09:40] Andrew Huberman: And I'm certainly not suggesting this, but what if somebody without schizophrenia took Clozapine?[1:09:45] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: They had the same side Facts, presumably. Yeah. And so it would not be something that that I would recommend. Yeah.[1:09:50] Andrew Huberman: Do psychiatrists take the drugs that they prescribe? I just finished, for the 3rd time, Oliver Sacks'[1:09:57] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[1:09:57] Andrew Huberman: Autobiography, which is marvelous, and and I highly recommend to people. He certainly took a lot of drugs, Not as part of his professional role.[1:10:07] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[1:10:07] Andrew Huberman: But just out of curiosity, what is the interest or kind of role of of drugs In the field of psychiatry, because for I would imagine for a group of very curious introspective people who are making recommendations about what to take, There could actually be some benefit for understanding what the experience of those drugs was like for their patients.[1:10:27] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I think that's that's true. And I I will say that probably Many or most psychiatrists have, you know, sampled a number of these for exactly the reason that you're saying is is to understand better and to help Treat their patients better. And I've I've spoken to people who have, you know, really been, have found this very helpful to know, okay, this this sleep Disruption caused by this medication, or the libido disruption caused by this other medication. Wow, that is that is a big effect. And and and it really Helps with empathy for the for the patients to understand.[1:10:59] Andrew Huberman: I'm not I'm not suggesting that physicians or anybody, Experiment with drugs, but I but I am relieved to hear that because I think that when you're talking about accessing somebody's mind and their basic physiology, as you mentioned, Relate to appetite, libido, and sleep. You're really you're really, one is acting as a mechanic of of their the person's whole experience. They walk out of the office, and they have a A life experience, that extends beyond the script. Yeah. Yeah.[1:11:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so and yeah. And so that so at the same time, though, You can't let that completely guide your clinical decisions because as I mentioned, some of these medications that have the most side effects, they are also the most effective. And Clozapine is a great example. That will work in patients where nothing else works. And believe me, we don't take the step of of Clozapine, prescription lightly because of all these these side effects.[1:11:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You have to come in for a weekly blood cell, or or every few weeks a blood cell check to make sure that the blood counts are not off, for example, but there are patients where no other medication works for the schizophrenia and clozapine works amazingly well. And and and so we do it Even though there are side effects. And so then this comes back to your question, what if we had better and better specificity? Well, Only if we know exactly what we're doing is the point. And so because as we become more refined, we better be right about where we're refining to.[1:12:19] Andrew Huberman: And you imagine a day where it will be a single, maybe even outpatient neurosurgery would go in through the skull or the back of the ear, Deliver a small viral injection of one of these adenoviruses, a little sticker of light emitting diode. Is that, it deep in the brain? Is that how you envision this[1:12:36] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That that certainly could happen. What I what I actually prefer as a vision is is still medications, because, those are, you know, minimally invasive. If we knew what we were doing, we could make them more specific, have fewer side effects. But optogenetics that'll arm us with true causal understanding. And so we'll know, and we're already moving rapidly toward this like we'll know, okay, this symptom, the loss of pleasure in life that we call anhedonia or the loss of of motivation or Or or energy to overcome challenges, active coping.[1:13:15] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: These are largely subserved, Largely controlled by this circuit or that circuit or the cell that inhabits this other circuit.[1:13:24] Andrew Huberman: And we will know that because Of the work done with channel ops.[1:13:27] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Exactly.[1:13:27] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I agree.[1:13:28] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: In ways that we we never could have the confidence, otherwise. And so we'll know that this is the circuit that that underlies The symptom or its resolution. And then we'll get to understand these cells very deeply. Okay. These cells that are causal, that do matter.[1:13:46] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Who are they? What are they what's their wiring? What are the proteins that they make? What are the little Things that are on the surface of the cell that could be receptors for specific medications or combinations of receptors that would give us the specificity we need. And then armed with that causal and precise and rigorous knowledge, then you can imagine medication development becoming totally different.[1:14:11] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: No longer serendipitous, But truly grounded in causality.[1:14:15] Andrew Huberman: I see. So using channel options as a way to probe the circuitry and figure out the sites that are Disrupted, what patterns of activity are required. And then by understanding the constituents of those cells, like what they expressing what they make, then developing drugs that could target those cells. K. Not necessarily putting light inducing diodes into the brain or Right.[1:14:36] Andrew Huberman: Walking around with wire packs attached to our skull or something of that. So that's fantastic, and I and you I realized no one has a crystal ball, but, what do you think the arc of, of that is? Meaning, Are we gonna see that in a year, in 2 years, 3 years? In let me reframe that. If how soon will a pill based Treatment for a psychiatric disease be available that targets a specific set of cells that we know are important Because of the work done with channel absence.[1:15:11] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I think, that is in some ways, it's already Happening at the level of individual patients, and Here at Stanford. Yep. Yep. And and and more broadly in terms of, new new drugs, new multicenter, you know, clinical trials that'll play out over the next few years. And these could be drugs that are already safe and approved for other purposes, but we might say, okay, now we know That this medication, based on what we know from causal optogenetics, this could be useful for this other purpose, this psychiatric And so the path, to to helping patients is could be relatively swift.[1:15:58] Andrew Huberman: That's very exciting. What are your thoughts about, brain machine interface? And, Neuralink always comes up, although I do wanna point out Tremendous respect for the folks at Neuralink, including someone who came up through my lab is now there as a neurosurgeon. But, the brain machine interface is something That's been happening for a long time now. Some of the some of the best work, among the best work being done here at Stanford and elsewhere too, of course.[1:16:25] Andrew Huberman: How is the what you just described compatible with or different than brain machine interface? Meaning devices, little probes are gonna stimulate different patterns of activity and ensembles of neurons. And what are your general thoughts about, brain machine interface as going forward?[1:16:40] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep. I mean, this is, first of all, it's an it's an amazing, scientific discovery approach. As you mentioned, we and others here at Stanford are using, electrodes, collecting Information from tens of thousands of neurons. In humans, I should add. Yeah.[1:16:56] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. And even yes. There's there's, It is quite even separate from the Neuralink work. As you point out, many people have been doing this, in humans as well as in non human primates. And this is pretty, powerful.[1:17:10] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It's important. This will let us understand what's going on in the brain, in in psychiatric disease and neurological disease, it will give us ideas for for treatment. It is, of course, it's still, invasive. You still are talking about putting a device, into the brain, And that has to be treated as a as a as a situation that has some risks and and a step that has to be taken carefully. I see that as something that will be part of psychiatry, in in in the long run.[1:17:48] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Already with deep brain stimulation, approaches, we can help people with psychiatric disorders. And that's putting just a single electrode, not even a a complex, you know, closed loop system where you're both playing in and getting information back. Even just a single Stimulation electrode in the brain can help people with, OCD for example, quite powerfully. And that will become much more powerful when we get true brain machine interface collecting information back, stimulating only when you need to. If we could identify A pathological activity pattern, a particular almost like the the prodrome or the early stage of a seizure, maybe there are events that happen leading up to On some time scale, a psychiatric, symptom, we could intervene in a closed loop way, Detect what's happening, what's starting to go wrong, feed that back to the brain stimulation electrode, have it be, you know, in that way more efficient and more principled.[1:18:47] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: This is is, I think it's great. It's it's something that of course will be grounded again in causal understanding, we'll need to know what is that pathological pattern that we're detecting, and we need to know that it matters. And so again, that's where optogenetics is helping us. It's helping us know, okay, this This pattern of activity in these cells, in these circuits, this does mean that there's a particular kind of of of symptom that's happening. But armed with that knowledge, absolutely, even the even the simple closed loop device detect and stimulate is gonna be part of psychiatry in the future.[1:19:19] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And then and then of course, as you get To more cells, more connections, the ability that we have to help people will become more powerful.[1:19:27] Andrew Huberman: One of the questions I get asked a lot It's about, ADHD and attention deficit of various kinds. I have the hunch That, one reason I get asked so often is that people are feeling really distracted and and challenged in, funneling their attention and their behavior. But, and there are a number of reasons for that, of course. But what is true ADHD, and what Does it look like what can be done for it? And, what if any role for channel options or these downstream technologies that you're developing?[1:20:04] Andrew Huberman: What do they what do they offer for people that suffer from ADHD or have a family member that suffers from ADHD?[1:20:11] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. This is a pretty interesting branch of of psychiatry. There's no question that people have been helped by the the treatments. There's, you know, active, you know, debate over, you know, what fraction of people who have these symptoms, Can or should be be, treated.[1:20:29] Andrew Huberman: This is typically Adderall or stimulants of some kind.[1:20:32] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: For example, stimulants. That's right. ADHD it's as as its name suggest it has, symptoms of, it can have either hyperactive, state or an inattentive, state. And, those can be completely separate from each other. You can have a patient who who, effectively, is is not hyperactive at all but Can't, remain focused on the the what's going on around them.[1:20:57] Andrew Huberman: So their body can be still, but their their mind is darting around.[1:21:00] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's right.[1:21:01] Andrew Huberman: Or they can be very hyperactive with their body. Yeah. It happens both ways. Probably rarely is somebody hyperactive with their body, but their mind is still. Although I have to say, and this is a a benevolent shout out to Botan Raska, Bolton has an incredibly sharp and focused mind.[1:21:14] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[1:21:15] Andrew Huberman: And his hand movements are extremely exact also. So I do sometimes wonder whether or not Our body movements and our head movements are whether or not they're coordinated or not is a is a readout of of how directed our attention is.[1:21:27] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. I I notice I have to think complex abstract thoughts, I notice I have to be very still. So my body has to be almost completely Unmoving for me to think very abstractly and and deeply. Other people are different. Some people, when they're running, they get their best thoughts.[1:21:42] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I can't even imagine that. My brain does not work that way at all. I have to be totally emotionless, which is kind of interesting.[1:21:48] Andrew Huberman: How do you go about that?[1:21:50] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I I I sit much like this. You know, I I I try to have time in each day where I am I'm literally, sitting, Almost in this in this position, but but without distraction and and thinking. And and so it's kind of a it's almost meditative in some ways except it's it's not true meditation, but I I am thinking while not moving.[1:22:12] Andrew Huberman: You're struct you're trying to structure your thoughts in that time. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.[1:22:16] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. So but everybody, as you say, is is is very different. And so with with ADHD, you have the key thing is we wanna make sure that this is present across different domains of life, school and home, to show that it really is a pervasive pattern, and not something specific To, oh, you know, the teacher or the the home situation or something. And then you can help patients. It's interesting that that ADHD is one of those disorders where people are trying to work on quantitative EEG based diagnosis, and so there's some progress toward making up a diagnosis Looking at particular externally detectable brainwave, rhythms.[1:22:55] Andrew Huberman: So skull cap with some electrodes that don't penetrate the skull?[1:22:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's right.[1:22:58] Andrew Huberman: And this can be done in an hour or 2 hour session.[1:23:01] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep. That's right.[1:23:02] Andrew Huberman: Has to be done in the clinic. Right?[1:23:03] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. In the clinic. Right? You have to have the right recording apparatus and so on. But But but, that's in principle, as increasing confidence comes in exactly which measurements, one could even imagine moving towards, you know, home tests, but we're not there yet.[1:23:22] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. I think, one of the reasons I get asked about it so much is a lot of people wonder if they have ADHD. Do you think that some of the lifestyle factors that, Inhabit us all these days could induce a subclinical or a clinical like, ADHD. Meaning, if I look at people's phone use including my own, and I don't think of it like addiction. It looks to me and feels to be more like OCD.[1:23:46] Andrew Huberman: And I'll come clean here by saying when I was younger, when I was a kid I had a grunting tic. I used to hide it. I actually used to hide in the closet because my dad would make me stop. And I used to yeah. I couldn't feel any relief of my mind until I would do this.[1:24:00] Andrew Huberman: And actually now if I get very tired, If I've been pushing long hours, it'll come back.[1:24:05] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Interesting.[1:24:05] Andrew Huberman: I was not treated for it. Mhmm. But I will confess that I've had the experience of I always liked sports where I involve a lot of impact. Fortunately, not football Yeah. Because I went to a high school where the football team was terrible.[1:24:18] Andrew Huberman: Maybe that would have avoided more impact. But things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief. I feel clarity after a head hit, which I avoid. But, but I used to say that's the only time I feel truly clear for a and then eventually, it dissipated. By about age 16, 70, it just disappeared.[1:24:36] Andrew Huberman: So I have great, empathy for those that feel like there's something contained in them that won't allow them to focus on what they wanna focus on. And these days with the phone and and all these, email, etcetera, I I wonder and I empathize a bit when I hear people saying, like, I think I might have ADHD or ADD. Do you think it's possible that our behaviors and our interaction with the sensory world, Which is really what phones and email really are, could induce ADD or reactivate it?[1:25:08] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You know, I this is a great question. I I think about it a lot. There's, You know, and and you you mentioned this this, tic like behavior in in yourself. It's very common that people who have tics have this building up of something that can only be relieved By executing the the tic which can be a motor movement or or vocalization or even a thought. And and People do, I think, these days do have this if they haven't checked their phone in a while, they do have a build up and build up and build up until they can they can check it and relieve it.[1:25:38] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And and and there's some similarities, you know, there is a little reward that comes with the with the the the checking. But the the key question in all of psychiatry what we do is we we don't diagnose something unless It's disrupting what we call social or occupational functioning. Like you could have any number of symptoms, but Literally every every psychiatric diagnosis requires that it has to be disrupting someone's social or occupational functioning. And these days, you know, checking your phone is pretty adaptive. That pretty much helps your social and occupational functioning.[1:26:14] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so we can't We can't make we can't make it a a psychiatric diagnosis. Interesting. At least in the world of today.[1:26:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Opting out of communication now makes it, makes you in some ways less adaptive, though I would point to you as an example of somebody who, is quite good at managing his, interactions at least from the outsider perspective, I do wanna ask you a little bit about you. And, first of all, and I realize this is only a partial list, but, you're a clinician, you see patients, you run a big laboratory. How many people are in your laboratory now? That's a huge laboratory.[1:26:53] Andrew Huberman: From experience, I can say that's that's an enormous laboratory. You have a family of 5 children, and you're happily married, to a wonderful colleague of ours as well who does incredible work. How how do you organize at a kind of conceptual level the day and the week? And I should say, what stress mitigation practices, if any, do you incorporate? I've received emails from you at 3 in the morning.[1:27:24] Andrew Huberman: I sometimes send emails at 3 in the morning, but that's when I wake up. Maybe I'm depressed, but I go back to sleep. So maybe you just describe, the arc Of of the blocks of the day, not hour by hour, necessarily the details of what are in those blocks. But how do you conceptualize the day? How do you conceptualize the week?[1:27:43] Andrew Huberman: And how do you feel about how that's, lined up with your your larger goals of of, you know, making sure these 5, young people, you know, flourish, which I hear they are. But how how do you go about this? What for most people would just be an overwhelming set of of items?[1:28:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, it's, of course, it's Sometimes it's just take it day by day, and and, and so I I don't claim[1:28:10] Andrew Huberman: So you bring the horizon into the unit of the day?[1:28:13] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I I I do. I do. It's the unit is the day. Right. And, what I I try to have in each day, as I I mentioned earlier, some at least an hour of time where I can think.[1:28:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And and that can be it can be when kids are napping, it can be, you know actually because like While driving, I can do that too, because I'm sitting still. But, that That's the one thing I try to preserve. When I was writing the book, I adapted that time to be my my writing time, but it wasn't enough. It's, you know, So I had to add in a new block of time which was sort of midnight to 2 AM writing time. And and so that Carving out these even small protected times are very important.[1:29:04] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: There's of course, you know, obligations will We'll expand to fill the time available, and you have to be disciplined in my at least, I found I had to be disciplined in in truly protecting those, Times where where one can think.[1:29:18] Andrew Huberman: So that means no phone.[1:29:19] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That means no phone, no checking of the phone. I would you know, when I was writing the book, I would I would have, there's a focus mode on the the The, MacBook, which kind of removes the border and you just have your your your documents and it's it's very and you don't have, a a a temptation of of distraction.[1:29:43] Andrew Huberman: I'm a big believer in because the Vision in the eyes play such a prominent role in directing our cognition. Something you talk about in the book, really beautifully and with a lot of depth and rigor. Using visual tools to harness one's complete mental attention. When you do this practice of sitting and just thinking, sitting still and thinking, You said your eyes are open. Are you hearing your own verbal voice, although in[1:30:12] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: your head?[1:30:13] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So you're actually in conversation with yourself.[1:30:15] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yes. And and hearing literally I mean, not quite literally. I don't actually hear a phonation, but I I I'm hearing words. And so it's I've I've discovered this about myself. Other people, I think, you know, may operate Differently, but I'm extremely verbal in how I think.[1:30:32] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's how all my reasoning is done. It's with sentences and construction of Of, you know, almost equations with words. Complete sentences? Complete sentences or complete ish anyway. Mostly complete.[1:30:45] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And then And when writing the book, everything about the writing, I would always every sentence was always played out in mind listening for for rhythm and timing, and and and I would obsess over exact placement of of words to get the right rhythm of the spoken sentence in my in my mind.[1:31:04] Andrew Huberman: Could I I don't mean to interrupt your flow, but when you do that and having experienced this process a bit, although Differently, do you experience any kind of welling up of anxiety when you're hitting the the friction points? And if so, do you have tools or, ways that you quell that anxiety in real time? Because what we're really talking about here is, your mind. But we're really talking about is this process of of converting the activity of neurons into something physically concrete in the world, And these intermediate steps are so mysterious to everybody. We hear, you know, just write the book, just do it, what whatever that means.[1:31:43] Andrew Huberman: In fact, the statements like that to me are kind of empty and meaningless. But when you hear your voice and you're trying to find the correct word and you keep hitting It doesn't sound quite right. What is the experience in your body?[1:31:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. I when it's not right, it's definitely, it it's it's aversive. It doesn't feel good, but it's not, but I but there's also a hope because I know I can solve it too. And and so there's There's this, it it's almost like you're you're almost there. You know, you've there's a a path that you know is there.[1:32:19] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You you don't quite see it, but It's there. And and I I keep that in mind, and so there's there's a there's a there's this, propulsive force forward, because I know that the solution is there. And and that said, I you know, there were there were single words that would, you know, I would spend days on, you know, because I was Just not happy until I got it right. And there were some things that I never quite got perfect and so I left out of the book entirely because it was so close, But not not quite there. And so I again, I was like, no.[1:32:51] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I can't put that in.[1:32:53] Andrew Huberman: Everything you just said is entirely consistent with my experience of you and the way you go about, everything. I have to ask, are are your kids writers? Do they like books and words and and poetry? I I know one of your children is going on to a career in medicine and science.[1:33:09] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. They're they're each different, which is amazing, yet they all, I think, do have some appreciation Or a lot of appreciation for for for reading, but some are very musical. 2 of the 5 are extremely musical, very very talented with and singing and and vocal, you know, impressions, it's just astonishing. And and some of them are are great with drawing and and Artistry and and some are very physical and vigorous and and are never, happy except when, you know, weeping about. And so It's it's just amazing how different they are, honestly.[1:33:42] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: But but I think there is a a shared appreciation for for language.[1:33:46] Andrew Huberman: Do you think the, that one can train their mind in using these practices. I I really like your description of the, sitting staying physically still and and learning to grapple with those Those challenges, it's something that, especially in laboratory science, we aren't really trained to do. Like many professions, we're taught to come in and just get into motion, And and I found that very relaxing as someone who probably has an underlying, tic or something like that. It felt great to be in motion. One of the hardest things about Becoming a university professor and running a lab was that I no longer working with my hands, and it felt like I was I It felt like some big important part of my life had been amputated.[1:34:27] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. But what sorts of practices do you incorporate there? And do you think People can learn to get better at focusing through a dedicated practice of the sort that you described.[1:34:40] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I think, you know, I also, you know, I I I remember the rhythms of of physical work in the laboratory very well. I I, my work, you know, these days as as as the laboratory leader, my job has returned mostly to words now again, And so it's it's kind of coming full circle. I was, so it's a different mode. I think you just have to embrace that The different stages of life come with with different modes, but you can definitely train yourself for each mode. I was not, you know, I I I loved, you know, the as I mentioned, the the the rhythm of of sewing and and and suturing and and surgery.[1:35:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And I worked really hard on that and became, you know, good at it. And now, I I never do it, but it's what's the next challenge? You know, there's all the various experimental techniques, the techniques, the dissections of the brain, you know, I I can't tell you how many thousands of brain dissections I've done in my life, and now I don't do them[1:35:41] Andrew Huberman: And then you developed a method so that we don't have to dissect brains. I should mention maybe tell us for a moment about clarity. And for the for, people who We'll probably never set foot into a laboratory. What an incredible yet another incredible discover discovery and development clarity is, and why it helps us understand how the brain is structured.[1:36:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. So this is this is a different technology also developed in in my lab here, and it's part of a broader approach that we call hydrogel tissue chemistry. And what this is is it's building a gel like a clear jello like, substance with from within all the cells of a tissue, or even an animal all at once. So you're building a effectively building a gel inside all the cells at once. Now that's a odd thing to do.[1:36:31] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Why do we do it? Well, we do it, To transform the tissue into a more tractable, accessible, object. And the reason that works is we Having built this gel, this new infrastructure inside the tissue, we can then use chemical tricks and we can link the molecules we care about like Proteins or RNAs, which are the things, as you know, right before they become proteins, we can link them Physically, anchor them to this gel which is a scaffold, basically. It's an interlocking network of of polymers. We can link all these interesting molecules in place, lock them in where they were initially in the tissue, in the cell, in all the cells, And then we can remove very vigorously everything we don't care about that's blocking our light, that's blocking our molecules coming in to Exchange information with the tissue.[1:37:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: We can get rid of everything else like the lipids, the fats. We can effectively use detergents to To get them all out, and then we can see in all the things that we're absorbing or scattering light are gone. You can have a brain that's completely transparent, And yet, all the interesting molecules are still locked into place there at the cellular and subcellular level. And so this is hydrogel tissue chemistry. The first form we described was called CLARITY.[1:37:50] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: We use that, quite a bit still, but there are many variants now that we and others have developed on this basic concept of building It's gel within the tissue and anchoring molecules into place.[1:38:00] Andrew Huberman: Literally glass clear brains. I've done this. I've taken a brain cleared with this method Yeah. And looked at somebody through it. And, although you don't wanna get it too close to your eye, you don't wanna touch it to your own eye, but, and you can see direct all the way through it.[1:38:13] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yep.[1:38:16] Andrew Huberman: That's incredible for the it raises an important question, which is, again, about the human brain. I mean, as somebody who essentially started out in neuroanatomy and then got into other things, I I always I'm, bothered by the fact that we actually know very little about the microstructure of the human brain compared to the brains of other Organisms.[1:38:38] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah.[1:38:38] Andrew Huberman: And in thinking about understanding the circuitry and the the piano, so to speak, that and how to manipulate it in order to, Relief suffering. One wonders are the structures in these animal brains, and how they behave in active coping, passive coping, ADD, etcetera, those models, how well they translate To the human condition. Do you think it's fair to say that there are entire regions of the human brain that aren't just bigger, but that exist only In the brains of humans, especially given that we have this speech. Although, I do wonder sometimes if, you know, animals are reporting to each other there. Maybe they have little psychiatric sessions with one another.[1:39:22] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: You know, I I I'm always careful to not, assume we do things better. We certainly understand what we're doing better than we understand, what animals are doing, and and they certainly do things better than than we do. That said, we do have, amazing wonderful brains and many structures that are very highly developed in our brains that are are are not nearly so developed in mice and, and fish for example. Now, that said, when I look at the big picture, you know, what what is the mammalian brain really doing? There are things that you would never have thought we could study in in animals, in in laboratory mammals like mice, That it turns out you can actually.[1:40:05] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And and so I would never draw the line and say here's something you can't study in mice, or here's something that Has no parallel in mice. I would be very careful before making any any statement like that. A good example of that is we've been able to study just in the past year, come to an understanding know, dissociation and both we had a paper that came out in late 2020, both mouse and human work, In which we got to the sort of the circuit basis for dissociation. What now, what is dissociation? A lot of people Might not have experienced it, but it's actually very common.[1:40:40] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: More than 70% of people who've been through trauma Experience dissociation, it shows up in borderline personality, it shows up in PTSD. What it is is a separation of the sense of self From the body. And so you can have someone who's it's not as if you're numb, you're not anesthetized, you can still you know that something's happening to the body, But you you just don't care because you don't ascribe it to yourself, which is very interesting. Right? That is how interesting is that?[1:41:09] Andrew Huberman: The self report narrative.[1:41:10] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. Yeah.[1:41:11] Andrew Huberman: Almost in your book, you touch on this, and I I will say is the most, precise and meaningful and eloquent description of what might be consciousness, This this narrative toward the self or of the self and where it might reside. So in dissociative conditions, people are Our feeling is kind of an absence of a merge between mind and body. Right.[1:41:33] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Is that[1:41:34] Andrew Huberman: one way to describe it?[1:41:35] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's right.[1:41:35] Andrew Huberman: And as I recall, this paper involved, an exploration of Ketamine.[1:41:39] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Ketamine was a big part of it. Yeah. That's right. And so Ketamine is is another one of those cases where people can experience dissociation. Ketamine or PCP, we call these the dissociative, Drugs, they cause it just like these these other psychiatric conditions can cause it.[1:41:54] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so we but we were able to manifest this In in mice, administering these dissociative agents in mice, we could make them still able to detect stimulus but not care that it was was happening. All the while we were recording the activity of individual cells in the brain to see what was going on, what what was happening along with This dissociation, and then use optogenetics to see that it mattered, to actually provide that pattern of activity and see, oh, that actually causes the dissociation. So we could do all that in mice, which which was, you know, just, who would have thought that that you could study something like this in mice? And we are able to go back and forth with, human, work because here at in our Stanford comprehensive epilepsy center, there are there's a lot of what we call Stereo EEG recording. Patients who come in and in the course of normal clinical care, they have electrodes recording in their brain to identify where the seizure is So they can, be candidates for removing a little patch of the brain that's causing a seizure.[1:42:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: This is done for patients who medications are not helping their seizure disorder. And there was a a patient who had a dissociative state before every seizure. So this is a human being who was really dissociating, who could us literally as it was happening, and we could see this pattern, the same pattern that was happening in the mice in the same patch of the brain. We could see that happening in the human being at exactly the right time, in the same patch of the brain that's homologous across these immense evolutionary distances. And we knew that it mattered too both in mouse and human because in the human, we could cause it to happen.[1:43:34] Andrew Huberman: And I just wanna underscore the power of not just, that I wanna underscore the power of of optogenetics and the ability to not just remove a particular Experience or behavior by lesioning or destroying, but then to go back and and actually activate the same structure or group of structures and see the emergence. So it's Essentially, these days, you hear a lot about gain of function research in the context of viral manipulation, but gain of function is something that we do in the laboratory and and and, you do in patients To both take away something and put it back and which gives you causality.[1:44:09] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's right. Yeah. And so and exactly. And so with optogenetics, we were able to provide, in animals without being on any any ketamine or any any drug, and we could cause the dissociative state by playing in a precise pattern of activity. And that who would have thought you could do that, but there was a a combined mouse and human paper.[1:44:26] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Likewise likewise, we've been able to play in, you know, visual sensations into the brains of of mice. And by observing which cells In the visual part of the brain, visual cortex are naturally responsive to, for example, vertical bars instead of horizontal bars in the visual world. We could see which cells were normally reporting on vertical bars, and then we could use optogenetics to come and play in Activity just to those cells[1:44:56] Andrew Huberman: So these animals are not viewing anything.[1:44:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Not viewing anything at all, and we could activate just the vertical bar cells and not only did the animal act as if it was seeing a vertical bar behaviorally, it was trained to do a particular thing if it saw a vertical bar, and Did that just as if it was seeing something visually. But everything in the brain that we were recording too, the internal representation of this External world was naturalistic too. It looked like the the the the brain was seeing something visual. So that was another that's Gain of function too, you know, playing in, providing a complex sensation or percept that wasn't there before, and we can do that in, you know, across species. So I I we haven't, you know and of course, mice are social, and and they do they do amazing acts of information processing, and and so I'm I don't, I try not to disparage our our cousins, too much.[1:45:46] Andrew Huberman: They certainly have helped the field of neuroscience and medicine, I should mention. And I know that people have various sensitivities about animal research, but The work that's been carried out in mice has been absolutely, vital and instructional for the for Treatment of human disease.[1:46:02] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's right.[1:46:04] Andrew Huberman: Since we talked about dissociation and dissociative, States rather. And Ketamine, I'd love your thoughts on, psychedelic medicine. You know, I, sort of half joke having grown up in this area, Northern California, when it was much more counterculture than it is now, That many of the things that we're hearing about now, at least from my read of the of the history books, Happened before. There was a movement, aimed at taking the very same compounds essentially, putting them into patients or People were obviously using them recreationally, but putting them into patients and seeing tremendous positive effects, but also, Tremendous examples of, induced psychiatric illness. In other words, many people lost their minds as a consequence of overuse of psychedelics.[1:46:54] Andrew Huberman: I'll probably lose a few, people out there, but I do wanna talk about what is the state of these compounds? And I Realize it's a huge category of compounds, but LSD and psilocybin, as I understand, trigger activation of particular serotonin receptor mechanisms May or may not lead to more widespread activation of the brain more that one wouldn't see otherwise. But when you look at the clinical and experimental literature, What is your sort of top contour sense of how effective these tools are gonna be for treating depression? And then We have at the time we get to talk about trauma and MDMA and some of that work.[1:47:32] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Well, you're you're right to highlight both the opportunity and and the peril that is there, and of course, we wanna help patients, and of course, we want to to explore anything that Might be be helpful, but we wanna do it in a safe and and rigorous way. But I I do think we should explore These these avenues, these are, agents that alter reality and alter the experience of reality I should say. In in relatively precise ways, they they do have problems, they can be addictive, they can cause lasting change that is not desirable. But we have to see these as opportunities. We have to, first of all, study in the laboratory, and I'm doing this, here, you know, we have big, we have safes with many interesting psychedelics that are all very carefully regulated.[1:48:24] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: We get Inspections from the DEA and so on.[1:48:27] Andrew Huberman: If anyone's hoping to find these labs, they exist in outer space, so you need, you need to be on board one of the One of the SpaceX, missions in order to access them, so don't try and confine them.[1:48:36] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: No. That's exactly true. Yes. And and, And and we're doing exactly this. We're we're saying this is an incredible opportunity.[1:48:43] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: If we could understand how, you know, The perception of reality is altered. We could be create new kinds of intervention that don't have the, risks and and and and The problems of of causing lasting change or or addiction. Now that said, even As these medications exist now, as you know, there's, an impulse to to use them in very small doses and to use them as adjunctive, treatments for For the therapy of of various kinds, and I'm also supportive of that if done, you know, carefully and rigorously. Of course there's risk, but there is risk with Many other kinds of of treatment, and I'm not sure that the risks, for these, medications, vastly We outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate in other branches of medicine.[1:49:32] Andrew Huberman: Why would they work? I mean, the, you know, let's say, That indeed their main effect is to create more, more connectivity, at least in in the In the moment, between brain areas. So, the way I think about a very, I think about the 2 extremes of of my Experience, anyways, a high degree of stress and focus for whatever reason is going to make create changes in my visual field and Changes in the way that I perceive time so that I'm gonna micro slice time. I might I'm in a very contracted view of whatever my experience is. Whereas on the opposite extreme, in a in a dream or in sleep, space and time are very fluid, and I'm essentially relaxed.[1:50:15] Andrew Huberman: Although it might be a very interesting might not be. Psychedelics seem to be a a trajectory. I'm not off too far off from the dream state where space and time are essentially not as rigid. And there is this element of synesthesia, blending of the senses. You know, feeling colors and, hearing, light and things of that sort.[1:50:40] Andrew Huberman: It you hear these reports anyway. Why would having that dreamlike experience somehow relieve depression Long term. Is it do we have any idea why that might be?[1:50:53] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. We have some ideas No no deep understanding. One way I I think about the psychedelics is they, Increase our willingness to they increase the willingness of our brain to accept, unlikely Ways of constructing the world, unlikely hypotheses as it were as to what's going on. The brain in particular, our cortex I think is a Hypothesis generation and testing machine. It's coming up with models about everything.[1:51:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It's got a lot of bits of data coming in, and it's Making models and updating the models and changing them, theories, hypothesis for what's going on. And some of those never reach our conscious mind. And this is something I talk about in Projections in the in the book, quite a bit is many of these are filtered out before they get to our our conscious mind, and that's good. We we think how distracted we'd be if we were constantly having to evaluate all these, you know, hypotheses about, you know, what kinds of shapes or objects or processes were out there. And so a lot of this is is handled, before it gets to consciousness.[1:51:59] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: What the psychedelics seem to do is they Change the, threshold for us to become aware of these incomplete hypothesis or wrong hypothesis or Or concepts that might be noise, but are just wrong, and so are never allowed to get into our our conscious mind. Now, you know, that that's pretty interesting and it goes wrong in psychiatric disorders. I think, in schizophrenia, sometimes the paranoid, delusions that people have are examples of these, poor models that escape in Help with something like depression. Patients with depression often are, are stuck. They they can't, look into the future world of possibilities as effectively.[1:52:58] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: There's everything seems, Hopeless. And what does that really mean? They they discount the value of their own action. They discount the value of The world at giving rise to a future that matters, everything seems to run out like a river just running out into a desert and drying up. And What these agents may do that increase the the flow through circuitry if you will, the percolation of activity through circuitry may I end up doing for depression is increasing the the the escape of some some tendrils of of of process of of forward progression through through the world.[1:53:38] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: That's a concept. It's how I think about it. There are ways we can make that rigorous. We we can indeed identify in the brain by recording. We can see cells that represent steps along a path and look into the future.[1:53:54] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And we can rigorously define these cells And we can see if these are altered on psychedelics. And so that's one of the reasons that we're, working with these agents in the laboratory to say, are is this really the case? Are these opening up new paths, or or representations of paths into the future. Mhmm.[1:54:13] Andrew Huberman: MDMA, ecstasy is a unique compound, and that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And I realized that the neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin often work in concert, not alone, the way they're commonly described in the, You know, the more general popular discussions. However, it is a unique compound, and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin. And there are now data, still emerging that it might be, and and in some cases, can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD, and and similar things. Why why would that work?[1:54:59] Andrew Huberman: And do you and a larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, All those compounds, they're to in my mind, there are 2 components. There's the experience you have while you're on them, and then there's the effect they have after. People are generating variations of these compounds that are non hallucinatory variations. But How crucial do you think it is to have the let's stay with MDMA. The experience of Huge levels of dopamine, huge levels of serotonin, atypical levels of dopamine and serotonin released, having this highly abnormal experience in order to be normal again.[1:55:39] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Yeah. I think the brain learns from those experiences. That's that's the way I see it. And and so, for example, people on who've taken MDMA, They will as you say, they'll have they'll be the acute phase of being, you know, on the the the drug and experiencing this extreme connectedness With other people for example. And then the the drug wears off and but the brain learned from that experience.[1:56:06] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so what What people will report is, yeah, I'm not I'm not in that state, but I saw what was possible. You know, I saw it. Yeah. You can There don't need to be barriers or at least not as many barriers as as I thought. I can connect with more people in a in a way that That is helpful.[1:56:23] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so I think it it it's the learning that happens in that state that actually, matters.[1:56:29] Andrew Huberman: And this as you described that, that sounds a lot like what I understand to be the hallmark Feature of really good psychoanalysis that the relationship between patient and therapist hopefully evolves to the point where, these kinds of tests can be run within the context of that relationship and then exported Yeah. To other relations.[1:56:47] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Is that Exactly right. Yeah.[1:56:49] Andrew Huberman: And and that probably, I'm assuming it's still the goal of really good psychiatry also.[1:56:53] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It's a part of,[1:56:54] Andrew Huberman: it The intimacy, really.[1:56:56] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: It it should be. When when we have Time, I think all all good psychiatrists try to achieve that that level of of of connection and learning. Try to help Patients, create a new a new model that is stable, that is learned, and that that can, help instruct future behavior.[1:57:16] Andrew Huberman: One of the things that I, took from reading your book in addition to learning so much science and the future of psychiatry and brain science was, You know, amidst these men it may cause very tragic cases and and sadness, and a lot of the The, the weight that that puts on the clinician, on you also, that there's a that there's a central chord of of optimism. That where we're headed is, not just, possible, but very likely and and better. Yeah. And, you know, are you an optimist?[1:57:53] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: I am. And this this is by the way, this was a really interesting experience in writing projections because I had a a a dual goal. I wanted it to be for everybody, literally everybody in the world who wants to To to to to read it. And yet at the same time, I wanted to, stay absolutely rigorously Close to the the science, what was actually known, when I was speaking about science, when I was speaking about the the neurobiology of the of the brain or or psychiatry. I wanted to to not have any of my scientific colleagues think, oh, he's He's going too far, he's saying too much.[1:58:33] Dr. Karl Deisseroth: And so I had these these 2 goals which I kept on my mind the entire time, and and a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word we talked about was On this path of staying excruciatingly rigorous in the science, and yet letting people see the hope, the the Where things were, have everybody see that we've come a long way, we have a long way to go, but but the Trajectory and the the path is is beautiful. And so that that that was the the goal. I I think, You know, of course, that sounds almost impossible to to jointly satisfy those 2 those 2 goals, but I I kept that in my mind the whole way through. And, yes, I am optimistic, and I hope that came through in the book.[1:59:16] Andrew Huberman: But it certainly did.
