I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Noam Sobol. Doctor Noam Sobal is a professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. His laboratory studies olfaction and chemosensation.[0:00:27] Andrew Huberman: Olfaction is, of course, our sense of smell. Chemo sensation is our ability to respond to chemicals in our environment. Today, you are going to learn some Absolutely incredible facts about how you interact with the world and other people around you. For instance, you will learn that humans can smell things around them as well as dogs can. In fact, humans are incredibly good at sensing the chemical world around them.[0:00:51] Andrew Huberman: You also learn, for instance, that every time you meet somebody, you are taking chemicals from that person, either from the chemical cloud that surrounds them or directly from the surface of their body, and you are actually applying it to your own body and you are processing information about that person's chemicals To determine many things about them, including how stressed they are, their hormone levels, things that operate at a subconscious level on your brain and nervous system, and the impact your emotions, your decision making, and who you choose to relate to or not to relate to. You also learned that tears, yes, The tears of others are impacting your hormone levels in powerful ways. You will also learn that every so often, Actually, on a regular schedule, there is an alternation of ease through which you can breathe through 1 nostril or the other, And that alternation reflects an underlying dynamic of your nervous system and has a lot to do with how alert or sleepy you happen to be. The list of things that doctor Noam Sobel's laboratory has discovered that relate to everyday life and that are going to make you say, wow. I Can't believe that happens, but then go out into the real world and actually observe that that happens in ways that are incredibly interesting.[0:02:05] Andrew Huberman: Just goes on and on. In fact, his laboratory discovered That we are always sensing our own odors. That's right. Even though you might not notice your own smell, you are always sensing your own odor cloud. And Throughout the day, you periodically smell yourself deliberately, even though you might not realize it, in order to change your cognition and behavior.[0:02:26] Andrew Huberman: I first learned of doctor Sobel's laboratory through a rather odd observance. That observance took place when I was a graduate student many years ago at UC Berkeley. The time, Noam Sobol was a professor at UC Berkeley. As I mentioned before, he has since moved to the Weizmann. Well, I was walking through the Berkeley campus, and I saw people on their hands and knees, But with their head very close to the ground and their eyes were covered, their hands were covered, their mouths were covered, and only their nose was exposed.[0:02:53] Andrew Huberman: And what I was observing Was an experiment being conducted by the Sobel Laboratory in which humans were following a scent trail. That scent trail was actually buried Some depth underneath the earth, and yet they could follow that sent trail with a high degree of fidelity. It was from that experiment and other experiments done in doctor Sobel's at Berkeley and at the Weizmann involving neuroimaging and a number of other tools and techniques that revealed the incredible power of Human olfaction and humans' ability to follow scent trails if they need to. And that, of course, led to many other important discoveries, some of which I alluded to a few moments ago, But you are going to learn about many, many other important discoveries in the realm of olfaction and chemosensation that have been carried out by doctor Silber's laboratory the course of today's episode. And by the end of today's episode, I assure you that you will never look at or smell the world around you the same way again.[0:03:46] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality.[0:04:09] Andrew Huberman: I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. ROKA eye glasses and sunglasses were designed with the biology of the visual system in mind. So no matter whether or not you're wearing them for sport, whether or not you're wearing them for work or for socializing, you can always see with crystal clarity. Their glasses are extremely lightweight, so most of the time you don't even realize that you're wearing them. I wear ROKA readers at night and sometimes when I drive at night.[0:04:36] Andrew Huberman: And I wear ROKA sunglasses throughout the day, except, of course, I do not wear them for my morning sunlight viewing. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, Go to Roka, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics, and nootropics is a word that I do not like because it means smart drugs.[0:05:03] Andrew Huberman: As a neurobiologist, I can tell you that there is no neural circuit in your brain for being smart. There are neural circuits for focus. There are neural circuits for memory. There are neural circuits for creativity, And there are neural circuits for task switching. Thesis understands that there's a diversity of neural circuits that support different brain body states And therefore, design nootropics that are customized to achieve specific brain body states.[0:05:25] Andrew Huberman: If you go to the thesis website and take a brief Quiz. They will design a nootropic starter kit. Some of those nootropics that they'll send you are designed to enhance your focus, others for clarity, others for creativity, and so on. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, you can go to take thesis.com/huberman And take a 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month. That's takethesis.com/huberman use the code Huberman at checkout to get 10% off your first order.[0:05:52] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes customized mattresses and pillows that allow you to get the best possible night sleep. So if you go to the Helix website, you can take a very brief quiz. It only takes about 2 minutes and answer questions Such as do you tend to sleep on your back or your side or your stomach? Do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?[0:06:11] Andrew Huberman: Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions, but they'll match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. For me, that was the Dusk, d u s k mattress, which is not too firm and not too soft. And I've been sleeping on it for more than 2 years, and it's the best sleep that I've ever had. If you'd like to try a Helix mattress, go to helix sleep.com/huberman. Take that 2 minute quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress, And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and 2 free pillows.[0:06:36] Andrew Huberman: Again, if you're interested, you can go to helix sleep.com/huberman for up to $350 off and Two free pillows. And now for my discussion with doctor Noam Sobel. Doctor Sobel, Noam, welcome. Thank you. Must say, I am Extremely excited for this conversation.[0:06:52] Andrew Huberman: I've been a huge fan of your work for more than a decade or two. Yes. Kind of frightening. Yeah. But yeah.[0:07:00] Andrew Huberman: We Overlapped at UC Berkeley some time ago, although we did not meet.[0:07:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: And we lived in the same apartment.[0:07:07] Andrew Huberman: And we just learned that The amazing apartment that you moved out of was the apartment that my girlfriend and I at the time moved into in 2006, I believe. So, We've shared quite a few things. Apparently. And today, I'd love for you to share with us, All about the amazing landscape of chemo sensation, in particular, olfaction or sense of smell, and some related Perceptual abilities or subconscious abilities, including pheromones, etcetera. To get everybody on the same page, I'd like to just start off by asking, What are the major components of our ability to smell?[0:07:47] Andrew Huberman: Obviously, where I like to think it involves the nose at some level.[0:07:50] Dr. Noam Sobel: It does.[0:07:51] Andrew Huberman: To what extent is that mixed in with other senses like taste? And perhaps more importantly, what about the Chemicals that we are sensing through this thing, and for those of you listening, and not watching, I'm tapping my nose, that we are not aware of. You know, the the chemicals that are that we're inhaling and, making sense of without our awareness. Now if you could just, give us the top contour or even deep contour, if you like, of the, the parts list and the, various roles they play.[0:08:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you you've asked a lot of questions at once. You know, I'll start with a little comment on the way you you you said smelling through our nose, which we indeed do, but we also Smell through our mouth, actually. There's a process referred to as retronasal olfaction where, odorants come up through our the back of our throat and Out of our nose, the reverse way. And we smell things that way as well. And in fact, a big part of the contribution of olfaction to Food and taste comes from that, from retronasal olfaction.[0:08:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: But, primary olfaction is Referred to as orthonasal olfaction that is through our nose, we sniff, and sniffing is a big thing. Well, I have a sense we might talk about that a lot today in all sorts of contexts. So we sniff in through our news. And to answer your general question of the organization of the system, so molecules, Airborne molecules travel up our nose a distance in the human of about 6 or 7 centimeters to about here Where they interact with I will use use the word sheet of receptors, but sheet is a bit misleading here. It's not a sheet.[0:09:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's very convoluted. We have about 7,000,000 such receptors, lining a structure known as the olfactory epithelium. This is the sensory surface of the olfactory system, the olfactory epithelium. Again, about probably about 6 or 7,000,000 receptors in the human. In the human, probably of about 350 different kinds.[0:09:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: So that's amazing. That means a a Meaningful percentage of your genome is devoted just to this, just to the kinds of olfactory receptor subtypes you have in your nose. The way, I can share an amusing story. I would imagine amusing stories are good for podcasts. So that number of 6 or 7,000,000 receptors It is probably not very well grounded.[0:10:19] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's hard to count, but it's reasonably grounded. And there was this thing roaming around in the literature about bloodhounds having 1,000,000,000 receptors in their nose, which is why they're so amazing. And this number was you know, it sort of propagated through the literature. And and our lab, has written over the years a Few review chapters, and and we were repeatedly writing the olfaction chapter for a very large one of these large textbooks, the Handbook of cognitive neuroscience, I think it's called. And and we had that in there as well somewhere.[0:10:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and One time when we're renewing the chapter for a new version of the book, I told the graduate student who is leading that at the time, Araya Sharoun, she's now a a professor at Tel Aviv University. I told her, check that check that reference out. Where in the world did that come from? And we started going back and back and back, and it turns out it comes from a textbook, An Australian textbook. And we found the author of the textbook, and and we wrote her.[0:11:22] Dr. Noam Sobel: And I said, look. There's this thing in in the literature Of a 1000000000 receptors in in the bloodhound, where did that come from? And and surprisingly, she answered me. And, you know, I was hoping to get a reference. Right?[0:11:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: But it wasn't reference. And and this is where it really becomes funny for us because she said, I I I was once, at a lecture of, an olfaction geneticists geneticist by the name of Duron Lancet. And he said that in the lecture. Now this is really funny because she's in Australia. This is all over the world, this number.[0:11:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: And I'm writing her from Israel, and Durham Lasset is in the building next to me. Okay. He's in in Weizmann Institute Genetics. I mean, he used to be he's he's retired now. And and he he had meaningful contributions in the history of wolf action.[0:12:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I picked up the internal phone and and I said, hey, Doran. You know, did you say that there's a 1000000000 receptors in the bloodhound news? And he said, what's a bloodhound? And so this is totally made up. Right?[0:12:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: It totally made up and it propagated. I mean, you can you can probably go into Google And type, like, a 1000000000 receptors in the bloodhound, and and you'll get a lot of hits. But there was absolutely no evidence for that.[0:12:33] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. And not just amazing in light of what it it tells us about olfaction in bloodhounds or otherwise, but amazing because it sheds light on Just how much of what is in textbooks, scientific and medical is absolutely wrong.[0:12:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: Things things propagate, And and, you know, you set yourself in. Right? So we fix that in in that version of the of the and and so to finish the line so that so so odorants interact with these receptors, here in our epithelium, where they undergo what is referred to as transduction, that is deodorants are Dock at a receptor and turn into a neural signal or or enforce the receptor to respond in a neural signal. And, this neural signal, in fact, action potentials, not gradient potentials of any kind, propagates, via the olfactory nerve. Now this is a nerve that goes from our epithelium, right here behind the forehead.[0:13:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. No. It well, yeah. Yeah. Here, through, the thinnest part of our skull, an area referred to as the cribriform plate, which is perforated.[0:13:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: It has a lot of holes. The nerve goes through those holes and synapses at the 1st target in the brain, which is the olfactory bulb. In humans, that forms an interesting, point of sensitivity, because a lot of people Lose their sense of smell due to trauma, because of that structure.[0:13:58] Andrew Huberman: They a head hit type trauma.[0:13:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: Well, yes. Although, you denoted hitting on the front of the head, which is where all this real estate is, but actually, the more common cause for losing your sense of small for trauma is the back of the head Because of what's referred to as a contreco injury. So as your listeners probably know, our brain is floating in liquid in CSF, in cerebral Spinal fluid inside our skull. And when we get in the back of the head, the brain has this forward and backward movement in the liquid In in the skull, it sort of crashes. It can crash against the front of the skull, which is why you also have in a contract windry, you also often have frontal damage.[0:14:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: But what happens is that this generates a shearing motion on the cribriform plate, and the olfactory nerve is severed. And if it's completely severed, It's it's lost.[0:14:49] Andrew Huberman: Forever because my my understanding is that the olfactory sensory neurons can are among the few central nervous system neurons in Adult humans that can regenerate So or replenish themselves.[0:15:01] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right. So so I'll I'll again, there are a few questions in the[0:15:03] Andrew Huberman: That's okay.[0:15:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: We will So first[0:15:04] Andrew Huberman: of all We will spin many Plate simultaneously.[0:15:07] Dr. Noam Sobel: Completely severed completely, then, yes, you're lost. Forever. Yeah. If it's completely severed. Because even if you'll have regeneration at the basal cell level at the epithelium, they won't manage to find their way back, to the bulb.[0:15:23] Dr. Noam Sobel: If if you have partial or something left or something shows up In a short while after the injury, then you have a good chance of recovery.[0:15:33] Andrew Huberman: Because they grow along the trajectory of the other axons, sort of pioneering the way for them.[0:15:37] Dr. Noam Sobel: Assumingly. Yeah. Interesting. And and so so, basically and and, basically, the time frame and, you know, it's funny. I get a lot of emails on this.[0:15:45] Dr. Noam Sobel: Although I'm not a medical doctor, but but I get a lot of emails from people who have lost their sense of smell because it's very distressing. And now more people know this because of COVID, That it's very distressing. And and, basically, the rule of thumb is that if you don't get it back within a year to a year and a half, you'll never, get it back.[0:16:03] Andrew Huberman: My my understanding of the statistics on olfactory loss in COVID and and and other viral type infections is that, first of all, I had I experienced that when I got COVID.[0:16:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: Including total anosmia?[0:16:15] Andrew Huberman: For one day and not total. It was just there was a remnant of an ability to to smell We're sent or perceived the smell of a lemon, and I was huffing as hard as I possibly could.[0:16:25] Dr. Noam Sobel: So[0:16:26] Andrew Huberman: I actually, there's an over the counter Remedy, and this is not, pseudoscience because there's a number of papers published about this on PubMed that alpha lipoic acid can accelerate the recovery of of of smell. Yeah. And I and so that's something that, it worked successfully for me. I'm not saying that that's the only or route[0:16:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: know if it worked successfully for you or if you recovered anyway. I mean, you didn't do a control experiment.[0:16:48] Andrew Huberman: That I was not willing to do the control experiment. Exactly. Yeah.[0:16:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: That that let me say 2 things on this front. 1st, the dean on the alpha lipoic acid is.[0:16:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's it's not overwhelming. Yeah. But but losing your sense of smell is overwhelming. Hey.[0:17:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. No. No. I know. So so I think people feel desperate.[0:17:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: One word about the smelling the lemon, and this is, I'll take that opportunity to to, share more information. When we smell things, It's the result of more, sensory subsystems in the olfactory system alone. So you have several chemosensory sensitive nerves in your nose. A primary one beyond the olfactory nerve is the trigeminal nerve, the 5th cranial nerve. So the trigeminal nerve has Sensory endings in your nose, in your throat, and in your eye.[0:17:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: It has 3 branches. That's why an onion has smell and burns your eyes and burns in your throat. Is that what? Trigeminal. Yeah.[0:17:40] Andrew Huberman: The tearing of of cutting an onion is Trigeminal. It's a trigeminal reflex. Amazing. We talked about trigeminal in the context of headache During a headache episode.[0:17:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's a trigeminal reflex. So the lemon you were smelling may have been a trigeminal sensation.[0:17:55] Andrew Huberman: So smelling the lemon with my eyes is what you're saying?[0:17:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: Well no. With your nose. And with my nose. But with your trigeminal receptors and not your olfactory receptors. So in within, you know, olfaction researcher jargon, there's what we refer to as pure olfactants.[0:18:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: These are odors that will stimulate your olfactory nerve alone. They won't influence your trigeminal nerve at all. And an example just to get a sense of That might be would be, the coffee right here, is a purofactant. Vanilla is a known purofactant. These things have no trigeminal activation.[0:18:28] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right.[0:18:29] Andrew Huberman: As long as we're on this topic and we'll weave back and forth, but I'm glad we are on this topic because a tremendous number of people wrote to me during the pandemic and continue to about Olfactory loss. Is the I I've heard of this olfactory training where whereby if you have a partial or even a Complete loss of of primary olfaction Right. That, one is encouraged to smell of a number of different smells. I I grew up Studying activity dependent wiring of the nervous system, it makes total sense to me why keeping neurons active keeps them alive. So this is not fire together, wire together type I think by the way, that's a quote from Carla Schatz, not Donald Head folks or me.[0:19:09] Andrew Huberman: But this is about keeping neurons electrically active, this case, olfactory neurons in order to maintain their connections because otherwise, they will die.[0:19:19] Dr. Noam Sobel: Olfaction is a definite use it or lose it system. And so that makes total sense. And, indeed, there's very strong evidence for success of of, the training programs more than the alpha lipoic acid. Right. And and so that's a real thing.[0:19:35] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and what's cool about that is that you don't need to go out and buy expensive things. Although you can. Of course, there are people who are capitalizing on this commercially already, but You can just take things from your refrigerator or your or your, you know, makeup cabinet or whatever and smell them, You know, attentionally and constantly and sniff them, and and that exposure will help you recover. There is good data on that by now. You you made that, Point in passing about regeneration in the olfactory system.[0:20:03] Dr. Noam Sobel: Indeed, there one one of the cool things so so in olfaction, you can you can study many things Through olfaction, indeed, one of them is is in is neuroregeneration, because the olfactory neurons are really the only neurons that do that Systematically in the adult mammalian brain. And whether the human olfactory system shows the same level of regeneration as it does in in, in other mammals is and was somewhat questionable. And I'm just bringing that up to share a really Cool study that was published in Neuron, I think somewhere around 2014, where to address this question, I just really like the idea of doing that. What the what the authors did, was look at in in postmortem, they looked at levels of c fourteen In in adults were exposed to atomic bomb experiments. Right?[0:21:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you have you you can actually look at these at these neurons and and time them based on exposure to radiation. And that paper Suggested that that there's not as much turnover in the human olfactory bulb as there is in other mammals. Other lines of data suggest otherwise. So this is kind of a debated question as to what extent neurogen degeneration you have in in the human olfactory system as opposed to other, mammals. But but that was just really cool paper, I think, of of of doing that.[0:21:37] Andrew Huberman: Fascinating. No. I I Should[0:21:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: I finish the the path just so we have the so so we said so so information then synapses at the olfactory bulb from from, the the olfactory epithelium. And the pattern of that synapsing follows what's referred to as the most extreme case of convergence In the mammalian, nervous system, more specifically, what happens is that all the receptors[0:22:07] Andrew Huberman: of a given subtype. And remember, in[0:22:07] Dr. Noam Sobel: humans, we said we have about 350. In the mouse, we have about a 1200 probably. So all the receptors of 1 subtype converge to 1 location in the bulb. And, this location is referred to as a glomerulus Soren and pleural glomeruli. And and that may be a slight oversimplification.[0:22:25] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's in fact 2 glomeruli. There's a mirror, sort of a mirror cut line, and so All the receptors of 1 subtype will converge to 2 on the olfactory bulb. So you end up having, to glomeruli that reflect that 1 receptor subtype. And so if and this is as As far as the I'm giving you now the textbook view of of how the system works, but then I can I'll happily share with you things that Pose a problem for the textbook view of how things work. But the textbook view of how things work is that every such receptor subtype is responsive to a small subset of different molecular shapes, what sometimes referred to as ototopes, the molecular aspects of deodorant.[0:23:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: So each receptor is is responsive to a different subset of ototopes, let's say 10, and each ototope will activate a different subset of receptors. So, potentially, you have this insane comment and torics of this potentially 350 dimensional space in the human, potentially. But then because of this convergence, you end up having on the bulb in a way a map reflecting receptor identity. So so let's say this coffee, activates receptors of type 1, 3, and 7. So the glomeruli of receptors 1, 3, and 7 will light up, Quote, unquote, when I smell the coffee and if you can take a snapshot of that, theoretically, you would have the map of of coffee and and so on and so forth.[0:23:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: This this is sort of the textbook view of how the system works, and and then information goes from the bulb To several targets in the brain. I mean, what is referred to as primary olfactory cortex is piriform cortex and and then the rhino cortex. This is on the ventral surface of the brain, the lower portion of our temporal lobe, and information goes there directly, but it also goes directly to the amygdala. It probably goes directly to the hypothalamus. It may go directly to the cerebellum.[0:24:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: It goes all over the brain. So so Information projects widely from there. And as far as people understand, the map that may exist on the bulb, doesn't exist in the rest of the brain, and the understanding of of how coding occurs in the rest of the brain is is murky.[0:24:40] Andrew Huberman: Commonly, one here is that the Memories that we have of odors are somehow more robust, than the memories of other perceptual events in our life. I I don't know if this is true or not, but, people will say, for instance, I can still remember the smell of my grandmother's hands or the smell of cookies in her kitchen. At a minimum, it points to the fact that smell and memory are closely linked. And you just mentioned a direct, you know, multistation, but, nonetheless, somewhat direct path from the nostrils to the hippocampus, one of the primary encoding centers of the memory[0:25:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: is away.[0:25:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Which is which is a remarkably short pathway considering that, for instance, just by example, because of our listeners won't be familiar with this, but some will that sound waves that, you know, are transduced into neural signals at the level of the inner ear Go through many stations before they arrive at the location in the brain where we make sense of those sound waves as voices or music, etcetera. Whereas olfaction is more of a direct route, to the to the, memory centers. Is there any, just so story or real, objective truth to the idea that olfactory memories are formed more easily or maintained Longer or more robustly than other sorts of memories? So so yes.[0:26:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: But first, I I should I should say that I'm not An authority on olfactory memory. It's sort of it olfactory memory is a huge field research, and somehow our lab has never really Gone much into that. Although, again, the same student I happened to talk about before, Yara Isharun, who's, again, now a faculty at Tel Aviv, ran a study a paper we I think we published in current biology biology called the privilege representation of early olfactory, associations. Basically, there's something about the 1st time you experience a smell that generates a particularly robust representation More than other sensory stimuli, and and that's what she in fact compared. So there's something about the first exposure to a smell, in terms of the brain encoding that that etches it into our, being.[0:26:55] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and this is an effect that has you know, it has echoes, of course, in literature. I mean, you know, the the the biggest cliche in this is to bring up the Proust effect. Right? So the Proust effect is when he ate the Madeleine, and then immediately the taste and smell immediately reminded him, of of an event in his childhood where where, where the same Madeleine, appeared. But but so so that's something very real.[0:27:19] Dr. Noam Sobel: There there's a lot of research on it, not coming from our work, so I'm I'm not an authority.[0:27:24] Andrew Huberman: But it does sound like there's something special about olfaction, And that doesn't mean that there isn't something special about vision or audition.[0:27:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean,[0:27:33] Andrew Huberman: I've Each each one has its own, unique,[0:27:37] Dr. Noam Sobel: is something special about olfaction. It's, my my my students make fun of me because they say and there's some truth to that that I try to explain everything through the system. I mean, for me, everything is olfactory.[0:27:50] Andrew Huberman: So so, yes, through the lens of the nose, I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic greens, now called AG one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens Once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important.[0:28:20] Andrew Huberman: It's populated by Gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact Our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, And it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, And they'll give you 5 free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you A year's supply of vitamin d 3 k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the 5 free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin d 3 k two.[0:29:07] Andrew Huberman: When I was at Berkeley, I was walking across campus one day, and I saw, I think students, but I saw people on their hands and knees with goggles on, gloves on.[0:29:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah.[0:29:21] Andrew Huberman: And, I think their mouths were covered too. Everything was covered. Was covered, and they were walking well, they were crawling along the ground, and I thought this was peculiar, but then again, it's UC Berkeley, and the joke is if it to get noticed on the UC Berkeley campus, you have to be naked and on fire. One or the other would not be sufficient. Please don't run this experiment.[0:29:43] Andrew Huberman: That kind of place. Yeah. But, Nonetheless, a a paper came out a few years later describing the results of what turned out to be experiment that your laboratory was running, which was having people follow an odor trail with their nose, and, and My understanding is that people can improve their ability to track sense quite robustly, especially if We deprive them of vision and somatosensation that is touch and some other, sensations. Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about that study. And Sure.[0:30:19] Andrew Huberman: And for I think in our audience, I'm suspecting that many people have a keen, keen sense of smell. Very I have a family member which is, like, detect any negative, you know, putrid odor in the environment, but also good odors, Exquisitely well, and I I have other family members whose sense of smell is quite poor. I'd love for All of those people to learn a bit about what is possible in terms of training up or improving our ability to smell and, perhaps in the context of that study, if you will.[0:30:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. So first, before even talking about improving, just off the bat, humans have a remarkable sense of smell. And this is something again, in our lab, we already said, you know, yeah. We know this. This is all news.[0:31:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: But but to people who who come from different worlds, we have to reiterate this. Sometimes when I give, you know, public lectures to to nonolfaction audiences, I reiterate this. Humans have an utterly remarkable sense of smell. To to put that a bit into sort of, you know, things that you could that are tangible. So so for example, Mercaptans, which are added to cooking gas so that we smell it because otherwise, it wouldn't have a smell so that the smell of gas is not the smell of gas, of propane.[0:31:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's an additive. Mercaptan. Yeah. It's Mercaptan. The sulfur like smell?[0:31:39] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so, our detection threshold, that is the level at which we can detect it, is 0.2 parts per 1,000,000,000. Okay? There's no machine that can really do that that effectively. No gas chromatograph. Nothing.[0:31:55] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now to give you another sense of of of making this again really tangible, we're working with a nodorant in our lab called estratetra enol That our participants can detect when we have it mixed at 10 to the negative 12 molar in the liquid phase. To give you a real sense of that, we did the math. If you would take 2 Olympic size swimming pools And you would pipe it 1 ml, 1 drop into 1 pool versus the other, you could smell the difference between the pools.[0:32:27] Andrew Huberman: Incredible.[0:32:28] Dr. Noam Sobel: That's the detection threshold that you have with your nose. People have an utterly amazing nose. Okay? So So so that's just in terms of its detection abilities, which are are just, you know, remarkable, really up there in the mammalian world. We're not a bad mammal at all faction.[0:32:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and beyond that, we can we can improve. Okay? And and the example you're talking about actually started off, is a lab bet. Okay. We we were having a lab picnic.[0:32:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I guess I should hear Flynn because I I'm I'm your guest from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. But Before going back to my home in Israel, I was a, faculty at UC Berkeley in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, And this study was done during that time. And we were on a lab picnic, and we were having indeed one of these sort of lab discussions arguments on what humans can and can't do with their sense Smell. And and I said that humans could truly even track odor like a dog, and people there said no way. And we ran this quick experiment, which I have video of, but I don't think we'll show it here.[0:33:35] Dr. Noam Sobel: But I actually have original the picnic video, we have it. And, a graduate student by the name of Christina Zalano, a brilliant graduate student at that time who's now she's now a professor at Northwestern. And she's really leading the field of of olfaction imaging today. But she was the volunteer, and we dragged a chocolate bar Across the grass and blindfolded her and checked if she could track the track we made with the chocolate, Which he did very effectively. Right?[0:34:06] Dr. Noam Sobel: And as far[0:34:06] Andrew Huberman: as place her at the starting point of the line?[0:34:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: Or I think we did. I don't exactly remember what we did on that sort of picnic, tryout. But, you know, I I assume she never practiced that in her life before. Right? And yet, you know, she she did it really, really well.[0:34:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: And And then this went on as a lab in a way that that I I said to my my students, okay. We we have to make this into a an experiment. Put it in an experimental setting and and and quantify what's going on. And they all said that it would be uninteresting. That was the bet.[0:34:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and I told them it would be in nature, which is a bet I won in this case. Nature, of course, being[0:34:43] Andrew Huberman: one of the the ape 3 Apex journals.[0:34:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: So it was it was nature neuroscience to prepare. But but, so so then we we turned it into an experiment, and and what the experiment was is that we brought in participants, naive participants, not not graduate students from our lab, completely deprive them of any other sensory input. So we blocked their eyes. We blocked their ears. We blocked everything.[0:35:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: We blocked what they were wearing, heavy gloves. You know, they they couldn't sense anything. And we generated a a a consistent odor path in the grass, which is what you saw. We did that by burying Twine under the grass and odor impregnated twine. So that way we can generate a consistent, odor trail every time.[0:35:27] Andrew Huberman: Was it at the base of the grass or in the dirt?[0:35:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: It was buried. It was buried under the grass. Really? Yeah. Yeah.[0:35:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: Wow. And I did not know that. It was buried under the grass, And we, conducted aerial photography, and, participants also had this sensor pack that they were wearing Where we, measured nasal airflow in each nostril in real time, and, they all we also use something called RTK GPS, which is a way to lay, radio frequency grid over the GPS grid so that you have millimeter resolution in space, basically. It's used by surveyors mostly, so that we could track behavior. And we found a few things doing this.[0:36:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: One is that people could just do this right off the bat. The second thing we found that is when we train them up, Then within, average of 4 days, the rate limiting factor became the speed at which they could crawl. So as fast as you could crawl, you could send track. Of course, you can't crawl as fast as a dog can run, but you as fast as you can crawl, you can send track. And then to to sort of add what made it really interesting from from a a systems neuroscience perspective is That we asked whether having 2 nostrils, contributes to this.[0:36:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, we built We constructed a a nasal prosthesis, if you will, that had 2 versions. 1 is that it it combined both nostrils Into 1 big nostril centered, and the other is that it it maintained 2 separated nostrils. And we compared performance under these 2 conditions, and people performed better, with 2 nostrils over 1 centralized nostril, although the flu remain the same. So you're taking advantage of the information, that comes from your 2 separate totally separate nostrils. By the way, the system I described before of your epithelium in bulb and and connection to cortex, you have 2 of those.[0:37:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? It's completely unilateral. Well, Almost completely unilateral system. There are some very small exceptions to that. But but[0:37:44] Andrew Huberman: So representation on both sides of the brain. Much in the same way we Two eyes were not a cyclops. We can gain depth perception information. We can perceive motion better as a consequence and and a number of adept, especially stereopsis.[0:37:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: And we can locate sound because of the difference between our ears and how head blocks them between and[0:38:03] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Another question about the The mechanics and strategies that you observed because I think there's information about the system, the brain, as a consequence. Were you in a position to measure sniffing frequency? And the specific question I have is, were people doing something along the lines of a Quick sniffing or a like a, you know, a long, draw in So inhale.[0:38:29] Dr. Noam Sobel: You know, We didn't so, yes, we were measuring, sniffing, and recording it, and and we have all the data. There was nothing very remarkable in that data in that study, although it may reflect that we didn't Analyze it carefully enough as well. I mean, it did it was it it wasn't a major component of our analysis. Although we did look at it, to some extent, again, you're you're asking me about a paper from quite a few years ago, so I I may be forgetting parts of it as well. But[0:39:00] Andrew Huberman: I'm sure if it was a a major component of it. It would have risen to[0:39:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: the top. It definitely wasn't a major finding, of the sniffing behavior, in the paper. Although, again, we, You know, sniffing behavior is a huge portion of our our life in lab, and and it's It's taking us to to places, and and it's reemerging now in our work. We're we're doing tons of sniffing work. You know, I I can share with you something That that I think will interest your your, listeners and viewers as well, and and and we think is is really, one of the most overlooked things In in neuroscience, I'll invite you I invite you to do the following experiments.[0:39:43] Dr. Noam Sobel: So occlude 1 nostril by pressing on it from the side and sniff in, And then include the other in sniffing. Do you sense a difference in flow?[0:39:51] Andrew Huberman: Yes.[0:39:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: Okay. Do you know why that is?[0:39:53] Andrew Huberman: No. And it was the next question on my list.[0:39:55] Dr. Noam Sobel: So don't feel badly about not knowing why that is. Mhmm. Most people don't, but that is a reflection of something referred to as the nasal cycle. So in fact, if you were to do that repeatedly, you would find that your high flow nostril and low flow nostril alternate Every two and a half hours on average.[0:40:15] Andrew Huberman: In an absolute way, or is it kind of like a sine wave, like gradual shift to the one and then gradual shift back?[0:40:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: It can vary. It can vary, and we don't yet know the rules, all the rules. But but you have this constant shift from side to side. The shift becomes incredibly pronounced in sleep, so we can measure the power of the difference. And and in sleep, you have this Phase shift of power.[0:40:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: You have a huge like, 1 closes and 1 opens totally. And It turns out that this is linked to, balance in the autonomic nervous system. So as you and your listeners know, we have an autonomic Nervous system that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it, and and they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases, for example. And this Interplay between the, auto between the the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system drives the switch From left to right nostril.[0:41:10] Andrew Huberman: Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy, has everything to do with Generating patterns of alertness. It's sometimes called the fight or flight system, but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative, and then it's balanced in a Coordinated way or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic nervous system, which is sometimes called the rest and digest system, but is, associated with all sorts of things, the sexual arousal response, and a number of other aspects of our physiology. So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm. Yeah?[0:41:39] Dr. Noam Sobel: Perfect. So now imagine. Right? Imagine Imagine you would walk around living your life, right, half of the time with 1 eye closed like this and the other half with 1 eye closed like this, And you have this eye cycle. Right?[0:41:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: And that was linked to autonomic arousal. I assure you, you would go to PubMed. There would be 5,000,000 papers on the eye cycle. Right? And the eye cycle in every disease you can name and what it denotes and what it tells us and what we can do with it.[0:42:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: You have exactly this marker. You're walking around with a marker on balance in your autonomic nervous system, And we do nothing with it. So we're in fact now doing a lot with it. Okay. So we built we built a wearable device that, is pasted to your body and measures airflow in each nostril separately and logs it for 24 hours.[0:42:26] Dr. Noam Sobel: And we're collecting these 24 hour recordings. We're calling it the nasal halter. So we measure with the nasal halter, And and we're finding it as a disease marker. I can I can give you a nasal halter measurement as an adult, And I can say this is work by team Nasaroka, graduates in our lab now? I can so we we can tell the difference between, ADHD and non ADHD adults.[0:42:55] Dr. Noam Sobel: And we can tell just from the recording. We can tell if the adults are on Ritalin or not. So I can I can measure your nasal airflow and say If you are or are not with ADHD and if you are or are not on Ritalin?[0:43:07] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. I have a a couple of questions about this. Is it the case that airflow through 1 nostril is reflective of a sympathetic nervous system dominance versus parasympathetic? Or is it simply the case that this alternating left right nostril, periodicity, which you said I think is on the order of about every 2 hours 2[0:43:29] Dr. Noam Sobel: and a half.[0:43:29] Andrew Huberman: 2 and a half. It which is to, maximal on one side versus the other. Is that simply reflective of an overall balancing? Let let's Maybe is it the hinge in the seesaw, or is it the tilt of the seesaw?[0:43:42] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I don't have a good answer. I don't have a good answer. I mean, you know, I I could give you sort of a, know, I could say that to some extent, right nostril more open, is more sympathetic, And the left nostril more open is more parasympathetic, but that that wouldn't be very correct. I mean,[0:43:59] Andrew Huberman: you know, it I'm sure that the you know, the yogis are gonna be all over[0:44:02] Dr. Noam Sobel: this world.[0:44:02] Andrew Huberman: I have to check. My lab does do some stuff on on breathing, and the the yogis are always saying, okay. You know, because there's this thing I don't do yoga anymore. I not for any particular trauma, But, where they'll have you breathe through 1 nostril or the other, and I've I've probably been asked this question on social media 10,000 times.[0:44:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: Okay. Wait. I'm gonna become public enemy number 1 of the yogis right now. So, listen, we so we We they'll[0:44:27] Andrew Huberman: come at you with, yoga mats, which are not very dangerous.[0:44:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: We really so so since we're so interested in this mechanism, One of the things we'd really like to know how to do is is to gain control of it somehow. And there's this world out there of yoga who claims to have control over this. So we said, okay. Let's bring, like, really serious yoga practitioners and see if they can shift their nasal cycle from left to right But by will alone, right, not by manipulating themselves somehow. And and if yes, you know, we'll learn from them how they do this, and then we might, you know, use this to to Cure ADHD or or whatnot.[0:45:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? So so we posted, like, on all the lists of, like, the yoga teachers And had this parade of yoga teachers walking into our lab. It this was one of the strangest Lot of sandalwood[0:45:13] Andrew Huberman: odors and bare feet.[0:45:16] Dr. Noam Sobel: White white, clothing and and so on. And and so we we study I actually know we studied 14 yoga teachers, All 14, by, you know, by the conditions of enlistment for this, came in saying that they they can control shifting from left to right, nostril.[0:45:34] Andrew Huberman: Without plugging a nostril Yeah.[0:45:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. By by the power of thought alone. And you know how many of 14 succeeded? 0, including including 1 you know, the most extreme one was we we had this guy who who, you know and we're recording, And we we know how to record this really well. Right?[0:45:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and he's sitting there saying, yeah. I'm switching now, and I'm I'm it's switching. And, you know, you're looking at the monitor and, no, it's not switching. And and so no no yoga teacher that we found, could, willfully switch, between left and right nostril flow.[0:46:08] Andrew Huberman: And yet they're they are convinced that they are, and I have to imagine they're not trying to you know, there's there's no incentive for them to lie. Right?[0:46:15] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. No. I I it Even the opposite, I mean, you know, this puts them in an awkward position once yeah. I I don't know what the deal is, but but none of them can do it.[0:46:25] Andrew Huberman: Given that the alternating flow through 1 or the other nostrils reflective of the autonomic nervous system has this two and a half hour periodicity. If I suddenly enter a bout of stress, for instance, does it switch? Because that's reflective of the autonomic nervous system.[0:46:39] Dr. Noam Sobel: And the[0:46:39] Andrew Huberman: reason I'm asking this question It's not because I think that's necessarily important as it relates to stress, but I'm trying to understand the direction of causality. In other words, is the As are we unilateral Smelling through or unilateral nostril smelling periodicity, there when we named it something, I could name it the wrong thing, I'm sure. Is that Driving the shift in the autonomic nervous system, or is it merely reflective of the the shift?[0:47:02] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you've you've very concisely now worded aim 2 of a grant That was probably just rejected. But but, basically, we're trying to answer exactly, that question, and we're Currently running experiments on that line. So so we have 1 experiment where, we're looking, So so we're exposing participants to pain. We're using, cold water hand exposure. It's a really cool paradigm because it it There's huge individual differences.[0:47:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: We just started this. We built the setup just now. And you have a lot of meat to work with there because there's a lot of individual differences. You're it's Capped at 3 minutes, so be for safety reasons because you have you have participants putting their hand in in, 2 degrees Celsius water. But there there'll be participants who will pull it out at, like, 10 seconds, 9 seconds, and then you'll have you'll have 3 minutes as well.[0:47:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: So there's lots of lots of, And and already in so now I'm sharing pilot data with you. So, you know, to to this might you know, when it when this ends up being published, it might be the opposite. But So far, it seems that that, the exposure to cold generates a shift in the nasal flow in in nasal balance.[0:48:13] Andrew Huberman: So autonomic arousal can drive the shift potentially. Earlier, you were describing the architecture of these, smelling systems. And you mentioned these glomeruli where the olfactory receptors converge[0:48:28] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right.[0:48:28] Andrew Huberman: In the bulb. And then later you mentioned that the system is unilateral, but with a mirror representation on both sides of the brain. So for those who don't think in terms of neuroanatomy, what Noam was describing is the fact that, of course, there are 2 nostrils and then a bunch of receptors. They converge in these glomeruli, but you have a mirror representation of that on both sides of the brain and that most of that Information is kept on one side of the brain or the other. There isn't a lot of extensive intermixing at the first order of processing.[0:48:54] Andrew Huberman: So the question I have is whether or not you believe I'm not asking for data. 1st, I just wanna know what you believe, that this alternating nostril airflow phenomenon Has anything to do with preferential processing of olfactory information in terms of right brain, left brain with the caveat that Anytime we hear right brain, left brain, we've covered this in a previous episode. Most of what people hear out there about right brain, left brain, Emotionality, logical stuff is completely wrong. Completely wrong. Doesn't exist.[0:49:25] Andrew Huberman: It's a total fabrication, and we'd like to abolish that myth. But With that aside or set aside rather, what are your thoughts on why the information would switch from one side of the brain to the other at all.[0:49:39] Dr. Noam Sobel: No. I don't think I don't think that that the nasal cycle is an olfaction story. So so I I don't think that that this was shaped by the olfactory system, Nor do I think this has major impact on olfaction. I think the nasal cycle story is a different story about brain function. Know, we have we have this sort of pet theory where we're calling now the the sniffing brain approach where We're basically we think that that nasal inhalation Is timing and driving a lot of aspects and patterns of of neural activity and cognitive processing.[0:50:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and this theory is is olfaction inspired in its beginning. That is I mean, if you if you think of the mammalian brain, right, it's which which Evolved from all faction. It's sitting there and and in all faction because all faction depends on sniffing. You have this situation where You have a you have a sniff, you have information, and then flat. Nothing.[0:50:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? And then you have information and then nothing. So information processing Is is 1 to 1 linked to nasal inhalation. And and we think that that This property evolved to to be meaningful in brain processing in general, not only of of olfactory information, but of any type of information because the brain evolved in this way in this way that it processes information on inhalation onset. So A study led by a offer from our our lab, 2, 3 years ago, we looked at at Something completely not olfactory.[0:51:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: We looked at at visual spatial processing, and we compared visual spatial processing on inhalation versus exhalation. And the brain does this completely different on inhalation versus exhalation. You you're in in that particular task, people performed Significantly better on inhalation versus exhalation.[0:51:52] Andrew Huberman: What was the task? Was it an olfactory task?[0:51:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: No. No. It's a visual spatial task. So this is a task We're we're, the the the specifics of the task were, that you see a shape, and you have to determine If it's a shape that can or cannot exist in the real world so some of them will leave these, like, usher shapes, like, you know, where where one facet doesn't Reach the other facets. The impossible figure.[0:52:17] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah. But but but, structural shapes, not not and and so so a pure visual Spatial task. We we intentionally went for a task that is not considered a ventral temporal task, an olfactory cortex task in any way. And and people performed much better on inhalation versus exhalation at doing this task.[0:52:39] Andrew Huberman: Was there a both nostrils occluded, version where people were forced to mouth breathe.[0:52:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yes. And in this particular task, they also did better on mouth inhalation versus mouth exhalation, but the difference wasn't as pronounced as it was with nasal inhalation versus exhalation.[0:52:58] Andrew Huberman: So that Yeah. I'm a big proponent of nasal, not mouth breathing whenever possible For sure. For many health related reasons. I'm a big fan of the book, Jaw is a hidden epidemic, written by colleagues of mine at Stanford. Familiar with it.[0:53:11] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And this idea that people who mouth breathe, experience More colds, more infections of various kinds. It's not good aesthetically or for the dentist dentiture. I never know. The teeth, gums, and stuff, Yep.[0:53:25] Andrew Huberman: Sorry. My, my dentist is gonna come after me. You need to go to the dentist anyway. The, that nose breathing is great For your health relative to mouth[0:53:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: breathing So I think it's also good for your cognition, not only for your your dental health. I think that That, nose breathing shapes cognition. And and there there are other labs, who who are, are finding the same. Again, Cristina Zalano is doing work on this line. She she had major contributions here, and and, Johan Lundstrom is doing work on this line.[0:53:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: There there's lots of studies suggesting that, nasal inhalation is timing Cognitive processing and and modulating it.[0:54:09] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. Perhaps not surprising Given what you've taught us about the olfactory system, I mean, that these 2 holes in the front of our face, these nostrils, I mean, are a Pathway to the brain. Right? I I love to tell people because I work on the visual system in my lab that, you know, your eyes are 2 pieces of brain from the cranial vault Right. Which they are.[0:54:29] Andrew Huberman: The the retinas any anyhow. And, and then you never look at anyone the same way again. It's okay. But the The olfactory sensory neurons are right there at the tops of those caverns that we call nostrils, and they are brain.[0:54:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Definitely. It's it's the only place where your brain meets the outside world because in your retina, they're protected by by a lens. Mhmm. And here here you have neurons In contact with with the world.[0:54:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: This this actually has been the source for some theories on a potential, route For for neurodegenerative mechanisms. So as as you may know, loss of the sense of smell is one of the, if not The earliest sign of neurodegenerative disease. So for example, in Parkinson's disease, there's, loss in the sense of smell Probably 10 years before any other symptom. But people have failed to make this a diagnostic tool because it's nonspecific. So it's not as if you could come to your doctor and say, I'm losing my sense of smell, and they'll say, oh, early sign of Parkinson's because You can have many reasons to lose your sense of smell and and and so on.[0:55:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: But but Olfactory loss, again, is is an early sign of of neurodegeneration, and there's at least 1 theory particularly about Alzheimer's disease Suggesting that that Alzheimer's may be the result of of a a pathogen that enters the brain through the olfactory system. Oh, interesting. It it's it's not, of course, a a a mainstream or widely accepted theory of any type, but but it's it just highlights this notion that That the nose is a path to our brain.[0:56:18] Andrew Huberman: I think these noninvasive, readouts of potential neurodegeneration, such as, visual tests because of the fact that the retinas are part of the brain and loss of neurons in the retina is Often associated with other forms of central degeneration, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, etcetera, as it's a little more invasive than what you're describing. I'm beginning to wonder why we don't, get have a, olfactory task every time we go to the doctor, that would allow tracking over time because, of course, as you mentioned, someone can Lose their sense of smell, does that mean they're getting Alzheimer's? Not necessarily. But if their sense of smell was terrific the year before and it's 50% Worse, the next day[0:56:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: a really bad sign.[0:56:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's a bad sign. And so what we're talking about is something completely noninvasive, and could be relatively Pleasant to innocuous Right. Depending on the odors used.[0:57:07] Dr. Noam Sobel: So yeah. So so first, I can answer that. Right? And the reason that that's not happened And that might that that may be changing right now, but the reason that has not happened is because olfaction has not been effectively digitized. Right?[0:57:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: So if if you need to generate, you know, really precise visual information, you can buy a monitor for, you know, $100 that is at the resolution of the visual system, basically. And if you wanna generate auditory stimuli really precisely, then you can buy an amplifier for, you know, maybe a bit more than $100, but not that much more, And you'll be at the resolution of the auditory system. In our lab, we build devices that generate odors. We call them olfactometers, which is a mis because they don't measure anything, but that's what they've always been called. So we call them off photometers as well.[0:57:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: And we've already built at least 1 off photometer that cost a quarter of €1,000,000, And it's pathetic. Right? So it just it's pathetic. It's it's slow. It's contaminated.[0:58:07] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's nowhere near the resolution of your system. So one of the reasons that's not happened is just the utterly poor control of the stimulus. Mind you, to some extent, it has happened and that there there are, a standard clinical tests of olfaction. Basically, 2 that sort of control, the world in this respect. The older one is is a test called the UPSIT, which stands for the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.[0:58:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: It was developed by Richard Doty in Penn, and it's a test where you scratch and sniff and and it's a 4 alternative forced choice test with For deodorants. So you have these 40 pages that you page through, and you sniff and smell and and, you know, it's been normed on gazillions of tests. I I'm always amused by it because so so Richard Doty made a ton of money, on the UPS IT, But he needed it because he has a habit. He has a NASCAR. I mean, so this every time we buy UPSITs in the lab, I said there's another gallon of Aston to Richard Doherty.[0:59:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: NASCAR? It's not like NASCAR, but, like, one lower than that. Like, I don't know. Like, some some sort of formula a or formula Ford or some he races a car. And so that's where all the UBSITs went.[0:59:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I always feel good about buying UBSITs because I know they're going to that good cause.[0:59:29] Andrew Huberman: But Keeping him in in in in the fast lane.[0:59:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. But but so so that's one test that's out there, and and indeed, you know, has been shown as a, You know? So so there's reduced DUPIX IT in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and and then a host of other diseases. And there's a European version called sniffing sticks, that Thomas Humer has developed, and and it's it's basically the same sort of concept of That one isn't scratch and sniff. It's like these pens that you open up and and sniff.[0:59:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: But but those exist, but they're not as as convenient as as, Is delivering a stimuli and vision in audition, and that's why, you don't have what you've just suggested. Interesting. You know, another thing another place where you don't have it, which which I think is Even more would have been even more meaningful is is you don't olfaction is not tested in in newborns, right, where vision and audition is. You know, there's this thing called congenital anosmia, right, which is being without the sense of smell from birth, supposedly congenital, which is a half a percent of the population.[1:00:34] Andrew Huberman: It's not a trivial number.[1:00:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: Not totally. Yeah. But nobody knows if that really is true because he here's an amazing factoid. Guess the average age At which congenital anosmia is diagnosed. And this is this is a horrible statistic for me for the way I see the world.[1:00:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: But what do you think the average age of diagnosis is for congenital anosmia? 5 years of age. 14. Incredible. 14.[1:01:02] Andrew Huberman: So most people who are one half of 1% of the human population, presumably Yeah. Is, without the sense of smell and doesn't realize that until they're 14 years old.[1:01:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: Well, I don't know when they realized it first, but but it's formally diagnosed at 14 on average, which means some of them even later. Right? And, and,[1:01:22] Andrew Huberman: right. So distribution. What what, do they suffer?[1:01:27] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yes. So so first of all, They they suffer socially, and there's a host of of deleterious Life events associated with congenital anosmia. The it they die younger. The so it's it's it's, it's this is work out of, Ilona Croix in Germany. And, You know, amongst the various things that are predicted by, an Osmia is shorter lifespan.[1:01:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: But things like, you know, reduced, social contacts, reduced, romantic social contacts. It's not a good thing.[1:02:11] Andrew Huberman: And and and do they lack olfactory bulbs? I'm presuming they have noses and nostrils. They have noses. Condition I'm aware of where where, Children are born without noses. They're[1:02:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: not very rare. Yeah.[1:02:21] Andrew Huberman: Very rare. We'll focus on that because it's it's exceedingly rare.[1:02:25] Dr. Noam Sobel: But They're born with noses and nostrils, and here's the thing. Right? We don't know if they're born with olfactory bulbs. Most of them, although not all of them, But most of them don't have olfactory bulbs in adulthood, or or I should rephrase that, have remnants olfactory bulbs, really shriveled olfactory bulbs. But, you know, nobody can say the cause and effect here.[1:02:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: Before we[1:02:48] Andrew Huberman: talk about the role of the the, requirement for Olfactory bulbs for olfaction, a very interesting topic in its own right. I I'm curious as to whether or not their endocrine system is altered because as we'll soon talk about, there's a lot of signaling through the nose from between individuals that, triggers things, everything from the onset of puberty to feelings of romantic attraction, attachment, these sorts of things. Is it known whether or not and I should say excuse me for interrupting myself. But as long as I'm interrupting you every 5 minutes, I might as well interrupt myself too, That, we are well aware of the proximity of the olfactory system to some of the hypothalamic systems that regulate the release of gonadotropins, which control Zosteron and estrogen production, etcetera. So, are they, hormonally normal?[1:03:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: So some are and some aren't, and I'll I'll be specific. So, there is a condition known as Kalman syndrome, which is hypogonetic, development, in in men. And in Kalman syndrome, they're practically all anosmic. So so to answer your question, yes, there's a direct link, and and it materializes in common syndrome. That said, Not all congenitally anosmic, individuals have common syndrome, and not all, but almost all people who have common syndrome are anosmic.[1:04:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so common syndrome, goes with, anosmia. I think so so there's a Female equivalent of commons or I'm I[1:04:24] Andrew Huberman: don't remember its name. It's not turn it's not a in the Turner Syndrome family. I'm not sure. Okay.[1:04:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: And I think it's also associated with anosmia, but I'm not confident of that. But is is associated with anosmia. So so the answer is is yes. And and, you know, we can maybe you know, olfaction and reproduction are are tightly linked, And and they're tightly linked in all mammals, and we are big terrestrial mammals, and olfaction reproduction, are linked in humans as well.[1:04:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We will definitely get into that. I'd like to just take a brief moment and thank one of our podcast sponsors, which is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that blood work is the only way that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors, etcetera, The impact, your immediate and long term health.[1:05:27] Andrew Huberman: One major challenge with blood work, however, is that most of the time, it does not come back with any information about what To do in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, into the ranges that you want. With InsideTracker, Changing those values becomes very straightforward because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use to address the nutrition based, Behavior based, supplement based approaches that you can use in order to move those values into the ranges that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity. InsideTracker now includes a measurement of Apolipoprotein b, so called ApoB, in their ultimate plan. ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health, And therefore, there's extreme value to knowing your APOB levels. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.[1:06:15] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's InsideTracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. I have a a story slash question that I'd like to, tell you ask you as a segue to that, noting, of course, that that we'll get back to the The requirement for olfactory bulbs, yes or no for olfaction. And, this relates to when I was growing up, I grew up at the, end of a street with a a lot of boys of my age who, just by coincidence, had a lot of older sisters They were my sister my older sister's age. It was fortunate, so I had a lot of kids to play with. We would hang out at each other's houses, bike, build Jumps and do all these things like kids stuff, fort stuff, get into trouble or whatnot.[1:06:59] Andrew Huberman: And oftentimes, We would end up leaving our articles of clothing at each other's houses all the time, like T shirts and jackets. And so My mom was constantly coming in and saying, there's all there's this clothes. Like, someone left us here. I don't know who it was. We're all more or less the same size.[1:07:16] Andrew Huberman: And from the as far back as I could remember, 6, 7 years old and onward, I could pick up a shirt or a jacket, Smell it and say, oh, well, that's Eric Eisenhart's shirt, a friend of mine there. I just gave his name. Or, oh, that's Scott Madsen shirt. I I could just smell the shirt and in a conscious way know who it belonged to, having never I promise, not that I would pretend if I if I had, pretend that I hadn't if I had, but having never actually done the exercise of going and taking, and smelling my friend intentionally.[1:07:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right.[1:07:49] Andrew Huberman: Okay? In fact, if anything, I had all the reasons in the world to avoid smelling, the other young boys in my neighborhood. Okay. So Yeah. That raises a question of whether or not we are consciously and or subconsciously coding identification of people that we interact with Frequently or infrequently in terms of their smell or some other aspect of their, chemistry.[1:08:15] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. So yes. We're doing that all the time In my view and a lot of this processing, almost all of it, is subconscious, And I don't know why. Already already put that out there. Right?[1:08:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: I have no idea why why, human Nature has has, or or nature or culture or whatnot has has has pushed this into the realm of of subconscious And something we're unaware of, but we do it all the time, and and, and our lab has lots of studies on this front. One of them you may be familiar with that that had gained some notoriety because it's amusing. So so we We look at human behavior a lot. We try to look at it through our nose in in the way we look at what people are doing. You know?[1:09:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: We try to Think, you know, if I was a dog, what what would I think of this? And and, you know, if you look at dogs, right, they they've You know, when they interact, they visibly sniff each other. It's very obvious. They walk up to each other and they sniff each other. And yet humans don't typically walk up to a stranger and carefully sniff them.[1:09:35] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? I mean, it's we're we're sort of obliged to Sniff our our babies, that's considered almost something you're supposed to do. And it's not culturally taboo to sniff our loved ones. It it doesn't seem like an odd thing to do, but we don't sniff strangers. Right?[1:09:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: Well or do we? So we're Finding more and more mechanisms where we do this, and and the one I'm referring to now for one example is we started looking at handshaking. Handshaking is this really odd behavior, and it's not only in the west, by the way. Some people think it's only a western thing. It's not.[1:10:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's almost everywhere. And and There's really poor understanding of how this behavior evolved. Like, where did where did this thing come from? So if if you, you know, if you Look for the Wikipedia version. Right?[1:10:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: Then they'll tell you that it's to show that you're not holding a weapon in your hand. But there's really no Good evidence for that. It's a bit like the trillion bloodhound receptor story. Right? I mean, we tried to find it.[1:10:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: You know, why do people say that? They just do. And we started looking at people handshaking, and and we noticed or it seemed to us that we're noticing that, you know, people will shake hands and then We go like this and like this.[1:10:49] Andrew Huberman: Of you listening, not watching, know, you know, he's taking his hand and and wiping it on his face. Yeah.[1:10:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: Grabbing his nose or touching himself. Yeah. These things these things that we do all the time.[1:11:00] Andrew Huberman: After a handshake.[1:11:01] Dr. Noam Sobel: Well, so so first of all, we do them all the time, Period. Right? The baseline here is really high, and we'll get to that in a second. But but but these behaviors that, you know, you you you could easily not notice. Right?[1:11:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and so we we asked whether that's a real thing. And this was a study led by Yudan Frumming in our lab at the time. And what we did first and and if you want, we can link. So so this was published in eLife, and one of the nice things about eLife is that it has very effective way to, embed videos in the publication. So if you want, we can link this to your system later on.[1:11:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: The They[1:11:36] Andrew Huberman: even in the show note Captions as a link on YouTube and the other 4, platforms, Spotify, Apple.[1:11:42] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so what we did is is, we we brought in participants to our lab, And we sat them in the room, experiment room, and and told them the experiment would start soon and they should wait for us there. They didn't know where they were coming from. Unbeknownst to them, they were already being videoed. Of course, later on, they they had the opportunity to to not agree to us Saving the video, in which case we would delete it immediately or or letting us use it for science or some letting us use it for more than science for for the video that's now on eLife. And and we walk into the room and say, okay.[1:12:16] Dr. Noam Sobel: Just wait here. We'll be right back with you, to set up our experiment. And They would sit there for 3 minutes. And during those 3 minutes, we could later quantify how much indeed they just by baseline, how much they touch their nose or their Farhead or their chin or how many times their hand, reaches their face. And by the way, that baseline is not low.[1:12:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: Okay? And then 3 minutes later, an experimenter would walk into the room and, would share a a consistent text. It would be, you know, we're still setting up our equipment in the other room, and and so just wait here and we'll be right back with you. But in the meantime, just wait here. And the experimenter went through this, like, 22nd fixed text.[1:12:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: And in half of the cases, it included a handshake. This was a new experimenter, not the one who put them in the room. So that's the first time they met. It'd be a low I'm, you know, so and so they would put out their hand and shake their hand or not. Okay?[1:13:09] Dr. Noam Sobel: And we did all possible interactions in terms of gender. So We matched, male participants with male and female experimenters and female participants with female and male experimenters. And so you had handshake and no handshake conditions, And then you can quantify that behavior of the hand going to the nose after handshake. And there was a remarkable increase In the hand going to the nose after handshake. And this is one of the nice cases we the paper includes statistics, but you don't need statistics here.[1:13:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: Just look at the video. It's it's unreal. The video is unreal. So interesting. The hand goes to the nose.[1:13:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now we did a few controls here To verify that this is an olfactory behavior, one is unbeknownst to participants, we measured nasal airflow. And and people not only bring their hand to their nose, they sniff it. And this is perfectly timed. They go like this. Okay?[1:13:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: So they're sniffing their hands. And in an additional control study, we manipulated it. So we built this little James Bond thing of a watch on the experimenter's hand that could emit an odor. And the experimenter didn't know what odor they were emitting, and they could emit either a pleasant or an unpleasant odor, And we could drive the self sampling afterwards up or down. So this was an olfactory behavior.[1:14:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: No doubt about it. I mean, we're we're quite confident.[1:14:23] Andrew Huberman: So people in that case, people must have been sensing the odor on their own hand because they'd shake shook the hand of the of the experimenter pleasant odor, And they're more frequently bringing that hand to their nose versus unpleasant odor that had been introduced to their own hand by the experimenter. Correct?[1:14:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: But I but no. I think I think they were Sensing the the ambient odor that came in with the hand that that choke, and then that either drove them to sniff their hands more or less.[1:14:47] Andrew Huberman: The odor cloud of the experiment.[1:14:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. And and there's an interesting thing going on here too because people didn't only smell the hand that shook. They also smelled the other hand. And and we think that there's something going on here comparing self to other. And we think a lot of self sampling might might reflect that.[1:15:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: There's on the same line and, again, to to link to your childhood story of of of, identifying your friends by by smell, Study we published just last year by, Imbal Rav Rebi in in our lab, where Imbayan came with this, basic interest in this phenomenon that's loosely referred to as click friendships. So people you meet and you click right away. Right? You immediately become close friends. And this is a phenomena that that, you know, is poorly described or is poorly described in literature as as as an entity, and yet anybody will tell you they know what you're talking about.[1:15:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? I mean, if you tell you know, if somebody you click with a right away, you you become intimate within 5 minutes. Right? Everybody experienced this in their life, you know, to some extent. And the question is, what what was there?[1:16:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? What was it? Was it because you look the same? Could it be? Was it because, you know, you had the same Sports team that you liked, or is there something, deeper here?[1:16:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and Impa's theory was that that, That a similarity in body odor may contribute to this. That people who smell the same will click in some way. And so to address that, she she actually recruited, click friends from all over Israel. She posted all over social media, to identify pairs of friends. So these are are same sex non romantic dyads.[1:16:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: So these are friends, men and women, whose friendship started as a click. Where here, this becomes sensitive because it has to be a mutual click. Right? Later on, we discovered there could be one-sided clicks. If somebody is sure they clicked with somebody else, but the other person[1:16:55] Andrew Huberman: There's a name for that in neurology that our, common friend, the late Ben Barris, taught me, which is there's a phrase that neurologists use Okay. Called sticky. These are people that come up to you and and start asking you questions and then won't leave you alone. They they're so called sticky people that And if you ask these sticky people, sticky in air quotes because they're not physically sticky. Maybe.[1:17:17] Andrew Huberman: What they could be. You know, what do you think of the per this person? They'll say, oh, they're great. We're really good friends, and so they've made a unilateral, Click friendship.[1:17:28] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.[1:17:29] Andrew Huberman: And, yes, neurologists are talking about you. If you're if you're one of these people, neurologists are talking about you. There's a an an informal diagnostic code, sticky.[1:17:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so so, she she recruited click friends, And then she, sampled their body odor. And and we have a a a protocol for this. They're given, you know, odorless shampoo and soap to use for 3 weeks or something, and then they sleep 2 nights in this T shirt, where they have to sleep alone, and then we extract the body odor from the T shirt. And so we have a way to extract, a method to extract body odor. And then she she first asked, whether indeed click friends are more similar in their body order than you would expect by chance.[1:18:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: And she first tested this with a with a device, a machine we call an electronic nose. So an electronic nose is sort of a very Poor effort to mimic what the mammalian nose does. Basically, it's a bunch of sensors that respond to airborne molecules. In this case, sensors referred to as MOXers, as a metal oxide Covered sensors. And so she used an electronic nose to sample these body odors, and she found that click friends are indeed More similar to each other, than you would expect, by chance, by random diodes.[1:18:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and this was a significant difference. And after she found that a device could do this, she had other participants do this. So so she had people smelling the Click friends versus nonclick friends, and and they judge them as being more similar to each other, than not. Now, again, You you might wonder, is this causal or not? Right?[1:19:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: Because maybe click friends go to the same restaurant together or all the time or whatever or live in the same neighborhood, and and that's why they They they smell the same. So to address causality, she recruited total strangers and first smell them with the electronic nose And then engage them in a social interaction, something called the mirror game. So in the mirror game, 1 person moves their hands and the other person is really close to them, like Right here so they can smell each other and has to move their hands with the other person. And one one prediction there panned out, but another didn't. The one that didn't so she predicted that people who would smell more, similar to each other would be better at the mirror game.[1:19:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: That is they would follow each other better. That did not pan out. However, she then also had the the interaction was completely nonverbal. They were not allowed Speak with each other, and she did an entire round robin, so everybody played with everybody else. This was an insane experiment to run.[1:20:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: And she then at the end of the experiment, Each person rated each other person as to how much they think they would wanna be their friends and also on a bunch of ratings, how nice they think they are, how affectionate they think, a bunch of ratings. Okay? All of this was predicted by the electronic news. So people who smell more similar to each other think that the other person is more likely to be their friend, is more likely to be a nice person, etcetera, etcetera. So we could actually predict friendship using the electronic nose.[1:20:39] Dr. Noam Sobel: So this is not a result of friendship. It's it it plays into the causal elements of of building friendship. So this is to relate to your childhood story. There's something going on here. We're we're constantly smelling ourselves constantly.[1:20:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: This constantly I mean, if you wanna link I'm and now The reason I'm smiling, I mean and and your viewers or listeners will understand why I'm smiling. I'll send you a video to link, in in the In into your podcast here, we thought of calling the the the fact that people constantly sniff themselves, we thought of calling this the low effect. And Lowe so so in in America, this won't pass that effectively, but in in in the rest of the normal world, Joachim Lowe is the soccer the national soccer coach of the German soccer team. So, yeah, I mean, I don't know who would be a very famous coach here, but Steve Kerr. I I mean, this is the you know, this is a super, super famous, name all around the world where soccer is the primary sport that people watch.[1:21:42] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and once people will see this video, they'll understand why we thought of calling this the low effect. It's very graphic, but but people are constantly smelling themselves. They're smelling themselves with their hands. They're smelling themselves explicitly. People are constantly smelling themselves, constantly smelling others.[1:22:03] Andrew Huberman: I find this topic so interesting. And first of all, confession. I definitely smell myself multiple times per day, and Everybody does. Okay. Good.[1:22:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, then I I, I would do it anyway. I think I, like most people, I either find my own smell to be neutral to pleasant. Right? I, occasionally, I'll be like, woah. I I need to take a shower.[1:22:24] Andrew Huberman: As long as we're talking about smelling oneself and, friendship kinship and its Relationship to smell. We have to talk about the relationship between smell and romantic attraction and bond. So my understanding is that If, for instance, a mouse is given the option to mate with any number of other different mice, they will bias their choice Toward the mouse that has the immune composition, the so called MHC, major histocompatibility complex, which reflects immune diversity, The immune system that is most distant from theirs, and the the evolutionary argument being that were they to, produce offspring, that the Array of immune genes would be much broader than if they were to select an animal very close to them. And in addition to that, that one of the most strongly selected Against behaviors, not just culturally, but at the level of eliciting a sense of disgust, Maybe even from the activity of the hypothalamus is mating with very close kin, aka incest, because that Can potential we know produces a higher rate of mutations. In other words, whereas you've described the relationship between smell and choice of friends as you, Choose people who smell more like you.[1:23:39] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that in the context of, choosing romantic partners or sexual partners or both, that you choose the person whose odor and therefore immune composition is most different.[1:23:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right. So the way you describe the animal literature is correct, and there's evidence to similar mechanisms in humans. Our lab has not worked Directly on this issue of of, of, romantic selection based on odor, there's a bunch of papers, Wedkinned, Ed Allen, and the Wedkin Lab and also Porter. I'll I'll email these to you later on, that have have done a lot of this work and find exactly as you say that that, romantic odor preferences in humans, are influenced by body odor and that this is linked to, MHC, histocompatibility complex makeup of the the Portion of our genome that that shapes our immune system, to some extent. So so this effect, has been studied and reported on, again, extensively in mice and also, in in humans, Not work that that we've done.[1:24:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: The one sort of Tangent work we've done and and and and I'd like to maybe tell you about it relates to to an effect That that is one of the most remarkable effects in in mammalian social chemo signaling. So And and also related to to so it's it's not related to romanticism in any way or or but but but it's related to reproduction. And and and indeed, in our lab, we've not looked at romanticism. We have looked at or are looking at reproduction. They're not always the same.[1:25:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: Certainly.[1:25:36] Andrew Huberman: Oh, they can.[1:25:37] Dr. Noam Sobel: They can. Animal mammalian or or terrestrial mammalian Reproductive behavior is is dominated by by the sense of smell, in in mammals. And here, Remember, initially, when you started off, I I noted that there are several subsystems in our nose that transduce odorants and and So primarily the the main olfactory system, the which is cranial nerve number 1 and the trigeminal nerve, which is cranial number 5. Most Terrestrial mammals have another subsystem referred to as the the, secondary olfactory system that has a separate sense organ in the nose. This organ is known as the vomeronasal organ.[1:26:16] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's a small pit in the nasal passage of of most terrestrial mammals. Sometimes it's, described as a communicating pit because sometimes it connects the nasal passage to the roof of the mouth. Sometimes it it connects both. And so there's the sense organ with its specific receptor subtypes, VNRs, Vermonasol Receptors. And, This, is linked to a to a sort of separate portion of the olfactory bulb, not really.[1:26:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: The main olfactory bulb, but it's referred to as the accessory olfactory bulb. And from there directly to the limbic system, to the to Portions of the brain that control reproductive behavior, and aggressive behavior. And And in most, terrestrial mammals, this subsystem processes odorants that are sometimes referred to as pheromones. Although that's in many ways a problematic term, but but odorants that are referred to as pheromones, namely odorants that are emitted by another member of the species To influence, that member of the species and alter behavior or hormonal state. And And and some of these formonal effects are are utterly remarkable.[1:27:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: And in my view, the most remarkable of all is an effect known as the Bruce effect. This was an effect discovered by Margaret Bruce in 1959. She was a a British, scientist. And In the Bruce effect, when you expose a pregnant mouse at an early critical stage of the pregnancy, I think up to about day 3, if you expose the pregnant mouse, to the order of what is referred to in technical terms as the non stud male, that is a male Who did not father the pregnancy, she will miscarry the pregnancy. She will abort it.[1:28:12] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now that that's an insane decision made by the female Yeah. Right? Because she's invested quite a lot in this, right, in in in biological terms and in in forming this pregnancy and maintaining it, and yet she drops it On the basis of an odor. And this effect is remarkably robust. And what do I mean by remarkably robust?[1:28:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: So this will occur On about 80% of exposures. Now as you know, 80% is a 100% in biology. Right? I mean, there's nothing that happens at more than 80%. So It's a remarkably be remarkably robust effect, this this dropping of the pregnancy.[1:28:50] Andrew Huberman: And we know it's mediated by Chemo sensation 3.[1:28:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: We know for sure, and we know in the following way. So first, it's enough to just bring the odor of the non stud male. You don't have to bring the male himself. Right? So you just can bring bedding from a non sun male and and that will induce, the Bruce effect.[1:29:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: But, of course, the most telling set of experiments is that if In the female mouse, you ablate the former nasal organ. You just burn this tiny structure in the nose, then the effect disappears. So the effect is completely dependent on the form of nasal organ. And and and I find this out Will affect. Right?[1:29:27] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean, it it be because, again, because of the the extent of of cost that that the female takes on here, based on on this information and smell. Now humans, The the the sort of the going notion in olfaction is that humans don't have a functional organ. So we don't have that, functional organ in our nose. Now I'll point out, we actually do have the pit. So the the the structure, or the outlining structure is there, but the pit that we have is considered vestigial and nonfunctional.[1:30:07] Andrew Huberman: And what about this thing I learned about at Berkeley, in integrated biology class that we have something called Jacobson's Oregon.[1:30:16] Dr. Noam Sobel: This is the same organ. So so Jacobson organs is the bone marrow nasal organ. It's also called Jacobson because, I think Jacobsen was a military physician in, like, the 1800 in Holland or something, and he found it in in In the soldier he was operating on or something like that. The the the story comes from something like that. But but, Jacobson organ is another name for the vomeronoiselle organ.[1:30:43] Dr. Noam Sobel: These are 1 in the same. The sensory organ of the, accessory olfactory system. And, again, the going notion is that the human Jacobson organ or vomeranian's organ is residual. It's nonfunctional. Does that necessarily mean that[1:30:58] Andrew Huberman: we don't have these pheromone effects?[1:30:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: No. It does not. So first of all, We know that lots of what are considered for hormonal effects, namely social chemocegonine and rodents are mediated by the main olfactory system. We know that for sure. There are several examples for this in mice and rats and rabbits and so on and so forth.[1:31:15] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so, a, These can be mediated by by the main olfactory system, and and and I'll I'll come back to that in a second. But first to finish the the Bruce effect. And and second and and I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm willing to take that that, risk. I'm I'm for me, the jury is still out on human vomeronasal organ. The the decision or the the notion, that it's nonfunctional relies on about 1a half papers postmortem, looking for the nerve that connects this thing to the brain and failing to find it, using staining and so on and so forth.[1:31:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: But Standing postmortem studies in humans are are notoriously complicated. Basically, you know, for many reasons, one of them is that the material is always has gone through you know, it's it's not ideally, set as it is when you sacrifice an animal and and And and study its its tissue. So so based on on really, really a paucity of studies that fail to find, this nerve, the notion is that the structure is vestigial, in humans. I don't have any evidence that it's functional, mind you. But but I'm just not sure that it's not.[1:32:41] Dr. Noam Sobel: But, what we do have a suspicion Is that humans may experience something similar to Bruce effect. So first of all, humans have an enormous, number or ratio of of of, of spontaneous miscarriage.[1:33:02] Andrew Huberman: Are they, occurring more often in the 1st trimester? Because you mentioned[1:33:06] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yes.[1:33:06] Andrew Huberman: That in the Bruce effect in the mice is in the 1st 3 days or so following pregnancy, which In the mouse gestation, as I recall, is about 21 days in the mouse. So you're talking about 1 7th of total gestation. So I'm Yeah. I'm not quick enough to to Nor is it important to translate, but this would be 1st trimester[1:33:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: in humans. Which is indeed Early 1st trimester. When most miscarriage occurs. Now Humans have, again, a huge number of miscarriages, and and the numbers I'll I'll soon share them with you. They they sound odd.[1:33:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: And the reason they sound odd is because if if you have what's sometimes simply referred to as failed implantation, right, this can occur, You know, in days 1, 2, nobody ever knows. Okay? So so some papers talk about 90% of all human pregnancies end in miscarriage. This is counting, a failed implementation in day 1, 2, etcetera. More conservative studies talk about 50%.[1:33:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: Nobody will argue 30%. Okay. So a huge number a huge number of of, human pregnancies end in miscarriage. Now out of these, there's a portion that are are unexplained. Right?[1:34:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: So nobody knows why. I mean, there are portion that are explained by All sorts of genetic factors, developmental factors, and so on and so forth. But there's also a proportion that are unexplained. And and and so all I'm saying is that there's there's a statistical backdrop or setting, if you will, for something like A remnant Bruce effect in humans. Now with that in mind, we we approached a group Of of we we we enlisted a group of of of they're not really patients and participants in in a study of people who or couples who are experiencing what is referred to as is unexplained repeated pregnancy loss.[1:34:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, formally, if you have, 2 consecutive, unexplained miscarriages, then, that that is sufficient for the diagnosis of unexplained repeated pregnancy loss. However, in our cohort of 30, we had couples who experienced 12 consecutive Unexplained repeated pregnancy losses. So so the 2 the 2 is just the formal. All of our cohort was like 12, 5, you know, so so this is an emotional Difficult place to be. And and these are couples who who are losing, their pregnancy for no apparent reason.[1:35:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: So they've gone through all the Test that you can imagine of, you know, genetic incompatibilities and all sorts of issues, clotting, all all the all the the known suspects, for for pregnancy loss. And the the medical establishment remains totally at a loss as to why these pregnancies aren't holding. And so we hypothesized that that perhaps here there's something akin to to a Bruce type effect. Obviously, it's not gonna be the same as in mice, but but something like a Bruce effect. Now, of course, at that stage, we could not do anything causal to to test this.[1:36:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? But What we could do is to see, you know, to to seek circumstantial evidence to see if if where there's fire, maybe there's smoke. And what we did was we tested, olfaction and more specifically, the response to to mail body odor In in the the couples experiencing, repeated pregnancy loss, And we found a few things. First of all, if you think of the mechanisms behind the Bruce effect, The Bruce effect implies that the female has to have a very clear memory of, the fathering male. Because if she's gonna miscarry in response to the non father, she has to know father and non father.[1:36:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean, that means that there's a pronounced Olfactory memory at the moment of mating. Okay? And and in mice, this has been very well characterized and and attributed To the anterio olfactory nucleus, a structure in the brain. But you'd have to have this memory in order to make that decision. Now so to address that and and here you're gonna see that you and your childhood story from before stand out a bit As as, skillful is that the first thing we did was just behaviorally test, whether These women and control women could identify the smell of their, spouse.[1:37:41] Dr. Noam Sobel: And you might be disappointed or, you know, we would all are probably a bit disappointed to learn That control women, are very poor at this. So so you you would think that that women would be good at identifying the body odor of their spouse. They're not. They're not far from chance. However, the, women who experience, repeated pregnancy loss are more than they're they're double, at their performance level.[1:38:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: So this is not a nuance effect. Women who who who who experience repeated, pregnancy loss can identify, their husbands or their spouses,[1:38:25] Andrew Huberman: by their body odor with much greater acuity than the typical person.[1:38:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: Double. A bit more than double and and way above chance.[1:38:34] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. No. I I sorry. I posed it as a question, but I meant, yes, with much greater acuity, and double is is Yeah. A significant, improvement.[1:38:44] Andrew Huberman: Are they much better at detecting any odor?[1:38:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: No. They're not. We did the controls, and they're not. And then, we also measured using fMRI, we measured their their brain response to, stranger male body odor. And there and and and this was quite remarkable because, you know, we approached so this was a full brain analysis.[1:39:07] Dr. Noam Sobel: So without a region of interest analysis, so it's not as if you're, tweaking your statistics to look at one part of the brain. You're just looking at the entire brain In the response to male body odor and asking de novo, is there a difference between these 2 groups of participants? And there was one huge difference, and it was in the hypothalamus. And so there was a difference in response to stranger male body order, between the 2 groups. So so Olfaction is altered in spontaneous repeated spontaneous, pregnancy loss.[1:39:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: We don't know this is causal. Right? But but That was enough for us to approach the ethics committee, to run a causal experiment, and we're at the beginning of that now.[1:39:54] Andrew Huberman: Incredible. I can't wait to hear the the results of that It's gonna take[1:39:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: it'll probably take years. A few. Because The these are slow experiments to run. Recruitment is complicated, but, basically, we're we're blocking, we're blocking smell in in, Couples who are trying to maintain a pregnancy.[1:40:20] Andrew Huberman: I want to touch on some other, so called pheromone effects. One thing I heard you say during a talk, which I think really captures this whole issue of, are there pheromone effects in humans, Very nicely as you said, you know, whether or not it's a classic for pheromone effect or whether or not it's olfaction or something else, this is chemosensory signaling Yep. Between individuals. The reason this is important to me is, a few years ago, I did a social media post about pheromone effects in animals and some potential pheromone effects in humans, and a couple of the, Human, olfactionistas, more from the the actually, who work on animal models really came after me with, You know, intense sniffing saying, you know, there is no evidence for human pheromone affects human pheromone organs. And I think today, you've beautifully illustrated how Regardless of the answer to that, humans are contain or and are emitting chemical signals that influence each other's physiology and behavior.[1:41:16] Dr. Noam Sobel: For sure. For sure. And and the the term pheromone is a problematic term in any case. I mean, the term the term was, put forth to describe insect behavior. Right?[1:41:26] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, you know, if if you were given a hard time by the mouse people, you could have given an them an equally hard time if you were an insect person. Right? Because really the the place the term It is is, is accurate. Is you know? So the 1st pheromone that was discovered was bambacol, which is the pheromone that has the male moth follow the the scent Trail of the female moth.[1:41:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: Bambacol is a pheromone. Insect pheromone people will argue that this Stuff that people talk about in mice and rats is not pheromones.[1:41:57] Andrew Huberman: I see.[1:41:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and and it all becomes semantics.[1:41:59] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Sort of like nerdy inside ball.[1:42:02] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's All semantics. So I don't I'd in in our publications, we don't use the term pheromone, you know, because it would not help me, and it would probably only hurt us. And so, you know, we talk about chemo signals.[1:42:12] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:42:12] Dr. Noam Sobel: And humans definitely emit chemo signals from their body, and these chemo signals influence other humans and influence their behavior. You know? And and and there there are several examples of this. One of them, I'll I'll point out first, Which is is sort of the most widely studied and and not mostly from our lab, actually. I mean, the the the flavor of the month For the past 10 years in this field is what's referred to as the smell of fear.[1:42:42] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? So, This is probably true of of many mammals and humans. It's true of, we emit a Specific body odor when we're in the state of fear. This was first discovered in humans by Denise Chen, out of, I think, Brown.[1:43:01] Andrew Huberman: I'm not sure. Think that's right.[1:43:03] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yep. Humans submit a particular body odor when they're in a state of fear, and this body odor influences other humans, in effect, Increasing, their autonomic, arousal, their sympathetic state. So in Fact, you could say that fear is contagious a bit. So the smell of fear, is contagious. By the way, culturally, we know for ages that dogs can smell fear in humans, but actually that was only really shown about a year and a half ago in a study.[1:43:33] Dr. Noam Sobel: So it it it was always said, but it wasn't really shown effectively. It was shown about a year and a half ago in a study that dogs indeed can smell human fear, and humans can smell human fear. So several labs starting from Denise Chen and Haviland Jones and and then in our lab and in other labs, if if you collect body odor from people in a state of fear, and collect body odor from the same people when they're not in a state of fear, other people can determine which is is the state of fear or not, and and this influences their behavior. What about the smell of safety, or is that simply the absence of[1:44:07] Andrew Huberman: the odor Corresponding to fear. And the reason I asked this is somewhat woven into our, prior discussion about mate choice. Again, I'll ask the question in a form of of brief anecdotes. I'll use the I had a friend who, approach here. But, well, one phenomenon that has nothing to do, with me in particular, I think this is a common phenomenon, is Romantic partners leaving articles of clothing at each other's homes.[1:44:34] Andrew Huberman: Now this could have other purposes to mark territory, but, Visually marking territory, but also, scent marking territory is very common in the animal kingdom. Yeah. It's not uncommon, for, romantic partners when one is traveling or away for the other partner to smell their article of clothing in order to bring about positive, connotations of the other partner, very common behavior. If you're doing this, folks, other people are doing this too. Yeah.[1:45:02] Andrew Huberman: It raises questions, for instance, about whether or not the morning period Part post breakup whether by decision by death or by, some other phenomenon that's forced the breakup, whether or not that mourning period has something to do with an olfactory Unlearning of, and made slash and on and on and on.[1:45:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: With with all these insights, I would offer you to be a postdoc advisor. Listen, Listen,[1:45:23] Andrew Huberman: I have a sabbatical finish. So I would love to do[1:45:26] Dr. Noam Sobel: a sabbatical. Gonna kill me. You said? Exactly.[1:45:28] Andrew Huberman: Is that you don't want me to work for you. We talked about this earlier That's[1:45:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: what I'm saying. Reasons. Exactly.[1:45:32] Andrew Huberman: A story there what no one is referring to. I'll just tell people because inside jokes on the podcast that don't really work. Earlier, I was just I was afraid, in fact, that I've had 3 incredible Scientific mentors, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc, but, for reasons, that are unclear to me, the first one died of suicide, the second one cancer at 50, and the third one, pancreatic cancer in his early sixties. And the last one before he died is an MD and a common friend of Noam's, and I turned to me and said, you know, Andrew, you're the common denominator. So, you know, the the joke that the joke to my business is you don't want me to work for you.[1:46:09] Andrew Huberman: So, nonetheless, I would love to do a sabbatical in your life. No. That[1:46:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: so so What I was trying to say in that roundabout way is that those are all really keen observations and good ideas, for sure. And and And they just highlight again, you know, that that we're incredibly olfactory animals. You know? And and and you're you're even talking about the nuance. We're very olfactory even not in the nuance.[1:46:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: You know, I I have this when people tell me that, you know, that we don't use our sense of smell, we don't need it and all that, and and I I have to deal with this a lot. Right? I have to deal a lot. You study vision. Nobody will tell you that vision is unimportant.[1:46:41] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right?[1:46:41] Andrew Huberman: I have to visually dependent. I don't need a dog to take over my olfactory system if I lose olfaction, but I'll tell you from having lost my sense of smell[1:46:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: Sure. Yeah.[1:46:49] Andrew Huberman: For one day Right. I was in intense fear. I bit into blue I Love blueberries. I'm like a drive by blueberry eater. If they're there, I just kinda pick them up like a grizzly bear and cram them in my mouth.[1:46:58] Andrew Huberman: So keep them away from me if you don't want them eating, but I can't I almost can't help myself. I bit into a blueberry or a handful of blueberries, and they just the it was the sensation of little bags of water, and I immediately felt, like, A tremendous read.[1:47:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: I'll tell you an, a a sort of a a throwaway line that I use in this one when I talk with people. You know, I I mean, you know, take the 2 Most basic behaviors that sustain us. Right? Let's say I give you a choice Between a beautiful looking layer cake with with with Strawberries and blueberries and and, and whipped cream, but that smells of sewage versus some gray brown mix that smells of cinnamon. Which do we eat?[1:47:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: Simple. The latter. Right. You eat the latter. Right?[1:47:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now imagine I offer you a mate. Choose the the gender of your liking. Right? It looks like a Greek God or goddess, right, but smells of sewage or an ordinary looking individual that smells of sin itself. Who do you choose?[1:48:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: The latter. Right. So in the 2 most basic behaviors we have, We follow our nose, not our eyes. Right? Definitely not[1:48:19] Andrew Huberman: always in predictable ways because you offered an extreme example, which is the best example. But I, for instance, for reasons I don't know, I've never liked the smell of perfume ever. In fact, I find it aversive, but I Do I confess. I do like the smell of certain body odors very much, and I'm very, Particular about that, and I know within an instant. And so, this is a problem for any romantic partner, who Likes perfume for me, but I know many people like perfumes and colognes and things of that sort.[1:48:54] Andrew Huberman: Perfume. And and in fairness, I've also been told, that, by someone that they couldn't spend time with me because they do not like my smell. In fact, they dislike it. And I've and fortunately for me, there's at least 1 person on planet who said the opposite. So the, so I completely agree with what you're saying.[1:49:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah.[1:49:12] Andrew Huberman: I can also say that, I imprinted on the smell of I had a bulldog mastiff, when that raised from the time he was a puppy, and I imprinted on I imprinted on his smell Immediately. And even though to other people, he was a bulldog mastiff after all, his smell was rather aversive. To me, he he smelled delicious. Right? I and it maybe it smelled like home, and he was my Yeah.[1:49:36] Andrew Huberman: Best animal friend for a long time. So and on and on and on. Right? The smell of children, as you said, the backs we had a guest on this podcast who I'm sure you're familiar, Charles Zucker. Yeah.[1:49:45] Andrew Huberman: A professor at Columbia has done incredible work in vision and old fashion.[1:49:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah.[1:49:49] Andrew Huberman: They're sensing it. And he and I talked a little bit about this that, there's something in the breadth of romantic partners, that's hopefully appetitive, not aversive. As well as in children, he was talking about the smell of his grandchilds, The bat the nape of their the back of their neck and how he misses that smell because it when he thinks about missing his grandchild or children, It's that smell that that that's associated with that ceiling. Hexadecanal. Hexadecanal?[1:50:19] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Is that Charles, your grandchildren smell like a decanal. Yes. He's gonna come after me now.[1:50:25] Dr. Noam Sobel: They do. And and so, this this is a study, ran by, Eva Michor, who was a graduate student in our lab. And and Eva was interested in aggression. She was really into aggression. And actually, when she start and and and so when she started off, we said, okay.[1:50:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: Let's do chemo signaling of aggression. She actually was going to, like, MMA clubs and collecting body odors, and we we had all sorts of ideas going, and and she's She worked on that for quite a bit. It never went anywhere really. And then at the same time, We had a colleague of ours, from Germany. I mean, when I say colleague, primarily a friend or or acquaintance I made at conferences, Heinz Brier, and and he was studying in his lab, a molecule, hexadecanal, that was a chemo signal in mice.[1:51:29] Dr. Noam Sobel: Where in mice, It was described as a chemo signal that promotes social buffering. Where social buffering, as far as I understand, It's not my field, but as far as I understand, it's basically a feel good together thing. So when lots of mice are together, they feel good about being in a group, And that's social buffering, and it's promoted by hexadecanal, which they emit in their feces, mice. And in his work on hexadecimal,[1:52:00] Andrew Huberman: and[1:52:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: and so so so Breyer and his colleague, Storzmann, they they discovered the receptor for this, And then they went and discovered that the receptor is very highly conserved throughout mammalian evolution. And therefore, they hypothesized That maybe, this is a universal mammalian signal. Now which is unusual because in in chemo signaling, Typically, you tend to think of things as being very species specific. But here, they hypothesized that maybe hexadecimal, which promotes social buffering in mice, May do something in all mammals. Again, because this receptor is very highly conserved, OR 37 b, I think.[1:52:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: So they so so he approached us and said, look. You gotta study this stuff in humans. Right? Because he knows us as the human people. Right?[1:52:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean, We go to these olfaction conferences where where lots of people study mice and and and zebrafish and whatnot, and we're the the human group. So and and eventually, he just FedExed us, hexadecimal. And and so we had this thing sitting around, And Eva was not going anywhere with her aggression studies with sweat from human participants, And yet she built the entire paradigm to study human aggression. So they're standard paradigms. This is a paradigm known as the TAP, The Tyler aggression paradigm.[1:53:23] Dr. Noam Sobel: I'll soon describe it. And so we said, okay. We have this hexadec canal stuff here, And it promotes social buffering. Social buffering sounds like it would make you less aggressive. Why don't you run your tap experiment using hexadecimal?[1:53:37] Dr. Noam Sobel: What's the tap experiment? So, basically, what you do is you bring in a participant to lab, and you have them Thinking that they're gonna be playing against another person in in this game. And you can you can do something like have another person walk into the other room Playing online, so so connected. So you can fool them into being quite convinced that this is what's happening. And they go into their own room.[1:54:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: And in the initial game they play, on each round, they're, they're Provided with a sum of money, and this is real money that they'll receive at the end of the experiment. And by turn, each one of them decides how to divide the money up between the 2. Right? So they're playing against another person, they think, but that's actually a computer algorithm that they're playing against. And the Computer algorithm is is programmed to be an insight if it's terminology, a jerk.[1:54:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? So that you know, like, let's say they have to divvy up a 100 shekel, which is the Israeli currency. So so the com you know, the other player would say, okay. You know, I'll keep 96, and you get 4. Right?[1:54:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: And then if you you can either accept it or not accept it, and then neither of you get anything. Right? So, basically, you're being shafted by by the other side all the time. And this is called the provocation phase. You're really getting angry at this person because they're they're really not nice.[1:55:01] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? They're they're shafting you on every trial or almost. And you play this game and and it goes to its end, and then you put you play a second game as far as, you know, against the same participant. And the 2nd game is a reaction time game. So a target shows up, and the 1st to press it wins.[1:55:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: And on every trial where you win, If you want, you can blast the other participant with a loud noise. And and it's a really loud noise. So you're also wearing earphones. It's 90 dB, And it's it's a screeching horrible sound. It's the most punishment that an IRB committee will let you, endure on a on a participant in the experiment, Unless you're in Stanford 70 years ago or[1:55:43] Andrew Huberman: whatever that was. No one's referring to the the classic prisoner experiment, which took place in the building next door to where I[1:55:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: work, by the way. So you can blast the other participant with varying levels of of sound, and you you have a selection box from something very low to something very high. And what's nice about this is that it then allows you to quantify aggression because the more volume you're blasting the opponent with, the more aggressive you are towards your opponent. And and so you have a a measure of aggression. Again, the Tyler aggression paradigm, obviously, invented by Tyler, very well validated, studied all over, you know, a a very standard protocol.[1:56:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, we brought in participants And had them play, the Tyler, The Tap, either under exposure to hexadecanal or control. Now exadecanal doesn't it's it's incredibly difficult to even detect exadecanal. But just in case, because it it it it's not very very it's considered a semi volatile. It it doesn't have a strong smell. But we buried it both control and the hexadecimal in a a control odor that hid them in a mask.[1:56:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and she ran lots and lots and lots and lots of participants, men and women. And I'll first tell you the result with men, which is that hexadecanal consistently reduced aggression. People were less aggressive under hexadecanal. The effect size was was, quite meaningful. And later on, we learned because I'm I'm no specialist in the world of aggression, but compared to effects seen in the aggression world in in research, Really, really strong effects.[1:57:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: So unusually strong. So hexadecimal lowered aggression in men, and we were like, cool. This is, you know, sort of what we were Hoping to to see consistent with the hypothesis, and consistent with it seems to do in mice. But then we looked at data from women, and hexadecanal increased aggression equally significantly.[1:57:41] Andrew Huberman: Is this thought to be something related to maternal protectiveness? We're getting there.[1:57:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you you got there really fast. It took me a year, but, and and and Eva got to it really. I'll I'll I'll tell you. Because remember, we're reaching the back of the head of your Of of, whose was it? Grandchildren?[1:57:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: Charles Zucker. Just go with the grandchildren.[1:57:59] Andrew Huberman: The Charles Zucker. One of the kingpins of the New York neuroscience mafia.[1:58:03] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yes. So so this was really odd to me at that time. So I didn't have the intuition you just had, and I was like, Eva, this there was some bug here. I mean, this this it makes no sense to me. You know, why would something increase aggression in women and decrease aggression in men?[1:58:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: This is Really, really strange. And and I said, okay. I wanna see this happen again before, you know, we go ahead with this. So she went and did the entire experiment again, and this time she did it within the fMRI magnet so that we we can also, track, brain activity, while this was happening. And first of all, it replicated again.[1:58:43] Dr. Noam Sobel: So once again, hexadecimal men made men less aggressive And women more aggressive. And and and the extent of more than the effect alone, the dissociation was remarkable. This has the it's it's almost like a chromosomal test. I mean, you you look at the data on the unit unit slope line, and all all the men are below and all the women are above. There there's this figure in the paper.[1:59:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: Then she also looked at at the brain data, and and this is you know, although our lab does a ton of fMRI, it's one of the major tools we use to measure, brain activity. I'm I'm I'm quite cognizant of the limitations of fMRI. And and this is, I think, sadly I think the only study in my career, at least, where where I actually managed to also get a mechanism out of fMRI, not only An area that's involved in activity. And and so here's what we saw, that hexadecimal alone increased activity White, pronouncedly in an area of the brain known as the left angular gyrus. Now this is an area involved in what's referred to as social appraisal.[1:59:50] Dr. Noam Sobel: So that was kind of cool in that a social order activated the social brain, not the olfactory system per se and and very pronounced. So on one hand, that was cool, but then what was uncool was that it did the same in men and women. And this was in contrast to behavior, which you don't like seeing. Right? I mean, because you would expect brain activity to reflect behavior.[2:00:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: And it increased activity in the left angeolary gyrus in both both men and women. But then she did a follow-up analysis, Which was look at what's referred to as functional connectivity. That is how does this region of the brain talk with the entire brain as it were Under hexadecanal versus, control. And here, the dissociation reemerged powerfully, whereby The connectivity from the angular gyrus was mostly to the classic neural substrates of aggression, so the amygdala and the temporal pole. And the connectivity went in opposite directions in men and women.[2:00:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: So hexadecadal increased functional connectivity in men and decreased it in women. So in a way, this is almost saying that the default brain reaction is aggression. Right? The default is to aggress. And in men, hexadecanal increases the control that the left angular virus is holding over your aggression and and keeping you back.[2:01:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: And in women, it let it roam free and they became more aggressive. But I was still puzzled. So so the so I was convinced this happened twice. The MRR data Provided not only a a pattern, but a mechanism which is unusual. And yet, I I was Telling you, you've already know, but, you know, this makes no sense to me.[2:01:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: And then and then her insight, which, of course, afterwards is like, duh, it Is no. There's a place where this makes perfect sense, and that is if you're a mammalian offspring because Paternal aggression is often directed at you. There's infanticide all over, and sadly, there's Male aggression towards human children as well, and maternal aggression is often protective. So if you're an offspring, if you have a molecule That will make your mother more aggressive and your daddy less aggressive. Both of those are good for you, so you're winning.[2:02:09] Dr. Noam Sobel: So We remembered a recently published paper from a group in Japan that looked at the odors emanating from baby heads. We now come full circle to Zukor's grandchildren. They used a method known as GCMS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, to measure the volatiles from baby heads because baby head odor is a cultural thing across cultures even in Japan. And so we quickly went to that paper and to see if one of the molecules that report is hexadecimal, and we were very disappointed that it wasn't One of the molecules that reported in the paper. And so we we wrote to the authors who are since then our coauthors, and we said, look.[2:02:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: You know, we're studying, this molecule, hexadecimal, and we don't see it in your results. And and we were wondering maybe you had some results that you didn't publish or some supplementary tools or whatever. And, this lab, which is a hardcore GC lab, said no. No. Hextodecanal is a semi volatile, which we knew.[2:03:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: And our previous paper was not directed to the semi volatile range, but we can now do use what's called GCX, GC, double GC that, is directed at semi volatiles, and we can do this again. We just, studied 11 babies, and we can we can see if this is an issue. So he said, yeah. Please do. The bottom line of all this is that hexadecimal is the most abundant semi volatile in baby hits.[2:03:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's tons of it coming out of baby hits. So babies again, speaking about if humans do or don't chemo single. Babies are conducting chemical warfare. Right? They're they're they're, You know, reducing aggression in their fathers or males around them and increasing aggression in their mothers or females around them, And both of those things are good[2:03:56] Andrew Huberman: for them. Incredible. This is somewhat different than what we're talking about, and yet similar in other ways, because it's, built off of anecdotal evidence. But it's anecdotal evidence that you hear all the time, and yet when you look in Scientific literature, at least by my read, the data are not clear, maybe even contradictory, and that relates to The coordination of menstrual cycles among cohost Yeah. Women or women who are friends.[2:04:27] Andrew Huberman: The you know, many women listening to this, And maybe some men who are aware of of this effect will say, oh, yeah. Absolutely. When I spend time with my friends or go away camping or even spend a day with them, our menstrual cycles become coordinated. However, my understanding is that the early literature, Barbara McClintock Correct. Discovered this phenomenon and published a paper in science as an undergraduate?[2:04:49] Andrew Huberman: 1971 nature. Amazing. Nature, paper. Again, one of the 3 Apex journals, and as an undergrad, fantastic. So discover this, describe this, And, probably, women all over the world who became aware of this one way or another probably probably said, yes.[2:05:02] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. This gives validation to what we've observed over and over again. And yet As subsequent papers have been published, this result has been called into question. Is, is there any, final word on whether or not menstrual cycles, become coordinated among women who spend time together, and if so, is there any role of olfaction in this, or, chemosensing through the nostrils, Warm and or mouth, to support this idea.[2:05:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so yeah. So so I'll start off indeed to echo, The background is that this study was conducted by by Martha McClintock when she was an undergraduate at Wesleyan College. And she noticed that She thought her menstrual cycle and and her co inhabitants in her dorm room, were coordinated in time. And I should say that this comes on the basis of similar or related type effects in rodents. Now rodents don't have a menstrual cycle like humans do, But but, there's an effect in ruins referred to as the Witten effect, which, resembles, this type of of of effect.[2:06:15] Dr. Noam Sobel: And she published indeed that paper as an undergraduate in Nature in 1971. And to answer your question, she published a follow-up in 1998, also in Nature, with then her graduate students at Chicago, Stern. So this is Stern and McClintock 1998. And here's what they did. They, collected, sweat From donor women and deposited it on the upper lip of recipient women.[2:06:42] Dr. Noam Sobel: So this would be a fun experiment For you at least, we so you said you like body odors, but for many others, perhaps it would be daunting.[2:06:50] Andrew Huberman: Well, I like certain body odors from certain individuals. Okay. I don't I don't think I uniformly like all body orders. Although, I do seem to uniformly not like the smell of perfume. Although, I should just declare why because I put this out there, and I learned the hard way in the comment section on YouTube.[2:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Some of those perfumes I find downright aversive. Yeah. Like, it's, I think the great Marcus Meister, who a great neurobiologist, once said there's basically 3 responses. It's either yum, yuck, or meh. So some I've Are truly[2:07:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: yuck never heard that one again.[2:07:20] Andrew Huberman: That one. Right? In terms of the animal behavior or human behavior, we're either a move forward, move back, or[2:07:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: a or a Yeah. Yeah. Or a pause.[2:07:27] Andrew Huberman: So some are truly a yuck. Some many are meh. 0 to date are Yum, Verney. Yeah. Now body odors, the distribution has shifted.[2:07:39] Andrew Huberman: It could be any one of those 3, yum, yuck, or meh. So just to be clear. But the The, yum category is definitely included. Thank you for for allowing me to do that. So[2:07:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: so, so So so she did this study. So so because right in the original McClintock study, you you might suspect other, drivers of the effect. Even let's say you You accept the effect, but still there might be other social drivers of the effect that are not body odor. Right? There might be some dominant woman Who's dominant in some other way, and this might be driving the coordination.[2:08:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? So here, there was no direct link between these women other than body odor. So if the effect reemerged, it would definitely be an olfactory effect. And what she found is that if she took, sweat from the follicular or the ovulatory, phase of the donors, One extended the the cycle in recipients and one shortened the cycle in recipients. I don't remember which was which.[2:08:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: But but, basically, definitely denoting a chemo signaling effect, with with opposing, effects on duration based on the time it was collected from, again, published in Nature in 1998. That's it. I I there there's a a quotation. I think this is from from, from from, I'm not sure, but but, you know, that that, if something is published in nature or science, that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true. So, with that in mind, the findings were since called into question white widely.[2:09:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: One reason is just statistics of cyclic events are surprisingly complicated. So so it's tricky. It's once you have a cyclic event, statistics become tricky. And and so so Martha took a lot of heat on the statistics of of Claiming an effect, and I think there was at least 1 effort of replication that didn't really work out. If you ask me, I'm on the fence.[2:09:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I I'm and but I may may be in a minority in my Field, I think, a majority in the field, is currently negative. I'm not. And I've we've said in the lab that we should do a planned replication. We will. It's just Again, it's a horrible study to run.[2:10:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's tons of work, and you and and and you have to run it for a really long time. And and, so it's it's just completely nontrivial. But we have a graduate student now in lab interested in these exact things, Rude Weisgrohe, and And she's doing similar stuff, and and I hope we'll we'll do that. I hope we'll we'll try to to replicate this.[2:10:43] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting result, and I think, interesting because it of its real world, meaning outside the laboratory, of course, or experiment Analog, but also because pheromone effects and olfactory effects in humans seem unique among neurobiological slash endocrine phenomena because there seems to be so many stories That we all have of the smell of our grandmother's hands or the recognizing the scent of of somebody or I knew from the moment that, I smelled their breath or, you know, or I just liked their smell kind of thing. These kind of things that that inform the the Deep potential for a real biological phenomenon as opposed to the kind of thing like, oh, you know, you just throw something out there. Cytosine is bonding, and and all of a sudden, you know, the the general public, not at no to no fault of their own, comes to think that every every aspect of bonding is is oxytocin, and every defect in bonding is lack of oxytocin. But the the general public provides a sort of a a rich, it's fodder for for exploring all these things, and a lot of times they turn out to be true, right, when in the context of old action.[2:11:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. No. It's it's a very primal system. You know? So so, it's it's linked to[2:12:02] Andrew Huberman: the most, you know, limbic primal mechanisms in our brain, and it drives primal behavior. It's it's an incredible system. I I have a question about a particular study, but I'm just gonna queue it up, and you'll know immediately what I'm I'm queuing up. And that is, what is the relationship between odors and hormones and in particular, Crying.[2:12:27] Dr. Noam Sobel: As I pointed out previously, the the sort of flavor of the month in in human social chemo signaling research is the smell of fear, And the the media, of the month is sweat. Right? So so, the the few, Maybe tens of labs in the world that study, human social chemo signaling all collect sweat, and and that's the media, they look at.[2:12:50] Andrew Huberman: Is it always from the armpit, or is there are there meaningful differences in terms of the sweat emitted from different locations on the body? I already know the answer to that as I ask it, but let's just stay above the waistline and, Oh, no. No. Yeah. Yeah.[2:13:03] Andrew Huberman: Below the waistline. I mean, we're biologists after all.[2:13:06] Dr. Noam Sobel: We we just yeah. So it's it's funny. We we we have we're working on a paper on that right now on the smell of fear. So so we have a nice Paradigm for, generating fear, we throw people out of airplanes. It's a very effective way to generate fear.[2:13:19] Andrew Huberman: To come to your lab. Sounds like[2:13:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: the greatest[2:13:21] Andrew Huberman: lab in the world.[2:13:22] Dr. Noam Sobel: We we didn't invent that, by the way. The 1st to do that was, and I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly. I think it's Mujika Perudi. But but, that's our paradigm for generating fear, and we started that on our own. But, we've since entered Into collaboration with the, Israeli Paratroopers Brigade, and we now collect body odor from every first time jumper.[2:13:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, We we went that path because we, like everybody else in this field, you know, the the holy grail there is is finding the molecules. Right? I mean, if you'll have The fear molecules, that's a bonanza. Right? Because I mean, you know, you could think of many reasons why it would be a bonanza, but for for me, you know, if If you find the molecules, you you can then try and find the receptors.[2:14:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: And when you find the cognate receptors, you can then develop blockers, and you can imagine, You know, what's the term I'm looking for? I'm switching into Hebrew. It's about midnight now. Right? I'm sorry.[2:14:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's 3:30 morning.[2:14:25] Andrew Huberman: You're doing incredibly well considering the conversion of the in the morning. Yeah. We would never know. Yeah. No one traveled in today from Israel.[2:14:32] Andrew Huberman: So he's a he's a circadian inverted as we say.[2:14:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: Anxiety. So so, You you can imagine developing, like, a nasal spray against anxiety, right, where where you would quell those receptors and kill the fear response. Right? Which rather than going the current path, which is through neurotransmitters that then have effects all over the place, you would be getting fear at its Source. Right?[2:14:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so that would be why I would want that. And and and we figure out that doing that, you know, collecting fear from, like, 3, 4, or 5 people, in an experiment, you'll never be able to do analytical chemistry on that. So we now have, we we have a a setting we call fear bank, which now has more than a 1000 samples in it. So we're we're trying to do, analytics on that. But But in doing that, we've we've joined, you know, the the crowd.[2:15:23] Dr. Noam Sobel: Everybody's doing fear, and everybody's doing sweat. And in one of our Discussions in lab, you know, we were saying, well, there's gotta be, you know or there potentially definitely could be additional bodily media that are are playing to social chemo signaling. Now many of these, you know, you can't really study. Right? I mean, so, you know, just to throw it right.[2:15:45] Dr. Noam Sobel: Most terrestrial mammals communicate social information through urine. But, you know, starting doing experiments with humans with Smelling urine, it would be difficult, you know, both in IRB and in agreement and, you know and and then We we we you know, this is a rare case where we actually hypothesize what we set out to do, and it's you know, it did only claim in retrospect that it was hypothesis, is is tears. We we we started thinking about tears and looking into tears because tears are a bodily liquid emotional tears that that we emit in emotional situations where where these are situations where nonverbal communication is is critical and key, and and tears are a liquid that that is puzzling beyond ocular maintenance. Right? And so so, you know, the the most Influential text, I think, till this day in in in emotion research is is Darwin's book, The Showing of the Emotions in Man and Animals, think it's the full name of the book.[2:16:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: And an entire chapter, chapter 6, is devoted to tears. An entire chapter of this book. Why? With with no conclusion. Why?[2:17:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: Because the book revolves around Describing the functional antecedents of emotional expressions. So for example, showing of the teeth is a sign of aggression. Right? So So animals first bit with their teeth, and and Darwin argued that through evolution, just, showing the teeth alone became an aggressive sign because It started from biting. Or what I I find is a is a beautiful example, and this is work partly done by by Adam Anderson now at Cornell, is is the, emotional expression of disgust.[2:17:41] Dr. Noam Sobel: So disgust, which comes from 1, disduzia, distaste, right, is spinning something out of your mouth. Now what what Adam showed is is that The musculature patterns of activation and the temporal sequence of activation when you experience moral disgust Are the same as when you spit a bitter taste out of your mouth. Right? So, again, so there's a functional antecedent spitting something out. And through evolution, the argument was that it became an expression of emotion, and you expressed disgust just as if you're spinning something out of your mouth even though they're you know, in the case of moral disgust, There's nothing you're spinning out of your mouth.[2:18:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so Darn systematically went through the expressions of emotions and for each one went to their and explained everything very nicely. And then he got stuck with tears. Right? Because tears are an obvious emotional expression, And he could not find a functional, antecedent. So he ended up saying, you know, this is an epic phenomena, Basically.[2:18:41] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? I I don't know. I What[2:18:43] Andrew Huberman: what all scientists do when they don't have a good explanation, you know, blame it[2:18:46] Dr. Noam Sobel: on nature. Right. Right. So so And and but he bothered to write this entire chapter on on on the ocular sort of maintenance, you know, function of tears and so on But but nothing emotional. So we thought, well, maybe the function is is a chemical signal.[2:19:03] Dr. Noam Sobel: And And, you know, so so with that in mind, we we harvested emotional tears, which was also an amusing Event on its own. Right? Because we we, we, we we posted, messages On all sorts of boards that that, we're seeking, experiment participants who cry with ease. Now this generated an unfortunate gender bias in our study. Right?[2:19:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: Because we received about a 100 women volunteers and about 1 man. And, you know, I think this is not a problem only in in macho Israel. Right? Probably anywhere in the west, this would be I mean, definitely in America would be the same, I think. Yeah.[2:19:45] Andrew Huberman: My guess is that there are probably men out there who Cry easily, emotional tears.[2:19:49] Dr. Noam Sobel: Oh, sure.[2:19:50] Andrew Huberman: But they're just gonna show up. Yeah.[2:19:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. That's what I'm saying. The it's a cultural thing. It's not you know, you're not gonna come to a lab and say, yeah. You know, I cry all the time.[2:19:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: It this is not gonna happen. And then, we we what we did is, for each one of these participants, You know, we would ask them, you know, is there a particular film event that you know of that you know, a scene that that makes you cry? And and interestingly, in these Effective criers. There's always oh, yes. You know, the scene in in so and so.[2:20:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: I always cry profusely from that. You know?[2:20:20] Andrew Huberman: They they have their me an example of one of the more Commonly used scenes.[2:20:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. With with these. The movie, the champ. The champ dies. He's a boxer, And he dies and literally in the hands of his about 8 year old son.[2:20:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: And his son is standing next to his bed and, you know, saying champ, champ, and and he dies. Right? It's a winner. Okay? Waterfalls.[2:20:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah.[2:20:54] Andrew Huberman: Got[2:20:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: it. So, you know, we're those 12th in the world. Right? We have a whole huge collection.[2:21:02] Andrew Huberman: There is such a thing as tears of joy, by the way.[2:21:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: So no. No? Well, we're going ahead of ourselves, but as I say, we tried to collect them and failed. Even people who think they shed tears of joy and laughter, Their eyes water a bit, but it's not the same thing. In in in the effective criers, we end up screening.[2:21:23] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, you know, we collect a full ML of tears a full ML of tears in about 15 minutes. Wow. So so that's pouring. Right? And that doesn't happen from laughter.[2:21:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: That we or we've never seen that. We've never seen that happen from laughter. We tried. So so, so we have we have all these sad films. And by the way, one of the amusing things is, when we ultimately published this paper in in science, we were forced, in retrospect, to go out and actually buy the films.[2:21:56] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right. We I mean, you know, originally, we, like, downloaded them. We're we're there, but you can't because you're you'd be violating, You know, copyright laws. Right. So we had to buy, like, purchase all these films that the participants watched.[2:22:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: Them. So So we we actually have these in lab, like DVDs, you know, that we actually purchased.[2:22:16] Andrew Huberman: But so so Nice coverage of potential legal fallout No.[2:22:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: No. No. Yeah. No. We did.[2:22:22] Dr. Noam Sobel: We did. I believe we did.[2:22:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It was[2:22:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: that, so, we and and yeah. And And, well, we can touch on that later. But but, so, we so most of these, volunteers who Who comes saying they can cry with ease actually don't meet the bill. And so out of the about 100, at least, more women that we screened, we ended up, with about 6 who who could really come to lab week after week and Porteous.[2:22:55] Andrew Huberman: There's a name for this in psychiatry. They call it, a narrative distancing. Some people when they watch a film where someone's getting hit, They they they they flinch quite a lot. They it's almost as if they're experiencing it. It but it works in the opposite direction too.[2:23:09] Andrew Huberman: I know someone like this. Okay. Where if they watch a film that Someone's experiencing something even mildly positive that their mood elevates, so they they can quickly bridge. Yeah. And and it's not always adaptive as you can imagine, so there's lack of narrative distancing.[2:23:24] Andrew Huberman: Right.[2:23:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. One one, you know, issue you can bring up with this entire line of studies in our lab Is I don't know if there's something very unique about the donors. Right? I mean, we're assuming these are tiers and No.[2:23:35] Andrew Huberman: This is pretty common. I think that the numbers I saw, out there about 5 to 8%.[2:23:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: That's exactly what we got about. Right? About 600. So so so we collected, Tears, and and we exposed, participants, to these tiers. And and we found a few things.[2:23:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: First of all, the tears are completely odorless. You cannot detect them at all. Completely odorless. And yet when you sniff them, you have a pronounced, reduction in testosterone, within about 20 minutes, half an hour.[2:24:18] Andrew Huberman: This is men and women smelling women's Cheers. Just men smelling women's tears, but not perceiving any odor.[2:24:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: Nothing. Just sniffing them. And you have, about, 14% drop in free testosterone. Free.[2:24:33] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So this is testosterone that's already been liberated from the testes.[2:24:37] Dr. Noam Sobel: Free test[2:24:37] Andrew Huberman: So that we've done a few hormone that's either bound or unbound is unbound, excuse me, from sex hormone binding globulin, etcetera, And it's the active form. So it's it's, it's subject to very short time scale changes.[2:24:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. And and this is, You know, people who who studied testosterone, which is not me, but they tell me this is a really strong effect. Like, it's it's hard to even pharmacologically get An effect like that that fast. I mean, no in pharmacology.[2:25:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Years ago, I spent time studying endocrine effects of this sort, and that's a a tremendous Resized effect.[2:25:12] Dr. Noam Sobel: So and so here, I'll point out in passing, that, one one of the concerns we had because of the Effort to run this study is that nobody would ever try to replicate it. And to our joy, about 2 years later, an independent group from, South Korea, Ow It Out, who I don't know at all, replicated the testosterone effect To a t. I mean, like, same numbers. So so, it it lowers testosterone. And and and We then also looked, using MR at the at the, effect on brain activity and saw pronounced, if effect on activity, a dampening, a lowering of activity, under under, an arousing state, a lowering of activity, both in the hypothalamus, and in the fusiform gyrus for whatever reason.[2:26:12] Dr. Noam Sobel: I don't know[2:26:13] Andrew Huberman: recognition area.[2:26:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: Amongst other things. Yes. And we don't know why, but pronounced. And currently, Shania Groen in our lab Is replicating this again, and this time, with a stronger behavioral component. And I can share with you, unpublished, data now under review, that's as you would expect, given the effect on testosterone, perhaps, sniffing tears lowers aggression in men.[2:26:45] Dr. Noam Sobel: Using again the tap, the same experiment used by in in the, hexadecimal experiment.[2:26:51] Andrew Huberman: The the tap I'm gonna think of that as the the the Tyler The titration. The sadist titration is[2:26:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: one of the Tyler aggression paradigm.[2:26:59] Andrew Huberman: So it's like the Milgram experiments of the of the 19 fifties, which post, this is looking at sort of, post holocaust behavior. Right. You know what? People basically in American laboratories thinking they were torturing other people Yep. Simply because they were told to, and a lot of people Did that even though most people would report that they would never torture someone.[2:27:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. No. Humans are not a wonderful species.[2:27:22] Andrew Huberman: Well or as we could say, I think it was the the the great Carl Jung that said, We have all things inside of us, but, the the goal is not to experience them all, certainly. It's an incredible study, and it points again to the the the power of of, these chemosensory systems and pathways. And, obviously, There's so much here. I I don't[2:27:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: know if you want me to to tell about this or not, and I guess you can edit it out. Please don't. But, please. This is just, you know, sharing stories about the politics of science and and so so whereas the effect on testosterone was Was, replicated by by an independent group. In the original study in in science where we had we it had 3 components.[2:28:09] Dr. Noam Sobel: One Was the effect on testosterone, which was robust. The second, which was brain activity, which was robust. And there was a significant but weaker effect on behavior, and I don't think we studied the right behavior in retrospect. What we looked at then Was, readings of arousal associated with pictures. And there there was an effect.[2:28:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: It was significant, but it was it was not what carried the story. Now there's a lab in Holland, of a guy by the name of ving I'm probably mispronouncing this, but I think it's Vingerhoet.[2:28:53] Andrew Huberman: For the non Dutch Yeah. Dutch names are always a little bit of a challenge.[2:28:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: But And, you know, I shouldn't say that. Being an Israeli, I shouldn't Go too much on that line, but but, that lab really didn't like our original tier story. And the reason they didn't like it is because they've they've built a career, on this notion, including a book with this title that emotional tears are uniquely human. Now Here I should do well, I should share. So one of one of the things we really liked about the the the, tier result is that Partially before we did our work, but more afterwards, and and we like that because usually things so usually in our chemo signaling work like what I told you before The Bruce effect, we look at what happens in rodents and we see if the same thing is happening in humans.[2:29:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: This was a rare case where after we did this work, More or less identical effects were discovered in rodents. So, a paper published in Nature 2 years later found that mouse tears, mouse pup tears, lower aggression in in, male adult mice towards them.[2:30:07] Andrew Huberman: In a in a Smell dependent way.[2:30:09] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah. So and and and they also actually found the actual component in tears that so the tear pheromone that lowers aggression. Right? So so, you know, this has us thinking of it's tears as as as you can think of tears as like a a chemical blanket in a way that That you're covering yourself up again with you know, to protect against aggression.[2:30:29] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? And and so our finding, you know, Which to me, I mean, this is consistent with how I think about behavior in general. I, you know, I don't think, you know, beyond language, There are very few things, definitely sensory things that are uniquely human. You know, I I I I'd be hard pressed. But So so, you know, our finding went against, you know, against their their story.[2:30:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? Because, you know, here we're saying no. You know, tears are this chemo signaling mechanism like all animals. And by the way, I you know, just after this entire debate about, 6 months ago, there was a paper in current biology that dogs emit emotional tears. And and it was, the dogs emit emotional tears when they reunite with their owners.[2:31:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: And you were talking before about about, Oxytocin. So I think what they showed there is that not only that, but that the the the view Seeing the tears in the dog influences oxytocin in in the humans.[2:31:29] Andrew Huberman: I I[2:31:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: hope I'm getting this right. No.[2:31:31] Andrew Huberman: I absolutely believe this. I mean, I From the from the time I brought Costello home at 8 weeks old Costello's your dog. My dog. Unfortunately, he passed away. They had him in a long time.[2:31:40] Andrew Huberman: Actually, the only time I can recall Crying. Listen. I I've certainly cried before, many times in my life. Many, many times. The only time I ever recall crying to the point where I wasn't sure that I could keep producing 2 years, but somehow it is when I had to put him down.[2:31:58] Andrew Huberman: Uh-huh. Right? Is this, like you know, and if I talk about Too long now, I'll start trying to you know, it's one of those things. Yeah. It has.[2:32:03] Andrew Huberman: I think it's a healthy[2:32:04] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah.[2:32:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Sure. For sure. But I recall when he was a puppy Thinking this oxytocin thing must be real because I can recall being in faculty meetings, which, you know, are Fairly stated or not always that interesting, but they're they could be pretty interesting. And someone presenting data in my mind thinking, I hope Costello's okay.[2:32:24] Andrew Huberman: What's he doing down in my office? This is when he was very little. And also not needing to eat, not being able to focus on Anything else except my attachment to him for about the 1st 2 or 3 weeks that I had him, then it was easy. Then I could focus off on other things. And I think I think that dogs, Perhaps through oxytocin, hijack the circuitry that's intended for child rearing.[2:32:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I really do. Otherwise, why would people be so ridiculously attached to their dogs? I mean, hence all the the post of everyone thinks their dog is the cutest dog the same way everyone thinks their children are the cutest children. You know, Cussolini, by the way, was a very handsome bulldog.[2:32:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so so yeah. So so so again so there so even, you know, to put another nail in that story of of, of tears are uniquely human, so they're not. Dogs shed emotional tears. And and and so that group really didn't like this, and they went ahead And and tried to replicate. And to your listeners, I'm showing double quotations on the replicate, only the behavioral part, The ratings of arousal, in women of women, and and failed to replicate that.[2:33:35] Dr. Noam Sobel: I see. Now this was, you know, just sharing on how science works and doesn't work in my in my notion in this case. So[2:33:44] Andrew Huberman: At the time,[2:33:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: after they got this accepted in some journal, not a field journal. In the journal of memory of something. They contacted me for a a response, and I I, wrote to the office and I said, look. You know, This is very odd to me. Why don't you come you know, why don't we replicate this again together and see if it doesn't work?[2:34:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: If it doesn't work, I'll publish it with you that it doesn't work, but you know? And so I said, why don't you send over a graduate student or the lead author, and we'll do it here, and we'll show them how it's done? Because they they did it very wrongly in the paper. And so they replied that, no. They don't have money to send over a graduate student to do it.[2:34:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I replied saying, okay. I'll fund The graduate student coming over, and I'll fund the entire study in their stay and so on and so forth, and let's do this together. And they replied, no. They're not willing to to do that, which, you know, I don't think is the way things should work. And and they published this sort of veiled, Behavioral effect in in that paper.[2:34:55] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I'm just sharing this, you know, that it's not only there there was that successful replication with the the effect on testosterone, but there was Supposedly, the spell replication on the effect in in behavior. And then I published a a rebuttal on on that, which I don't know if I should have done, but I did.[2:35:11] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think it's, it's interesting. I mean, I I think, provided studies are done correctly. I mean, the the positive result, almost always trumps the A negative result, and yet I think replication is key. The problem as you pointed out is that replication is rarely pure replication of the exact study.[2:35:28] Dr. Noam Sobel: This one is not even remotely, but And I I published the detail. So, actually, they hid something in their data that did partially rip. So I I asked for their data and I reanalyzed it, and that's what I published in the rebuttal. But, you know, this is just sharing on on how science works. I I took advice.[2:35:43] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I'm it's not that that, I'm friends with him, but at time, I was communicating a bit because we're on some board with with, with, Daniel Kahneman, who's who's Nobel laureate.[2:35:54] Andrew Huberman: Fast and slow. Right.[2:35:55] Dr. Noam Sobel: And so so, I asked him, how how should I deal with this? You know, give me some advice here. I was really you know, it it it wasn't emotionally not fun to be in that position. And he said, don't don't don't never publish a rebuttal. Don't do anything.[2:36:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: I was you know, how can I? You know, I have to do something. He said, no. Don't. Because once you do that, then, you know, people don't go into the details.[2:36:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: They won't read the details of your rebuttal. They'll be like, well, there's a group that says this, and there's a group that says that. So it's unclear.[2:36:27] Andrew Huberman: Well and Yeah. I mean, I I appreciate that you're bringing it up today, and I I do appreciate that you published The rebuttal and that you offered in a very magnanimous way to to do a collaboration.[2:36:37] Dr. Noam Sobel: Then said. That's so so so common advice after that was that, well, if you insist, then just publish, write a response that you offered them to come do it together, they refused, and there's nothing you can do about that.[2:36:51] Andrew Huberman: It's a lot like, fight sports. Right? People talk a lot of trash. Although in science, you know, I will say this, you know, as long as we're on the the sociology of science, science[2:37:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: is very different[2:37:01] Andrew Huberman: science is very different than podcasting or social media or, other fields. Because in science, people generally are very kind to your face, and then they you get it in the you get it in the neck on grant reviews or Anonymous reviews. Yep. I was on a grants review panel this morning. I'm a nice reviewer.[2:37:18] Andrew Huberman: Meaning, I judge things objectively, but I I try to always, Think from the perspective of the graduate student or author of the of the proposal. Listen. I I think that, science is a is a game of of of people who Most of them are seeking facts. However, the the ego is strongly woven into it like any like anything else.[2:37:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I[2:37:39] Andrew Huberman: think it was, very magnanimous of you to offer the collaboration, so I'm gonna tell this lab whose name I can't pronounce. Please accept the collaboration, then we can invite everyone on here for a roundtable. I appreciate that you shared that story, and I know a number of other people will, for a number of reasons. I have a couple more questions, and I realize and Thank you, by the way, for your, for your willingness and stamina because it is probably 1 AM Israel time now, and you just arrived.[2:38:06] Dr. Noam Sobel: No. You are. I think[2:38:07] Andrew Huberman: but you're doing Terrifically well. So I I, if you'll indulge us just a a touch further, there are 2 topics that, I wanna touch on, and if you wanna cover these in shorter thrift, that's fine, although don't feel any obligation to. The first one is, I think most people are familiar with the scent of food For foods as a signal of the nutrient contents of those foods. You know, an orange that smells great or the smell of something baking. You know?[2:38:34] Andrew Huberman: It didn't it it suggests something about the the contents and quality of that food. After all, you and I both separately lived in the same apartment in Berkeley above the cheese board, which The smell of cheese wafting up through the cheese board is something I will never forget, and the breads. Never forget it. Amazing, Brett[2:38:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean, I I don't know if you've conveyed that clearly enough to listeners or watchers.[2:38:56] Andrew Huberman: Now the probability is just[2:38:58] Dr. Noam Sobel: covered that we lived in the same we've never met, I mean, a fit like this before. Yep. And we lived in the same apartment. Are we[2:39:06] Andrew Huberman: click friends?[2:39:09] Dr. Noam Sobel: In a in a lingering way, I[2:39:11] Andrew Huberman: guess. Absolutely. Through the through the the Through the, Floorboards.[2:39:15] Dr. Noam Sobel: It had a great floor, that place. It had a great wooden floor.[2:39:17] Andrew Huberman: It was an amazing place. I lived there with my girlfriend for a year and a half, and then, It was an amazing place. We won't give it out the address Yeah. For out of respect for the people that live there now. But do check out the cheese board if you're ever in Berkeley.[2:39:30] Andrew Huberman: Their hours are weird, but, so you have to look online, but that they're it's a unique place Yeah. With great bread and cheese and, Some good flavors of pizza. In any case, I'm wondering whether or not smell Can signal things about the nutrient contents of foods in a way that's divorced from the smell that we are perceiving. So for instance, I could imagine based on what you've told us about smell today that, you know, I I don't know. I I I I smell a a piece of meat cooking, and it smells great to me.[2:40:08] Andrew Huberman: And I think of it as, oh, that's so savory, and my mouth is watering, and I I love the smell of this. And I'm thinking, okay. This is protein and fat, and I love the taste of steak and a little bit of char, but that nature has co opted that to Ensure or I should say increase the likelihood that I will ingest some other thing that's in stake for that has No odor, but whose nutrient content is very important to me. For instance, amino acids.[2:40:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right.[2:40:36] Andrew Huberman: Right? I mean, amino acids are essential to life, And yet, we don't go around sniffing for amino acids. We go around sniffing for savoriness, umami type, tastes and and things of that sort. So, I could imagine a 1000000 different examples of this. In the same way, I could imagine that the Scent of somebody that we fall in love with or become romantically attached to or, you know, sexually attracted to is signaling all sorts of things about, Sure.[2:41:03] Andrew Huberman: The potential for offspring of a particular immune status, that's a long term game, but also, something about, Pleasure and safety of a potential interaction. So what I'm asking here is about that whether or not there are subconscious signals that the, olfactory system has, learn to seek, but learn to seek through, more overt signals, sort of the the tip of the iceberg for going on.[2:41:29] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, you know, I don't have a good answer for you, although I think it's a really good question, or or or a good idea, in fact. So So whether whether the there's, you know, over cues on nutrient value is a really good idea. Moreover, it's probably good to the extent that somebody probably did it, and I should know and don't. We haven't done anything on that line, so I don't know. I don't know if if the nutrient value of food is systematically encoded in odor.[2:42:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: If that's not been done, and I will check after our, meeting today, then it should be. That's a really good idea.[2:42:17] Andrew Huberman: I mean, one of the reasons I asked this is because, you know, the obesity crisis in the US is a huge issue and elsewhere, And highly processed foods, you know, have a lot of things that are problematic, but one of the things that they don't have, often is a direct relationship between the scent, the taste, and the new and the nutrient Content. And I don't mean macronutrients, sugar, fat, excuse me, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, but the the vitamins and micronutrients, things that support the microbiome. Whereas Foods that are not highly processed, for instance, meat or a piece of fruit, contain many micronutrients that are vital to aspects of our biology. We don't go around sniffing[2:43:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: for probiotics. I'll tell you one sort of factoid that may support your hypothesis here, And that is that there appears to be potential olfactory perceptual similarity In metabolic products. So something that's metabolized from something else has perceptual Similarity across those those 2 things. So so so metabolic cascades Playing to the coding of olfactory space, and and that is consistent with the direction you're you're you're implying. But, again, I don't I don't know of a direct test of of, of nutritional value and smell.[2:43:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and, Again, the fact that I don't know doesn't mean, of course, that it doesn't exist. And in this case, I would suspect that it should exist, in scientific press, and and if not there, then with The companies that have vested interest in this, which are many, briefly share just Just an an an amusing anecdote to share with you is that we've received 2 independent, Peep you know, of companies who have turned to our lab recently, asking for help, to to bring odor to engineered meat. Right? That's a growing thing. And all these, you know, meats that are[2:44:30] Andrew Huberman: You had to bring it up. This this audience is going to be very polarized along the along the lines of engineered meat. I I I'm I'm You're not you're not you're not promoting it.[2:44:40] Dr. Noam Sobel: Oh, no. No. No. No. No.[2:44:41] Dr. Noam Sobel: I am I'm agnostic, but but, But we've had 2 companies turn to us and say, look. You know, we have this great product, but it just doesn't smell like meat. So help us make it smell like meat. Interesting.[2:44:53] Andrew Huberman: The reason it's so polarizing is that anything related to nutrition on social media is a total barbed wire topic. We've had experts on nutrition come on here. We'll More of a I I know nothing Don't worry, Trisha. You're you're safe. No.[2:45:05] Andrew Huberman: Don't worry. No. He's not and he's not promoting, this he hasn't even said whether or not gonna help them out. No.[2:45:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: We we're not actually not not because yeah. It just never it didn't happen, though. Yeah.[2:45:15] Andrew Huberman: No. The the the whether or not those, engineered meats Our, yum, yuck, or meh is is a personal issue to people in terms of taste. Whether or not they are better for neutral or worse for you And the planet then given the ingredients that are required, that's a a whole world will avoid now.[2:45:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: I I won't. But to, you know, I'll take the the opportunity to to To highlight something related maybe because on on what were you saying on the on the scale, you know, there's this know, I'll take the opportunity to dispel another misconception about olfaction. Right? There's this common notion That our sense of smell, is incredibly subjective. Right?[2:46:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: And that what you might like in a smell, I will not liking the smell and that we all have our own, you know, totally subjective world of all faction.[2:46:08] Andrew Huberman: I think I know the study you're gonna There are many. The cross cultural similarity.[2:46:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: There are many. That that is utterly untrue. Many, not only from my lab. There are many from many labs.[2:46:17] Andrew Huberman: Please clarify for those that follow this literature.[2:46:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: So, yeah. So so humans are incredibly similar to one another in their olfactory perception, and this is in contrast to what most people think. So why why is there this misconception? The misconception is there for two reasons. First of all or for several reasons, but 2 are stand out.[2:46:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: First of all, we're we're attracted by outliers because you know what? I'll tell somebody look you know, for example, a factory pleasantness is highly correlated amongst humans. And let's first put this in numbers. You'll take a a bunch of humans and a bunch of odorants and have them rate pleasantness. The correlation across, the humans will be about 0.8.[2:47:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: That's incredibly high. Incredibly high.[2:47:07] Andrew Huberman: What do you think is pleasant? I think is pleasant.[2:47:10] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Now why why is that Go against what culturally people think for two reasons. First of all, we're we're Attracted or or biased by outliers. But that's particularly that shows, in fact, the result. What do I mean?[2:47:25] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you'll tell somebody, look. People are very similar in their pleasantness estimates. And so, you know, that can't be. I love cilantro, and, you know, my girlfriend hates the smell of cilantro. Right?[2:47:35] Dr. Noam Sobel: Or and there are few Classic examples there, Guava. Right? You know, is another, polarizing odor. So there are a few polarizing odors. Right?[2:47:43] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and that's true. Right? So that's true that, you know, half of the population loves the smell of cilantro and half hates it. Half loves guava, half hates it. That's true.[2:47:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: Pop popcorn. However, I assure you that, you know, you can come to our lab. We have about a 1000 odorants in our lab. Okay? We won't smell the 1,000.[2:48:03] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? But I assure you, you know, take a 100 odorants, okay, from our mixtures and labs. Right? And we'll we'll smell them. Right?[2:48:12] Dr. Noam Sobel: And out of the 100, 90 We'll totally agree on. Right? And including I mean, you know, nobody will say they like the smell of feces or fecal smells, And everybody all say they like the smell of rose and flowery smells. There will be rare rare exceptions. Again, the correlation is about 0.8 across individuals.[2:48:34] Dr. Noam Sobel: So a 90 of a 100 will be in high agreement, then 5 will be in sort of intermediate agreement. And, yes, they'll be the 5 that we're in Total disagreement on. But I asked you, you know, if we agree on 95 and disagree on 5, are we the same or are we different? We're the same. They're just outliers to this to this rule.[2:48:53] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and and so one reason is this issue of of outliers attract how we think about things, but, no, we're actually much more similar than than what we think. And the second thing that that drives this cultural effect is the is our poor application of language to olfaction. Right? So so in other sensory systems, we grow up with we we we're we're we develop with anchors. Right?[2:49:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you're a little kid, you know, your mother shows you a cow and says, what does a cow do? Moo. Right? And we all know moo moo. And what color is this?[2:49:26] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's, Well, this is kind of an odd black, but it's black. Right? Or or what color is that? It's red. Right?[2:49:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: So you have these anchors. But as you all know, you know, the red that I'm seeing is not of the red that you're seeing, we just both know to call that red. And since you say red and I say red, I think why? We're seeing the same thing. But, no, we're not seeing the same thing.[2:49:44] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? And in in odor, we don't have those anchors. Right? We we don't from childhood. You know, our mom doesn't tell us, so what's this smell and what's that smell?[2:49:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? And so we don't have these language anchors that make us think that we're perceiving the same thing. Now how can you quantify that? The most important term in in measuring sensory systems is similarity. Right?[2:50:05] Dr. Noam Sobel: That's the measure. Right? So what can you do? Let's say we take Ten odorants. And I have you rate all the pairwise similarities.[2:50:13] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? So you'd end up with 45 numbers. Right? So, you know, How similar is 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4, and then 2 and all the possible pairwise similarities. Let's say you rate similarity from 1, which is totally dissimilar a hundred exactly the same.[2:50:27] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? So now I have a similarity matrix that describes Andrew's perception of smell. Right? I have you know, based on these 10 utterance that I selected. Now I can run my similarity matrix, and then I can see if the similarity matrix are correlated.[2:50:43] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? And then we've gotten rid of the issue of names and orders. Right? It doesn't matter if I'll call this lemon and this orange and you call this sweet potato and this Marshmallow. Right?[2:50:52] Dr. Noam Sobel: It doesn't matter. If I think that these 2 are highly similar and you agree, and I think that these 2 are very different and you agree, Right? We perceive the world in the same way if our similarity matrices are aligned. Right? And what's nice about that is that then you can do that for vision audition in all faction In a common group.[2:51:11] Dr. Noam Sobel: And you can see where we're more like each other or not. And we've done that for color vision, Olfaction, internal audition. Okay? And we are most dissimilar in color vision. Okay?[2:51:26] Dr. Noam Sobel: We're in color vision, the variance is about a 100%.[2:51:31] Andrew Huberman: Amazing.[2:51:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: It's quite different. And there's tons of literature on this. Tons of it. Tons of it. Right?[2:51:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: And in all faction and audition, they're about the same. So we're not different. We're very similar. We're just very poor at appreciating this. And and mind you, not that there's not variability.[2:51:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: There is variability. And, of course, the system is malleable as all sensory systems are, you can learn to like an odor, and and that will change you and learn to just like an odor. Right? But just the way you can learn to like a sound or dislike a sound. So, you know, this doesn't take away from the hardwired link of a structure to its perception that you can that they're malleable.[2:52:07] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and And we're we're not very variable. We're we're actually kind of similar.[2:52:14] Andrew Huberman: That's a perfect segue to the question I have next, which is if, In general, people perceive certain odors similarly. You could imagine that odors could be Manufactured, co opted, etcetera in order to elicit richer sensory experiences and drive choice making. Yeah. That's obvious at the level of the smell of a hot dog stand or freshly baked bread, etcetera. But what I'm talking about here, and I'd like to ask you about is Doing this at scale and, scientists, geeks like to say in silico in, through computers.[2:52:52] Andrew Huberman: So for a long time now, there's been this idea that, there will soon be Google smell, not to call out Google as the only search engine, but duck, duck, go smell for those of you that don't wanna hear Smell Chat GPT. Your your chat GPT, and on and on. In other words, you know, vision visual is sent through, computer interfaces as is auditory information, not so much haptic somatosensory, although it can. You know, we lab uses VR. It's it it can be done.[2:53:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right.[2:53:22] Andrew Huberman: But it hasn't really taken hold. However, smell being such a rich source of Behavioral and hormonal and other sorts of deep, deep information that can drive people into yum, yuck, or meh Type decision making Yeah. Seems like an amazing candidate. So what is your experience with, generating smells in silico in computers. And here, folks, for those of you that aren't catching on to this and and I don't expect that everyone would because what we're really alluding to here, is the idea that you'll look at you'll put into a search engine, blueberry pancakes recipe, And that not only will you get photos of those blueberry pancakes and a recipe, but you will get the, hopefully, validated odor of Those pancakes and that recipe coming at you in real time through the computer.[2:54:18] Dr. Noam Sobel: So I'll start off answering from, From the, the name you threw out there, Google. So about, probably about 5 years ago, Google had an April fools spoof. Oh, right. And they put out this video of Google smell. Okay.[2:54:38] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and it had all these, like, classic, like, sales images of, you know, holding up your phone to a rose and it Generating rows and and and all these things. Right?[2:54:49] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[2:54:50] Dr. Noam Sobel: So Google is now trying to do that. And they just They just, published I mean, I I know they've been trying to do it for a while. They visited our lab, but they just sort of Went public with this that really just like about a a month ago or something that that, they have this offshoot startup. I think it's called Osmo or something like that that started off with a ridiculous sum of money for a startup. Like, I don't know,[2:55:22] Andrew Huberman: Tons of money. A lot. There's a lot of money in that world.[2:55:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Yeah. In Google. Yeah. To to, you know, to digitize, smell.[2:55:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and and there are other companies that are trying to do this as well. And we've been talking now for quite a while about our Our lab's chemo signaling work, but actually half of our lab is devoted to this question of of, ultimately digitizing smell. And and so so this is a very, very active field of research, and and and I'll say, One thing that that dovetails with what you were talking about before, in many ways, COVID is going to be one of the best things that ever happened to olfaction research. Because suddenly, all the world, is are all the world. Lots of people are are, very cognizant of the importance of smell.[2:56:21] Dr. Noam Sobel: And the smell is, like, way up there in people's awareness because of COVID. And this is driving a renaissance of of olfaction research. And and awareness to olfaction is something that's Worth paying attention to. And and our lab has been involved in this way, in this effort for a long time where where The initial part of this effort is in fact to develop a set of rules that link odor structure to odor perception. That is The the going thing was that that until recently, at least, there was no scientist or perfumer for that matter who could look at the structure of a novel molecular mixture And predict for you how it will smell or smell something and tell you what it molecular structure could or should be.[2:57:08] Dr. Noam Sobel: You know? So in in contrast, let's say, the trivial, like, color vision, let's say. So, you know, if if if you know what the wavelength of the light is, you more or less know what Perceived color is gonna be. Of course, there are exceptions to that and and and all sorts of issues. But as a rule, you you would know or, you know, or the other way around, you can generate a wavelength, and you would know what what color light, it's going to be perceived.[2:57:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: So so that's an example of where The rules linking structure, in this case measured by wavelength and perception, in this case, experienced this color, the rules are well known. In olfaction, we didn't have that, until recently. But over the past few years, a bunch of labs have really, pushed this forward. There's a bunch of work, out of Leslie Voshall's lab at Rockefeller and Andreas Keller working with Leslie, who who've done a lot of work on this front, also work from Joel Mainland's lab, at Monell, and FAIR Discovery. Joel was a a graduate student in our lab.[2:58:12] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and recently, in our lab, we've had and and I hope this doesn't come across as overly arrogant, but we we've had a sort of mini breakthrough on this front. To call something a[2:58:22] Andrew Huberman: mini breakthrough is far from arrogant.[2:58:24] Dr. Noam Sobel: And and and this is a paper, led by Arun Raviya, from our lab, and Kobe Snitz also a major contributor there, a paper published in Nature, about a year and a half ago In the height of a COVID pandemic, so nobody really or I won't say nobody, but it it wasn't noticed in the way it otherwise would have been. It was It was published in Nature really on, like, a week where the whole world was, like, going berserk over COVID. And in this paper, we develop an algorithmic framework, where we can Predict the perceptual similarity of any 2 molecular mixtures with very, very high accuracy. So if you give me 2 molecular mixtures, I can predict how similar you you will smell them to be. Okay?[2:59:16] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now Not only could we predict that, but we could design it. So we can generate, mixtures with known similarities. And the the the result was highlighted, and and and you'll appreciate this coming from vision, is that using our algorithmic Solution, we generated olfactory metameris. So we measured mixtures completely non overlapping in their molecular structure, But they smell exactly the same. Okay?[2:59:47] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now if you would come to a classic perfumer or most classic perfumers and tell them That you can generate 2 mixtures with 0 molecules in common, but smell exactly the same, they would tell you no. And yet We did and and anybody can recreate them. This is simple, actually. And and in the paper, we do a few things like we generate a For, Chanel number 5. So you don't like perfume.[3:00:14] Dr. Noam Sobel: So this one but but we we we take so we generate a Chanel number 5 with no component from Chanel number 5 in it. Okay. And we actually have a a a publicly available website. I'll give it to you for your links. If you want that anybody can do this, we built an An engine that you can generate these these meta merits.[3:00:31] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now once we did that, In a way, we've generated the the the infrastructure for digitizing smell. Because What again, what we what our what our algorithm predicts, our our framework predicts is similarity. But in a way, that's enough for you. Why is that enough? We have a map Of, 4,000, molecules, for each one, we know there are perceived smell.[3:01:00] Dr. Noam Sobel: Now you can make up any mixture you want from me. I can project it into that map and measure its pairwise distance from all the points in the map. If it falls on lemon, then what you generated smells like lemon. And if it falls, you know, on tomato, then what you generated smells like tomato. So we we now solve that problem.[3:01:20] Dr. Noam Sobel: We can predict the odor of any molecular mixture. We can see how it's going to smell. What we can do is then find a set of components, which we call odor primaries, that can be used to mix any odor that you can perceive. And that's what we're working on now. In about a month ago, so this is in collaboration with a lab of a Jonathan Williams and Max Plank in Munich.[3:01:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: Jonathan Williams is an, atmospheric chemist, but he's really good at At using GCMS, these tools that measure molecules. So, Jonathan Williams measured odorants in Germany, transmitted the information to us over IP. We fed that into our algorithmic framework and Recreated it from a device that mixes primaries. And we tried to do 4 different odorants, in our our proof of concept test. One of them, was Rose, and we failed at recreating Rose.[3:02:25] Dr. Noam Sobel: We, in fact, recreated something that had a precip, most people perceived it as bubblegum. The second one we tried to do was, and we failed at recreating. And most people said it was cherry, which is not very far, but it failed. The third was gasoline, and we were slightly but significantly better than chance at recreating gasoline. And the 4th with was violence.[3:02:54] Dr. Noam Sobel: And 15 of 16 people sent violets. So the 1st odor ever transmitted over IP is violets, and we did that last month. Of course, this is not anything near a practical solution. The device, that Jonathan was using to measure, is a $1,500,000 device bigger than this table?[3:03:18] Andrew Huberman: That's right. I remember when VCRs, half the audience won't even know what that is. VCRs were like this big, so we're we're all good. Oh, yeah. I'm all good with the, With the prediction that things will come down in size and cost.[3:03:30] Dr. Noam Sobel: Hey. I was just saying here, you know, we're don't hold your breath, for this to be on your table tomorrow. And and, you know, again, even even you know, all we have in hand is this very initial proof of concept. You know, it doesn't it's not even yet close to being a paper we are submitting because there's still lots of work to be done. But we're on we're on the path.[3:03:51] Dr. Noam Sobel: We're on the path, and, you know, Google will probably beat us to it. They got a A lot No.[3:03:57] Andrew Huberman: You seem pretty dogged in there. Yeah.[3:03:59] Dr. Noam Sobel: But they have so much more resources that, that, at this stage, And and they're they've already published, 2 papers from that effort that are good. Yeah. You know, if[3:04:12] Andrew Huberman: They definitely have a lot of dollars and Lot of people a a lot of good, neuroscience and other biology engineering graduate students and postdocs go there, but but, the real question is, are they getting the best people? Run Run and out gun large groups. And and here, I don't have anything against Google,[3:04:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: by the way. Yeah.[3:04:37] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I use it all the time.[3:04:39] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean I'm not a betting man, but I would put my my money on Google on this race, but I'll give I'll try and give them a a a run for their money.[3:04:48] Andrew Huberman: There you go.[3:04:48] Dr. Noam Sobel: That was[3:04:48] Andrew Huberman: well, seems like most of us wanna see the problem solved regardless of who, gets there first. What I'll say is you better get going, Google, because Noam's being he's humble and he's Dog, it's so know. Better better get cracking. There, we just cost the weekends of and, and broke up the relationships of a bunch I remember when I was a graduate student at Berkeley. I remember hearing there was a guy in in our common friend, Irv, Irving Zucker's lab that worked a hours a week, so I was like, oh, I'll work a 100 and 2 hours a week, which was not a good choice.[3:05:15] Andrew Huberman: But in any case, it's it's, it's Abundantly clear that you're making progress here. And and I and I go to some of the earlier discussions we had, and I think we're not just talking about transferring recipes and smells, of of food, gasoline from people watching the the f one race or something, but, thinking dating apps, I'm thinking, you nowadays, everyone knows that when you travel and you wanna see your family, your grandkids or kids, you better to get on FaceTime and see them or Zoom, than to just hear their voice. We're also talking about being able to smell them. I'll tell you more[3:05:50] Dr. Noam Sobel: than that. I'll tell you more than that. I mean, we're talking now of trying to achieve, the olfactory equivalent of circa 1956 black and white TV, okay, basically. Right? And, you know, I'm not dreaming, let's say, of being able to transmit to you the difference between a Cabernet or a Merlot.[3:06:09] Dr. Noam Sobel: Right? But if I can generate something that's vaguely wine, That will be an amazing success from my perspective. Right? But jump ahead in your imagination to to 4 k order transmission, Then medical diagnostics is what you wanna be talking about. Because in in this is this is, Over, extension, but you can almost say that every disease will have an odor.[3:06:36] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean, every disease is a specific metabolic process. Metabolic process have metabolites. Metabolites have a smell. Olfaction, once it's digitized and And high resolution, which, again, in our hands, it's not gonna be. I mean, we're talking, you know, in my retirement, maybe I'll read about this one day if I'll still have vision.[3:06:57] Dr. Noam Sobel: I mean, this is not Close. But when when olfaction digitization is brought to the equivalent of 4 k, vision and audition that you have now, then it will be in medical diagnosis. You you'll have excuse me for the, The imagery but you will have an electronic nose in your bathroom. Each one of us will have in the toilet, and it will be doing diagnostics all the time. And and, that's that's where it's gonna go.[3:07:27] Dr. Noam Sobel: But, again, not anywhere in the very close future.[3:07:33] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's it's certainly an exciting proposition, and I'm delighted that you and other groups, who are so strong are working on it. I have really am. No. My I wanna say thank you for your time today. First of all, this was a tremendously interesting conversation, And we touched on so many things, hormones, smells, the architecture of the olfactory system.[3:07:57] Andrew Huberman: I know that people listening to this are realizing, but I'm gonna say it anyway, what an incredible gift you've given us in, as a you. As a expert in this field, giving us this tour of Of the work that you and others, who you credit so generously, have done to elucidate this incredible system that we call olfaction chemosensation. Also, just for the incredibly pioneering work that you've done. You know, I I don't have many heroes in science. I have heroes outside of science and a few in science, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna, purposely embarrass myself a little bit by saying that, from the time I was at Berkeley, and I Then and saw that experiment being done of people foraging, falling scent trails.[3:08:41] Andrew Huberman: And then when I was a until I was a junior professor, I used That in my teaching slides, in a class that I taught, that was sort of the early origins of this podcast in many way. And over and over again, When your laboratory publishes papers, I find, like, this is super interesting, super cool, and I find myself telling everybody about it. And that's really what I do for, for a living as I I learn, and then I blab about it to to the world. So thank you so much for the work that you've done and the spirit that you bring to it. Whatever drives that spirit, as The great late Ben Barris used to say, keep going because we are all benefiting tremendously.[3:09:16] Andrew Huberman: And, and I also just wanna say that, You know, for people listening to this, the the spirit of science is one of as you mentioned, there's complex politics and all these things, but It's absolutely clear that you delight in the work you do, and, so I delight in it. I'm grateful for it. I'm grateful for your time today. And so on behalf of me and and Many, many people listening to this. I just wanna extend a huge debt of gratitude.[3:09:41] Andrew Huberman: Thank you so much.[3:09:42] Dr. Noam Sobel: Oh, so I'm I'm the, I'm blushing. I don't know if this doesn't come across on the on the radio podcast, but thank you so much for, very warm words. I mean, you know, We as you know, when you work in your lab, you don't there's these moments where you suddenly discover that somebody He's like cares a bit about it, and those are always very rewarding moments because usually you you function without that. I mean, I guess that's one of the things you need To be a scientist is to have the, you know, the drive to work without that because it comes only rarely.[3:10:21] Andrew Huberman: There's immense gratitude and appreciation for you and what you do from me, and now I know from a large segment of the world as well. So, my only request is that you come back and tell us about, the next results sometime not too long from now.[3:10:35] Dr. Noam Sobel: Yeah. Well, I'm I'm gonna catch you live now, although you have the Power to edit this. I guess that's not fair. But first, you come visit us in Israel and and tell us both about the science and the public science work doing, and then I'll come again.[3:10:50] Andrew Huberman: A good bargain, and again, I accept. Delighted. Thank you so much. Yep. Pleasure.[3:10:55] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me for today's discussion about olfaction and chemosensation with doctor Noam Sobal.
