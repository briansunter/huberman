I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing doctor Craig Heller as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Doctor Heller is a professor of biology and neurosciences at Stanford. His laboratory works on a range of topics, including thermal regulation, Down syndrome, and circadian rhythms.[0:00:32] Andrew Huberman: Today, we talk about thermal regulation, How the body heats and cools itself and maintains what we call homeostasis, which is an equilibrium of processes that Keeps our neurons healthy, our organs functioning well, and as doctor Heller teaches us, thermal regulation can be leveraged in order to greatly increase our performance in athletics and mental performance as well. Learning to control your core body temperature is one of the most, If not the most powerful thing that you can do to optimize mental and physical performance regardless of the environment that you're in. He also dispels many common myths about heating and cooling the body, including the idea that putting a cold pack on your head or neck is the optimal way to cool down quickly. And in fact, As doctor Heller tells us, it actually can be counterproductive and lead to hyperthermia. It's a fascinating conversation from which I learned a tremendous amount of new And we didn't even get into the other incredibly interesting work that doctor Heller does on Down syndrome and circadian rhythms and sleep.[0:01:34] Andrew Huberman: So we hope to have him back in the future to discuss those topics. As you'll soon see, doctor Heller is a wealth of knowledge on all things human Physiology, biology, and human performance. It's no surprise then that he's been chair of the biology department at Stanford for many years as well as director of the human biology program. So if you're interested in human biology and how to improve your performance in any Context or setting, athletic or otherwise, I think you'll very much enjoy today's conversation. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research at Stanford.[0:02:09] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the Absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that the visual system has to go through a lot of work in order to maintain clarity of what you see When there are shadows, when you go into different types of indoor lighting, and so on.[0:02:39] Andrew Huberman: And a lot of glasses don't work well because you put them on, and then you're in bright light and you can see But then you move into a shadow, and then you have to take them off and they don't adjust or they don't adjust quickly enough. With ROKA, their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed With the visual system biology in mind, so you always see things with perfect clarity. The glasses are also terrific because they're very lightweight, And they won't slip off your face if you're exercising, if you're running or biking. In fact, they were designed for the purpose of being able to be worn while you're engaging in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk. I happen to wear readers at night, when I drive or when I work, and I love their sunglasses because I can wear them anywhere.[0:03:17] Andrew Huberman: And also the aesthetics Other sunglasses and eyeglasses are terrific. Unlike a lot of other performance glasses that frankly make people look like cyborgs, the aesthetics on Rokas are really terrific. You could wear them anywhere you'd to go. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to roka.com.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can also analyze your DNA to see what you ought to be doing for your immediate and long term health. We hear a lot these days about optimization, optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism, optimizing this, optimizing But unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors, hormones, and other things that are in your blood and DNA, you don't know what to optimize.[0:04:19] Andrew Huberman: With InsideTracker, it makes all of that very easy. They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test, or you can go to a nearby clinic. They send you The information and you take those results. And unlike a lot of laboratories doing blood work out there and DNA tests, they have a simple platform, a dashboard that walks you through your results and helps you identify what sorts of nutritional or behavioral or other types of practices you might want incorporate into your life in order to positively impact your immediate and long term health. It's a very easy system to use, and you will gain a ton of information simply by doing that test, whether or not you end up making changes to what you're doing or not.[0:04:56] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/ Huberman, to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans, just use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started using Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is because it covers all of my nutritional bases.[0:05:26] Andrew Huberman: In fact, if people ask me and I often am asked, what supplement should I take? I always recommend Athletic Greens. And in fact, if you were to take just 1 supplement, I recommend basis. And the probiotics optimize gut brain health, which we now know is essential for mood, for immune system function, for metabolic function. It's got so many great things in there.[0:05:54] Andrew Huberman: I really do feel better when I'm drinking my Athletic Greens. I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice, and as I mentioned before, I'll drink it once or twice a day. If I travel, I might even drink it a 3rd time just because of the additional stress on my mind and body. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs.[0:06:17] Andrew Huberman: So these are Travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens if you're on the plane or in the car, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two. There is now ample evidence that vitamin d three k two is supportive of the immune system and a bunch of other biological functions, and k two has been shown to be important for cardiovascular health. So again, if you go to athletic greens.com/huberman, you'll get the athletic greens, the 5 free travel packs, and the year's supply of vitamin d three k two. And now for my discussion with doctor Craig Heller. Great to have you here.[0:06:49] Andrew Huberman: It's[0:06:49] Dr. Craig Heller: good to be here. Yeah.[0:06:50] Andrew Huberman: It's it's been a long time coming. I know that I and many people have a lot of questions about the use of cold. So one of the things that's happened In recent years is that for many reasons, people have become interested in things like taking cold showers and Taking ice baths for many different purposes. Mhmm. Sometimes this is introduced as just a general health tonic.[0:07:17] Andrew Huberman: You know? But other times, people get specific about how it can improve resilience or it can improve one's metabolism. Could you just tell me a little bit about what happens when I get into a cold shower or an ice bath? What what are some of the basic responses at the level of metabolism? Obviously, psychologically, we don't know exactly.[0:07:41] Andrew Huberman: It'll vary from person to person. But What happens when I submerge myself into an ice bath if I've never done it before?[0:07:49] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, first of all, you get a tremendous shock. And what that's going to translate into is a bit of a shot of adrenaline. And I think this is really the, so called benefit, but I wouldn't call it a benefit of the cryo chambers. You go into a cryo chamber, and it's a shock. You get a shot of adrenaline.[0:08:08] Dr. Craig Heller: So sure, you're gonna feel different when you come out. You've had a shot of adrenaline, but it doesn't necessarily translate into any Benefit in terms of your physiology, your performance, and so forth. Now if you take a cold bath or a cold shower, a couple things are happening. 1 is you're going to stimulate vasoconstriction. So if anything, it's going to make it a little bit more difficult For your body to get rid of heat because you're shutting off your avenues of heat loss.[0:08:40] Dr. Craig Heller: If you're in a true Cold bath. The overall surface area of your body is so great that it doesn't matter if you vasoconstrict it. You're still going to lose heat.[0:08:51] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So, so vasoconstriction, the constriction of is it capillaries, vessels, and arteries all constrict or Just 1 or 2? Well, this is an area of controversy.[0:09:05] Dr. Craig Heller: In general, when people talk of vasoconstriction, they talk of the overall skin surface, and that is not true. The primary sites of heat loss, which we're going to get into, are the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, and the upper part of your face. And the reason these are avenues for heat loss is their underlain by special blood vessels. And these blood vessels are able to shunt the blood from the arteries, which are coming from the heart, Directly to the veins, which are returning to the heart and bypassing the capillaries, which are the nutritive vessels but high resistance. So you can tell when you shake someone's hand what his or her thermal status is.[0:09:49] Dr. Craig Heller: The hand's hot or it's cold? You think that's part[0:09:52] Andrew Huberman: of the reason why humans evolved this practice of, shaking hands? Assessing each other's level of anxiety. We all know that a limp handshake is pretty, Indicative of something, and a firm handshake is indicatives of something as is the crushing handshake for that matter. Right. Yeah.[0:10:07] Dr. Craig Heller: I really don't know what the evolutionary origin of handshaking is than to get your hand away from your weapon, perhaps.[0:10:14] Andrew Huberman: Right. A couple of questions before we get into these specialized, vascular compartments on the soles, the palms, and the upper face. You mentioned whole body immersion like Into an ice bath or very cold water up to the neck versus a cold shower. Is is there something fundamentally different about those 2 besides the fact that they both provide this Release of adrenaline. Is there anything that's that's really important to understand about the difference in the physiological response evoked by the by cold shower versus immersion in cold?[0:10:48] Andrew Huberman: Well, there are differences that[0:10:50] Dr. Craig Heller: are more physical than anything else. So if you are in a cold bath and you're still, You develop a boundary layer. If you're in a shower, you can't develop a boundary layer.[0:11:00] Andrew Huberman: Could you explain what a boundary layer is?[0:11:01] Dr. Craig Heller: Yes. If you it's best to explain it in terms of a hot bath because everybody's experienced that. You get into a hot bath, and, oh my god. It's really hot, almost painful. And then you sit down, and eventually, it doesn't feel so hot anymore because the still water, which is Close to your skin is coming into equilibrium with your skin, so it's like having a blanket on you or an insulator on you.[0:11:28] Dr. Craig Heller: And then if you move around, you disturb that still water layer. You feel the hot temperature again.[0:11:35] Andrew Huberman: I see. So if I were to get into a cold ice bath or very cold[0:11:39] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:11:40] Andrew Huberman: Body of water of some kind and stay still, I'd likely feel warmer, at least until I serve.[0:11:45] Dr. Craig Heller: You're not gonna be losing as much heat.[0:11:47] Andrew Huberman: I see. Right? And then when I move, it's flail around.[0:11:49] Dr. Craig Heller: If you flail around, Then you're going to lose more heat. Got it. Yeah. But I think getting back to your original question about benefits, you have to keep in mind whether you're talking about aerobic Activity or anaerobic activity if you're referring to performance and exercise and so forth. So if you're doing Aerobic activity that you can sustain for a long time, your production of heat is rising gradually and is being distributed throughout your body.[0:12:19] Dr. Craig Heller: So eventually, your body temperature is going to come up to a level that's going to impair your performance. So the benefit of a cold bath or a cold shower before aerobic activity is that you increase the capacity of your body mass to absorb that excess heat.[0:12:35] Andrew Huberman: I see. So could you say that, in a in a rough sense that a protocol that one might use if they're gonna head out for a A long run. Yeah. Even on a reasonably warm day, not super hot.[0:12:48] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:12:48] Andrew Huberman: Or maybe it is super hot, would be to take a cool shower before they go run. Would that be beneficial?[0:12:53] Dr. Craig Heller: Sure. It'll take them longer to get to the sweat point and to heat up.[0:12:57] Andrew Huberman: And what will that translate to in terms of a performance benefit?[0:13:00] Dr. Craig Heller: Increase your, Well, could increase your speed, or it depends on how you use that benefit. Some people are pacers. They will go at same pace, and then they will go farther, or some people are, I wanna say pacers and regulators. And no. No.[0:13:18] Dr. Craig Heller: Pacers or forcers, they will take that advantage and use it up as fast as they can. So they will go faster, But not necessarily farther.[0:13:27] Andrew Huberman: I see. As far as I know, not many athletes, at least not the ones that I know, are getting into cool bodies of water, taking cold showers before They head out to train, but it sounds like there could be a real performance benefit there.[0:13:39] Dr. Craig Heller: It could be a benefit. I know our we're going to talk about our technology for cooling. But, at one point, our I don't know if they're using it now, but our cross country team, when they would go to compete in a very hot place, they would do their warm up exercises, their stretching, then they would extract heat before the beginning of the race. So they I like to think of it as you have greater scope For heat absorption, interesting about how long, would one need to take one[0:14:07] Andrew Huberman: of these showers or cold immersions before heading out For run roughly speaking, we don't have to get into details because everyone's performance level and regimen is gonna be different, where they live is going to[0:14:17] Dr. Craig Heller: be different, etcetera. Right. It's not as long as you think. It's minutes.[0:14:21] Andrew Huberman: Couple minutes?[0:14:22] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. For for because what's going to happen is, as your core temperature goes down, you will eventually shut off your heat loss, And that keeps it from going below normal. So it it you can if you're if you've warmed up and your temperature has risen by half a 3, let's say. It doesn't take more than a few minutes to extract that heat if you're vasodilated. Interesting.[0:14:47] Dr. Craig Heller: And what about for the Anaerobic athlete, the strength athlete. For the anaerobic athlete and let's say they're doing several Several they're doing several sets, and how many reps, whatever they're doing. Their core temperature is not gonna rise that fast because it's only certain muscles which are being used, but the temperature of those muscles will go up.[0:15:11] Andrew Huberman: So it's a local effect.[0:15:13] Dr. Craig Heller: It's a local effect.[0:15:14] Andrew Huberman: Right. Let's say let's for sake of today, I've made for this discussion. Let's if we assume that the, basic workout, even though people do variation on this is, You know, 5 sets of 5 or 10 sets of 10. Yeah. So for those listening, it would be 5 sets of 10 of 5 rep repetitions or 10 sets of 10 repetitions.[0:15:34] Andrew Huberman: 10 by 10, 5 by 5. Uh-huh. Yeah. So if somebody, let's say, is doing, a large body compound movement like barbell squats where there's there are a lot of large body movements, hip hinging units, etcetera. But for instance, the The biceps are not they're involved, but more or less indirectly.[0:15:54] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:15:55] Andrew Huberman: So the effect is going to be to heat up the Quadriceps heat up the hamstrings, heat up the glutes, this kinda thing. Right. I see.[0:16:02] Dr. Craig Heller: And then during rest, that heat will leave the muscle, but it's not fast. And, certainly, the heat can't leave the muscle very fast while you're working out because when the muscle contracts, it squeezes the blood vessels. And the only way heat gets out of a muscle is in the blood, and your muscle metabolism can go up 50 or 60 fold during anaerobic activity. That means the heat production in the muscle goes up 50 or 60 fold. The blood flow to that muscle cannot go up 50 or 60 fold.[0:16:34] Dr. Craig Heller: So you literally have the capacity to cook your muscles. Mhmm.[0:16:39] Andrew Huberman: So, this is probably an appropriate time to just mentioned briefly what the underlying mechanism of this is. Could you just we we will return to the specifics of what one can do to mitigate this heating up. But, could you just explain the relationship between energy production, ATP, and pyruvate kinase and the role of heat there?[0:17:00] Dr. Craig Heller: Sure. We don't get something for nothing. So like a steam engine, most of the energy in our food is lost as heat. So we are roughly about 20% efficient. So of the energy that we take in in our Food, about 20% of that can go into doing work, and the rest of it is lost as heat.[0:17:22] Dr. Craig Heller: Now we're mammals. We use that heat to keep our body temperature considerably above the environment. But if you raise body temperature a few degrees higher, You're in trouble. That's hyperthermia. So individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits before you might Experience it in the whole body.[0:17:45] Dr. Craig Heller: So to keep you from damaging your muscle by hyperthermia, we have fail safe mechanisms, And one of those fail safe mechanisms is an enzyme which is critical for getting fuel, in other words, The results of metabolism of glucose, getting that fuel into the mitochondria, which is making our Major coinage of energy exchange, ATP. Yeah. So that particular enzyme is temperature sensitive. So when the muscle temperature gets above 39 or 395, it shuts off, and that essentially Shuts off the fuel supply to the mitochondria. That's when you cannot do 1 more rep.[0:18:28] Andrew Huberman: So failure could we say that one one component of muscular failure is overheating of the muscle locally.[0:18:35] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. There[0:18:36] Andrew Huberman: are probably other things too.[0:18:37] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, if you yeah. If you lack oxygen.[0:18:40] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:18:40] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. But our oxygen[0:18:40] Andrew Huberman: delivery is pretty good[0:18:40] Dr. Craig Heller: to the Delivery is pretty good to the to to the muscle. If you run out of glucose, yeah, that's going to impair you, but The most immediate the most immediate impairment of muscle activity, muscle fatigue, in other words, is the rise in temperature of the muscle.[0:18:57] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. I wanna talk about how that muscle fails locally, but I have this burning question in my mind that I cannot seem To answer for myself, I'm hoping you can answer it for me. So let's say I'm doing, 5 sets of 5 with squats. Mhmm. I hit muscular failure at a given weight.[0:19:16] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And according to what I now know, it's my quadriceps and the muscles associated, I mean, with the squat that have failed because of this heat triggering this mechanism triggered by heat that shuts off the muscle. But my biceps are nice and cool, you're telling me. They're they're they're not doing too much work. It's only indirect work.[0:19:37] Dr. Craig Heller: Mhmm.[0:19:37] Andrew Huberman: So why is it that I can't set this The bar down in the squat rack, walk over and do barbell curls with the same intensity that I could If I were to do those barbell curls fresh, had not having done anything prior.[0:19:53] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, you will still have a fatigue curve with your Upper body. Okay. And that will be influenced by any rise in temperature that has been generated by your lower body exercise.[0:20:06] Andrew Huberman: So so temperature in both cases is the limiting factor.[0:20:09] Dr. Craig Heller: It's one limiting factor. It's one limiting factor.[0:20:13] Andrew Huberman: I find that amazing. I find that amazing because I always thought, naively, that the reason muscles fail is because we, quote, don't have the strength to do another repetition. There were it's that You like glycogen or some ability to access that glycogen. But, of course, we still have glycogen. It's naive for me to think that because if I Wait 3 minutes and go back, I can do those repetitions again.[0:20:35] Andrew Huberman: So the glycogen wasn't restored in that 3 minutes.[0:20:38] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:20:38] Andrew Huberman: Obviously, it was there.[0:20:39] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:20:40] Andrew Huberman: So I realized there might be other mechanisms involved. Sounds like heat is, if not, the dominant mechanism that prevents more work. It's one of them.[0:20:50] Dr. Craig Heller: It's one of them, and it's A quick one. It's a fast one. So it can happen with let's say you are a really experienced Weight lifter. K. You may be doing very, very high weights with sets of 5 or 6.[0:21:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. To be clear for the audience, I'm not doing very high weights for the sense of. I'm not particularly strong. I I'm not super weak, but I'm not particularly strong. But Craig's referring in the general sense to with to you.[0:21:19] Andrew Huberman: So it why why is it that if I finish a set of squats, I can't simply cool off my quadriceps by throwing a nice cool towel on my quadriceps. Why would why is that not the best way to go about it?[0:21:34] Dr. Craig Heller: Because your body surface is a very good insulator. Okay? We we think we don't have fur, and therefore, we're not insulated. But the skin, the fascia, the, the muscles underneath underneath, that they're all very good insulators, And that's why I said earlier that the way the heat gets out of the muscle is in the blood.[0:21:56] Andrew Huberman: So I I wanna step through a couple other portals by which one Might think that heating and cooling would be ideal and then get back to these Sure. Specialized surfaces on the the hands, the feet, and the face.[0:22:09] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah.[0:22:09] Andrew Huberman: So if throwing a cold towel or ice even ice cold towel on my quadriceps isn't gonna work or standing in front of the fan because I'm insulated from that cool. I can't cool off my blood fast enough. What about drinking 16 ounces of ice water?[0:22:22] Dr. Craig Heller: Sure. You can do that, but you can calculate how much heat that can absorb. Okay. And you can't continue drinking liters of ice water. You're going to dilute your your blood and have other problems.[0:22:34] Dr. Craig Heller: But, yes, it'll help. Sure, it will help. But it is not doesn't have the the full capacity you will need.[0:22:42] Andrew Huberman: What about an ice pack to the back of my neck or to my head or squeezing the cold sponge over the head? I'm I'm deliberately moving through these options because these are the ones that see most often we were actually just watching the Olympic track and field trials last night up in Oregon. I'm a huge track and field fan, and, there were a lot of, there were a lot of sponges on the backs of necks, before and between and after events. And, How good is that or how poor is that as a strategy? Since now we know that being overheated locally and throughout the body is is a serious limiting factor on performance.[0:23:18] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, you have to understand something about our thermoregulatory system. We have a thermostat just like you have a thermostat in your house, and that thermostat is in the brain. Okay?[0:23:30] Andrew Huberman: Do we know the specific site?[0:23:31] Dr. Craig Heller: Yes. Yes. It's called the preoptic anterior hypothalamus. It does many things in terms of physiological regulation, But it serves as a thermostat. Now that thermostat has to have information.[0:23:44] Dr. Craig Heller: It has to have input. Where does that input come from? It comes from our overall body surface where we sense temperature. So one of the things that can happen when you're overheated is that you can send in a cold stimulus to your thermostat, and that's sort of like wanting to cool your house by putting a wet wash Cloth over your thermostat? No.[0:24:06] Dr. Craig Heller: It's it's doing the wrong thing. So we've actually had experiences where we've had people Exercising, getting overheated, and then cooling the body surface. And they say it feels great. This is fantastic, and their core temperature's going up.[0:24:21] Andrew Huberman: I think this is such an important point. First of all, I I, was weaned in a laboratory where there were always battles over the temperature In the lab. So people were always putting ice packs on thermostats or putting fans towards thermostats and trying to play this game. Good to know we were all being foolish, even though we're neurobiologists. Putting a cold towel over my torso Or putting ice on the back of of my upper back, you're saying could actually heat up my core.[0:24:51] Dr. Craig Heller: It'll at least Decrease your heat loss, your rate of heat loss as we're you're going to raise the issue a little later, I I know, and that is our natural portals for heat loss. So you can think of the natural porters portals for heat loss as our air conditioners. Okay. The thermostat's in the brain, and the information from the thermos to the thermostat is coming from the overall body surface. So what can happen if you, let's say, cool the torso with an ice vest, you can actually cause vasoconstriction of your Portals.[0:25:25] Dr. Craig Heller: Your heat loss portals. So that's what impairs the rate at which you're losing heat. Feels good. Now back to the head. That's really interesting.[0:25:35] Dr. Craig Heller: The major blood flow to the brain comes up 4 arteries Through the neck, there's the carotid arteries, and there's the vertebral arteries. So when you put a cold towel around the neck, You're going to be putting a cold stimulus into the brain. Well, that's great for protecting the brain. You wanna protect the brain, But it's also going to make you feel cooler than you are. So you will think you're ready to go again quickly when you've just essentially, cool.[0:26:07] Dr. Craig Heller: The thermostat.[0:26:09] Andrew Huberman: This is an important point. And there's a lot of, interest nowadays in people doing marathons, and there are even[0:26:15] Dr. Craig Heller: some people who[0:26:15] Andrew Huberman: do these Ultras, ultra running, which I guess is everything longer than a marathon, and go and go last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind of things. So you're saying that if somebody's hyperthermic, they could trick themselves into subjectively thinking that They are cooling off by putting the quartile and then they can go further, but their brain could cook.[0:26:36] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, if they stop the cooling, then that hot blood from the body core is gonna go[0:26:40] Andrew Huberman: to the brain. Interesting. Well, many, it's a bit of a of a tangent, but many people report after long bouts of exercise Mhmm. Or even just very intense bouts of exercise, and the Digination post exercise. But is it possible that there are some post exercise effects on heating and cooling of the brain that might impact cognition?[0:27:09] Andrew Huberman: Or I should say negatively impact cognition?[0:27:11] Dr. Craig Heller: It's certainly possible because we know that A rise in temperature decreases cognitive capacity. Mhmm. I mean, you can experience that yourself. You can get On a treadmill, you know, and follow your temperature and then just do a simple activity like adding and subtracting. You get to about 39 degrees.[0:27:33] Dr. Craig Heller: You can't just calculate how how long you've been on the treadmill.[0:27:36] Andrew Huberman: So the the phrase cool, calm, and collected is a is Cool, calm, and collected. That's the goal in in all pursuits.[0:27:42] Dr. Craig Heller: That's right.[0:27:43] Andrew Huberman: So, I wanna talk about these portals Yeah. Because you've mentioned them a few times. Before I ask about what The portals are exactly in how they work and how they can be leveraged for performance. I just there's a question that my neurobiologist self can't resist but ask. We have this thermostat[0:28:03] Dr. Craig Heller: in[0:28:04] Andrew Huberman: the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, which is interesting to me that pre op the medial preoptic area is also one that's known to be, sexually dimorphic, depending on testosterone exposure early in life, etcetera. Although, people should just note that it's not actually testosterone that Creates these sexual dimorphisms, these differences. It's actually testosterone converted into estrogen. It's actually estrogen is the effector, which is fascinating. Nonetheless, we've got this area that acts as a thermostat.[0:28:33] Andrew Huberman: And you said it's collecting information from the whole body. Does that mean that there are pathways as the neuroscientists like you and I refer to them as these these afferent or input pathways from the body The information just coming from the left shoulder, just from the right toe. It sounds like you need a pretty, probably a pretty crude map, but that you need a complete map of[0:29:05] Dr. Craig Heller: the body surface there. Well, you don't need a complete map in the hypothalamus. I mean, that thermal afferent information that you mentioned, it also goes The somatosensory cortex. So you know if an ice cube has touched you on the back, But that doesn't necessarily translate into a change in, let's say, you're shivering or or sweating. So the information that's going to the hypothalamus is more integrated representation of[0:29:36] Andrew Huberman: of body temperature. So it's sort of an average of what's happening across the bunch. Right. So if I were to let's say I get hot on a hot day And, popsicles. When we were in summer camp Yeah.[0:29:44] Andrew Huberman: And I went to a sports camp near here, actually, and we'd run around like crazy. And then we get into the shade if we could, but we're, you know, popsicles. Brain freeze. Or the kids were putting ice cubes down each other's Yeah. You know, shirts or something.[0:29:57] Andrew Huberman: But that's an average because other parts of the body aren't Exposed. The mouth is exposed to the ice in the popsicle case or the the cold cubes or in the hands. As you said, it feels really good. It feels good. Yeah.[0:30:08] Andrew Huberman: But it sounds like it it's Feels deceptively good because in reality, it could still be quite warm internally. Absolutely. Yep. Interesting.[0:30:18] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. You can feel great and have a, dangerously hyperthermic temperature. But I should say that when you get into the danger zone, things get bad fast.[0:30:29] Andrew Huberman: What are some of the symptoms that people could be on the lookout for for hyperthermia?[0:30:34] Dr. Craig Heller: Essentially, it's it's almost ironic that if individuals are trans transitioning into heat stroke, They actually vasoconstrict, and they stop sweating. And that's a pathological situation. I I I couldn't begin to explain it, but, essentially, you are just feeling exhausted. You're feeling Miserable. The heart rate is very high.[0:31:06] Dr. Craig Heller: Your heart rate goes up as your core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. So you just feel rotten, But that's why since since it's not an an an it's not a danger signal that you can translate immediately into, nope. I'm going into heat stroke. That's why people can overcome their bad feeling with motivation to continue going, to work harder. So There have been a number of high profile athletic deaths due to heat stroke that were during practice, Not in competition when people, you know, are really trying to do it, but in practice, which shows they were just motivated to push.[0:31:50] Andrew Huberman: So let's talk about these magnificent portals[0:31:53] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah.[0:31:53] Andrew Huberman: That not just humans, but other animals, mammals are[0:31:57] Dr. Craig Heller: equipped with.[0:31:58] Andrew Huberman: So, if putting cold on the neck, or on the head, or on the torso is not optimal, what is optimal? And, maybe walk us through a theory as to why we would have these portals located where they are, And then we can talk about how one might leverage them for performance.[0:32:18] Dr. Craig Heller: K. Where the portals are are in the glabrous Skin, big word. Okay? Glabrous just means no hair. So it's the hairless skin.[0:32:29] Dr. Craig Heller: You say, well, I'm you know, most of my body is without hair. No. Your most of your body has hair follicles. We are mammals. Mammals have fur.[0:32:39] Dr. Craig Heller: We've lost the fur, but we still have those That hairy skin phenotype all over our body, except except for those skin This is where our mammal relatives didn't have fur, so the pads of the feet. And for the primates, upper part of the face. For rabbits, no portions of the ears, the inner surface[0:33:03] Andrew Huberman: of the ears. Thought about that.[0:33:04] Dr. Craig Heller: For bears, no. The tongue. Bears have big tongues, huge tongues.[0:33:09] Andrew Huberman: I didn't know that either. I haven't been that close to a bear yet.[0:33:13] Dr. Craig Heller: You haven't been a licking match[0:33:15] Andrew Huberman: for the bear. Not yet. No.[0:33:16] Dr. Craig Heller: So, anyway, our mammal mammalian relatives can't lose heat over their overall body surface. So probably very early on in mammalian evolution, they evolved these special blood vessels in the limited surface areas that don't have fur. And as I said, what these blood vessels are are shunts between the arteries and the veins. Arteries and veins are both low resistance vessels, so you can have high flow rate. Capillaries, which normally are between arteries and veins, are high resistance because they're very tiny.[0:33:53] Dr. Craig Heller: Okay.[0:33:54] Andrew Huberman: Is it fair to say that, what I was taught is that blood flows from arteries, Then to capillaries, and then to veins,[0:34:02] Dr. Craig Heller: and then[0:34:02] Andrew Huberman: back to the heart. So it's sort of like from the heart through arteries, then through these little capillaries, which are like little estuaries and streams, and then to the veins back to the heart. Is that is that generally[0:34:12] Dr. Craig Heller: true? Absolutely.[0:34:13] Andrew Huberman: So what I learned in basic physiology is still[0:34:16] Dr. Craig Heller: It it's still[0:34:16] Andrew Huberman: I wouldn't I wouldn't get an f in your class.[0:34:18] Dr. Craig Heller: No. Okay.[0:34:19] Andrew Huberman: I'll Maybe a d or a c, but not enough.[0:34:22] Dr. Craig Heller: So that's excellent.[0:34:23] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And so you're saying that In this glabrous or beneath the glabrous skin[0:34:29] Dr. Craig Heller: There are these shunts.[0:34:30] Andrew Huberman: And those go directly from Arteries to veins. So you skip the the catheters.[0:34:36] Dr. Craig Heller: Yep. I see.[0:34:37] Andrew Huberman: And it's actually as long as I as I'm, say that in the skin, know, when I feel the pads in my hands, how deep to the surface do these do these vessels Rosario[0:34:49] Dr. Craig Heller: They're below the, obviously, the the the the the the epidermis. So so If you are warm and you look at just palms of your hands, they are fairly red.[0:35:01] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:35:02] Dr. Craig Heller: The backs of your hands aren't. Mhmm. You don't have these vessels in the backs of your hands. Now if you take a a glass, like a water tumbler, right, and you grab it, you can see if you squeeze a little bit, the hand goes white.[0:35:18] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:35:18] Dr. Craig Heller: That's because you've shut off that blood flow.[0:35:21] Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting. I'm gonna do that little home experiment.[0:35:24] Dr. Craig Heller: You're bicycling on a hot day, you don't wanna be grabbing your handlebars all the time. You wanna periodically.[0:35:30] Andrew Huberman: Well, this is important. I know you you, you're privy to some really amazing results that we're gonna talk about, but I actually heard you say this during This lecture recently that Stanford held about human performance that we're both part of. And you mentioned this that if you're cycling And you're working hard and you want to be able to do more work. We now know why you wanna remain cool in order to continue to do work. If you get too warm, that's bad.[0:35:56] Andrew Huberman: That gripping the handlebars too tightly will actually limit your performance.[0:36:01] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:36:01] Andrew Huberman: And that's probably also true on the Peloton or any other kind of device, or the ski, or or anything like that.[0:36:06] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:36:07] Andrew Huberman: So loosen the grip, or if you safely can, you wanna actually Expose your hands Right. To the world. Now what about for people wearing gloves? What about the the to me, that just seems crazy based on everything you're telling me.[0:36:18] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss, from the hands just as socks impede heat loss from the feet. Okay? So if you wanna maximize your heat loss, you want to have as thinner protectors as possible on your hands. And, of course, the feet are more Problematical because you have to be using them in certain ways.[0:36:38] Andrew Huberman: Some people run barefoot. Yeah. Well yeah. Yeah. That's that's become Somewhat popular.[0:36:43] Andrew Huberman: It seems like it kinda came and went. They had those toe shoes things, but they looked so ridiculous that I think most people just were willing to take the Performance hindrance of regular shoes.[0:36:52] Dr. Craig Heller: Actually, we had a track coach here at Stanford who, for a while, was famous for introducing, training without shoes running. Interesting. And he thought it was because it changed the posture of[0:37:04] Andrew Huberman: the runner, and I think it was just due to the fact that He was increasing the capacity of his runners to lose heat. Interesting. Yeah. So heating up at the level of the hands, obviously, is gonna hinder performance. So If I can how about with running?[0:37:18] Andrew Huberman: I noticed, I ran cross country briefly in high school and and not particularly well at that, But that we were told to run as if we were holding, you know, crackers in our in our fingers or something like very lightly and to keep hands kinda loose. Running like this would actually be more beneficial performance than[0:37:34] Dr. Craig Heller: Oh, than than[0:37:35] Andrew Huberman: or gripping a phone Yeah. Yeah. Which is probably what most people are doing nowadays. Right? Interesting.[0:37:40] Andrew Huberman: And, I once I'll tell you[0:37:42] Dr. Craig Heller: an experience I had once. I was in Alaska in the winter, and I went out running, and I absent mindedly forgot Gloves. And I realized this after a short period running because the backs of my hands were aching from the cold. The palms of my hands were sweating and were hot.[0:38:01] Andrew Huberman: Oh, amazing. Amazing. So these compartments are a real thing. And you mentioned the upper half of the face.[0:38:06] Dr. Craig Heller: Upper part. That's where our primate ancestors don't have fur.[0:38:10] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And the bottoms of our feet. So, let's just take a moment and talk about some of the more Amazing results that have been associated with proper cooling of these glabrous skin surfaces.[0:38:23] Dr. Craig Heller: Let me introduce 1 more thing. Sure. As you asked earlier about the pouring of water on the head. Yeah. One of the things which is not appreciated fully is that the blood which is perfusing these special blood vessels in the face above the beard line.[0:38:42] Dr. Craig Heller: That's the non hairy skin. That blood then returns in the venous supply to the heart, but it actually does it in a very strange way. It actually goes through what are called, I'm blocking on the name now.[0:38:59] Andrew Huberman: Take your time.[0:39:00] Dr. Craig Heller: These are blood vessels that go through the skull. K? And that's why the scalp bleeds a lot if you cut Mhmm. Cut the scalp. And these blood vessels, which are called, I wanna say emergent, but it's not emergent.[0:39:11] Dr. Craig Heller: It's It's a word that means leaving. These blood vessels were primarily thought to be ways that blood is leaving, the brain. But when you're overheated, the direction of flow in those blood vessels reverses. So the Cooled blood that's coming from your facial region goes into that circulation and actually is a cooling source for the brain. So you can cool the brain.[0:39:41] Dr. Craig Heller: You can have a cooling effect on the brain by pouring water on on your head. Interesting. So that practice, which we, At[0:39:48] Andrew Huberman: least for me, I most commonly associate with, combat sports[0:39:52] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. Where[0:39:52] Andrew Huberman: someone the fighter goes to their corner, they usually sit down on a, on a stool unless they're trying to, do some mental warfare from the corner, in which case they they don't even take a seat. And their, corner Crew will will squeeze a a glove excuse me, a sponge full of cold water over them.[0:40:12] Dr. Craig Heller: Or,[0:40:14] Andrew Huberman: That you're saying is somewhat effective in cooling the brain.[0:40:17] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. It's one of the natural mechanisms for cooling the Right.[0:40:21] Andrew Huberman: I wanna return to this at some point as well. But is there any known benefit to cooling the brain in terms of Offsetting physical damage, you know, offsetting the negative effects of concussion. Because one of the reasons why, Fighters will often get a a a cold on the back, you know, cold item on the back of the neck or on the head is not just to cool them down, but The theory is that it might offset some of the damage of neurons.[0:40:50] Dr. Craig Heller: I just can't comment on that. I'm aware of those ideas, they're controversial. One of the things that you want to do for injury to the brain is to decrease swelling. And, one of the ways that you decrease swelling in many parts of the body is to cool. It it decreases inflammation.[0:41:12] Dr. Craig Heller: It decreases the blood flow. So, you know, I I think it's a really interesting topic, and it's something that Should be investigated. It's kinda hard to investigate.[0:41:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Interesting. Okay, so I hear these stories, and I've seen the data. So I believe the stories. Maybe tell us a story about An observation that your group has made with respect to anaerobic exercise and the and this Prop and proper, cooling of the these glamorous surfaces.[0:41:46] Andrew Huberman: And we can talk about the technology.[0:41:48] Dr. Craig Heller: Yep.[0:41:50] Andrew Huberman: Maybe give us the dips example first. Okay. So, of course, you know, I think most people familiar with dips. You're supposed to, I guess, get down.[0:41:56] Dr. Craig Heller: Raise and lower your body.[0:41:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Raise and lower your body raise and lower your body mass usually with your legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough to attach a weight there, and, they'll do it's essentially a compound upper body exercise. Right. One dip would not be particularly impressive for most people, a 100 would be very impressive, 20 would be impressive for some, etcetera.[0:42:19] Andrew Huberman: What happens when a skilled athlete comes in and does dips for multiple sets? And then what happens when they cool properly using the glabrous Skin surfaces.[0:42:30] Dr. Craig Heller: This was a story that occurred early on in our investigations when we first made the discoveries that Cooling has a benefit to increase your work volume, your capacity to do more reps. Okay? So, the word got over, I think, to the 40 niners camp, and, one of their players, Greg Clark, who was a tight end at the time, he had been Tight end at Stanford. He decided or I don't know if he was asked or what, to come over and check it out. So Greg came over, and we said, Greg, what are you good at?[0:43:07] Dr. Craig Heller: What what activity do you like to do? He said, dips. I can do a lot of dips. I can do 40 dips in a 1st set, and I can probably do 5 sets. That's a usual workout for me.[0:43:19] Dr. Craig Heller: And we said, okay. So he came over to the Jim one day, and that's exactly what he did. He did 40 dips the 1st set and then maybe 25 and 15 and you're down down for[0:43:31] Andrew Huberman: Do you recall roughly what kinda rest periods he was taking between sets?[0:43:35] Dr. Craig Heller: We we ins we we standardized the rest period to 3 minutes Because that's what we had set on for cooling as the interest a[0:43:44] Andrew Huberman: good long rest period.[0:43:46] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. It[0:43:46] Andrew Huberman: it is. Yeah. Dips. Got it.[0:43:48] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. It's actually a longer rest period than many, people would prefer during workouts. They wanna make the most[0:43:54] Andrew Huberman: Not me. I prefer to take much jazz as I possibly can. Yeah.[0:43:58] Dr. Craig Heller: So several days later, he came back. And, his 1st set, he did, I think, maybe 42. A little bit better, but now people were standing around watching. So there was a little impetus there to show off. Mhmm.[0:44:12] Dr. Craig Heller: So then his 2nd set was I don't remember the numbers, but very much above the 2nd set on the control day. This was after we Cooled his[0:44:21] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So he does when[0:44:22] Dr. Craig Heller: when is he doing the cooling? He's he's sitting down and putting his hands in the devices that we had built, which were Cooling the palms of his hands.[0:44:31] Andrew Huberman: For how long does that cooling take? Can he do it inside of a 3 minute rest period?[0:44:35] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. That's what we were doing. Yeah. We standardized The Okay. The interval for resting or cooling, to 3 minutes.[0:44:42] Dr. Craig Heller: Okay. But the the point is he got to his 5th Set, and he's and all of the sets were above what he had done on the previous day, and he said, you know, I'm not tired. I can do another set, And then I can do another set. I can do another set. I can do another set.[0:44:58] Dr. Craig Heller: So from one day 2 2 or 3 days later with cooling, he doubled the total work volume. He doubled the total number of dips. By adding more sets and more repetitions to each set. Right. So then he kept coming back, for Four more weeks, twice a week.[0:45:19] Dr. Craig Heller: And by the end of that month, he was doing 300 dips.[0:45:24] Andrew Huberman: Wow. So what percentage? So he tripled.[0:45:26] Dr. Craig Heller: He tripled. He tripled. He tripled. And so here's a here's a professional athlete at peak physical conditioning, and he triples Amazing. What he can do.[0:45:34] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. And in terms of his ability to recover, did was that explored or discussed at all? Because my understanding is that if we cause enough stress to a muscle during anaerobic training, We provide the stimulus for compensatory regrowth, etcetera.[0:45:53] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:45:54] Andrew Huberman: But if we do more work, We essentially scale up the amount of recovery that's needed or the recovery time. I'm I'm very curious about whether or not he needed longer to recover between these Super performing workouts.[0:46:06] Dr. Craig Heller: That's very interesting. That was a major discovery, which we didn't realize we were making at the time. There is this phenomenon you're referring to as delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS, and this is due to those little micro tears and so forth that are happening as we extend our workout capacity volume. Okay? So we've had this experience so many times that an athlete or anyone will come in to the lab, and they will Exceed what their previous goals were, their previous expectations, and I can always see the words coming out of their mouth.[0:46:44] Dr. Craig Heller: I'm going to be so sore tomorrow. They never are. Interesting. And we've actually demonstrated that, with a naive group. We had a class, physical conditioning class, and, we had half of them.[0:47:01] Dr. Craig Heller: The 1st days of the class, we had to establish their True capacity, what they could do. So these were pretty heavy workouts for these new recruits, and, We gave half of them the benefit of cooling and the other half not, and then we had them record their subjective levels of delayed onset muscle soreness. And they Those that were cool didn't have significant muscle soreness.[0:47:25] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. And I know there are also published results, and we we will provide links to some of these papers for people, seeing similar effects, I should say similar performance enhancing effects using, bench presses, You know, bench press or push ups or other other sorts of things. Maybe you could give us an example from the realm of endurance work or or aerobic work, running, cycling, things of that sort.[0:47:51] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, one of the problems with, for us is that our equipment now is not Really portable. I mean, it's portable in the sense you can carry it to the gym or to the football field.[0:48:03] Andrew Huberman: But you're not gonna run with it.[0:48:04] Dr. Craig Heller: But you're not gonna run with it. Right.[0:48:06] Andrew Huberman: Or equip a bicycle with it. Although when are the cooling handles on bicycles coming?[0:48:10] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. That would be that would be good. But one one, itinerant activity is golfing. People have put it on their golf carts, and, they're out.[0:48:19] Andrew Huberman: Really heat up that much in golf?[0:48:20] Dr. Craig Heller: They do?[0:48:21] Andrew Huberman: Not to to be disparaging of the golfers, but I the way I think conceptualize golf, it's like a swing and then a walk and then a and then a Cart ride and then a meal. I probably just offended all the golfers out there.[0:48:31] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, we one one time we had we were doing work for the, for the, Department of Defense, and they wanted to check it out whether or not what we were doing was really worthwhile. So they sent out a team of special, Special ops soldiers to be our subjects and test it out. They were here for a week. So they that was a fun wish.[0:48:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're I do some work with those guys. They're they're hard driving. Yeah. They they also know how to have fun.[0:49:01] Andrew Huberman: But they're they but, yeah, they they definitely have If they have an off or a quit switch, it's buried deep within their nervous system. They don't like to hit that that Quit switch.[0:49:13] Dr. Craig Heller: So the guy who wrote the final report, he gave an addendum to the report. He said, well, I'll tell you this. After I've gotten At home, it's added that techno they took the technology with them. They wanted to keep it.[0:49:26] Andrew Huberman: That's that's sounds about right. I said[0:49:28] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. And And using it, it has added 20 yards to every club in my bag, and that's no effing small Wow. People.[0:49:35] Andrew Huberman: So it's allowing people to hit further hit the golf ball Further. Right. Interesting. You'll get alright. So for the for the golf, players out there, and the, it Then, that's the, that's the reward you get back from Craig for all my my little knocks on golf.[0:49:54] Andrew Huberman: I actually I I don't have any knock on golf. I just don't think about it as a sport where heating up is a limiting factor. So Well, yeah. Since they're getting more more out of their drive, what's what do you think is going on there?[0:50:06] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, they can be heating up.[0:50:08] Andrew Huberman: And there were specialists. Right?[0:50:09] Dr. Craig Heller: They're wearing it on a hot day and so forth. But let me just tell you one more serious, story about golfers, and that is Individuals with multiple sclerosis are exceedingly temperature sensitive. I didn't[0:50:22] Andrew Huberman: know that.[0:50:22] Dr. Craig Heller: So they may still be mobile, but they have to stay in cool locations and not increase their exercise to any great extent. But we've had, subjects that have with multiple sclerosis who have just essentially put the device on their golf cart, and they're back out playing golf in the middle of the summer.[0:50:40] Andrew Huberman: Oh, that's great. Yeah. That's great. It does Anything that allows people to have normal levels Right. Of, you know, livelihood And, and recreation is great.[0:50:50] Andrew Huberman: We always think about performance as the at these kind of like peak and elite levels and, pushing harder. But, Anything that allows people to be to be mobile and functional is great. So, what's your favorite example of endurance? And feel free to give us the extreme one, and then we'll talk about averages at to be you know, make sure we're thorough about averages versus exceptions.[0:51:12] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. We haven't done a lot in The field. I mean, out outdoors. Most of our endurance has been in experiment. We had, I think, maybe 18 subjects just off the street.[0:51:29] Dr. Craig Heller: Maybe we just recruited people in the hallways. Come on in and do this. And What we found is we could for this group, with one trial with and without cooling, we could double their endurance Walking on the treadmill, walking uphill on the treadmill in the heat, like, maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40 degrees centigrade.[0:51:49] Andrew Huberman: What does that experiment look like? You're having people walk on an incline. It's really warm. Some people are just gonna hit the quit button and say, I've had enough and get off the treadmill. Right.[0:51:59] Andrew Huberman: With proper cooling, when are they doing the cooling?[0:52:02] Dr. Craig Heller: They're they're doing it continuously[0:52:04] Andrew Huberman: I see.[0:52:04] Dr. Craig Heller: Because in the Laboratory, we can suspend devices from the ceiling, for example. Sure. Now we do have prototype wearable devices. We did them, in response to emails from, Ebola workers a number of years ago in, Sierra Leone, I said, we've read about your work with athletes. Can't you do something for us?[0:52:25] Dr. Craig Heller: I mean, we're in the personal protective gear, and we can't be in the hot zone for more than 15 or 20 minutes. So that was started us on the, challenge of developing wearable systems that could go under the PPE. We published that work now.[0:52:40] Andrew Huberman: That's great. There's no guessing the military special operators that are out in the desert and other locations are probably excited about this technology.[0:52:47] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, once they get it.[0:52:49] Andrew Huberman: Once they get it. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. Yeah.[0:52:52] Andrew Huberman: You know, I think some people, might wonder, you know, if there are all these Studies and there are these incredible results over the years. Why haven't we heard more about it? And I I will ask your opinion on that as well, but I'll just editorialize a little bit. Is that the The best laboratory work and its practical applications oftentimes requires many studies. And oftentimes, there isn't a portal, so to speak, to get that information out into the technology sector.[0:53:22] Andrew Huberman: So there is A company that's developing this technology for people to use Right. To purchase and use. Right. Might as well just tell us now. What is the name of that company?[0:53:33] Andrew Huberman: And and do they have a website? People are gonna wanna know, where can they get This magical technology.[0:53:38] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[0:53:39] Andrew Huberman: And and is there a poor man's version of it as well?[0:53:41] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, the company is Arteria, a r t e r I a, And the website is www.coolmit.com. So coolmitt is just c o o l m I t t. Mhmm. Gourmet.com.[0:53:57] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's a great website. When I went there, it says that right now, the technology is only available to Professional sports teams and military. Is that true?[0:54:04] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, where we stand now is, the new version of the technology is sort of in beta test versions. Got it into the hands of people who had used the technology before. So there's, NFL, teams that are using. There's, college teams. There's, Olympics.[0:54:22] Dr. Craig Heller: There's the Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, the NBA, the National Tennis Association, they have locations where now they are trying this out and reporting back how is it working, how could change it. How could you improve it Great. And so forth. So that's that's where we are. But, on the website, you can actually sign up for Being one who will be able to get one when they are finally manufactured, they're now being made in fairly small lots because you wanna change things[0:54:54] Andrew Huberman: as[0:54:54] Dr. Craig Heller: you realize how it can be improved.[0:54:56] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This is Stanford after all. You wanna get the technology right. I I like to joke that, one of the reasons I like being at Stanford so much is that not only are my colleagues amazing and they're so forward thinking, but they're all perfectionist. And so the the perfectionist mindset is it has to be perfect before it can go go live, so to speak.[0:55:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, I think there will be a lot of interest. Let's Talk about the technology in a little more detail for a moment, and then let's talk about whether or not cruder forms of that technology exist either for sake of safety and or performance. So what is, the the cool mitt, as I understand, is it it's a it's a mitt. It's a glove. Yeah.[0:55:35] Andrew Huberman: You put your hand into it. You you hold on to A surface, and that surface, cools you cools your hand and thereby through this, specialized, portal, Cools your your core body temperature and all the all the muscles of the body. Subjectively, if I were to do this right now, would I think that it Was ice cold, or would I think it was just cool? Just cool. I see.[0:55:59] Dr. Craig Heller: Ice cold is too cold. So people always ask, well, why can't you just stick your hand in a bucket of ice water? It's too cold. What that does is that causes reflex vasoconstriction of the Very portals that you're trying to maximize the heat loss from. So you stick your hand in cold water.[0:56:19] Dr. Craig Heller: When it comes out, it's cold. You just sealed up all the heat in your body. Right. So what I sort of recommended to someone at one point. They said, well, when I'm running, can I just carry a frozen juice can, and it will gradually melt?[0:56:33] Dr. Craig Heller: And I said, well, no, because That's going to decrease the heat loss from that hand. But if every couple minutes you switched hands,[0:56:40] Andrew Huberman: it might work. Well, I have a feeling that there are people now doing that As well as trying trying this. So, how long in in the cool mitt, at the proper temperature, how long are Are people putting their hands into the mitt? We once again had just standardized on 3 minutes. And part of[0:56:59] Dr. Craig Heller: the reason for that is that The heat law the rate of heat loss is an exponentially declining curve. Okay? And 3 minutes sort of gets the best part of the curve. So you can go longer and get more benefit, but the biggest bang for the buck is in the 1st 2, 3 minutes.[0:57:18] Andrew Huberman: K. You mentioned, a number of impressive, organizations, sports teams, and military that are using this. This is not something that I typically see on the sidelines of games. Although, to be honest, I haven't looked very carefully. I'm guessing that they are probably keeping the technology somewhat under wraps.[0:57:37] Andrew Huberman: Where and how are they doing this? Are they running back to the locker room? I mean, the the military special operators are doing their thing. But in terms of the athletes, Is it possible, hypothetically, that athletes are doing this somewhat incognito?[0:57:51] Dr. Craig Heller: It it's possible, but I really don't know. People have mentioned here at Stanford, they don't see the football team using it. Well, the football team here at Stanford is mostly Playing in cold weather, cool weather. Night games are cool. Even date games are not very hot frequently here.[0:58:09] Dr. Craig Heller: But when they go to a hot place like Arizona or Utah, at least, our coach, Shaw, says that they take it with them, and that's when they find the benefit. That's when they[0:58:20] Andrew Huberman: use it. Interesting. So is there a poor person's, Poor man or woman's version of this. You mentioned the juice can passing back and forth. You mentioned cooling the hands.[0:58:34] Andrew Huberman: A number of people Said to me after learning a little bit about this science and technology that they've experienced some big effects, positive effects of of cooling by, and I confess I've done this. Taking a a, package of frozen blueberries and just kinda passing it back and forth between my hands. Now talking And you I realized I probably didn't do it long enough. I probably was I was only doing maybe 30 seconds passing it back and forth between my hands and then Going back into sets, I did see a performance enhancing effect. Uh-huh.[0:59:05] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. But, I realized I probably wasn't optimizing the protocol. If you were going to give a, accrued protocol for let's just say for the gym, because with running, it's a little bit tricky. But, what would that look like if people wanted to just play with this in in some sort of fashion?[0:59:23] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, that it you know, It's would be experimental.[0:59:28] Andrew Huberman: Sure. And, like Yeah. None of that is very controlled.[0:59:31] Dr. Craig Heller: Your idea of frozen peas is a good idea. And I think Since there's been no actual study of that, you would have to be you working out what is the best for you. But one way to figure it out is that if after you hold the cold peas in one hand and you switch it to the other hand, If someone then comes and feels your hand, is it warm or cold? If it's cold, it means you vasoconstricted. If it's warm, it means the hot blood is still going there.[1:00:04] Dr. Craig Heller: Okay?[1:00:04] Andrew Huberman: So we do that in the lab. And the key is for it to not vasoconstrict. Right. Okay. So so there's a test out there, folks.[1:00:11] Andrew Huberman: If you're gonna try this in kind of crude fashion, at least until the, the cool mitt is available more broadly To the general public, you could assess you wanna assess whether or not the hit your palms actually feel cool To the touch by somebody else to us. And if it does, that means you you've essentially shut down the portal. You're sealing in more heat, which is bad. What about, putting this cold pack of some sort on the face or, Or the feet. More of the feet.[1:00:40] Andrew Huberman: I work out at home. I don't often work out barefooted, but I suppose I could like they did in the seventies, you know, when those guys were walking around without shoes and squatting without shoe without any shoes or socks on. Could I put my feet on them?[1:00:53] Dr. Craig Heller: You you could. If you had simply had a water perfused pad and you were circulating cool water through it. You could just put your feet on it. Okay? Part of the problem is, that you don't want if let's say you have just a cold pack of something.[1:01:16] Dr. Craig Heller: The problem is back to boundary layers again. If you don't have a convective stream of the cooling Medium. The heat sink is not as effective because there'll be a boundary layer developed between the heat sink material and your skin, Yeah. So that decreases its its efficacy.[1:01:35] Andrew Huberman: I see. Maybe we should just, for a moment, talk about and convection and just make that clear. Like, if I put my hands let's say it's a cold night and I'm at a campfire, and I take my hands and I put them out to the fire.[1:01:48] Dr. Craig Heller: You're getting radiation.[1:01:49] Andrew Huberman: You're getting radiation.[1:01:50] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:01:50] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:01:51] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:01:52] Andrew Huberman: And and then if it's a windy, warm night no. I don't know if the best example. Give us a good example of convection.[1:01:59] Dr. Craig Heller: Convection, sure, is is in a cool breeze.[1:02:01] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:02:01] Dr. Craig Heller: You know, with the wind chill factor, That's due to convection. Mhmm. Okay? But in terms of heat transfer between 2 objects, if you have convection of the medium, whether it's blood on the inside and water on the outside, you Increase the heat exchange if you have convection on both sides.[1:02:23] Andrew Huberman: Right. So this is why just planting my feet on 2, packages of my bare feet on 2 packages of frozen peas, there's really no opportunity for circulation of and and therefore, heat transfer. So it's not really optimal, Which is a I and I But[1:02:38] Dr. Craig Heller: once again, it depends on the surface area to get any benefit at all. We have a study that we published, which was investigating the standard treatment for hyperthermia in the field. And the standard, treatment. The the, that's recommended by medical organizations is you take cold packs and you put them in the axilla, The groin.[1:03:03] Andrew Huberman: The axilla or the or the or the armpits?[1:03:05] Dr. Craig Heller: The armpits. Yeah. The groin, which is,[1:03:09] Andrew Huberman: Thin skin, lots of vasculature.[1:03:11] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. And the and the neck. So what we did is we did studies in which we made people hypothermic, And then we measured the rate at which we could cool them by putting those positions in the those Heat exchange bags in the recommended location versus on the glabrous skin, versus palm soles and face. The the cooling rate was double. Wow.[1:03:36] Dr. Craig Heller: So we put the same ice packs, the same cold packs, on the, Heat portals rather than the axilla, the groin, and the face. Wow.[1:03:48] Andrew Huberman: Or the neck. Wow. So face, hands, and bottoms of feet will cool you twice as fast as putting cold Packs into your armpits, your groin, or back of neck.[1:04:02] Dr. Craig Heller: So so I like to give the analogy of if your car is overheating, okay, and you have a Hose, a garden hose. Where should you spray your cooling system? Or should you spray the tubes going in and out of the radiator? Well, the rationale with putting these cold packs in the axial of the groin and the neck is that you're getting close the major arteries. Sure.[1:04:25] Dr. Craig Heller: That's going to be effective, but it's much more effective if you actually increase the heat loss capacity of the radiating surface, the radiators.[1:04:34] Andrew Huberman: So you cool the hot stuff heading toward the core.[1:04:38] Dr. Craig Heller: That that's essentially what the standard operating procedure is.[1:04:43] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. The[1:04:44] Dr. Craig Heller: that you hit the arteries. Mhmm. Amazing. And the veins. Arteries and veins.[1:04:48] Andrew Huberman: I'm gonna just tell a brief story that, illustrates how almost everybody gets this stuff wrong, and then I'm gonna use that as an opportunity ask you about heating deliberate heating as opposed to deliberate cooling. So about 4 months ago, a friend of mine, incidentally, a Guy who did 9 years in the SEAL team is really skilled cold water swimmer. We went out for a swim in the morning. I'm not nearly Even close to the being in the same universe of his, output potential, we do these swims. I'm familiar with them.[1:05:21] Andrew Huberman: I got enough blubber on me that stay warm enough in the cold Pacific. No wet suits. We do the morning cold cold swim for about a mile or so, and we brought with us a a young kid that I know real well that Hangs out with us sometimes and trains with us who's got very little body fat. He's just exceptionally lean despite eating Everything inside. Right?[1:05:42] Andrew Huberman: Teenager. Great athlete, great kid, great swimmer. So we're out there swimming, and at some point, We're talking to him and it's clear that he's gone hypothermic. He's slurring his words. He's not doing well.[1:05:56] Andrew Huberman: So we get him Onto the beach. His teeth are turning yellow. He's quaking. He's not he's got, you know, his saliva is taken on that consistency that's clear, like, he's hypothermic. We go to the lifeguard station.[1:06:09] Andrew Huberman: Lifeguard says, okay. Let's get his vitals. Let's do all this. Meanwhile, try and Stand next to him, and heat him up by heating up his torso. So there we are like pressing against this Guy, our friend, trying to heat him up.[1:06:25] Andrew Huberman: They get a blanket on him. He's I'm realizing he was barefoot. His face was Although, we did cover his head with a blanket. And he eventually came back. We got some warm liquids into him, and he he was okay.[1:06:36] Andrew Huberman: He was fine. I don't know that his mother is ever gonna let him swim with us again. If if I ever disappear or go missing, it's because of that incident. Anyway, he did great. He recovered.[1:06:49] Andrew Huberman: He's back in the water and doing well. But I realized that pretty much everything from the point where we got back on the beach, until he was back to normal was We did incorrectly. We heated his torso. We left his extremities exposed, and We assume we were doing the right thing, and the lifeguard is a skilled lifeguard at a major public beach. So I guess the simple question is, did we get everything wrong?[1:07:16] Andrew Huberman: Did we get Anything right? And what would have been the better option to heat up a hypothermic person in that or similar situation?[1:07:26] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, it's interesting you asked that because that is the way we got into this area of investigation. I worked on how the hypothalamus regulates body temperature neurophysiology. And one day, we were having a discussion with a colleague in the department of anesthesia, and, he jokingly said to my colleague, he said, Yeah. You guys think you know so much about temperature. I bet you couldn't solve a problem we have in the recovery room.[1:07:58] Dr. Craig Heller: What's that? Well, the patients come out of surgery. They're hypothermic, and it takes us hours to get them to stop shivering. What do they do in the recovery room? Exactly what You suggested they put in warm blankets.[1:08:11] Dr. Craig Heller: They put in heat lamps, and it takes them an hour or 2 hours to get these patients to stop shivering to bring them back up to so we say, ah, it's a trivial problem. No. It's a hard problem. It's a hard problem because when you're Under anesthesia, you're vasodilated. When you come out of anesthesia, you're hypothermic and you vasoconstrict.[1:08:34] Dr. Craig Heller: That makes it very difficult get heat into the body. So we got the idea that, well, if we could just take 1 appendage like an arm, And we put it in a, environment wrapped in a heating pad and, a negative pressure, you know, suction, that would pull more blood into that limb. That blood would get heated, and it would warm the body up faster. So my colleague built a Prototype device? You couldn't get such a device into the hospital these days.[1:09:05] Dr. Craig Heller: But we were with our Anesthesiologist ran. We took it into the recovery room, and and first thing, the patient said, no way. You're not gonna put that on my patient. But he prevailed, and 1st patient didn't shiver at all. 1st patient was back to normal temperature, core temperature in, I think it was 8 minutes.[1:09:28] Dr. Craig Heller: Amazing. 8 or 9 minutes.[1:09:29] Andrew Huberman: Is this now standard practice in hospitals? No. No. So this is another example where No. I I don't get upset About the although it it's upsetting to know that it's not, but I think that it's yet another case where a Fundamental problem exists.[1:09:44] Andrew Huberman: There's a science based solution That makes sense at the level of physiology, engineering, and practice, and yet it's not being done.[1:09:55] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:09:56] Andrew Huberman: And, I mean, we could we that's a whole other discussion as to the limitations are? Well, perhaps in an I know a number of our listeners are in the health care and medical profession as well as military athletes and just also standard Other types of jobs, civilians of doing other types of work. It would be wonderful if people understood this. So, once again, is there a, is there a Homegrown technology that people could use. If somebody's hypothermic, what is going to be the best way for them to warm up?[1:10:24] Andrew Huberman: Is it gonna be holding a a nice warm, Mug of cocoa or something like that, but not not too hot, I guess, is the again, the idea.[1:10:31] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. Well, actually, you can go hotter on the On the glabrous skin, they[1:10:37] Andrew Huberman: Oh, because they don't dilate?[1:10:39] Dr. Craig Heller: Be because it takes the heat away faster.[1:10:41] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:10:41] Dr. Craig Heller: Okay? But back to the, anesthesia, what you can do is you can use, warm pads. They have them in all hospitals. They have circulating water perfused pads.[1:10:52] Andrew Huberman: Hot water bottle[1:10:53] Dr. Craig Heller: types of stuff.[1:10:54] Andrew Huberman: So typically, they'll slide them under your lower back or something like that.[1:10:58] Dr. Craig Heller: Put them on put them on the feet. Okay. Sure. That that will do it. But, turns out that, we discovered through this work that it had nothing to do with the whole arm.[1:11:09] Dr. Craig Heller: It was only the hand, And that's when we came to the realization of these special blood vessels. We didn't discover the blood vessels. They're described in Grey's Anatomy, but nobody knew what they were for. And you mentioned bears earlier and other hairy animals.[1:11:26] Andrew Huberman: Do they have these AVAs[1:11:28] Dr. Craig Heller: Oh, yeah.[1:11:28] Andrew Huberman: As well? Oh, and I suppose we haven't defined AVAs. We've been pretty good about the no acronyms rule. AVAs is Arteriovenous anastomoses. So A connection between the arteries and the veins.[1:11:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I actually use this technology. I have a bulldog, bulldog master. He has a very high, Propensity for overheating Mhmm. Because they they're terrible at dumping heat, and bulldogs are great at pushing themselves Yeah.[1:11:53] Andrew Huberman: To the point of exhaustion or death. It it happens. And so now we do what we call palmer cooling. Sorry. I couldn't help myself.[1:12:01] Andrew Huberman: Where I'll take Costello and lower him into A cool body of water, just the just the bottoms of his paws. Although I think animals instinctually know to do this And we'll go and stand in bodies of water. They don't often lie down all the way. Yep. Some do.[1:12:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But They seem to know that's a great way to cool themselves off.[1:12:21] Dr. Craig Heller: Yep. Oh, absolutely. Yeah.[1:12:23] Andrew Huberman: And they get the advantage that their palm that their palms and their feet are essentially the same thing.[1:12:27] Dr. Craig Heller: We we actually built devices for dogs[1:12:30] Andrew Huberman: Did you really?[1:12:30] Dr. Craig Heller: And tried them on. Iditarod sled dogs, and it worked beautifully. They had little backpacks with the equipment and pads on all their feet, and and, it worked beautifully. Amazing.[1:12:43] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Along the lines of Heating. Deliberate heating. Wearing a knit, cap is something that you see more of that on the East Coast. You know, people run around Boston and New England, you know, with a with a knit cap.[1:12:58] Andrew Huberman: I've always done that at the start of my runs to try Warm up more quickly, and then I take it off. I shed layers as I go. Is that a rational practice the way I just described it? Yeah. Because warming up is important too.[1:13:11] Andrew Huberman: You you know, there's a certain amount of, quote, unquote, warming up that's required to lubricate joints or at least to get the sense that joints are lubricated and and to be able to move more easily.[1:13:21] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah.[1:13:21] Andrew Huberman: Do you still recommend that people warm up?[1:13:24] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. But I think we're misled by the term warm up as if the major purpose is to raise temperature. I don't I'm not aware of any data on this, but I I do think that the major contribution is increasing flexibility, so you're going to avoid having damage of joints and and tendons and ligaments and so forth. But, also, The ability of the mitochondria to produce, energy, can be impaired at low lower temperatures. And you have to keep in mind that we say our body temperature's 37 degrees, but that's not true.[1:14:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It varies across the day.[1:14:07] Dr. Craig Heller: It's well, it varies in parts of your Body. I mean, my hands and arms are not at 37 degrees right now. They're much lower.[1:14:16] Andrew Huberman: So that that raises an interesting question. What is the best way to measure core body temperature? Well, the best core temperature is that What we use is esophageal. So we put a thermocouple up the nose about 2 feet down the esophagus so[1:14:33] Dr. Craig Heller: that it's about the level of your art.[1:14:34] Andrew Huberman: Not gym or home practical. Although I I know. I don't know. Some of those COVID swab tests go pretty far. I can't even imagine going any further.[1:14:42] Andrew Huberman: I felt Like, my brain was getting tickled, and it was really unpleasant.[1:14:46] Dr. Craig Heller: Tympanic is a pretty good So the ear? The ear. Yeah. It's not Foolproof because you have to actually have it aimed properly at the tympanum. And frequently, what you're getting is you're getting sort of a mixture of tympanic plus Ear canal temperature.[1:15:01] Andrew Huberman: And the and for those listening and for those watching, the tympanic is not gonna be the pinna that this part of the ear, the outer part of the ear. The tympanic can be near the headed towards the tympanic membrane. And, yes, I'm sticking my finger in my ear because that's where the laser would actually have to go to measure your temperature.[1:15:18] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:15:18] Andrew Huberman: When we're walking into restaurants and other places nowadays and they're shining the laser at our forehead, that's probably giving a pretty crude readout of temperature.[1:15:25] Dr. Craig Heller: It is, But there's much less insulation between your brain and your forehead skin than there is between your biceps and your arm skin. So if you're going to measure a surface temperature, that's where you would do it. And, we do temperatures in the infrared. We we take infrared videos of athletes and and our our subjects. And, of course, the face lights up.[1:15:49] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Okay. So if we're not I imagine there's gonna be a technology coming soon where you can point your, smartwatch or your smartphone to yourself, and you're gonna get a heat map.[1:15:58] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. Right.[1:15:59] Andrew Huberman: That's got it. If if somebody out there hasn't already invented this for the typical folks outside military, somebody please invent that because, I think there is growing interest in temperature, based on the work that you're doing and also for sake of, something I do wanna touch on, which is Sleep and metabolism, although we don't wanna open up those portals all the way because we'd need several days to cover it. Okay. So putting on the the the cap, what about some of the helmets and gloves that are used in typical sports? Do you think that those can be improved in order to improve performance in terms of their ventilation ability or keeping palmer surfaces, open, for instance.[1:16:40] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, you mentioned about the the net cap in in cold weather, especially, and that is significant because you do lose a lot of heat from your Head, but it's a constant heat loss. It's not variable like your glabrous skin. So, if you decrease that heat loss, you're going to be warmer. So sure. That that that has an impact.[1:17:06] Dr. Craig Heller: Now in terms of helmets, they should be, ventilated. I mean, they should have enough, space in them and holes in them so that air can circulate, you don't want to insulate, thermally insulate your your scalp. That's going to Decrease heat loss quite considerable. Just for a resting individual, the brain is about 20% of your metabolism. So that's a lot of heat production.[1:17:32] Andrew Huberman: Yeah, absolutely. I realized there was a question that I failed to ask earlier, that is burning in my mind now, And I think is likely burning in the minds of of some of the listeners which is so you if you do this cooling in between sets in the gym, you get this performance enhancing effect. Mhmm. You don't get the delayed onset muscle soreness, which is great. Mhmm.[1:17:56] Andrew Huberman: So, presumably, The body is adapting. You're getting better as a consequence of being able to do more work per unit time or to go harder in some way, of course. You get that adaptation. Does that mean that you see a performance enhancing effect even when you don't cool if you've previously done the cooling workouts? So for instance, let's say I can do 10 sets of 10 dips, which I I like to think I can.[1:18:21] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I need to go try. I don't know if I've done that recently. I do the cooling. I I cool for 3 minutes between sets. And let's say I, get to the point where I can do, you know, 20 for 10 sets.[1:18:33] Andrew Huberman: 10 sets of 20 repetitions. And then I don't cool Mhmm. Will I be able to match or approximate my new better performance?[1:18:42] Dr. Craig Heller: You keep your gains. It's a true conditioning effect. You respond to the increased work volume by all of those mechanisms you mentioned. Amazing. You increase the number of contractile elements in your muscles.[1:18:56] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. Muscles get bigger. Amazing.[1:18:58] Dr. Craig Heller: We had an experiment that involved some of our, female students, not athletes, but just regular they were freshmen actually. And, The experiment was, 10 sets of push ups to muscle failure with or without cooling.[1:19:15] Andrew Huberman: Same regimen, 3 minutes of of cooling in between sets of push ups?[1:19:18] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. Some of those young ladies reached over 800 push ups.[1:19:25] Andrew Huberman: Now the total duration of the workout could be getting much longer as a consequence of doing more work.[1:19:29] Dr. Craig Heller: No. It doesn't take you longer. Well, minor. I mean, a push up is pretty fast.[1:19:34] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Pretty fast.[1:19:35] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. So You do 10 sets the maximum, in 45 minutes total. That's a lot[1:19:40] Andrew Huberman: that's a lot of push ups. That's a[1:19:42] Dr. Craig Heller: lot of push ups. Yep. And so the interesting thing is they came in one day, and they said, doctor Heller, you cost us a lot of money. Why? Well, we had a formal dance this weekend.[1:19:51] Dr. Craig Heller: We all had to buy new sleeveless Dress[1:19:53] Andrew Huberman: is nice. It's a good problem to have. Good problem to have. Let's talk about steroids, anabolic steroids. We're heading into an Olympics.[1:20:04] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Every time the Olympics rolls around, we hear about these cases of people getting popped as they call it or caught for anabolic steroids. There are some accusations out there now. There'll be more. They'll this will get, you know, handled in the press and then the various organizations.[1:20:22] Andrew Huberman: Clearly, Athletes and nonathletes use anabolic steroids. And, typically, anabolic steroids are of the testosterone variety. There are derivatives, etcetera, And those derivatives do different things, and the anabolic versus androgenic, etcetera. But, typically, the idea is, at least as I understand it, In talking to some of these individuals, is that they allow people to train more because they recover faster. They are able to synthesize more protein because they're basically getting a second puberty.[1:20:55] Andrew Huberman: Because as we all know during puberty, there's a lot of growth of the body. And, of course, there are a lot of negative effects of abuse of these things, and they are banned from from various sports organizations. Especially, I should mention in combat sports, it's is especially concerning because in combat sports, a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody more than you would be able to otherwise as opposed to in other sorts of sports. Just to conceptualize it. And, and I'm not taking a moral stance on any of this.[1:21:25] Andrew Huberman: I just wanna Ask you, when you compare palmar cooling to anabolic steroids in terms of Gym performance. What do[1:21:37] Dr. Craig Heller: you see? Well, we do not do research on steroids, but there is a lot of research in the literature. A lot of that research in the strength conditioning Magazines is not very scientific. No. Okay?[1:21:56] Dr. Craig Heller: But Or[1:21:56] Andrew Huberman: it might not even be scientific at all.[1:21:58] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. Right. But we did do an analysis of reputable papers. And we did find, I think it was probably 8 or 9, 10 studies On bench press, increase in bench press performance on steroids or not. Okay?[1:22:16] Dr. Craig Heller: The bottom males or females? Well well, these were all males. Mhmm. But I'll get back to the females. Okay?[1:22:23] Dr. Craig Heller: The bottom line is that in all of these independent studies, Their rate of improvement was approximately 1% per week.[1:22:34] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:22:34] Dr. Craig Heller: Okay. Now I've just told you About studies in which we've had 300% increase in a month. So[1:22:46] Andrew Huberman: It's an enormous Yeah. Enormous difference.[1:22:49] Dr. Craig Heller: So so why would you endanger your health as well as your legal ability to compete with such an ineffective tool.[1:22:57] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Yep. No. I I think it's the the notion of performance enhancement Is is a really interesting one because people clearly pay attention to nutrition. Sleep is now something that I think everybody, but especially athletes are paying attention to.[1:23:12] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:23:14] Andrew Huberman: And I predict that temperature will be one of the more, powerful, parameters that people are going to be focusing on. Yeah. Because because of the magnitude of the effects that you're describing, and and also because So much of the variability around performance, as you mentioned, has to do with when you go to a new environment. You know, everyone Has their home environment worked out pretty well? Sleep well in your own bed at home.[1:23:40] Andrew Huberman: You when you can control everything, your performance is always great. This is why I think military operators are particularly interesting group because their whole world is centered around Elite and high performance at with very high risk, high consequence under variable conditions. The essence of their work is variable unpredictable conditions. So, you mentioned female athletes and steroids. I'm curious about this.[1:24:06] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. Because everybody has always said to us, well, you only use male subjects, and, obviously, they have this testosterone background. You know? They have higher levels of testosterone. That's why you get these results.[1:24:18] Dr. Craig Heller: So we did a comparative study on females. We get the same results.[1:24:22] Andrew Huberman: Impressive. And these are are Stanford athletes or also[1:24:26] Dr. Craig Heller: These were not Stanford. They were Stanford students But not athletes. Well, we we have done, of course, work on some athletes, but in general, we don't do research on Our teams, our varsity teams, they have their own protocols. They have their own training programs.[1:24:42] Andrew Huberman: They don't like us to get too close[1:24:43] Dr. Craig Heller: to that. They They don't know.[1:24:44] Andrew Huberman: Work with some of these folks and the coaches, and they are very skeptical with good reason. Also and the reason I ask is that, I when you see these, Pac 10 or or division 1 college athletes, and then you see their peers have it. There's there's clearly a, a difference. Right? I mean, they they are Pedigree that throughout.[1:25:04] Andrew Huberman: Right? And more typical folks, also have different goals. Yeah. They may not want to get Infinitely stronger Mhmm. Or or perform more endurance work.[1:25:14] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So I wanna ask you a couple things about Shivering and metabolism. Mhmm. Because I think they're very interesting and, sufficiently related. So My understanding is that shiver is an adaptation that's designed to heat us up.[1:25:31] Andrew Huberman: Yes. That we have brown fat That's in compartments around our body that are activated by shiver or co activated by shiver. And That shivering is useful for increasing metabolism. Is that true? And does it require that cold be the stimulus?[1:25:51] Andrew Huberman: So 2 2 scenarios. I'll give you an experiment. I put someone into cold water of some sort, and then I make them get out or I have them stand near it, and then they start shivering. My understanding is that their their metabolism will increase. What if I take someone and I just have them shiver, they're not exposed by cold.[1:26:08] Andrew Huberman: It's kind of a deliberate shivering. Will that also create a substantial increase in metabolism?[1:26:14] Dr. Craig Heller: Sure. So deliberate shivering without cold is essentially what happens when you get a fever. Your set point goes up in your hypothalamus, And you actually even though your normal body temperature, your thermostat is telling you you're too cold. Increase your metabolism, so shiver. Right?[1:26:34] Dr. Craig Heller: So, sure, shivering is, is a good way of increasing metabolism, but it only can take metabolism up maybe 3 or 4 times resting.[1:26:44] Andrew Huberman: Okay. This is like[1:26:44] Dr. Craig Heller: This exercise can take you up 10 times.[1:26:48] Andrew Huberman: Got it. All right. I'm gonna ask a couple of more random questions, and, Seemingly random. Do bears actually hibernate? Oh, yeah.[1:26:56] Andrew Huberman: The true hibernation?[1:26:58] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, it depends on how you define true. A bear. Actually, we've done a lot of work on bears. We we've[1:27:06] Andrew Huberman: Do you also put the nose thermocouple down in the esophagus?[1:27:09] Dr. Craig Heller: Oh, we implant surgically.[1:27:10] Andrew Huberman: Okay. They're anesthetized when you implant them? Yes. What kind of bears are these?[1:27:14] Dr. Craig Heller: Black bears. Okay. And did this with colleagues at University of Sky, and we're analyzing the data now. But what we've done is we've, we've had now a total of 18 bears, and we implant them with EEG, EKG, temperature sensors, and sometimes we actually measure their oxygen consumption.[1:27:31] Andrew Huberman: These are bears in the wild.[1:27:33] Dr. Craig Heller: These are bears in the wild, but they're brought in, to University of Alaska go where we keep them in an outdoor enclosure, so they're hibernating in a nest box in a enclosure, and we're recording this electrophysiological data continuously for months. Amazing.[1:27:47] Andrew Huberman: How do I get on this protocol? Can I Craig and I are doing some work together going forward, and, maybe you could Slide me onto this protocol too? It sounds amazing.[1:27:57] Dr. Craig Heller: Right now, it's a matter of just analyzing the gigabytes, terabytes of data that have been collected. So but, anyway, you asked about hibernation. So, bears only go down to about 33, 34 degrees centigrade in core temperature. And that's been argued that, well, they can't go lower because they have so much insulation. They're so big.[1:28:19] Dr. Craig Heller: Their surface volume ratio and so forth, and that's not true. They shiver. So if if we have a day like minus 40, which you get up in in Alaska, they will go through periods of shivering, and maintain a core temperature on 33, 34. Now the ground squirrels and the marmots, which are small smaller animals, they will drop down to a body temperature, maybe within a degree of the environment. So they can go down to 1 or 2 degrees centigrade Just above freezing, during bouts of hibernation.[1:28:54] Dr. Craig Heller: So they'll stay in hibernation for 7 or 8 days, and they'll come back up to normal Body temperature for a day, then they'll go back down into another job.[1:29:01] Andrew Huberman: That day when they're warming up again? Do they warm up?[1:29:03] Dr. Craig Heller: Rearrange their nests, eat, if they've stored food. Some species Store lots of food. Others just depend on their fat.[1:29:11] Andrew Huberman: A former mentor of mine, my my master's degree mentor, and A colleague and friend of yours, Irving Zucker at UC Berkeley Mhmm. Told me a story once. Told me a lot of stories. He tells great stories as you know. He told me that when an animal comes out of hibernation periodically, that it's a very dramatic thing to observe.[1:29:31] Andrew Huberman: That it's not like they wake up and yawn and look around, but it's like a like a complete epileptic seizure.[1:29:37] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:29:38] Andrew Huberman: What what's going on?[1:29:39] Dr. Craig Heller: Shivering.[1:29:40] Andrew Huberman: It's just a very traumatic shiver.[1:29:42] Dr. Craig Heller: So at the low temperatures, they cannot shiver because the effect of temperature on the conduction of the of the nerves and the muscle fibers.[1:29:50] Andrew Huberman: So they're shut down, basically?[1:29:52] Dr. Craig Heller: They're shut down. So there, they use brown fat. So activate brown fat. And then when they get up To a temperature of maybe 15, 16 degrees centigrade, then the shivering starts, and it gets very, very violent, but they're still asleep. Do we shiver in our sleep?[1:30:09] Dr. Craig Heller: I would imagine we do, but[1:30:10] Andrew Huberman: it probably wakes us up. Interesting. So the brown fat is kind of like kindling.[1:30:16] Dr. Craig Heller: The brown fat is, a tissue which has lots of stored energy because it's fat. But unlike our white fat, our regular fat, it also has lots of these little powerhouses, mitochondria, and lots of blood supply. So, essentially, it is a tissue just to produce heat. That's what it's there for. Now in these hibernators, There are big patches of brown fat at certain locations that are critical, like around the heart, for example.[1:30:46] Dr. Craig Heller: For us, the brown fat is sort of distributed. So for many, many years, it was thought humans don't have brown fat, but indeed we do. It's just not localized into discrete fat Pads like it is in, ground squirrels, marmots.[1:31:02] Andrew Huberman: I don't know why the the phrase fat pads is so satisfying to say, but it is fat pads. Speaking of fat pads, I was taught that we have by the Internet, I should say. I was taught by the Internet That we have brown fat between our scapulae and our upper neck, is is that truly a source of brown enrichment for brown fat if you're a ground squirrel? So it's complete this is all the drawings out there. Okay.[1:31:29] Andrew Huberman: So what I'm what I'm hearing you say is that brown fat is actually distributed in patches.[1:31:33] Dr. Craig Heller: In humans, it's distributed, Along with other, fat tissue. It's it's not as discreet.[1:31:41] Andrew Huberman: So the reason I'm I'm kinda shocked and amused and, troubled by this is because there is a somewhat standard protocol in the Performance wellness, whatever, world, whatever you wanna call it of putting ice packs on the upper back as a way to stimulate brown fat Thermogenesis. I'm I'm hearing some some, inhales of concern from from the physiologist. So tell me why It sounds like that's probably not the best way to stimulate brown fat activation.[1:32:15] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, let's put it this way.[1:32:17] Andrew Huberman: You're not attacking anyone specifically because the whole world believes this. So it doesn't[1:32:21] Dr. Craig Heller: But but it may not be totally, facetious or false. Think of what that's doing. If you put ice Right there where your spinal cord is close to the surface, that's where you're gonna hit the vertebral arteries. So you're essentially putting a cold source into the brain to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus says you're too, cold, so it is going to turn on shivering and brown So[1:32:49] Andrew Huberman: would there be a better site for sake of activating brown fat?[1:32:56] Dr. Craig Heller: Palmer cooling. You know, I I can't say because the activation of brown fat is a sympathetic Nervous system response. So any lowering of core temperature that will let the thermostat, Say you're too cold is going to turn on sympathetic. Now people will have perhaps different amounts of brown fat. So, newborn have more brown fat than adults.[1:33:25] Andrew Huberman: And probably newborns can't shiver. Correct? I[1:33:27] Dr. Craig Heller: don't know. Okay.[1:33:29] Andrew Huberman: That's what I read. I don't know if it's true. I don't know. I I I read that in what I believe to be credible sources.[1:33:34] Dr. Craig Heller: But Yeah. It could be. I I I just don't know. It depends on If it's really newborn, I can agree because you don't have all of the, motor pathways connected up yet. Right.[1:33:46] Dr. Craig Heller: That's something that occurs in early, days of life is probably one of the functions of REM sleep, which infants have a lot of. Right? Okay? But How to activate brown fat? If you are consistently exposed to cold, so if you live in the Arctic and you go out jogging in the winter, maybe that will increase the amount of brown fat you have.[1:34:11] Dr. Craig Heller: If you live in the tropics, Maybe you have less I don't know. I don't know of any studies which have looked into that.[1:34:17] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Ice headache. Sometimes I'll drink a cold beverage or I'll, eat ice cream, and my head will Brain freeze. Splitting it. Brain freeze.[1:34:27] Andrew Huberman: And speaking of special forces, I Starting to, you know, we all see the images of the seals seal training slash, screening in Coronado where they're going in and out of the Pacific which is very cold. But, I know they also spend some time in the very cold waters of Kodiak, Alaska. You mentioned Alaska.[1:34:45] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah.[1:34:46] Andrew Huberman: Brain freeze, So called ice headache is, a common occurrence there, in those situations. But we all have experienced that's why you eat ice cream. You get that brain freeze. I can feel it right now a little bit subjectively. I can induce it.[1:35:02] Andrew Huberman: What's going on there? And, would always just rub my tongue on the roof of my mouth. Is there something that I'm doing that's, functional there just to try and alleviate it?[1:35:11] Dr. Craig Heller: Good question. The thing is that The roof of your mouth is very close to your hypothalamus. So if indeed it's a popsicle that's giving you the brain freeze, it may be, direct cooling effect from the roof of your mouth. You put your tongue there. You're insulating the roof of your mouth.[1:35:28] Dr. Craig Heller: I don't know. I'm guessing.[1:35:30] Andrew Huberman: But what's it but the sore what's the source of the brain freeze? Is it a vasoconstriction?[1:35:34] Dr. Craig Heller: It it's a it's it's a vasomotor change. Whether it's constriction, I think it's more likely a vaso an increase in blood pressure, which will essentially cause an expansion of the arteries and, activate pain receptors. We don't have pain receptors in the neural tissue, in the brain. We have them in the meninges and predominantly associated with the the blood vessels, the walls of the blood vessels. So if you have something which will dramatically increase, your blood pressure going to the brain, you're likely to get a we've had some preliminary data.[1:36:11] Dr. Craig Heller: I even hate to mention this because we have not been able to pursue it systematically, but we've had some experience with people with migraine that say if they use one of our devices to heat that the migraine goes away.[1:36:28] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:36:29] Dr. Craig Heller: And I don't know.[1:36:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The idea It's a very a lot of people suffer from migraine. I know there are a lot of different types of migraine.[1:36:36] Dr. Craig Heller: Right.[1:36:37] Andrew Huberman: Been reading a lot about this Lately, because I get so many questions about migraine. But I hate to say anything Sure. And and we'll just underscore this as preliminary. And people are have been great about, Understanding that when we say preliminary, we mean has not passed through the the, required filters to call it, Hard hard fact? Yeah.[1:36:57] Dr. Craig Heller: But We don't we don't even have a decent dataset. Right. It's just this these are anecdotal reports.[1:37:02] Andrew Huberman: Anecdata as we like to but I don't even like to call it that because then if you we don't wanna give it more weight than it deserves, but that's interesting. The ice headache and the increase in blood Pressure is interesting because the only thing that I've heard is similar to it is something that, comes from you know, they have these competitions where people eat these Very hot chili peppers. You know, it's kind of[1:37:23] Dr. Craig Heller: a Yeah.[1:37:24] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Yeah. An ego thing, I guess, for reasons that that escaped me that Eating really hot peppers. And every once in a while, someone will eat one of these and get what's called thunderclap headache, where a headache comes on extremely quickly. And so quickly that it's caused so severe rather that it's been known to cause stroke and brain damage.[1:37:44] Andrew Huberman: So these very, very, very hot peppers, if you're not acclimated to them, and maybe even if you are, have been shown to to cause actually cause brain damage. Yeah. Some good evidence for this. I do wanna talk about, something that we were have not touched on yet, Which is NEAT, non exercise induced thermogenesis. Right?[1:38:07] Andrew Huberman: The, so non activity associated thermogenesis. And the fidgeters. Right? So the the classic work of, like, Rothwell and Stock, and the idea that some people who Overeat are burning off that energy by way of shaking their knee or moving around a lot. These are the kinda nerve they quote, you know, quote, unquote, nervous types.[1:38:28] Andrew Huberman: But, they quoted in those studies, huge degree of caloric burn. You know, 800, 25 100 calories per day burned above Those who sit rather still. Does that seem far fetched? Those are older data, but any any comment on meat or non exercise induced, Thermogenesis?[1:38:48] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, I do think it's pretty straightforward that if you increase muscle activity of any kind, you're increasing your energy consumption and your heat production. And, no, the the really extreme example is hyper and hypothyroidism. People that are hyperthyroid are Fidgety, and, you know, they have a very metabolic rate, and they're hot.[1:39:09] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:39:09] Dr. Craig Heller: And people that are hypothermic are cool. They're Not they don't move very much. So any kind of muscle activity increases. And when you say, you know, it's not much activity, but remember, it's only 20% effective. 80% of the energy is going to heat.[1:39:27] Dr. Craig Heller: So it may not exert much energy to tap your foot, but Four times the amount of energy that is going into the movement is being lost[1:39:38] Andrew Huberman: as heat. That's very interesting. A couple more quick questions. There's a lot of excitement these days or at least usage these days of so called energy drinks pre workout drinks. Mhmm.[1:39:50] Andrew Huberman: Many of these contain thermogenic compounds. So caffeine, things there's a, Culture now of taking, arginine, things that support arginine. So, you know, beet juice and, L Citrulline, things to dilate the blood vessels. Sometimes this is for sake of of increasing blood flow to the muscles during resistance exercise, but a lot of these are thermogenic. Is to increase body temperature.[1:40:16] Andrew Huberman: And are some is it possible that some of these energy drinks are actually, or similar, you know, 6 espresso or whatever it is, are acting to prevent optimal performance or reduce performance.[1:40:29] Dr. Craig Heller: I don't think that the The temperature rise is that I really don't know. But what it does is it makes you more jittery, and you're going to increase that neat that you were talking about. Dior, it's another thing, and that is that, when you're exercising your muscle and it becomes slightly, the, hypoxic. I mean, it's the oxygen supply is is is not enough. The muscle releases adenosine, And what adenosine does in the muscle is cause the blood vessels to open up, to dilate.[1:41:05] Dr. Craig Heller: Mhmm. So It's a way of increasing the blood flow to the muscle and, therefore, the oxygen supply to the muscle.[1:41:11] Andrew Huberman: So And caffeine in is an essentially an adenosine antagonist.[1:41:14] Dr. Craig Heller: Adenosine antagonist.[1:41:16] Andrew Huberman: So and so if the under the strict logic, ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release, and we're will reduce oxygen utilization of the muscle. Right. So that would lead me to believe that motivational support aside, That caffeine will hinder muscular performance.[1:41:37] Dr. Craig Heller: I would think so, but I I can't give you an authoritative Answer on that.[1:41:43] Andrew Huberman: Okay. We're just we're just, going through the Yeah. The logic and the gymnastics around that. I think it's a fascinating area that that deserves attention because, the question of what one can ingest in order to perform better.[1:41:57] Dr. Craig Heller: Mhmm.[1:41:58] Andrew Huberman: Say nothing of, you know, hormone augmentation, but, has often leads back to stimulants. Yep. And if those stimulants, Most of which include caffeine of some sort are inhibiting the adenosine system, and the adenosine system is supporting the oxygenation of muscle, then I would imagine that avoiding them might be the better option.[1:42:21] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. I just I'm not aware of of of data that would So this is a general phenomenon of adenosine and, and blood flow. It has, of course, a different effect in the brain. Adenosine causes sleep, so caffeine keeps you awake. Mhmm.[1:42:38] Dr. Craig Heller: And if you stay awake, you're going to have a higher metabolic rate than if you, Go to sleep. So and the thing is you say, you know, energy drinks. The question is, you know, what really is It is in them.[1:42:52] Andrew Huberman: It's usually a cocktail of things. I don't take these. I don't like them at all, but they're usually a combination of vasodilators, Caffeine, some sort of stimulant.[1:43:01] Dr. Craig Heller: Source of glucose, usually.[1:43:02] Andrew Huberman: Sometimes a source of glucose and sometimes not. And oftentimes, there are There are vasodilators, and there are compounds that are thought to be so called nootropics, Smart drugs that basically increase Acetylcholine or Norepinephrine transmission. You know, in the in the eighties nineties, the beta 3 agonists like Climebuterol were very popular, but they were all banned. Mhmm. So those are all banned from from, Although people use them recreationally, which I do not recommend, there were actually a number of deaths due to dehydration, overheating, as well as cardiac effects.[1:43:42] Andrew Huberman: Before we wrap up, I I know you've done a ton of work on sleep. I think we're gonna have to do another episode about Your work on sleep because it your the amount of data that you produce there is vast, actually. So I first got to know you and your work, related to sleep and temperature. We all hear nowadays that it's good to keep the room that you sleep in cool, keep it dark. I've talked a number of times on podcast episodes About, the role of light and shifting its circadian rhythms, I have 2 questions related to sleep.[1:44:15] Andrew Huberman: 1 is, are there any things that may or may not relate to temperature, but that you think are very useful for getting better sleep that You don't hear that much about, that people might wanna consider or try. Realizing that there are a lot of reasons why people don't sleep great. But What are some things that you don't hear that much about these days that you wish people knew?[1:44:43] Dr. Craig Heller: Well, the sleep medicine community now puts A lot more emphasis on cognitive behavioral therapy than on pharmacology. So what Cognitive behavioral therapy does is it essentially increases your sleep hygiene. So there are certain just General rules. So have a regular bedtime and a regular arousal time. Don't be skipping back and forth all the time.[1:45:08] Andrew Huberman: Arousal, you mean wake up time?[1:45:10] Dr. Craig Heller: Wake up time. Yeah.[1:45:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Spoken like a true physiology. Right.[1:45:15] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. Another thing is Don't use screens, within a couple hours of bedtime because screens are predominantly rich in blue light. And what that does is you mentioned the circadian system. That affects your circadian system that pushes off your stimulus for sleep. Okay?[1:45:37] Dr. Craig Heller: Another thing is, of course, relax. I mean, don't work right up till the time you're going to bed. Take some time to do something relaxing. And then temperature, you you've mentioned that. And For many people, a warm bath, you know, is is really conducive to to to good sleep, and people are now swearing by a cooler environment for sleep.[1:46:02] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[1:46:02] Dr. Craig Heller: And that makes sense in terms of the circadian effect on body temperature. So our circadian clock is affecting our thermostat. So at the time we go to bed, our thermostat is on its way down to a lower set point. Yeah. So what happens?[1:46:20] Dr. Craig Heller: You go to bed, and you're feeling a little bit cool, so you pile on lots of blankets. And then what happens is you wake up a little bit later, and you're hot, so you throw them off. It's because your thermostat has set downward. Now why is it better to have a cool environment? It's better to have a cool environment because it's easier to thermoregulate.[1:46:42] Dr. Craig Heller: So you go to Europe in the summertime, and the hotel rooms still have these big comforters, these down comforters. So how do you deal with that? You stick out your hands and your legs. Mhmm.[1:46:54] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I've always slept with I have 1 leg that just kinda hang hangs out of the yeah.[1:47:00] Dr. Craig Heller: But that's they're your heat loss surfaces. Right? So if you're in a cool environment, you can take advantage of that. You can take advantage by passively Regulating your body temperature. You don't have to get up and wake up and say, oh my god.[1:47:14] Dr. Craig Heller: I gotta change the covers or blankets or what have you. If you're in a warm environment, what can you do?[1:47:20] Andrew Huberman: You need to sleep with 1 hand in the cool mitt. Right. Right? And right now, that's not available yet.[1:47:25] Dr. Craig Heller: Right. So It's not available.[1:47:26] Andrew Huberman: I've never I've never heard about it that way. I've always heard you wanna sleep in a cool room or keep the room cold.[1:47:32] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah.[1:47:33] Andrew Huberman: But I never realized why that's useful, which is as you're You're saying that then you can move your these glabrous surfaces in and out. You could even sometimes you wake up under the blanket completely. Face. Yeah. Very, very interesting.[1:47:47] Andrew Huberman: That finally, a rational science grounded explanation for why we need to sleep in a cool room. Because I always thought, well, temperature is going down anyway Uh-huh. Why do you have to sleep in a cool room? What about wearing socks while you sleep? That was big a few years ago where they said, you know, you should put socks On now, I would think that's probably the wrong advice.[1:48:05] Andrew Huberman: You probably just Well,[1:48:06] Dr. Craig Heller: I don't know if it's wrong advice. There's an old, old study, That was supported by, I think, Eddie Bauer, the the sleeping bag company. And What the study showed what the study was asking is where what are the most temperature sensitive spots in the body? Where do you feel cold? And what that showed was it was the toes.[1:48:28] Andrew Huberman: So Makes sense. So when you sample water with your toe, you always see that.[1:48:33] Dr. Craig Heller: So so the the socks essentially are Promoting thermal comfort by insulating that area that's quite sensitive. Now, of course, if it's too warm, you're not gonna put socks on.[1:48:43] Andrew Huberman: Right. Well, Craig, thank you so much. You gave so much information that's actionable and interesting. I know A lot of people are gonna be really interested in the Palmer cooling technology, like from Coolmit. We will be sure to provide resources to the website, so that people can register interest.[1:49:02] Andrew Huberman: I do encourage people to play around with, so to speak, the, the palmer cooling, technology that we all have, which are Yep. You know, these Glabrous surfaces. And, also just wanna thank you for taking time out of your Busy schedule to share this information.[1:49:20] Dr. Craig Heller: Yeah. It was fun. It was lots of fun.[1:49:22] Andrew Huberman: I certainly learned a lot, and I know a lot of people are going to learn a lot That's useful to them.[1:49:27] Dr. Craig Heller: Good questions.[1:49:28] Andrew Huberman: Well, fabulous answers.

On Instagram, I do short neuroscience tutorials that are separate from the tutorials that I tend to do on the podcast. Often on this podcast, we discuss Supplements. One of the really important things if you're going to take supplements is that the supplements be of the highest quality ingredients and That the amount of those ingredients that's listed on the label actually matches what is in those supplements.[1:50:50] Andrew Huberman: We partner with Thorne, t h o r n e, because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency in terms of quality and how much of each supplement they put in their products. If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorn, thorne.com/theletteru/huberman. And there, you can see what I take. You can get 20% off any of those supplements if you enter the Thorne site through that portal. And even if you navigate to other products and other product pages within the Thorne site, you can Still get that 20% off.[1:51:20] Andrew Huberman: So it's thorn, thorne.com/theletteru/huberman. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
