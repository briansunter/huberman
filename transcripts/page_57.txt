I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Jack Feldman. Doctor Jack Feldman is a distinguished professor of neurobiology at the University of California Los Angeles. He is known for his pioneering work On the neuroscience of breathing.[0:00:26] Andrew Huberman: We are all familiar with breathing and how essential breathing is to life. We require and it is only by breathing that we can bring oxygen to all the cells of our brain and body. However, as the work from doctor Feldman and colleagues tells us breathing is also fundamental to organ health and function at enormous number of other levels. In fact, how we breathe, including how often we breathe, the depth of our breathing, and the ratio of inhales to exhales actually predicts how focused we are, how Easily we get into sleep, how easily we can exit from sleep. Doctor Feldman gets credit for the discovery of the 2 major brain centers that control The different patterns of breathing.[0:01:09] Andrew Huberman: Today, you'll learn about those brain centers and the patterns of breathing they control and how those different patterns of breathing influence All aspects of your mental and physical life. What's especially wonderful about doctor Feldman and his work is that it not only points to the critical role of respiration in disease, in health, and in daily life, but he's also a practitioner. He understands how to leverage particular aspects of the breathing process In order to bias the brain to be in particular states that can benefit us all. Whether or not you are a person who already Practice his breath work or whether or not you're somebody who simply breathes to stay alive, by the end of today's discussion, you're going to understand And a tremendous amount about how the breathing system works and how you can leverage that breathing system toward particular goals in your life. Doctor Feldman shares with us his own particular breathing protocols that he uses, and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration in ways that can allow you, for instance, to be more focused for work, to disengage from work in high stress endeavors, to calm down quickly.[0:02:11] Andrew Huberman: And indeed, he explains not only how to do that, but all the underlying science in ways that will allow you to customize your own protocols for your needs. All the guests that we bring on the Huberman Lab Podcast are considered at the very top of their fields. Today's guest, doctor Feldman, is not only at the top of his field, he founded the field. Prior to his coming into neuroscience from the field of physics, there really wasn't much information about how the brain controls breathing. Was a little bit of information, but we can really credit doctor Feldman and his laboratory for identifying the particular brain areas that control different patterns of breathing and how that information can be leveraged towards health, high performance, and for combating disease.[0:02:51] Andrew Huberman: So today's conversation, you're going to learn a tremendous amount From the top researcher in this field, it's a really wonderful and special opportunity to be able to share his knowledge with you. And I know that you're not only going to enjoy it, but you are going to learn Tremendous amount. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort To bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.[0:03:20] Andrew Huberman: Our 1st sponsor is Thesis. Thesis is a company that makes nootropics. Now I've talked before on the podcast and elsewhere about the fact that I don't really like the term nootropics, Which means smart drugs because smart means many different things in many different contexts. You've got creativity. You've got focus.[0:03:37] Andrew Huberman: You've got Task switching. So the idea that there will be 1 pill or 1 formula that could make us smarter and better at all those things at once just doesn't stand up to logic. In fact, different chemicals and different brain systems underlie our ability to be creative or our ability to task switch or to be focused. And that's the basis of Thesis. Thesis is a company that makes targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.[0:04:00] Andrew Huberman: In other words, specific nootropics to get your brain into Dates that are ideal for what you're trying to accomplish. Thesis uses very high quality ingredients, many of which I've talked about before on the podcast such is DHA, ginkgo biloba, and phosphatidylserine. I talked about those in the ADHD podcast. Those are some of the ingredients in their so called logic formula. There's a lot of research showing that ginkgo biloba can be very helpful for increasing levels of focus and even for people with ADHD.[0:04:26] Andrew Huberman: However, I can't take it. When I take it, I get really bad headaches, and I know some people who do and some people who don't get headaches when they take Ginkgo Biloba. This is a great example of why nootropics need to be personalized to the individual. Thesis gives you the ability to try different blends over the course of a month discover which nootropic formulas work best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and which ones are best for particular circumstances. So they have a formulation, for instance, which is motivation.[0:04:53] Andrew Huberman: They have another formulation, which is clarity. They've got another formulation, which is logic. And each of these is formulated specifically to you and formulated to a specific endpoint or goal state of mind for your particular work. So as a consequence, the formulations that you arrive at will have A very high probability of giving you the results that you want. In addition to that detailed level of personalization, Thesis takes a step further by offering free consultations with a brain coach to help you optimize your experience and dial in your favorite and best formulas.[0:05:25] Andrew Huberman: I've been using Thesis for close to 6 months now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a total game changer for me. My favorite of the formulations is their motivation formula that they've tailored to me. When I use that formula, I have very clear state of mind, I have even energy, and I use that early in the day until the early afternoon to get the bulk of my most important work done. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, you can go online to take thesis.com/huberman. Take a 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you different formulas to try in your 1st month.[0:05:56] Andrew Huberman: That's takethesis.com/huberman and use the code huberman at checkout to get 10% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in 1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012, and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that it covers all of my vitamin, mineral, and probiotic foundational needs.[0:06:22] Andrew Huberman: There's now a wealth of data showing that not only do we need vitamins and minerals, but we also need to have a healthy gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is a set of nerve connections that link the microbiota, literally, microbacteria that live in our guts and that are healthy for us with our brain function, and our brain is also Talking to our gut in a bidirectional way. And that conversation is vital for metabolism, for the endocrine system, meaning the hormonal system, and for overall mood and cognition. There's just so much data now pointing to the fact that we need a healthy gut microbiome and a healthy brain gut axis as it's called. By taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day, I can get the vitamins, the minerals, and the probiotics needed for all those systems to function optimally.[0:07:05] Andrew Huberman: And, again, it tastes great. It's great for me. In fact, if people ask me what's the 1 supplement that I should take and they can only take 1 supplement, I recommend Athletic Greens for all the reasons I mentioned. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They're giving you Five free travel packs, which are these little travel packs to make it easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road or in the car or on the plane, etcetera, and a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:07:30] Andrew Huberman: There is also wealth of evidence showing that vitamin d three is vital to our overall health, and k two is important for cardiovascular health and other systems as well. Most of us are not getting enough vitamin d 3 or k two even if we're getting some sunshine. So, again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you get the 5 free travel packs, A year supply of vitamin d three k two. Athleggreens.com/huberman is where you go to claim that special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.[0:07:56] Andrew Huberman: Headspace is a meditation app that's supported by 25 published studies and benefits from over 600,005 star reviews. I've long been a believer in meditating. There is so much data now pointing to the fact that regular meditation leads to reduced stress levels, Heightened levels of focus, better task switching and cognitive ability, it just goes on and on. I mean, there are literally thousands of Peer reviewed studies now and quality journals pointing to the benefits of having a regular meditation practice. The problem with meditation is many people, including myself, have Struggled with sticking to that practice.[0:08:30] Andrew Huberman: With Headspace, it makes it very easy to start and continue a meditation protocol. The reason for that is they have meditations that are of different lengths and Different styles so you don't get bored of meditation. And even if you just have 5 minutes, there are 5 minute meditations. If you've got 20 minutes, which would be even better, there are 20 minute meditations. Ever since I started using Headspace, I've been consistent about my meditation.[0:08:51] Andrew Huberman: I do meditation anywhere from 5 to 7 times a week In my best weeks, and sometimes that drops to 3. And then I find with Headspace, I can quickly get back to doing meditation every day because of the huge variety of great meditations they have. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you can get a free 1 month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation. That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.[0:09:16] Andrew Huberman: So, again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer. One quick mention before we dive into the conversation with doctor Feldman. During today's episode, we discuss a lot of breathwork practices. And by the end of the episode, all those will be accessible to you. However, I'm aware that there are a number of people out there They wanna go even further into the science and practical tools of breath work.[0:09:36] Andrew Huberman: And for that reason, I wanna mention a resource to you. There is a cost associated with this resource, but it's a terrific platform for learning about breathwork practices and for building a number of different routines that you can do or that you could teach. It's called Our Breathwork Collective. I'm not associated with the Breathwork Collective, but doctor Feldman is an adviser to the group, And they offer daily live guided breathing sessions and an on demand library that you can practice anytime, free workshops on breath work, And these are really developed by experts in the field, including doctor Feldman. So as I mentioned, I'm not on their advisory board, but I do know them and their work, and it is of the utmost quality.[0:10:12] Andrew Huberman: Anyone wanting to learn or teach breath work could really benefit from this course, I believe. If you'd like to learn more, you can click on the link in the show notes or visit ourbreathcollective.com/ And now for my conversation with doctor Jack Feldman. Thanks for joining me today.[0:10:37] Dr. Jack Feldman: It's a pleasure to be here, Andrew. Yeah.[0:10:38] Andrew Huberman: It's been a long time coming. You're my go to source for all things respiration. I mean, I breathe on my own, but when I wanna understand how I breathe and how The brain and breathing interact. You're the person I call.[0:10:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, I'll do my best. As you know, there's a lot that we don't understand, which still keeps me employed and engaged, But, we do know a lot.[0:11:00] Andrew Huberman: Why don't we start off by just talking about what's involved in generating breath? And if you would, could you comment on some of the mechanisms for rhythmic breathing versus non rhythmic breathing?[0:11:16] Dr. Jack Feldman: Okay. So on the mechanical side, which is obvious to everyone, we, want to have air Flow in, inhale, and we need to have air flow out. And the reason we need to do this is because For body metabolism, we need oxygen. And when oxygen is utilized through the meta aerobic metabolic process, We produce carbon dioxide, and so we have to get rid of the carbon dioxide that we produce, in particular because the carbon dioxide affects the acid base balance of the blood, the pH and all living cells are very sensitive to what the pH value is. So your body is very interested in regulating that pH.[0:11:59] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we have to have enough oxygen for our normal metabolism, and we have to get rid of the c o two that we produce. So how do we generate this airflow? Well, the air comes into the lungs. We have to expand the lungs. And as the lungs expand, Basically, it's like a balloon that you would pull apart.[0:12:17] Dr. Jack Feldman: The pressure inside that balloon drops, and air will flow into the balloon. So we Expand pull a pressure on put pressure on the lung to pull it apart that lowers the pressure in the air sacs called alveoli, And air will flow in because pressure outside the body is higher than pressure inside the body when you're doing this expansion, when you're inhaling. What produces that? Well, the principal muscle is a is a diaphragm, which is sitting inside the body just below the lung. And when you wanna inhale, you basically contract the diaphragm, and it pulls it down.[0:12:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: And as it pulls it down, it's Inserting pressure forces on the lung, the lung wants to expand. At the same time, the rib cage is gonna rotate up and out and therefore expanding the gut cavity, the thoracic cavity. At the end of inspiration, Under normal conditions when you're aggressed, you just relax, and it's like pulling on a spring. You pull down a spring, and you let go and it relaxes. So you Inhale, and you exhale.[0:13:25] Dr. Jack Feldman: Inhale, relax, and exhale.[0:13:27] Andrew Huberman: So the exhale is passive?[0:13:29] Dr. Jack Feldman: At rest, it's passive. We'll get into, what happens when you need to increase, the amount of air you're bringing in because your ventilation your metabolism goes up like doing exercise? Now the muscles themselves, skeletal muscles, don't do anything unless the nervous system tells them to do something. And when the nervous system tells them to do something, they contract. So there are specialized neurons in the spinal cord And above the spinal cord, the region called the brain stem, which go to respiratory muscles, in particular for inspiration, the diaphragm and the External intercostal muscles in the rib cage, and they contract.[0:14:15] Dr. Jack Feldman: So these respiratory muscles, these inspiratory muscles Become active. And they become active for a period of time, then they become silent. And when they become silent, the muscles then relax back to their original resting level. Where does that activity in the these neurons that innovate the muscle, which are called motor neurons, where does that originate? Well, this was a question that's been banded around for 1000 of years.[0:14:47] Dr. Jack Feldman: And when I was a, beginning assistant professor, it was fairly high priority for me To try and figure that out because I wanted to understand where this rhythm of breathing was coming from, and you couldn't Nowhere it's coming from until you knew where it was coming from, and I I didn't phrase that properly. You couldn't understand how it was being done until you know where to look. So we did a lot of experiments, which I can go into detail, and finally found there was a region in the brain stem That's once again this region sort of above the spinal cord, which was critical for generating this rhythm. It's called the pre Botzinger complex, we could talk about how that was named. This small site, which contains in humans a few 1,000 neurons, It's located on either side and works in tandem.[0:15:42] Dr. Jack Feldman: And every breath Begins with neurons in this region beginning to be active, and those neurons then connect Ultimately, to these motor neurons going to the diaphragm and to the external intercostals, causing them to be active and causing this inspiratory effort. When the neurons in the pre Botoxia complex finish their burst of activity, Then inspiration stops, and then you begin to exhale because of this passive, Recall of the lung and rib cage.[0:16:20] Andrew Huberman: Could I, just briefly interrupt you to ask a few quick questions before, We move forward in this, very informative answer. And the the 2 questions are, Is there anything known about the activation of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles between the ribs As it relates to nose versus mouth breathing, or are they activated, in the equivalent Equivalent way regardless of whether or not someone is breathing through their nose or mouth.[0:16:53] Dr. Jack Feldman: I I don't think we fully have the answer to that. Clearly, there are differences between nasal and mouth breathing. At rest, the tendency is to do nasal breathing because the Air flows that are necessary for normal breathing are easily, managed by passing through the nasal cavities. However, when your ventilation needs to increase, like during exercise, you need to move more air. You do that through your mouth because The airways are much larger than, and therefore, you can move much more air.[0:17:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: But at the level of the intercostals and the diaphragm, their contraction, is not, is almost, agnostic to whether or not the nose and mouth[0:17:38] Andrew Huberman: are open. Okay. So there If I understand correctly, there's no reason to suspect that there are particular, perhaps even non overlapping sets of neurons in pre Botzinger Area of the brain stem that trigger nasal versus mouth inhales.[0:17:55] Dr. Jack Feldman: No. I would say that, there's It's not that the prebudsen complex is not concerned and cannot influence that, but it does not appear as if there's any, modulation of whether or not it's where the air is coming from, whether it's coming through your nasal passages or through your mouth. Right.[0:18:15] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. And then the other question I have is that these intercostal muscles between the ribs that move the the ribs up and out, if I understand correctly, and the diaphragm, are those skeletal, or as the Brits would say, skeletal, muscles or smooth muscles? What type of muscle, are we talking about here?[0:18:32] Dr. Jack Feldman: As As I said earlier, these are skeletal I didn't say there were skeletal muscles, but they're muscles that need neural input in order to move. You talked about smooth muscles. They're specialized muscles like we have in the gut and in the heart, and these are muscles that are capable of actually Contracting and relaxing on their own. So the heart beats, it doesn't need neural input in order to beat. It the neural inputs modulate the strength of it and the frequency, but they beat on their own.[0:19:05] Dr. Jack Feldman: The Skeletal muscles involved in breathing are need neural input. Now there are smooth muscles that have an influence on breathing, and these are muscles that aligning the the airways. And so the airways have smooth muscle, and when they become activated, the smooth muscle can contract or relax. And when they contract Propially is when you have problems breathing like an asthma. Asthma is a condition where you get inappropriate constriction of the smooth muscles of the airways.[0:19:40] Andrew Huberman: So there's no reason to think that in asthma that the pre Botzinger or these other neuronal centers in the brain that could that activate breathing that they are involved or causal for for things like asthma?[0:19:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: As of now, I would say the preponderance of evidence is that it's not involved, but we've not really fully investigated that.[0:19:59] Andrew Huberman: Thank you. Sorry to break your flow, but I was terribly interested in And knowing answers to those questions, and you provided them. So thank you.[0:20:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: Now remind me again where I was in my[0:20:11] Andrew Huberman: We were just landing in prebuttsinger, And, we will return to the naming of Prebutzinger because it's a wonderful and important story, really, that I think people should, be aware of. But, Yeah. Maybe you could, march us through the brain centers that you've discovered, and others have worked on as well That control breathing, pre Botzinger as well as, related structures.[0:20:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we when we discovered the pre Botzinger, we thought that It was the primary source of all rhythmic respiratory movements, both inspiration and expiration. The notion of a single source is like day or night. It's like they're all coming they all have the same origin that the Earth rotates day follows night, and we thought that the prebutzinger complex would be inhalation, exhalation. And then in a series of experiments we, did in the early part of 2000, we discovered that There seemed to be another region which was dominant in producing expiratory movements that is the exhalation. We had made a fundamental mistake through sin with the discovery that pre Budsinger Not taking into account that at rest, expiratory muscle activity or exhalation is passive.[0:21:41] Dr. Jack Feldman: So if that's the case, a group of neurons that might generate active exploration, that is to contract the Muscles like the abdominal muscles or the internal intercostals are just silent. We just thought it wasn't there. It was coming from 1 place. But we got evidence that, in fact, it may have been coming from another place. And following up on these experiments, we discovered that there was a second oscillator, And that oscillator is involved in generating what we call active exploration.[0:22:14] Dr. Jack Feldman: That is this active Like, if I go. Yeah. Or when you begin to exercise, you have to go and actually move that air out. This group of cells, Which is silent at rest suddenly becomes active to drive those muscles, and it appears that it's an independent oscillator. When, maybe you could[0:22:36] Andrew Huberman: just clarify for people what an oscillator is.[0:22:39] Dr. Jack Feldman: Okay. An an oscillator is something that goes in a cycle. So you can have a pendulum as an oscillator going back and forth. The earth is an oscillator because it goes around, and it's day and night. Some people's moods[0:22:51] Andrew Huberman: are oscillating.[0:22:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: Oscillating. And it depends how regular they are. You can have oscillators that are highly regular that are in a watch, or you can have those that are Sporadic or episodic. Breathing is one of those oscillators that for life has to be working continuously 247. It starts in the late in 3rd trimester because it has to be working when you're born and basically works throughout life.[0:23:19] Dr. Jack Feldman: And if it stops, If there's no intervention beyond a few minutes, it will likely be fatal.[0:23:25] Andrew Huberman: What is this second oscillator called?[0:23:28] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, We found that, in a region around the facial nucleus. So we initially, when this region was initially identified, it we thought it was involved in sensing carbon dioxide. It was we call essential chemoreceptor. That is, we wanna keep carbon dioxide levels, particularly in the brain, at a relatively stable level because the brain is extraordinarily sensitive to changes in pH. If there's a big shift in carbon dioxide, there'll be a big shift in brain pH, And that'll throw your brain, if I can use the technical term, out of whack.[0:24:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: Mhmm. And so you wanna like that. And the way to regulate something in the brain is you have a sensor in the brain. And, others Basically, identified that the ventral surface of the brain stem, that is the part of the brain stem that's on this side, Was critical for that, and then we identified a structure that we, Was near the trapezoid nucleus. It was not named in any of these neuroanatomical atlases.[0:24:39] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we just picked the name out of the hat, and we Called it the retro trapezoid nucleus.[0:24:44] Andrew Huberman: I should clarify for people when we, when, Jack is saying trapezoid, it doesn't mean the trapezoid muscles. Trapezoid refers to the shape, of this nucleus, this cluster of neurons. Parafacial makes me think that this general area is involved in something related to Mouth or face? Is it an area rich with, neurons controlling other parts of the face? Eye blinks, nose twitches, Lip curls, lip smacks.[0:25:12] Dr. Jack Feldman: If you go back in an evolutionary sense, and a lot of things that are hard to figure out Begin to make sense when you look at the evolution of the nervous system, when, control of facial muscles, Going back to more primitive creatures because they had to take things in their mouth for eating. So they we call that the And the face sort of developed. The eyes were there. The mouth is there. These nuclei, the motor that contained the motor neurons, A lot of the control systems for them developed in the immediate vicinity.[0:25:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: So if you think about the face, there's a lot of subnuclei around They are that had various roles at various different times in evolution. And at one point in evolution, the Facial muscles were probably very important in moving fluid in and out of the mouth and moving air in and out of the mouth. And so Part of that of these many different subnuclei now seems to be in mammals to be involved in the control of expiratory muscles. But we have to remember that mammals are very special when it comes to breathing because we're the only class of vertebrates that have a diaphragm. If you look at amphibians and reptiles, they don't have a diaphragm, and the way they breathe It's not by actively inspiring and passively expiring.[0:26:41] Dr. Jack Feldman: They breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring because they don't have a powerful inspiratory muscle. And somewhere along the line, The diaphragm developed, and there are lots of theories about how it developed. I don't think it's particularly clear. There was a, something you can find in alligators and lizards that could have turned into a muscle. There was a die the diaphragm.[0:27:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: The Amazing thing about the diaphragm is that it's mechanically extremely efficient. And what do I mean by that? Well, if you If you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body into the bloodstream, the critical passage It's across the membrane in the lung. It's called the alveolar capillary membrane. The alveolus is part of the lung, And the blood runs through capillaries, which are these the smallest tubes in the circulatory system.[0:27:42] Dr. Jack Feldman: And at that point, oxygen Can go from the air filled alveolus into the blood. Which is amazing.[0:27:51] Andrew Huberman: I find that amazing. Even though it's just purely mechanical, the idea that we have these little sacks in our lungs, we inhale and the air goes in, and, literally, the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream.[0:28:01] Dr. Jack Feldman: Passes into the bloodstream, but the the rate at which it passes will depend on the characteristics of the membrane, How what the distance is between the alveolus and the the, blood vessel, the capillary, but it the key element is the surface area. The bigger the surface area, the more oxygen that can pass through. It's entirely a passive process. There's no magic about making oxygen go in. Now how do you get a pack, a large surface area in a small chest?[0:28:34] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, you start out with 1 tube, which is the trachea. The trachea expands. Now you have 2 tubes, then you have 4 tubes, and it keeps branching. At some point, At the end of those branches, you put a little bit a little sphere, which is an alveolus, and that determines what the surface area is going to breathe be. Now you then have a mechanical problem.[0:28:59] Dr. Jack Feldman: You have this surface area. You have to be able to pull it apart. So imagine you have a little square of elastic membrane. It doesn't take a lot of force to pull it apart. But now if you in increase it by 50 times, you need a lot more force to pull it apart.[0:29:16] Dr. Jack Feldman: So amphibians Who were breathing not by compressing the lungs and then just passively expanding it, weren't able to generate a lot of force. So they have relatively few branches. So if you look at the surface area that they pack in their lungs relative to their body size, It's not very impressive. Whereas when you get to mammals, the amount of branching that you have is you have 4 to 500,000,000 alveoli.[0:29:48] Andrew Huberman: How if we were to take those 4 to 5,000,000 of 100000000.[0:29:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: 45 45[0:29:54] Andrew Huberman: 100 100,000,000. Excuse me. And lay those out flat. What sort of surface area are we talking about?[0:30:00] Dr. Jack Feldman: About 70 square meters, which is about a third the size of a tennis Court. Wow. So you have a membrane inside of you, a third the size of a tennis court, said you actually have to expand every breath, And you do that without exerting much of a you don't feel it, and that's because you have this amazing muscle of the diaphragm, which Because of its positioning, just by moving 2 thirds of an inch down is able to expand that membrane enough To move air into the lungs. Oh. Now the the at rest, the volume of air in your lungs is about 2 and a half liters.[0:30:40] Dr. Jack Feldman: Do we need to convert that to quartz? No. Right. It's about 2 and a half liters. When you take a breath, You're taking another 500 milliliters or half a liter.[0:30:50] Dr. Jack Feldman: That's the size maybe a little of my fist. So you're increasing the volume by 20%. But you're you're doing that by pulling on this 70 square meter membrane, but that's enough to bring enough Fresh air into the lung to mix in with the air that's already there, that the oxygen levels in your Your bloodstream goes from a partial pressure of oxygen, which is 40 millimeters of mercury, To a 100 millimeters of mercury. So that's a huge increase in oxygen, and that's enough to sustain normal metabolism. So we We have this amazing, mechanical advantage by having a diaphragm.[0:31:37] Andrew Huberman: Do you think that the our brains are larger than that of other mammals in part because of the amount of oxygen that we have been able to bring into our System.[0:31:46] Dr. Jack Feldman: I would say a key step in the ability to develop a large brain that has a continuous demand for oxygen is a diaphragm. Without a diaphragm, you're an amphibian. And they're and and There there's another solution to increasing oxygen uptake, which is the way birds breathe, but birds have other limitations, And they still can't get brains as big as, mammals have. So we we the, The brain utilizes maybe 20% of all the oxygen that we intake, and it needs it continuously. You can't the brain doesn't wanna be neglected.[0:32:29] Dr. Jack Feldman: So this puts certain demands on breathing system. In other words, you can't shut it down for a while, which poses other issues. You're born and you have to mature. You have the small body. You have a small lung.[0:32:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: You have a very pliant ribcage, And now you have to develop into an adult, which has a stiffer rib cage. And so there are changes happening in your brain and your body Where breathing, the neural control of breathing has to change on the fly. It's not like for things like vision, where you have the opportunity to sleep. And while you're sleeping, the brain is capable of doing things that are not easy to do during wakefulness, like the construction crew comes in during sleep. Breathing has been the change in breathing have been described as trying to build an airplane while it's while it's flying.[0:33:20] Andrew Huberman: Basically, what Jack is saying is that, respiration science is more complex and hardworking than vision science, which is a direct jab at me, that some of you might have missed, but I definitely did not miss, and I appreciate that you always, take the opportunity like a good New Yorker to To, you know, give me a good healthy, intellectual jab, a question, related to Diaphragmatic breathing versus nondiaphragmatic breathing. Because the way you describe it, the diaphragm is always involved. But, you know, over the years, Whether it be for, you know, yoga class or a breathwork thing or you hear online that we should be breathing with our diaphragm, that rather than lift thing our rib cage when we breathe and our chest that it is healthier, in air quotes, or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale. I'm not aware of any particular studies that really examined the direct health benefits of diaphragmatic versus nondiaphragmatic breathing. But if you don't mind commenting on anything you're aware of, as it relates to diaphragmatic versus nondiaphragmatic breathing, Whether or not people tend to be diaphragmatic breathers by default, etcetera, that would be, I think, interesting to a number of people.[0:34:33] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, I think by default, we are obligate diaphragm breathers. I, there may be pathologies where the diaphragm is compromised and you have to use other muscles, And that's a challenge. It, certainly, at rest, Other muscles can take over, but if you need to increase your ventilation, the diaphragm is Very important. It's would be hard to increase your ventilation otherwise.[0:35:05] Andrew Huberman: Do you pay attention to whether or not you are breathing in a manner where your belly, Goes out a little bit as you inhale, because I can do it both ways. Right? I can inhale, bring my belly in, or I can inhale, Push my diaphragm and belly out. Not the diaphragm out, but and that's interesting, right, because it's a completely different muscle set for each, each version.[0:35:28] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, in the in the context of things like breath practice, I'm a bit agnostic about the effects of Some of the different patterns of breathing, clearly, some are gonna work through different mechanisms, and we can talk about that. But at certain level, for example, whether it's primarily diaphragm where you move your abdomen or not, I am agnostic about it. I think that the changes that that breathing induces in emotion and cognition, I have different ideas about what the influence is, and I don't see that primarily as How which particular muscles you're choosing, but that just could be my own prejudice. Okay.[0:36:18] Andrew Huberman: And we'll we will return to that, as a general theme in a little bit, I I wanna ask you about sighing. One of the Many great gifts that you've given us over the years, is an understanding of these Things that we call physiological size. Could you tell us about physiological size? What's known about them? What Your particular interest in them is and, what they're good for.[0:36:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: A very interesting and important question. So everyone has a, sense of what a sigh is. We Certainly, when we're emotional emotional in some ways, we're stressed, we're particularly happy, we'll take a we'll sigh. It turns out that we're sighing all the time. And, When I would ask people who are not particularly knowledgeable that haven't read my papers or James Nestor's book or listened to your podcast, they're usually off by 2 orders of magnitude about how frequently we sigh on this low side.[0:37:30] Dr. Jack Feldman: In other words, they So once an hour, you know, 10 times a day. We sigh about every 5 minutes, And I would, encourage anyone who finds that to be, a unbelievable fact Just lie down in a quiet room and just breathe normally. Just relax. Just let go, and just pay attention to your breathing. And you'll find that every couple of minutes, you're taking a deep breath, and you can't stop it.[0:38:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: You know, it it just it just happens. Now why? Well, we have to go back to the lung again. The lung has these 500,000,000 alveoli, and they're very tiny. They're 200 microns across.[0:38:18] Dr. Jack Feldman: So they're really, really tiny. And you can think of them as fluid filled. They're fluid lined. And the reason they're fluid lined has to do with The, esoterica of the mechanics of that, it makes it a little easier to stretch them with this fluid line, which is called surfactant. And surfactant is important during development that is a determining factor in the, when premature infants are born.[0:38:45] Dr. Jack Feldman: If they have not do not have lung surfactant, it makes it much more challenging to take care of them than after they have lung surfactant, which is sometime, if I remember correctly, in the late 2nd, early 3rd trimester, which it appears, in any case, it's fluid line. Now think of a balloon that you would blow up. But now before you blow it up, fill the balloon with water. Squeeze all the water out, and now Whole when you squeeze all the water out, you notice the size of the balloon stick to each other. Why is that?[0:39:19] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, that's because water has what's called surface tension. And when you have 2 surfaces of water together, they actually tend to stick to each other. Now when you try and blow that balloon up, you know that it or you'll notice if you've never done it before, that the balloon is a little harder to inflate than if we're dry on the inside. Why is that? Because you have to overcome that surface tension.[0:39:45] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, your alveoli Have a tendency to collapse. There's 500,000,000 of them. They're not collapsing at a very high rate, But it's a slow rate that's not trivial. And when alveolus collapses, it no longer can receive oxygen or Take carbon dioxide out. It's sort of taken out of the equation.[0:40:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: Now if you have 500,000,000 of them and you lose ten, No big deal. But if they keep collapsing, you can lose a significant part of the surface area of your lung. Now a normal breath It's not enough to pop them open. But if you take a deep breath, it pops them open. Through[0:40:28] Andrew Huberman: no through no nose or mouth. Okay. Doesn't[0:40:30] Dr. Jack Feldman: Or It's just increased that lung volume because you're just pulling on the lungs. They'll pop open about every 5 minutes. And so we're doing it every 5 minutes in order to maintain the health of our lung. In the early days of mechanical ventilation, which was used to treat polio victims who had weakness of their respiratory muscles, They'd be put in these big steel tubes, and the way they would work is that the pressure outside the body would drop. That would put a expansion pressure on the the lungs excuse me, on the rib cage.[0:41:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: The rib cage would expand, and then the lung would expand. And then the pressure would go back to normal, and the lung and rib cage would go back to normal. There was a this was great for Getting ventilation, but there was a relatively high mortality rate. It was a bit of a mystery, And one solution was to just give bigger breaths. They gave bigger breaths and the mortality rate dropped.[0:41:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: And it wasn't till I think it was the fifties where they realized that they didn't have to increase every breath to be big. What they needed to do is every so often, they need to have 1 big breath. So you have a couple of minutes of normal breaths and then 1 big breath just Mimicking the physiological size, and then the mortality rate drops significantly. And if you see someone on a vent a ventilator In the hospital, if you watch every couple of minutes that you see the membrane move up and down, every couple of minutes, there'll be a super breath, And that pops it open. So there are these mechanisms for these physiological sighs.[0:42:17] Dr. Jack Feldman: So just like with the collapse of the lungs where you need a big, pressure to pop it open, It's the same thing with the alveoli. You need a bigger pressure, and a normal breath is not enough. So you have to take a big inhale. And what nature has done is instead of requiring us to remember to do it, it does it automatically, And it does it about every 5 minutes. And one of the questions we wanna we asked is, how is this happening?[0:42:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: Why every 5 minutes? What's What's doing it? And we got into it through a backdoor. Typical of the way a lot of science gets done, there's this serendipitous, event where you run across a paper and something clicks And you just you know, you you follow it up. Sometimes you go down blind ends, but this turned out to be incredibly productive.[0:43:17] Dr. Jack Feldman: One of the guys in my lab was reading a paper about stress. And during stress, lots of things happen in the body. One of which is that the hypothalamus, which is very reactive to body state, releases peptides, which are specialized molecules, which then circulate throughout the brain and body that particular effects usually to help deal better with the stress. And one class of the peptides that are released are called Bombasen related peptides. And He also realized, because he was a breathing guy, and when you stress, you sigh more.[0:43:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we said, Alright. Maybe they're related. Bombasen is relatively cheap to buy. Who said, let's buy some bombasen, throw it in the Brain stem. Let's see what happens.[0:44:07] Dr. Jack Feldman: And, you know, the one of the nice things about, some experiments that we try to design is to fail quickly. So here we had the idea. We throw Bomberson in, and if Bomberson did nothing, no nothing lost, maybe $50 to buy the bomberson. But if it did something, it might be of some interest. So we 1 afternoon, he did the experiment, and he comes to me.[0:44:31] Dr. Jack Feldman: He says, I won't quote exactly what he said because that, might need to be censored, but he said, look at this. And It was in a rat. Rats sigh about every 2 minutes. They're smaller than we are, and they need to sigh more often. This irate from went from 20 to 30 per hour to 500 per hour when he put Bombasen into the prebuttinger complex.[0:44:58] Dr. Jack Feldman: Amazing. And the way he did that is he took a very, very fine glass needle and anesthetize a rat And inserted that needle directly into the pre Botzinger complex. So it wasn't a generalized delivery of the peptide. It was localized to the pre Botzinger, and The sirete went through the roof.[0:45:19] Andrew Huberman: And I would, add that that was an important experiment to deliver the Bombasen directly to that site because one Could have concluded that the injection of the Bombasen increased sign because it increased stress rather than directly increased sign.[0:45:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: Amongst Hundreds of other possible interpretations. So the precision here is very important, and that goes back to what I said at the very beginning. Knowing where this is happening allows you to do the proper investigations. If you didn't know where the inspiratory rhythm was originating, we never could have done this experiment. And so then we then we did another experiment.[0:45:55] Dr. Jack Feldman: We said, okay. What happens if we Take the cells in the pre Botzinger that are responding to the peptides. So neurons will respond to a peptide because they have specialized Receptors for that peptide. And not every neuron expresses those receptors. In the pre blood cell complex, it's probably a few 100 out of 1,000.[0:46:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we, used the technique we had used before, And this was a technique developed by Doug Lappe down in San Diego, where you could take a peptide and conjugate it with a molecule called saproin. Saprin is a plant derived molecule, which is a cousin to ricin. And many of your listeners may have heard of ricin. It's a[0:46:48] Andrew Huberman: ribosomal toxin.[0:46:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: It it's very nasty. It's it a a single, You know, stab with an umbrella will kill you, which is a, something that supposedly happened to a Bulgarian diplomat By a Russian operative on a bridge in London, he got stabbed. And the way ricin works is it goes inside a cell, crosses the cell membrane, goes inside the cell, He kills the cell, then it goes to the next cell, and then the next cell, and then the next cell. It's, it's extremely, dangerous. In fact, it's firstly impossible to work on in a lab in the United States.[0:47:25] Dr. Jack Feldman: They won't let you touch it. Bryce.[0:47:26] Andrew Huberman: Because we've worked with Safran many times.[0:47:30] Dr. Jack Feldman: Safran is safe because it doesn't cross cell membranes. So you get an injection of Safran, It won't do anything because it stays outside of cells.[0:47:40] Andrew Huberman: Please, nobody do that even though it doesn't cross cell membranes. Please, nobody inject saproin whether or not you are a Operative or otherwise.[0:47:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: Thank you, Andrew, for protecting me there. So but what Doug Lappe figured out is that When a ligand binds to a receptor, that's when a molecule binds to its receptor. In many cases, that receptor ligand complex gets pulled inside the cell. So it goes from the membrane in the cell inside the cell.[0:48:13] Andrew Huberman: So, like, you can't go to the dance alone, but if you're coupled up, you get in the door.[0:48:17] Dr. Jack Feldman: That's right. So what he figured out is he put saproin To the peptide, the peptide binds to its receptor. It gets internalized. And then when it's inside the cell, Safran does the same thing that ricin does. It kills the cell, but then it can't go into the next cell.[0:48:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: So the only cells that get Killed or the more polite term, ablated, are cells that express that receptor. So if you have a Big conglomeration of cells. You have a few 1,000 and only 50 of them res express that receptor, Then you inject the saproin conjugated to the ligand, to the peptide, and only those 50 cells die. So we took Bombasen conjugated the saprin injected into prebutseria complex of rats, and it took about A couple days for the saffron to actually ablate cells. And what happened is that The mice started sighing less and less and excuse me.[0:49:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: The rats started sighing less and less and less and less and essentially stopped sighing.[0:49:26] Andrew Huberman: So, your student or postdoc, was it, murdered these cells? And as a consequence, the sighing goes away.[0:49:36] Dr. Jack Feldman: Alright.[0:49:36] Andrew Huberman: What was the consequence of eliminating sighing on the Internal state or the behavior of the rats.[0:49:45] Dr. Jack Feldman: Did they[0:49:45] Andrew Huberman: in other words, if one can't sigh, It generate physiological size. What is the consequence on state of mind? Do you would imagine that carbon dioxide would build up more readily or, to higher levels in the bloodstream and that the animals would be more stressed. That that's the kind of logical extension of the way we set it up.[0:50:07] Dr. Jack Feldman: It was Less benign than that. When the animals got to the point where there were any sighing, then And we did not, determine this, but the presumption was that their lung function significantly deteriorated, And their physi their whole health deteriorated significantly, and we had to sacrifice them. So I can't tell you whether they were stressed or not, but their breathing got to be significantly, deteriorated that we sacrificed them at that point. Now we don't know whether that is specifically related to the fact they didn't sigh Or that it's there was secondary damage due to the fact that some cells die, so we never determined that. Now After we did this study, to be candid, it wasn't a high priority for us to get this out the door and publish it.[0:51:06] Dr. Jack Feldman: So it stayed on the shelf. Then I got a phone call from a graduate student at Stanford, Kevin Yackel, who starts asking me all these interesting questions about breathing, And I'm happy to answer them, but at some point, it concerned me because he was working for a renowned biochemist who worked on Lung in Drosophila fruit flies, Mark Krasnow.[0:51:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. My next door colleague. Right.[0:51:38] Dr. Jack Feldman: Yeah. And I said, Why are you asking me this? And he said, I was an undergraduate at UCLA, and you gave a lecture in on my undergraduate class, and I was curious about breathing ever since. So that's one of those things which, as a professor, you love to hear that actually is something you really affected the life of a student.[0:51:56] Andrew Huberman: When you birthed a competitor, but you had only yourself to blame.[0:51:59] Dr. Jack Feldman: No. I I don't look at that as a competitor. I I think that there's enough interesting things to go on. I know some of our neuroscience colleagues say you can work on my lab, but then when you leave my lab, you gotta work on something different.[0:52:12] Andrew Huberman: No one I ever trained with said That it's a it's open field. You wanna work on something, you you hop in the mix.[0:52:17] Dr. Jack Feldman: And, but there there are people like that neuroscientists like that. I never felt like that.[0:52:22] Andrew Huberman: That their breathing apparati are disrupted, and it causes a brain dysfunction that leads to the behavior you just just described. That's actually not true.[0:52:30] Dr. Jack Feldman: But but[0:52:31] Andrew Huberman: in terms of the so I The before, you we talk about the the beautiful story with with Yaackel and Krasnow and Feldman Lab, I want to just make sure that I understand. So if physiological sighs don't happen, Basically, breathing overall suffers. Well, that that would go back[0:52:55] Dr. Jack Feldman: to the observations in, Polio victims in these high and lungs where the principal deficit was there was no hyperinflation of the lungs, And they many of them deteriorated and died.[0:53:08] Andrew Huberman: And just to stay on this one more moment before, we move to what you were about to describe. We hear often that people will overdose on drugs of various kinds because they stop breathing. So barbiturate alcohol combined with barbiturates is a common cause of death, for drug users and Contraindications of drugs and these kinds of things. You hear all the time about celebrities dying because they combine alcohol with barbiturates. Is there any evidence that the size that occur during sleep or during states of, you know, deep, deep, relaxation, and and sedation that size recover the the brain because, you could imagine that if these size don't happen As a consequence of some drug impacting these brain centers, that that could be one cause of basically asphyxiation and death.[0:54:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: If you look at the progression of any mammal to death, You find that their breathing slows down a a a death due to, quote, natural causes. Their breathing slows down. It's will stop, and then they'll gasp. So we have the phrase dying gasp. Super large breaths.[0:54:31] Dr. Jack Feldman: They're often described as an attempt to auto resuscitate. That is you take that super deep breath And that maybe it can kick start the engine again. We do not know the degree to such things as gas are really size that are particularly large. And so if you suppress the ability to gasp in an individual who is Subject to an overdose, then whereas they might been able to rearouse their breathing, If that's prevented, they don't get rearoused. So that is certainly a a possibility.[0:55:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: But this has not been investigated. I mean, one of the things that I'm interested in is in individuals who have diseases which will affect prebuttinger complex. And there's there's data in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, which is another form of neurodegeneration, Where there's loss of neurons in pre Botzinger. And the question is and it also may happen in ALS, Sometimes referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease, amitrophic collateral sclerosis. These individuals often die During sleep, we have an idea that we have not been able to get anyone to test is that patients with Parkinson's, patients with MLS typically breathe normally during wakefulness.[0:56:16] Dr. Jack Feldman: The disturbances that they have in breathing is during sleep. So Parkinson's patients at the end stages of of the disease Often have significant disturbances in their sleep pattern, but not during wakefulness. And we think that What could be happening is that the proximate cause of death is not heart failure, is that they become apnea, they stop breathing, and don't resuscitate. And that resuscitation may or may not be due to an explicit suppression of size, But to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus of the pre Butzinger complex.[0:56:54] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Thank you. So Yackel calls you up.[0:56:59] Dr. Jack Feldman: So he calls us calls me up, and he's great kids, super smart, and He tells me about these these experiments that he's doing, where he's looking in a database To try and find out what molecules are enriched in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing. So we and Others have mapped out these regions in the brain stem, and he was looking at one of these databases to see what's enriched. And I said, That's great. We'd be willing to sorta share our work together. He says, no.[0:57:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: I my adviser doesn't want me to do that. So I said, okay. But Kevin's a great kid, and I enjoy talking to him, and he's a smart guy. And, you know, What I found, in academia and is that the smartest people Only wanna hire people smarter than them and only 1 in and have the preference to interact with people smarter than them. The, the faculty who are not At the highest level and at every institution, there's a distribution.[0:58:12] Dr. Jack Feldman: They're ones above the mean and those below the mean. Those whom below the mean are very threatened by that. And, I saw Kevin as, like, a a shining light, and I didn't care whether he was gonna outcompete me because whatever he did was gonna help me in the field. So I would I did whatever I can to help to work with Kevin. So one point, I got invited to give grand rounds in neurology at Stanford.[0:58:40] Dr. Jack Feldman: Turns out an undergraduate student who had worked with me Was now ahead of the training program for neurologists at Stanford, and he invited me. And at the end of my visit, I go to Mark Krasnow's office, and Kevin is there and a postdoc, Pangly, who was also working on a project was there. And towards the end of the conversation, the Mark says to me, You know, we found this 1 molecule which is highly concentrated in an important region for breathing. I said, oh, that's great. What is it?[0:59:22] Dr. Jack Feldman: And he says, I can't tell you because we wanna work on it. So, course, I'm disappointed, but I realized that, in the the ethic in some areas of science or the custom in some areas of Science is that until you get a publication, you'll be relatively restricted in sharing your and I[0:59:43] Andrew Huberman: are gonna have a chat when I come back. Alright.[0:59:45] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, he may remember the story differently, but, I said okay. And as I'm walking out the door, I remember these experiments I described to you about Bombasen, and that was the only unusual molecule we're working. So the reason I'm rushing out the door is I have a flight to catch. So I stick my head in. I said, is this molecule related to Bombasen?[1:00:09] Dr. Jack Feldman: And then I run off. I don't even wait for them to reply. I get to the airport. Mark calls me and he says, Bombacin, the peptide we found is related to Bombacin. What does it do?[1:00:22] Dr. Jack Feldman: And I said, I'm not telling.[1:00:26] Andrew Huberman: Oh my. And I'm so glad I wasn't involved in this collaboration.[1:00:29] Dr. Jack Feldman: No. No. But but that was sort of a a a tease Sure. Because I said, Well, let's work together on this, and then we work together on this.[1:00:37] Andrew Huberman: Prisoner's dilemma at that point. You yeah. So Kevin Yackel is spectacular, has his own lab at UCSF. And the work that I'm familiar with, from Kevin is is worth mentioning now, or I'll I'll ask you to to mention it, which is this reciprocal relationship between brain state, or we could even say emotional state, and breathing. And I'd love to get your thoughts on how breathing interacts with other things in the brain.[1:01:07] Andrew Huberman: You've beautifully described how breathing controls lungs, the diaphragm, and the interactions between oxygen and carbon dioxide and so forth. But as we know, when we get stressed, Our breathing changes when we're happy and relaxed. Our breathing changes. But, also, if we change our breathing, we, in some sense, can adjust our internal state. What is the relationship between brain state and breathing?[1:01:33] Andrew Huberman: And if you would, because I know you have a particular, Love of of one particular aspect of this, what is the relationship between brain rhythms, Oscillations, if you will, and breathing.[1:01:47] Dr. Jack Feldman: This is a topic which has really intrigued me over the past decade. I would say before that, I was in my silo just interested about how the rhythm of breathing is generated and didn't really pay much attention to this other stuff. For some reason, I got interested in it, and I think it was triggered by an article in the New York Times about mindfulness. Now believe it or not, although I'd lived in California for 20 years at that time, I never heard of mindfulness. It's Staggering how isolated you can be from the real world.[1:02:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: And I googled it, and there was a mindfulness institute at UCLA, And they were giving courses in meditation. So I said, oh, this is great because I can now see whether or not The breathing part of meditation has anything to do with the purported effects of meditation. So I signed up for the course. And as I've joked to you before, I had 2 goals. 1 was to see whether or not, breathing had an effect, and the other was to levitate.[1:02:51] Dr. Jack Feldman: Because I grew up in all these kung fu things, and all the monks could levitate when they meditated. So why not? You know, we have a mile in the lab. You can't do anything interesting if you're afraid of failing. And if I fail to levitate, well, at least I try.[1:03:07] Dr. Jack Feldman: And I should tell you now, I still haven't done it yet, but I haven't given up yet. I haven't given up. So I I took this course in mindfulness, And it became apparent to me that the breathing part was actually critical. It wasn't simply a distraction or a focus. It you know, they could have had you, move your index finger to the same effect.[1:03:32] Dr. Jack Feldman: I really believe that the breathing part was involved. Now I'm not an unbiased observer. So, the question is, how can I demonstrate that? I didn't feel confident to do experiments in humans, and I didn't feel like I designed the right experiments in humans. But I felt maybe I can study this in rodents.[1:03:55] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we got this idea that we're gonna teach rodents to meditate. And, you know, it that's laughable. But we said, but if but if we can, then we can actually study how this happens. So believe it or not, I was able to get a, sort of a starter grant, an r twenty one from NCCIH, that's the National Complimentary, Medicine Institute.[1:04:25] Andrew Huberman: A wonderful institute, I should mention. Our government puts Major tax dollars toward studies of things like meditation, breath work, supplements, herbs, acupuncture. This is, I think, not well known, and it's an incredible thing that this that our government does that, and I think it deserves a nod and more funding.[1:04:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: I I totally agree with you. I think that it's the kind of thing that many of us, including many neuro many scientists thinks is to woo woo and and unsubstantiated, but we're learning more and more. You know? We used to laugh at neuroimmunology, that the nervous system didn't have anything with the immune system. And, pain itself can influence your immune system.[1:05:11] Dr. Jack Feldman: I mean, there are all these things that we're learning that we used to dismiss. And I think there's there's real nuggets to be learned here. So they Went on a limb and they funded this particular project. And now I'm gonna leap ahead because for 3 years, we threw stuff up against the wall that didn't work. And recently, we had a major breakthrough.[1:05:37] Dr. Jack Feldman: We found a protocol By which we can get mice to breathe slowly awake mice to breathe slowly. I won't tell you.[1:05:48] Andrew Huberman: Normally, they don't breathe slowly.[1:05:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: No. No. In other words, whatever their normal breath is, we could slow it down by a factor of 10, And they're fine doing that. So we could do that for we did that 30 minutes a day for 4 weeks. Okay?[1:06:04] Dr. Jack Feldman: Like a breath practice.[1:06:05] Andrew Huberman: Do they levitate?[1:06:07] Dr. Jack Feldman: We haven't measured that yet. I would say, a priori, we haven't seen them floating to the top of their cage, but we haven't weighed them. Maybe they weigh less. You know, they maybe, you know, levitation is involved is graded. And so maybe if you weigh less, it's sort of partial levitation.[1:06:25] Dr. Jack Feldman: In any case, We then tested them, and we had control animals, Mice, we did everything the same except the manipulation we made did not slow down their breathing. So but they went through everything else. We then put them through a standard fear conditioning, which we did with my colleague, Michael who's one of the real gurus of fear. And we measured a standard test is to put, mice in a condition where they're concerned that receive a shock, and their response is that they freeze. And the measure of how Fearful they are is how long they freeze.[1:07:13] Dr. Jack Feldman: This is well validated, and it's way above my pay grade to describe, the validity of the test, but it's very valid. The the control mice At a freezing time, which was just the same as ordinary mice would have. The ones that went through our protocol froze much, much less. According to Michael, the degree to which they showed less freezing was as much as if there was a major manipulation in the amygdala, which is a part of the brain that's important in fear processing. It's a staggering change.[1:07:53] Dr. Jack Feldman: Problem we have now is the grant ran out of money. The post op working on it left, and now we have to try and piece together everything. And, but the data is spectacular. Well, I[1:08:06] Andrew Huberman: think it's, I'll just pause you for a moment there because I think that the you know, you're talking about a rodent study, but I think the The benefits of doing rodent studies that you can get deep into mechanism, and for people that, might think, Well, we've known that meditation has these benefits. Why do you need to get mechanistic science? I think that, one thing that's important for people to remember is that, first of all, As many people as one might think, are meditating out there or doing breath work, a far, far, far greater number of people are not. Right? I mean, there's a the majority of people don't take any time to do dedicated breath work nor meditate.[1:08:46] Andrew Huberman: So Whatever can incentivize people would be, wonderful. But the other thing is that it's never really been clear to me Just how much meditation is required for a real effect, meaning a a practical effect. People say 30 minutes a day, 20 minutes a day, once a week, twice a week, same thing with breath work. Finding minimum or effective thresholds for changing neural circuitry is what I think is the holy grail of all these, practices, and that's only gonna be determined by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe. So I this is wonderful.[1:09:18] Andrew Huberman: I I do hope the work gets completed, and, we can talk about ways that, we can ensure that that happens. But, But let me let[1:09:25] Dr. Jack Feldman: me add one thing to what you're saying, Andrew. One of one of the, issues, I think, for a lot of people is that there's a placebo effect. That is in humans, They can respond to something even though the mechanism has nothing to do with what the, the the intervention is. And so it's easy to say that the meditative response is a has a big component, which is a placebo effect. My mice don't believe in the placebo effect.[1:09:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: And so if we could show there's a bona fide effect in mice, It is convincing in ways that no matter how many human experiments you did, the control for the placebo effect is extremely difficult in humans. Advice, it's it's a nonissue. So I think that that in of itself would be an enormous message to send.[1:10:14] Andrew Huberman: Excellent and indeed, a better point. I think a 30 minute a day meditation, in these mice, if I understand correctly, the meditation, we don't know what they're thinking about.[1:10:28] Dr. Jack Feldman: Breath practice.[1:10:28] Andrew Huberman: Right. So it's breath practice. So there because we don't they're, Presumably, they're not thinking about their 3rd eye center lotus position, levitation, whatever it is. They're not instructed as to what to do, and if they were, they probably wouldn't do it anyway. So 30 minutes a day in which breathing is deliberately slowed or is slowed relative to their normal patterns of breathing.[1:10:48] Andrew Huberman: Got it. Was the frequency of sighing during that, 30 minutes?[1:10:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: Unclear. We don't know yet. Well, no. We have the data. We just we're analyzing the data.[1:10:58] Andrew Huberman: To be determined, were to be announced at some point. So, so the fear centers are altered in some way that creates, a shorter fear response to a foot shock. Right. What are some other examples that you are aware of From work in your laboratory or work in other laboratories for that matter, about interactions between breathing and brain state or emotional state.[1:11:22] Dr. Jack Feldman: So this goes back to our A prior conversation, I sort of went off on that tangent. We we need I think we need to think separately Of the effect of volitional changes of breathing on emotion versus the effect, the the effect of brain state on breathing. So the effect of brain state on breathing, like when you're stressed, It's a effect, presumably, originating in higher centers, if I can use that term affecting breathing. It's the reciprocal is that when you change breathing, it affects your emotional state. I think I think of those 2 things as different They may ultimately be tied together.[1:12:13] Dr. Jack Feldman: So there's a landmark paper published in the fifties where they stimulated in the amygdala of cats. And depending on where they stimulated, they got profound changes in breathing. There's, like, every pattern of breathing you could possibly imagine, they found a site in the amygdala which could produce that. So there's clearly a powerful descending effect coming from the, the amygdala, which is a major site For processing emotion, fear, stress, and whatnot, that can affect breathing. And, clearly, we have volitional control over breathing, so we have profound effects there.[1:12:48] Dr. Jack Feldman: Now I should say about emotional control of breathing, I need to segue into talking about locked in syndrome. Locked in syndrome is a devastating lesion that happens in a part of the brain stem Where signals that controlled muscles are transmitted. So the fibers coming from your motor cortex Go down to this part of the the brain stem, which is called the ventral pons. And if there's a stroke there, It can damage these pathways. What happens in individuals who have locked in syndrome is they lose all volitional movement except Lateral movement of the eyes and maybe the ability to blink.[1:13:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: The reason they're able to still blink and move their eyes is that those control centers are are rostral closer to are not interrupted. In other words, the interruption is below that. They continue to breathe because the centers for breathing Don't require that volitional command. In any case, they're below that, so they're they're fine. So these people continue to breathe normal intelligence, But they can't move.[1:14:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: There's a great book called the Diving Bell and the Butterfly about a young man, Who had this happens to, and he describes his life. And it's a real testament to human The human condition that he's does this, it's a remarkable book. It's a short book. Did he write the[1:14:27] Andrew Huberman: book by blinking[1:14:28] Dr. Jack Feldman: to his He wrote it. He he he did it by blinking to his caretaker. It's pretty amazing. And there was a movie which I've never seen with Javier Bardeen as the protagonist, but the book I highly recommend is, to anyone to read. So I had colleagues studying an individual who had locked in syndrome, And they this patient breathed very robotically.[1:14:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: Totally consistent. Very regular. They gave the patient a low oxygen mixture to breathe. Ventilation went up. A c o two mixture To breathe, ventilation went up, so all the regulatory apparatus for breathing was there.[1:15:09] Dr. Jack Feldman: They asked the patient to hold his breath or to breathe faster. Nothing happened. Just the patient recognized the command, but couldn't change it. Then all of a sudden, the patient's breathing changed considerably. And they said to their patient, what happened?[1:15:24] Dr. Jack Feldman: They said, you told a joke, and I laughed. And they went back. And whenever they told a joke that the patient found Funny, the patient's breathing pattern changed. And you know your breathing pattern when you laugh is, you know, you inhale, you go But it's also very distinctive. We have some neuroscience colleagues who will go unnamed, who if you heard them laugh 50 yards away, You know exactly who they are.[1:15:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, I'll I'll I'll name him. Eric Kendall For 1. Has an inspiratory laugh. He's famous for a As opposed to a Exactly.[1:16:00] Dr. Jack Feldman: Yeah. Exactly. So the it's very stereotype, but it It's maintained in these people who lose volitional control of breathing. So there's an emotive component controlling your breathing, which has nothing to do with your volitional control, and it goes down to a different pathway because it's not disrupted by this locked in syndrome. If you look at motor control of the face, we have the volitional control of the face, but we also have motor control, emotional control of the face, Which most of us can't control.[1:16:36] Dr. Jack Feldman: So when we look at another person, we tend we're able to read a lot about what their Their emotional state is and that's a lot about how primates communicate. Humans communicate. And you have people who are good deceivers. Probably used car salesman, poker players or now poker plays, you know, have tells, But many of them now wear, you know, dark glasses because a lot of the tells you blink or whatnot. Pupil size is a tell.[1:17:05] Dr. Jack Feldman: Pupil size is a tell, which is an autonomic function, not a a a, skeletal muscle function. But we have these all these skeletal muscles which we're controlling, Which give us away. I have the I've tried to get my imaging friends to image some of the great actors that we have in Los Angeles. You[1:17:27] Andrew Huberman: mean brain imagers? Brain imagers.[1:17:29] Dr. Jack Feldman: Yeah. I'm sorry.[1:17:29] Andrew Huberman: No. That's alright.[1:17:30] Dr. Jack Feldman: I mean, I yeah. Brain imagers. Because I think When when I tell ask you to smile, I could tell that you're not happy, that you're smiling because I asked her to smile.[1:17:43] Andrew Huberman: I think you were crack a joke, But we're we're old friends. So yeah.[1:17:48] Dr. Jack Feldman: No. I'm I'm not, that that you know, when when you see a picture, Like, at a birthday, I want none and say say cheese. You could tell that at least half of the people are not happy they're saying cheese. Whereas a great actor, when when they're able to dissemble and the fact that they're sad or they're happy, you believe it. They're not faking it.[1:18:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: It's Like, that's great acting. And I don't think everyone could do that. I think that the individuals who are able to do that have some connection to the parts of their motive control system that the rest of us don't have. Maybe they develop it through training and maybe not, But I think that this can be image. So I would like to get one of these great actors in a imager and have them go through that and then then get a normal person And see whether or not they can emulate that.[1:18:40] Dr. Jack Feldman: And I think you're gonna find big differences in the way they control this emotive thing. So this emotive control of the The facial muscles, I think, is in large part similar to the emotive control of breathing. So there's that emotive control And there's that volitional control, and they're different. They're they're different. Now the you asked me about the Yako stuff.[1:19:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: The Yako Paper had to do with ascending that the effect of breathing on emotion. What Kevin found was that there was a population of neurons in the pre Botzinger complex that We're always looking to things that are projecting ultimately the motor neurons. He found the population of cells that projected to locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus, Excuse me. It's one of those places in the brain that seem to go everywhere.[1:19:34] Andrew Huberman: Take a sprinkler system. Exactly.[1:19:36] Dr. Jack Feldman: Exactly. And influence mood and, you know, you've had podcast about this. I mean, it there's a lot of stuff going on with the amebas. So actually, the locus aurelius. So you get into the locus coeruleus, you can now spray information out throughout the entire brain.[1:19:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: He found specific cells that projected from pre Botzinger to locus coeruleus and that these cells are inspiratory modulator. Now it's been known for a long time since the sixties that if you look in the locus coeruleus of cats When they're awake, you find many neurons that have respiratory modulation. No one paid much attention to it. I mean, why why bother? Not why bother paying attention, but why would the brain bother to have these inputs?[1:20:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: So what Kevin did with, Lindsay Schwartz and Lee Leshun Lowe's lab is they killed or bladed those cells going to Locustrarias from Przybyciger. And the animals became calmer, and their EEG levels Changed in ways that are indicative that they became calmer.[1:20:49] Andrew Huberman: And as I recall, they didn't just become calmer, but they weren't really capable of high arousal states. They were kinda flat.[1:20:58] Dr. Jack Feldman: I I don't think we really pursued that in the paper. And so we'd have to ask John Huguenard about that, but, I[1:21:08] Andrew Huberman: He's on the other side of my lap, so we'll we'll ask him. But but, nonetheless, that beautifully illustrates how there is a bidirectional control, Right?[1:21:21] Dr. Jack Feldman: Of Well, that's a shaming.[1:21:23] Andrew Huberman: Emotion well, no. The the the 2, the 2 stories of the locked in, syndrome plus the Yackel paper shows that emotional states influence breathing, and breathing influences emotional states, which, but you mentioned inspiration, which I always call inhalation, but people will will follow. No. No. It's fine.[1:21:42] Andrew Huberman: People those are interchangeable. People can follow that. There's some interesting papers from Noam Sobel's group and from a number of other groups that as we inhale or right after we inhale, The brain is actually more alert and capable of storing information than during exhales, which I find incredible, but it also makes sense. I'm able to see things far better when my eyes are open than when my eyelids are closed for that matter.[1:22:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: Maybe. I I don't I mean, no enormous work is great. Let me backtrack a bit because I I want people to understand that when we're talking about breathing affecting emotional cognitive state, it's not simply coming from pre Botzinger. There are there are at least well, there are several other sites. And let me sort of I need to sort of go through that.[1:22:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: 1 is olfaction. So when you're breathing normal normal breathing, you're inhaling and exhaling. This is creating signals coming from the nasal COSA that is going back into the olfactory bulb, that's respiratory modulated. And the olfactory bulb has a profound influence and projections through many parts of the brain. So there's a signal arising from this rhythmic moving of air in and out of the nose That's going into the brain that has contained in it a respiratory modulation.[1:23:12] Dr. Jack Feldman: So that signal is there. The brain doesn't have to be using it, but when it's, You know, discriminating odor and whatnot, that's riding on a oscillation, which is respiratory related. Another potential source is the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is a major nerve which is containing afferents From all of the viscera.[1:23:34] Andrew Huberman: Efferents just being A signal.[1:23:36] Dr. Jack Feldman: Signals too. Yeah. Signals from the viscera. It also has Signals coming from the brain stem down, which are called efferents, but it's getting major signals from the lung, from the gut, and this is Going up into the brain stem, so it's there. There are very powerful receptors in the lung that are responding to the lung volume, the lung stretch.[1:24:02] Andrew Huberman: These are baroreceptors. Sorry. That, It the well, you we have a number of them, like the like the piezo receptors of the of this year's Nobel Prize. Yeah.[1:24:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: Yeah. Yeah. So they're responding to The expansion and relaxation of the lung. And so if you record from the vagus nerve, you'll see that there's a huge respiratory modulation due to the mechanical changes in the lung. Now why that is of interest is that for Some forms of refractory depression, electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can provide tremendous relief.[1:24:39] Dr. Jack Feldman: Why this is the case still remains to be determined, but it's clear that signals in the vagus nerve, at least artificial signals in the vagus nerve, Can have a positive effect on reducing depression. So it's not elite to think that under normal circumstances That that rhythm coming in from the vagus nerve is playing a role in normal processing. Okay. Let me let me continue. Carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.[1:25:09] Dr. Jack Feldman: Now under normal circumstances, your oxygen levels are fine. And unless you go to altitude, they don't really change very much, but your c o two levels can change quite a bit With even a relatively small change in your overall breathing, that's gonna change your pH level. I have a colleague, Alicia Murat, who is working with patients who have who are anxious, and many of them hyperventilate. And as a result of the hyperventilation, their carbon dioxide levels are low. And she has developed a therapeutic treatment where she trains these people to breathe slower And the Brit to restore their c o two levels back to normal, and she gets relief in their anxiety.[1:26:05] Dr. Jack Feldman: So c o two levels, which are not gonna affect brain function on a breath by breath level, Although it does fluctuate breath by breath, but sort of as a continuous background can change. And if it's changed chronically, We know that highly elevated levels of c o two can produce panic attacks. And, We don't know the degree to that's a gets exacerbated by people who get who have a panic attack to the degree to which their ambient c o two levels are affecting their degree of discomfort. What about people who are,[1:26:44] Andrew Huberman: tend to be too calm? Meaning, they're they're they're feeling sleepy, they They they're under breathing as opposed to over breathing. Is there any, knowledge of what what the status of c o two is in their system?[1:26:57] Dr. Jack Feldman: I don't know, which doesn't mean there's no knowledge, but I'm unaware unaware, but that's blissfully unaware. I have not looked at that literature, So I don't know.[1:27:07] Andrew Huberman: When I I've a feeling I mean, most people, or excuse me. Most of the scientific literature around breathing in humans that I'm aware of relates to these stressed States because they're a little bit easier to study in the lab, whereas people feeling, understimulated or exhausted all the time, it's a it's a complicated thing to measure. I mean, you can do it, but it's it's not as[1:27:25] Dr. Jack Feldman: straightforward. 2 is easy to measure.[1:27:26] Andrew Huberman: But in terms of the sort of, the the measures for feeling, fatigue, you know, they're in they're somewhat indirect. Rest stress, we can We can get at pulse rates in HRV and things of that sort.[1:27:37] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, I imagine that these, these devices that we're all wearing will soon be able to measure well, now they can measure Oxygen levels, oxygen saturation Which is amazing. Yeah. But oxen's you know, We'll pretty much stay above 90% unless there's some pathology or you go to altitude. But c o two levels Very quite a bit. And sealed in fact, because they vary, your body is so sensitive, the control of breathing, like how much you breathe per minute, is determined in a very sensitive way by the c o two level.[1:28:13] Dr. Jack Feldman: So even a small change in your c o two will have a significant effect on your ventilation. So this is another thing that not only changes your ventilation, but affects your brain state. Now another thing that could affect, breathing how breathing practice can affect your emotional state is simply the descending command. Because breathing practice involves volitional control of your breathing, and therefore, there's a signal that's originating somewhere in your motor cortex, That is not of course, that's gonna go down to pre Botzinger, but it's also gonna send off collaterals to other places. Those collaterals could obviously influence your emotional state.[1:28:57] Dr. Jack Feldman: So we have quite a few different potential sources. None of them that are exclusive. There's an interesting paper which shows that if you block nasal Breathing, you still see breathing related oscillations in the brain. And this is where I think The the mechanism is occurring is that that these breathing related oscillations in the brain, they are playing a role in signal processing. And maybe should I talk a little bit about the role that oscillations may be playing in signal processing?[1:29:34] Andrew Huberman: Definitely. But before you do, I I just want to, ask you a, intermediate question. We've talked a lot about inhalation, inspiration, and exhalation. What about breath holds? You know, in apnea, for instance, people are holding their breath whether or not it's, conscious or or or unconscious.[1:29:53] Andrew Huberman: They're holding their breath. What's known about breath holds, in terms of how it might interact with brain state or oxygen c o two? And I'm particularly interested in how Breath holds with lungs empty versus breath holds with lungs full might differ in terms of their impact on the brain. I'm not aware of any studies on this, looking at a mechanistic level, but I find it really interesting. And even if there are no studies, I'd love it if you'd care to speculate.[1:30:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, one of the breath practices that intrigued me is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute and then hold your breath for as long as you can.[1:30:29] Andrew Huberman: Tummo Dial, Wim Hof style or Yeah. We call it in the laboratory, because frankly, before Tummo and before Wim, there There it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation. So it's basically right? Followed by a breath hold. And that breath hold could be done with lungs full or lungs empty.[1:30:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[1:30:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: So I had a long talk with some colleagues about what they might think the underlying mechanisms are, Particularly for the breath hold. And there's certainly comp I I certainly envision that there's a component with respect to the Presence or absence of that rhythmicity in your cortex, which is having effect. But the other thing with the hyperventilation, Hypoventilation or the apnea is your c o two levels are going from low to high. Anytime you're holding your breath. Anytime you're holding your breath.[1:31:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: Okay? And those are gonna have a profound influence. Now I have to talk about episodic hypoxia because there's a lot of work going on, particularly with Gordon Mitchell, the US of Florida's doing some Extraordinary work on episodic hypoxia. So in the eighties, David Millhorn, did some really intriguing work. If I ask you to hold your breath to excuse me.[1:31:55] Dr. Jack Feldman: If I gave you a low oxygen mixture For a couple of minutes, your breathing level would go up because you'd you wouldn't you wanna have more oxygen. Air. Yeah. No. You're starving for Oxytribe.[1:32:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: Okay? And for a couple of minutes, you go up, you can reach some steady state level. Not so hypoxic that you can't reach an equilibrium. And then I give you room air again, your ventilation quickly relaxes back down to normal. If on the other hand, I gave you 3 minutes of hypoxia, 5 minutes of normoxia, 3 minutes of hypoxia, 5 minutes to normoxia, 3 minutes hypoxia, 5 minutes to normoxia.[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: Normoxia being normal.[1:32:39] Dr. Jack Feldman: Normal normal air. Your ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. After the last episode, your breathing comes down and doesn't continue to come down, but rises again and stays up for hours. Okay. This is well validated now.[1:32:58] Dr. Jack Feldman: This was originally done in animals, but in humans all the time. It seems to have profound benefit On motor function and cognitive function.[1:33:08] Andrew Huberman: In what direction?[1:33:09] Dr. Jack Feldman: Positive. Positive. I've often toyed with the idea of getting a 5% an 8% auction don't do this, listeners. Getting an 8% auction tank By my desk when I'm writing a grant and doing, like, in blue velvet and, you know, going through the the episodic hypoxia to improve my cognitive function. I certainly could use improvement when I'm writing grants.[1:33:32] Andrew Huberman: But you could do this without the the low oxygen. I mean, you could do this through breath work, presumably.[1:33:38] Dr. Jack Feldman: It's hard to lower your oxygen enough. Okay? We're going in the experimental studies, they typically use 8% oxygen. It's hard to hold your breath long enough. And there is another difference here.[1:33:53] Dr. Jack Feldman: That is what's happening to your c o two levels. When you hold your breath, your oxygen levels are dropping. Your c o two levels are going up. When you're doing episodic, Hypoxia, your c o two levels are gonna stay pretty normal because you're still breathing. It's just the oxygen levels are gone.[1:34:13] Andrew Huberman: So unlike normal conditions, which you described before, where, oxygen is relatively constant and c o two is fluctuating depending on emotional State and activity and things of that sort. In episodic hypoxia, c o two is relatively constant, but you're varying the oxygen level coming into the system quite a bit.[1:34:32] Dr. Jack Feldman: Would say it's relatively I would say c o two is relatively constant, but you're but it's not going to go in a direction which is gonna be significantly Far from normal. Okay. Whereas when you're holding your breath, you're gonna become both hypoxic and hypocapic at the same time.[1:34:49] Andrew Huberman: Should explain to people what hypoxic and hypocapinib are because we haven't[1:34:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: done it. Just the technical term for low levels of oxygen, hyper or you could say hypoxic, low. Hyper is high, so hyperoxia or hypocapia, low c o two or hypercapia, highest levels of c o two. So when you're in episodic hypoxia, if anything, you're gonna become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. And that could have play an influence on this.[1:35:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: One example that, I re I remember, and Gordon will have to forgive me if I'm misquoting this, Is they had a a patient who had a stroke and had Weakness in ankle flexion that is excuse me, ankle extension, to extend the ankle. And so they We had the patient in a seat where they can measure ankle extension, and then, they measured it. And then they exposed the patient to episodic hypoxia, And they measured again the strength of the ankle extension went way up. And so Gordon is looking at this. They're looking at this now for Spinal cord rehab.[1:36:04] Andrew Huberman: And I imagine for all sorts of neuromuscular performance, it it could be beneficial.[1:36:09] Dr. Jack Feldman: Gordon is looking into athletic performance. We have a project which we haven't been able to to push to the next level to do golf. So what we I I think golf?[1:36:20] Andrew Huberman: Because you because you love golf.[1:36:21] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, it's it's because it's motor performance, coordination. So it's not simply running as fast as you can. It's coordination. It's concentration. It's a whole variety of things.[1:36:33] Dr. Jack Feldman: And so the idea would be to get a group of golfers And give them, their placebo controlled. They don't know whether they're breathing a gas mixture, which is just normal air Where hypoxic gas mixture, although they may be able to figure it out based on their response, do it under control circumstances that do it into a net. Measure their length of their drives, their dispersion, and whatnot, and see what happens. Look. If we could find that this works for golfers, Forget about cognitive function.[1:37:05] Dr. Jack Feldman: We could sell this for unbelievable amounts of money.[1:37:09] Andrew Huberman: That sounds like a terrible idea.[1:37:13] Dr. Jack Feldman: By the way, I'm not serious about selling it, but I[1:37:16] Andrew Huberman: I know you're joking. I think maybe people should know that you are joking about that. No. I think that anything that can improve Cognitive and neuromuscular performance is gonna be of interest for a a wide range of both pathologic states like injury, TBI, etcetera. I mean, One of the most frequent questions I get is about recovery from from concussion or traumatic brain injury.[1:37:37] Andrew Huberman: A lot of people think sports. They think football. They think rugby. They think hockey. But if you look at the statistics on traumatic brain injury, most of it is construction workers, car crashes, bicycle accidents.[1:37:48] Andrew Huberman: I mean, It the the sports part of it is a tiny, tiny, minuscule fraction of the total amount of traumatic brain injury out there. I think these protocols tested in the context of golf would be very interesting because of the constraints of the measures, as you mentioned, and and it could be exported to a number of things. I wanna just try and imagine whether or not there is any kind of breathing pattern or breathwork, Just to be direct about it, that even partially mimics what you described in terms of episodic hypoxia. I've done a lot of Tummo Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before. My lab studies this in humans, and, what we find is that If people do cyclic hyperventilation, so for for about a minute, then exhale, hold their breath for 15 to 60 seconds depending on what they can do, and just keep repeating that for about 5 minutes, It seems to me that it at least partially mimics the state that you're talking about because afterwards, people report heightened levels of alertness, lower levels of, kind of triggering, due to stressful events.[1:38:54] Andrew Huberman: They feel comfortable at a higher level of autonomic arousal, Cognitive focus, a number of improvements that are pretty impressive that any practitioner of Wim Hof or Touma will be familiar with. Is that pattern of breathing even can we say that it it maps to what you're describing in some general sense?[1:39:12] Dr. Jack Feldman: I Well, the the the expert in this would be Gord Mitchell. I would say it moves in that direction, but it's not as stream because I don't think you can get down to the levels of hypoxia that they do clinically. I know that our pals at our breath collective actually just bought a machine because you buy a machine that does this. I see. And they bought it, and they're gonna do their own self testing to See whether or not this has any effect on anything that they can measure.[1:39:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: Of course, you have to be concerned about self experimentation, but I, I applaud that curiosity in going after it. Hyperbaric chambers.[1:39:52] Andrew Huberman: I hear a lot nowadays about hyperbaric Chambers. People are buying them and using them, and, what are your thoughts on hyperbaric chambers as it relates to any of the Hyper or hypo? Hyperbaric chambers. Okay.[1:40:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: So you're not talking about altitude? No. I don't really have much to say. I mean, your auction levels will probably go up a little bit, And that could have a beneficial effect, but that's way outside my area of comfort.[1:40:17] Andrew Huberman: I think, 2022, I think, is going to be the year of 2 things I keep hearing a lot about, which is the deliberate use of high salt intake, for performance, blood increasing blood volume, etcetera, and hyperbaric chambers seem to be catching on much in the same way that ice baths were in and Sauna seem to be right now. But, anyway, a prediction we can return to at some at some point. I I wanna ask you about, Some of the studies that I've seen out there exploring how deliberately restricting one's breathing to nasal breathing Can do things like improve memory. There's a couple papers in Journal of Neuroscience, which is a respectable journal in our field. One looking at olfactory memory, so That kind of made sense because you can smell things better through your nose than your mouth unless you're some sort of, you know, elk or something that where they can, Presumably, they have some sense of smell in their mouth as well, but, humans generally smell with their nose.[1:41:13] Andrew Huberman: That wasn't terribly surprising, but there was a companion study that showed that The hippocampus, an area involved in encoding memories in one form or another, was more active, if you will, and, memory and, recall was better when people learned information while nasal breathing as opposed to mouth breathing. Does that make sense, from any mechanistic perspective?[1:41:36] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, given that there are there's a major pathway going from the olfactory system into the brain, And you cut that and and not one from any receptors in the mouth. The degree of Respiratory modulation you're gonna see throughout the forebrain is gonna be less with mouth breathing than nose breathing. So it it's certainly plausible. I I I think there is there are A lot a lot of experiments that need to be done to distinguish between the 2 that is the the nasal component and the nonasal component of these breathing related signals. There's a tendency sometimes when you have a strong effect to be exclusive.[1:42:33] Dr. Jack Feldman: And I think what's going on here is that there are many inputs that can have an effect. Now whether they're parcel that Some affect this part of behaviour and some affect that part of behaviour remains to be investigated. There's certainly a strong olfactory component. My interest is trying to follow the central component because we know that there's a strong central component in this. In fact, there's a strong central projection to the olfactory bulb.[1:43:02] Dr. Jack Feldman: So regardless of whether or not there's any airflow in and out of the nose, There's a respiratory input into the olfactory bulb, which combines with the respiratory modulated signals coming from the sensory receptors.[1:43:15] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. And as long as we are, poking around, forgive the pun, the nose, what about One nostril versus the other nostril. I know it sounds a little crazy to imagine, but there have been theories in, yoga traditions and others that Breathing through 1 nostril somehow activate certain brain centers, maybe hemispherically one side of the brain versus the other, or that Right nostril and left nostril breathing might, differ in terms of the levels of alertness or calmness they produce. I'm not aware of any mechanistic data on that, but if there's anything, worthwhile about right nostril versus left nostril breathing That you're aware of, I'd love to know.[1:43:57] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, it it's certainly plausible. I don't know of any data demonstrating it except the anecdotal reports. The the as you know, the brain is highly lateralized, and we have, you know, speech on one side and, you know, a dominant hand is on one side. And so the notion that if you you have this huge signal coming from the olfactory system And it to some degree, it's lateralized. It's not perfectly symmetrical.[1:44:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: That is one side is not going evenly to both sides, Then you can imagine. And once the signal gets, distributed in a way that's not uniform, That the effectiveness or the response is gonna be particular to the cortex in which, either the signal still remains Where the signal is removed from.[1:44:50] Andrew Huberman: I see. What are some of the other features of our brain and body, Be it blinking or eye movements or, ability to encode sounds or Any features of the way that we function and move and perceive things that are coordinated with breathing in some interesting way?[1:45:14] Dr. Jack Feldman: Thank you for that question. Almost everything. So we have, for example, On the autonomic side, we have respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That is during expiration, the heart slows down. Your pupils oscillate with the respiratory cycle.[1:45:35] Dr. Jack Feldman: I don't know what the functional basis for that is, but They do oscillate with the respiratory cycle.[1:45:40] Andrew Huberman: When we inhale our people's constrict, presumably, because there's an increase in in heart rate and sympathetic tone, I would think of constriction. I'm guessing as you relax, the pupil will get and you exhale the pupil[1:45:50] Dr. Jack Feldman: will get you're right, but I always get, you know, I always get the, valence of that[1:45:54] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's it's counterintuitive because people wouldn't think When the pupils get, I mean, it depends. I mean, well, you can get very, alert and aroused in that for stress or for good reasons, and the pupils get wider, but your visual field narrows, and then the opposite is true. Anyway, I they I guess the idea is that the pupils are changing size, and therefore, the aperture of your visual window is changing in in coordination with breathing.[1:46:19] Dr. Jack Feldman: Okay. Your fear response Changes with the respiratory cycle.[1:46:25] Andrew Huberman: Tell us more about that.[1:46:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, there's a paper by, Zalano, which I think showed rather clearly that if you show individuals, fearful faces That their measured response of fearfulness changes between inspiration and expiration. You know, I don't know why, but it does. Your your, reaction time Changes. So you talk about blinking, the reaction time changes between inspiration and expiration. You're if I ask you to punch something, The time will change between inspiration and exploration.[1:47:08] Dr. Jack Feldman: In fact, I don't know the degree to which martial artists exploit that. You know, you watch the breathing pattern, and Your your opponent will actually move slower during 1 cycle compared to the other.[1:47:21] Andrew Huberman: Meaning, as they're In which direction? If they're exhaling, they can they can punch faster.[1:47:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: I have to say, I I don't keep a table of which is which direction things move in because Okay. I'm out of the martial arts field now.[1:47:34] Andrew Huberman: My, vague understanding is that exhales on strikes is the more typical, way to, to do that. And so as people strike, they exhale, in many As[1:47:48] Dr. Jack Feldman: you you exhale, but There there are there are other components to striking because you wanna stiffen your your rib cage. You wanna make a Valsalva maneuver. So that's, You know, both an inspiration and an exploration is at the same time. So I don't I I don't I don't know enough about When you say during exploration, I would assume that when you make your strike, you actually sort of wanna stiffen here, which is a Valsalvan like maneuver.[1:48:16] Andrew Huberman: Oftentimes, they'll clench their fist at the last moment because anyway, there's a a whole set of motor, things that we we should we can talk to some fighters. We we know people who know fighters, So we can ask them. Interesting. What are some other, things that are modulated by breathing?[1:48:32] Dr. Jack Feldman: You know, I think anything anyone looks at seems to have a breathing component because It's all over your brain, and it's hard to imagine it not being effective. Now whether it's incidental or, Just background and doesn't really have any behavioral advantage It's possible. In other cases, it might have a behavioral advantage. I mean, the the the biggest, eye opening thing for me, Probably a decade ago, I was digging into literature and and seeing how much of cortical activity And subcortical activity had a respiratory modulated component to it. And I think a lot of my colleagues who are studying cortex are Oblivious to this.[1:49:27] Dr. Jack Feldman: And, they they find I heard a talk the other day with a person who go unnamed. We find a lot of things correlated with, a particular movement. And I think it all when I looked, I said, Gee, that's a list of things that are respiratory modulated. And rather than it being correlated to the movement that we're looking at, I think the movement they were looking at was modulated by breathing as was everything else. So there wasn't that the movement itself was driving that correlation, it was that they were all correlated to something else, which is the breathing movement.[1:50:04] Dr. Jack Feldman: And whether or not that is a behaviorally relevant or behaviorally something you can exploit, I don't[1:50:11] Andrew Huberman: know. I suspect you're right, that breathing is, if not the Foundational driver of many, if not all of these things, that it's at least one of the foundational drivers.[1:50:22] Dr. Jack Feldman: In the background. It's in the brain, and, I oscillations play an important part in brain function, and they vary in frequency from maybe a 100 hertz, down to well, we can get to circadian and, you know, sort of monthly cycles. But breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that because so let me talk about what the When people think the oscillations are doing, particularly the faster ones, they're important in coordinating signals across neurons. Just like in a computer, a computer steps. So a computer knows when information is coming from another part of a computer that it was originated at a particular time.[1:51:11] Dr. Jack Feldman: And so that discreet step by step thing is important in computer control. Now the brain is not a digital Device. It's an analog device. But when I have a signal that I that coming in my ear and my eye, which is Andrew Huberman speaking, and I'm looking at his face. I see that as a whole, but the signal is coming into different parts of my brain.[1:51:33] Dr. Jack Feldman: How do I unify that? Well, my neurons are very sensitive to changes in signals arriving by fractions of a millisecond. How do we ensure that those signals coming in represent the same signal? Well, if I have throughout my brain an oscillation And the signals ride on that oscillation, let's say, the peak of the oscillation, I can then have a much better handle on the relative timing and say, Those 2 signals came in at the same time. They may relate to the same object, and, I see you as one unified thing spouting, you know, talking.[1:52:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: And so these oscillations come in many different frequency ranges and are important in memory formation and all sorts of things. I don't think people pay much attention to breathing because it's relatively slow to to this, the range when you think about Milliseconds. But we have important things that are thought to be important in Cognitive function, which are a few cycles per second to 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second. Breathing in humans is Maybe 0.2 cycles per second every 5 seconds. Although in rodents, they're up to 4 per second, which is pretty fast.[1:52:53] Dr. Jack Feldman: So but breathing has one thing which is special that is you can readily change it. So the degree to which the brain is using that slow signal for anything, if that becomes part of its normal signal processing, You now change it. That signal processing has to change. And as that signal processing changes, Acutely, there's a change. So, you know, you asked about breath practice.[1:53:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: How long do you have to do it? Well, a single breath will change your state. You know, you're nervous. You take a deep breath, And it seems to help relax so he[1:53:38] Andrew Huberman: can die.[1:53:41] Dr. Jack Feldman: Call it what you will. Call it what you will. It seems to work. Now it's not it doesn't have a permanent change, but, you know, when I'm getting up to bat or getting up to the 1st tee or getting to give a big Talk or coming to do a podcast, get a little bit anxious, a a deep breath or a few deep breaths are Tremendously effective in calming one down. And so, you can get a transient disruption.[1:54:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: But on the other hand, let's take something like depression. I think it's you can envision depression as activities sort of going around in a circuit. And because it's continuous in the nervous system as signals keep repeating, they tend to get stronger. And they get so strong, you can't break them. So you can imagine depression being a something going on and on and on, and you can't break it.[1:54:44] Dr. Jack Feldman: And so we have trouble when we get to certain levels of depression. I mean, all of us get depressed at some point. But if it's not continuous, it's not long lasting, We're able to break it. But if it's long lasting and very deep, we can't break it. So the question is, how do we break it?[1:55:00] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, there are extreme measures to break it. We could do electroconvulsive shock. We shock the whole brain. That's disrupting activity in the whole brain. And when the circuit starts to get back together again, it's been disruptive.[1:55:15] Dr. Jack Feldman: And we know that The brain, when signals get disrupted a little bit, we can weaken the connections. And weakening the connections of his son and the circuit evolved in depression, We may get some relief. An electroconvulsive shop shop does work for relieving many kinds of depression. That's pretty heroic. Focal, deep brain stimulation does the same thing, but more localized or transcranial stimulation.[1:55:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: You're disrupting a network, and while it's getting back together, it may weaken some of the connections. If breathing is playing some role in this circuit, and now instead of doing, like, a, You know, one second shock, I do 30 minutes of disruption by doing slow breathing or other breathing practice. The those circuits begin to break down a little bit, and I get some relief. And if I do continue to do it Before the circuit can then build back up again, I gradually can wear that circuit down. I I sort of liken this.[1:56:22] Dr. Jack Feldman: I tell people it's like walking around on a dirt path. You build a rut. The rut gets so deep, you can't get out of it. And what breathing is doing is sort of filling in the rut bit I bet to the point that you can climb out of that rut, and that is because breathing the breathing signal is playing some role in this way the circuit works. And then when you disrupt it, the circuit gets a little thrown off kilter.[1:56:49] Dr. Jack Feldman: And when as you know, when this when circuits get thrown off, the nervous system tries to adjust in some way or another. And it Turns out, at least for breathing, for some evolutionary reason or just by happenstance, it seems to improve our emotional function our our cognitive function, and, you know, we're very fortunate that that's the case.[1:57:13] Andrew Huberman: It's a Terrific segue into what I wanna ask you next, and this is, part of a set of questions I wanna make sure we touch on before we wrap up, which is, what do you do with all this knowledge in terms of a breathing practice? You mentioned that 1 breath can shift your brain state, and that itself can be powerful. I think that's absolutely true. You've also talked about 30 minute breath breathwork practices, which is 3 minutes of breath work is a pretty serious commitment, I think, but it's doable. Certainly a zero cost except for the time, for In most cases, what do you see out there in the landscape of breath work that's being done that you like, and why do you like it?[1:58:01] Andrew Huberman: What do you think you or what would you like to see more of in terms of exploration of breath work, and what do you do?[1:58:11] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, I'm a relatively new convert to breathwork. Through my own investigation of of it, I became convinced that it's real. And, I'm basically a beginner In terms of my own practice, and I like to keep things simple, and I think I've discussed this with you before. I liken it to someone who's a couch potato who's told they gotta begin to exercise. You don't go out and run a marathon.[1:58:42] Dr. Jack Feldman: So, you know, couch potatoes say, okay. Get up and walk for 5 minutes and 10 minutes. And then, okay, now you're walking for a longer period, you begin to run. And then You reached a point and say, well, gee, I'm interested in this sport, and there may be particular kinds of practices that you can use that could, be helpful in in optimizing performance with that sport. I'm not there yet.[1:59:06] Dr. Jack Feldman: I find I get tremendous benefit by Relatively short periods between 5 and maybe 20 minutes of doing box breathing. It's very simple to do. I have a simple app which helps me keep the timing.[1:59:24] Andrew Huberman: Do you recall what app it is? Is it the apnea trainer?[1:59:27] Dr. Jack Feldman: Is that the one? Well, I was using Calm for a long time, but I let my subscription relapse. And I have another one whose name I I don't remember, but, it it's so it's very simple, and it works for me. Now trying this 2 mole Because I'm just curious in exploring it because of it may be acting for a different way, and I wanna see if I I respond differently. So I I don't have a particular point of view now.[1:59:57] Dr. Jack Feldman: I have friends and colleagues who are into, You know, particular styles like Wim Hof, and I think what he's doing is great in getting people who are interested. I think the notion is that I would like to see more people exploring this. And to some degree, as you point out, thirty Minutes a day, some of the breath patterns that, some of these stars like Wim Hof are a little intimidating to newbies, and so I would like to see something very simple that peep what I tell my friends is, look. Just try it 5 or 10 minutes. See if you feel Better do it for a few days.[2:00:37] Dr. Jack Feldman: If you don't like it, stop it. It doesn't cost anything. And, invariably, they find that it's helpful. I will often interrupt my day To take 5 or 10 minutes, like, if I find that I'm lagging. You know, there's a I think there's some pretty good data that Your performance after lunch declines.[2:01:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: And so very often, what I'll do after lunch, which I didn't do today, is take 5 or 10 minutes and just breath practice.[2:01:10] Andrew Huberman: And and and Lately, what the what does that breath practice look like?[2:01:13] Dr. Jack Feldman: It's just box breathing for 5 or 10 minutes.[2:01:15] Andrew Huberman: And your the duration of inhales and holds and exhales and holds is set by the app. Is that right?[2:01:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, I I do 5 seconds.[2:01:22] Andrew Huberman: So 5 seconds, inhale, 5 second hold, 5 second exhale. 5 5 second exhale.[2:01:28] Dr. Jack Feldman: And sometimes I'll do doubles. I'll do 10 seconds, Just because I I I get bored, you know, it's just I I feel like doing it. And it's it's, It's very it's very helpful. I mean, it now that's not the only thing I do with respect to trying to maintain my sanity and my health.[2:01:49] Andrew Huberman: No. I can imagine Imagine there[2:01:50] Dr. Jack Feldman: could be[2:01:50] Andrew Huberman: a number of things. Although you seem because you seem very sane and very healthy, I, in fact, know that you are. Both those things[2:01:58] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, you suspect that I[2:01:59] Andrew Huberman: I suspect, but there's data. A while back, We had a conversation, casual conversation, but you said something that really stuck in my mind, which is that it might be that The specific pattern of breath work that one does is not as important as experiencing transitions between states based on deliberate breath work or something to that extent, which I interpreted to mean that if I were to do box breathing with 5 2nd in, 5 second hold, 5 second exhale, 5 second hold for a couple of days or maybe even a couple of minutes, and then switch to 10 seconds or then switch to tummo, That there's something powerful, perhaps, in the in the transitions and realizing the relationship between different patterns of breathing in those transitions, much in the same way that, you can get onto, into one of these cars at an amusement park that just goes at a constant rate and then stops. Very different than learning how to shift gears. You know? I used to drive a manual.[2:03:00] Andrew Huberman: I still can, so I'm thinking about a manual transmission. But even with an automatic transmission, you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves under different conditions. And I thought that was a beautiful, seed for a potential breathwork practice that, at least in my awareness, nobody has really formalized, which is that you introduce some variability within the practice that's somewhat random in order to be able to sense the relationship between different speeds and depths So inhales, exhales, and holds, and so forth. And, essentially, it's like driving around the track, but with obstacles, at different rates and breaking and restarting and things of that sort. How you learn how to drive.[2:03:35] Andrew Huberman: What do you think about that? And, if you, like it enough, can we call it the Feldman protocol?[2:03:41] Dr. Jack Feldman: Oh, please. You know, I was asked, in this BBC interview once. Why didn't I name it the Feldman complex So the pre Botzu complex[2:03:52] Andrew Huberman: You said I already have a Feldman complex.[2:03:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, it sounds like a psychiatric disorder, but but, I I think the primary effect is this disruptive effect which I described. And but The particular responses may clearly vary depending on what that disruption is. I don't know of any particular data which are some well controlled experiments, which can actually Work through the different types of breathing patterns or simply with a box pattern just varying the durations. I mean, Krayama is sort of Similar, but the the amount of time you spend going around the box is different. So I I don't really have much to say about this.[2:04:38] Dr. Jack Feldman: I mean, this is why we need Better controlled experiments in humans, and I think this is where being able to study it in rodents where you can have a Wide range of perturbations while you're doing more invasive studies to really get down as to Which regions are affected? How is the signal processing disrupted? Which is still a hypothesis, but how it's disrupted Could tell us a lot about you know, maybe there's a resonant point at which there's an optimal effect when you take a particular breathing practice. And then when we talked about, you know, the the fact that different breathing practices could be affecting the outcomes through different pathways. You know, you have the olfactory pathway.[2:05:30] Dr. Jack Feldman: You have a central pathway. You have a vagal pathway. You have a descending pathway. How different practices may change the the summation of those things because all think all those things are probably involved, and we're just beginning to scratch the surface. And, I just hope that we can get serious neuroscientists and psychologists to do the right experiments to get at this because I think there's a lot of value To human health here.[2:06:05] Andrew Huberman: I do too. And, it's one of the reasons my lab has shifted to these sorts of things in humans. I'm delighted that you're continuing to do the Hardcore mechanistic work in mice and probably you'll do work in humans all as well if you're not already. And there are other groups, EPEL Lab at UCSF and a number of. Starting to see some papers out there about respiration in humans a little bit, some more brain imaging.[2:06:28] Andrew Huberman: I can't help but ask about a Somewhat unrelated topic, but it is, important in light of this conversation because you're here. And one of the things that I Really enjoy about conversations with you, as it relates to health and neuroscience and, and so forth is that, No. You're one of the few colleagues I have who openly admits to, exploring supplementation. I'm I'm a long time, supplement fan. I think there there's power in compounds, Both prescription, nonprescription, natural synthesized, I don't use these haphazardly, but I think there is certainly power in in them.[2:07:13] Andrew Huberman: And one of the Places where you and I converge is in terms of our interest in the nervous system and supplementation is, vis a vis magnesium. Now I've talked at you know, endlessly, on the podcast and elsewhere about magnesium for sake of sleep and improving transit transitions to sleep and and so forth. But you have a, somewhat different interest in magnesium As it relates to cognitive function and durability of cognitive function, would you mind just sharing with us a little bit about what that interest is, where where it stems from? And because it's this because it's the Huberman Lab Podcast and we often talk about supplementation, what, what you do with that information?[2:07:54] Dr. Jack Feldman: So I need to disclose that I am a scientific adviser to a company called NeuroCentria, which my graduate student, Khosang Liu, was CEO. So that said, I can give you some background. Guosong, although he when he was in my lab, worked on breathing, had a deep interest in Learning a memory. When we left my lab, he went to work for it with a renowned learning a memory guy at Stanford, Dick Chen. And when he, finished there, he was hired by Sesuma Tonogawa at MIT.[2:08:29] Andrew Huberman: Who also knows a thing or two about memory. I'm teasing. Sesuma has a Nobel for his work on immunoglobulins, but then as a world class memory researcher. Yeah. And more.[2:08:42] Andrew Huberman: He's many things.[2:08:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: And and Gwasong had very curious, very bright guy, and He was interested in how signals between neurons get strengthened, which is called long term potentiation or LTP. And one of the the questions that arose was if I have inputs to a neuron And I get LTP. Is the LTP bigger if the signal is bigger or the noise is less. So we can imagine that, when we're listening to something, if it's louder, we can hear it better, or if there's less noise, we can hear it better. And he wanted to investigate this.[2:09:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: So he did this in tissue culture of hip hippocampal neurons. And what he found was that If he lowered the background activity in all of the neurons that the LTP He elicited got stronger. And the way he did that was increasing the level of magnesium in the bathing solution. This gets into some esoteric, electrophysiology, but, basically, there's a background level of noise in all neurons, and that part of it is regulated by the degree of magnesium in the extracellular bath.[2:10:07] Andrew Huberman: And you mean x, you mean electrical noise?[2:10:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: Electrical noise. I'm sorry. Electrical noise. And if you in what's called the physiological range, Which is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar, which don't worry about the number.[2:10:24] Andrew Huberman: Remember the millimolar of the magnesium Well,[2:10:26] Dr. Jack Feldman: I I'm always frightened that I Get you know, I say micro or femto or something. I go off by several loads of magnitude. But, so in that physiological range, There's a big difference in the amount of noise in a neuron between 0.8 and 1.2 millimole. So he played around with the magnesium, and he found out that when the magnesium was elevated, there was more LTP. Alright.[2:10:52] Dr. Jack Feldman: That's an observation in a tissue culture. Right.[2:10:55] Andrew Huberman: And I should just mention that more LTP essentially translates to more neuroplasticity, more rewiring of connections Okay. In in essence.[2:11:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: So he, tested this in mice. And, basically, he offered them a, he had control mice, which got a normal diet and one that had one enriched in magnesium. And the ones that lived, enriched with magnesium, had higher cognitive function, live longer, everything you'd want in some magic pill. Those mice did that. Excuse me.[2:11:31] Dr. Jack Feldman: Rats. The problem was that you couldn't Imagine taking this into humans because most magnesium salts don't passively get from the gut Into the bloodstream, into the brain. They pass via a what's called a transporter. Transporter is something in a membrane that grabs A, magnesium molecule or atom and pulls it into the other side. So if you imagine you have magnesium in your gut, You have transporters that pull the magnesium gut into the bloodstream.[2:12:10] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, if you had to take a normal magnesium Supplement that you can buy at the pharmacy, it doesn't cross the gut very easily. And if you would take enough of it to get it in your bloodstream, You start getting diarrhea, so it's not a a a good way to go. Oh, it[2:12:29] Andrew Huberman: is a good way to go. Oh, Couldn't help myself.[2:12:34] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well said. So he worked with this brilliant chemist, Faye Mao. And, Faye looked at a whole range of magnesium compounds, and he found the magnesium threonate was much more effective in crossing this the, gut blood barrier. Now they didn't realize at the time, but Threonate is a metabolite of vitamin c, and there's lots of threonate in your body. So magnesium threonate would appear to be safe And maybe, part of the role or the now they believe it's part the role of the threonate is that it supercharges the transporter to get the magnesium in.[2:13:21] Dr. Jack Feldman: And remember, you need a transporter at the gut Into the brain and into cells. So they gave Magnesium threonate to mice, who had, no. Let me backtrack a bit. They did a study in humans. They hired a, a company to do a test.[2:13:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: It was a hands off test. It's one of these companies that gets hired by the big pharma to do their test for them. And they got patients who had were diagnosed as mild cognitive decline. These are people who had cognitive disorder, which was age inappropriate. And the the metric that they use for, Determining how far off they were is Spearman's g factor, which is a Generalized measure of intelligence that most psychologists accept.[2:14:20] Dr. Jack Feldman: And the biological age of the subjects was, I think, 51, and the cognitive age was 61 based on the Spearman g's test. Or I should say, the Spearman g factor Starts at a particular level in the population at age 20 and declines about 1% a year. So Sorry to say we're not 20 year olds anymore. But when you get a number from that, you can put on the curve and whether it you're it's about your age or not. These people were about 10 years older according to that metric.[2:15:00] Dr. Jack Feldman: And Long story short, after 3 months, this is a placebo controlled double blind study. The people who were in the Placebo arm improved 2 years, which is common for human studies because of placebo effect. The people who got the compound improved 8 years on average, And some improved more than 8 years. They didn't do any further diagnosis as to what caused the myoclonal decline, but it was pretty it was extraordinarily impressive.[2:15:36] Andrew Huberman: So it moved their cognition closer to their[2:15:38] Dr. Jack Feldman: biological age. Biological age. Do you recall what[2:15:42] Andrew Huberman: the doses of magnesium 3 in a[2:15:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: It's in the it's in the paper, and it's basically what they have in the compound which is sold commercially. So the compound which is sold commercially is, handled by a nutraceutical wholesaler who sells it to the retailers, and they make whatever formulation they want. But, it's it's a dosage which, is, my understanding, Israeli tolerable. I take half a dose. The reason I take half a dose is that I had my magnesium blood magnesium measured, And, it was low normal for my age.[2:16:25] Dr. Jack Feldman: I took half a dose. It became high normal, And I felt comfortable staying in the normal range, but, you know, a lot of people are taking the full dose and, And, for at my age, I'm not looking to get smarter. I'm looking to decline more slowly. And it's hard as you know, it's hard for me to tell you whether or not it's effective or not.[2:16:50] Andrew Huberman: Well, you remembered the millimolar of the magnesium in the solution and on the high and end. So I would say, it's not a well controlled study, when it's an n of 1, but, it seems to be working.[2:17:04] Dr. Jack Feldman: When I when I've recommended it to my friends, academics who were not by nature skeptical, if not cynical, And I insist that they try it. They usually don't report a major change in their cognitive function, although sometimes they do report, well, I feel a little bit more alert, and my my physical movements are better, but many of them report they sleep better.[2:17:28] Andrew Huberman: And and That makes sense. I think, there's good evidence that 3 and 8 can, accelerate the transition into sleep and maybe even, access to Deeper, modes of sleep, for some people. There, for many people, actually, a small percentage of people who take three and eight, including one of our, podcast staff, here have stomach issues with it. They can't tolerate it. So I would say, just anecdotally, about 5% of people don't Tolerate three and eight well.[2:17:57] Andrew Huberman: Stop taking, and then they're fine. It caused them diarrhea or something of that sort. But most people tolerate it well, and most people Report that it it vastly improves their sleep. And, again, that's anecdotally. There are a few studies, and they're more on the way.[2:18:10] Andrew Huberman: But this that's very interesting because I, until you and I had the discussion about 3 and 8, I wasn't, aware of the, cognitive enhancing effects. But the story makes sense from a mechanistic perspective, it brings it around to a a bigger and more important statement, which is that I so appreciate your Attention to mechanism. I guess this stems from your early training as a physicist and the desire to get numbers and and to really, parse things at a fine level. So we've covered a lot today. I know there's much more that we could cover.[2:18:45] Andrew Huberman: I'm going to insist on a part 2 at some point, But I really wanna speak on behalf of a huge number of people and just thank you, not just for your time and energy and attention to detail and accuracy and clarity around this topic today. But, also, what I should have said at the beginning, which is that, you know, you really are a pioneer in this field of studying respiration and The mechanisms underlying respiration with modern tools for now for many decades, you know, and the field of neuroscience was, one that was perfectly content to address issues like memory and vision and, you know, sensation, perception, etcetera, but the The respiratory system was largely overlooked for a long time, and and you've just been steadily clipping away and clipping away and much because of the events of Of, related to COVID and a number of other things, and this huge interest in breath work and brain states and wellness, I the field of respiration and interest in respiration has just exploded. So I really wanna extend a sincere thanks. It means a lot to me, and I know to the audience of this podcast that someone with your depth and rigor in this area is both a scientist and a practitioner and that you would share this with us.[2:20:03] Andrew Huberman: So thank you.[2:20:03] Dr. Jack Feldman: Well, I I I wanna thank you. This is actually a great opportunity for me. I've been Isolated my silo for a long time, and it's been a wonderful experience to communicate to people outside the silo than this. And I think that there's a lot that remains to be done, and I enjoy speaking to people who have interest in this. I find the interest to be Quite, mind boggling, and, it's quite wonderful that people are willing to, listen to Things that can be quite esoteric at times, but it gets down to deep things about who we are and how we are gonna live our lives.[2:20:43] Dr. Jack Feldman: I appreciate the opportunity, and I would be delighted to come back at any time.[2:20:48] Andrew Huberman: Wonderful. We will absolutely do it. Thanks again, Jack.[2:20:51] Dr. Jack Feldman: Bye now.[2:20:53] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor Jack Feldman.

During today's podcast and on many previous podcast episodes, we talk about supplements.[2:21:51] Andrew Huberman: While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them. One of the key issues with supplements if you're going to take them is that they be of the utmost quality. For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered with Thorne, t h o r n e. Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality both with Respect to the quality of the ingredients themselves and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients. Why do I say that?[2:22:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, many supplement companies out there List amounts of particular substances on the bottle, and when they've been tested, they do not match up to what's actually in those products. Thorne has the highest levels of stringency for quality and the particular amounts that are in each product. They partnered with the Mayo Clinic and all the major sports teams, so there's tremendous trust in Thorne products. That's why we partnered with them. If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.com slash the letter u slash Huberman.[2:22:43] Andrew Huberman: You can see the supplements that I take from Thorne.

If you go in through thorne.com/u/huberman, you'll also get 20% off any of the products that Thorn makes. I also want to just mention one more time the program that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, which is Our Breadth Collective.[2:23:06] Andrew Huberman: The Our Breadth Collective has As an advisory board that includes people like doctor Jack Feldman, where you can learn detailed breath work protocols. If you're interested in doing or teaching breath work, I highly recommend checking it out. You can find it at our breath collective.com/huberman, and that will give you $10 off your 1st month. So I wanna thank you once again for joining me for my conversation with doctor Jack Feldman, and last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
