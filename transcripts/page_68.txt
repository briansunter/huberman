I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor Andy Galpin. Doctor Galpin is a full and tenured professor in the department of kinesiology at California State University in Fullerton. He is also a world expert In all things exercise science and kinesiology.[0:00:29] Andrew Huberman: Today, you are going to hear what is essentially a masterclass in how to build fitness no matter what level of fitness you happen have. He talks about how to build endurance and the multiple types of endurance. He talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy, which is the growth of muscle fibers. So if you're seeking to get stronger or build bigger muscles or build endurance or all of those things, today, you're going to learn how. Also going to learn how to build flexibility, how to hydrate properly for exercise, and we'll also talk about nutrition and supplementation.[0:01:00] Andrew Huberman: What makes doctor Galpin so unique is his ability to span all levels of exercise science. He has the ability to clearly communicate The sets and repetition schemes that one would wanna follow, for instance, to build more strength or to build larger muscles. He also clearly describes That's exactly how to train if you want to build more endurance or enhance cardiovascular function. What's highly unique about doctor Galpin and the information he teaches And the way he communicates that information is that he can take specific recommendations of how recreational exercisers or even professional athletes ought to Train for their specific goals and link that to specific mechanisms, that is the specific changes that need to occur in the nervous system and in muscle fibers It's truly rare to find somebody that can span so many different levels of analyses and who is able to communicate all those levels of understanding in such a clear and actionable way. Indeed, doctor Galpin is one of just a handful of people to which I and many others look when they want to make sure that the information that they're getting about exercise is gleaned from quality peer reviewed studies, hands on experience with a wide variety of research subjects, meaning everyday people all the way up to professional athletes in a wide variety of sports.[0:02:22] Andrew Huberman: So it's no surprise that he's not only one of the most knowledgeable, but also the most trusted voices exercise science. Doctor Galpin is also an avid communicator of zero cost to consumer information about exercise science. You can find him on Instagram at doctor Andy Galpin and also on Twitter at doctor Andy Galpin. Both places, he provides terrific information about recent studies both from his laboratory and from other Laboratories, more in-depth protocols of the sort that you'll hear about today. So if you're not already following him, be sure to do so.[0:02:52] Andrew Huberman: He provides Only the best information is extremely nuanced and precise and clear in delivering that information. I'm certain that by the end of today's conversation, You'll come away with a tremendous amount of new knowledge that you can devote to your exercise pursuits. I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting 2 live events this May. The 1st live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington on May 17th. The 2nd live event will be hosted in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.[0:03:18] Andrew Huberman: Both are part of a lecture series entitled The Brain Body Contract, during which I will discuss science and science based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. I should point out that while some of the material I'll cover will overlap with information covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast and on various social media posts, Most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere. So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th, Portland on May eighteenth, you can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com/tour, and I hope to see you there. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.[0:04:05] Andrew Huberman: In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs.[0:04:27] Andrew Huberman: It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go athletic greens.com/huberman and claim a special offer.[0:05:00] Andrew Huberman: They'll give you 5 free travel packs, which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, Plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two. There are ton of data now showing that vitamin d three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three. And k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athletic greens.com/huberman to claim the special offer of the 5 free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:05:32] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes what are called nootropics, which means smart drugs. Now to be honest, I am not a fan of the term Nootropics. I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that I don't believe that there's any one substance or collection of substances that can make us Smarter. I do believe based on science, however, that there are particular neural circuits and brain functions that allow us to be more focused, More alert, access creativity, be more motivated, etcetera.[0:06:00] Andrew Huberman: That's just the way that the brain works. Different neural circuits for different brain states. And so the idea of a nootropic that's just gonna us smarter all around fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things. Right? If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math, you're doing accounting, a different part of the day, you need to be creative.[0:06:15] Andrew Huberman: These are all different brain processes. Thesis understands this. And as far as I know, they're the 1st nootropics company To create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes. They only use the highest quality ingredients, which, of course, is essential. Some of those I've talked about on the podcast, things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, Phosphatidylserine.[0:06:33] Andrew Huberman: They give you the ability to try several different blends over the course of a month, discover which nootropics work best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals, And with that personalization, design a kit of nootropics that's ideal for the different brain and body states you wanna access. I've been using Thesis for more than 6 months now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a total game changer. My go to formula is the Clarity formula or sometimes I'll use their energy formula beef before training. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to take thesis.com/huberman. Take a 3 minute quiz, and Thesis will send you 4 different formulas to try in your 1st month.[0:07:10] Andrew Huberman: That's takethesis.com/huberman and use the code Huberman at checkout For 10% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes Data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. What's unique about InsideTracker is that while there are a lot of different Tests out there for hormones and metabolic factors, etcetera.[0:07:44] Andrew Huberman: With InsideTracker, you get the numbers back in terms of your levels, but they also give you very clear directives in of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation that can help you bring those values into the ranges that are best for you and your health goals. And that's very different than a lot of the other programs where you get a lot of information, but you don't really know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes that all very easy to understand and very Actionable based on the very easy to use dashboard at InsideTracker.

And now for my discussion with doctor Andy Galpin.[0:08:21] Andrew Huberman: Welcome doctor professor Andy Galpin. It's been a long time coming. We have friends in common, but this is actually the 1st time we've sat down face to face.[0:08:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I'm very excited.[0:08:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. There are only a handful, meaning about 3 or 4 people who I trust enough in the exercise physiology space That when they speak, I not only listen, but I modify my protocols, and you are among those 3 or 4 people. So first of all, a debt of Gratitude. Thank you. You've greatly shaped the protocols that I use, and, I know there's far more for me and for others to learn.[0:08:58] Andrew Huberman: So you're a professor, you teach in university, and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration. Muscle biopsy, literally, images down the microscope all the way to training professional athletes and everything in between. So you are truly an n of 1. And just to start us off, I would love to have you share with us what you think Most everybody or even everybody should know about principles of strength training, principles of endurance training, and principles of, let's call it, hypertrophy power and the other sort of categories of training. And this could be very top contour, but do you think everybody on planet Earth should know about these categories of personal and athletic development?[0:09:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, that's a great first question. Holy cow. I think I'll start it this way. I tend to think about, there's about 9 different adaptations you can get from exercise. Fat loss is not one of those.[0:09:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is a byproduct, but that's not really what I'm getting at. And so we can kinda categorize everything like that. And what we're gonna We can talk about or what are the concepts that you need to hit within each one, and then you could have infinite discussion of the different methodologies. Right? And so that that 1st thing to hit is the concepts are actually fairly few, but the methods are many.[0:10:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? People have said that in iterations throughout time. So if you walk from the very beginning, the first one to think about is what we'll just call skill. So this is improving anything from, say, a golf swing to a squatting technique to running. This is just simply moving mechanically how you want your body to move.[0:10:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm just gonna globally call that skill. From there, we're gonna get into speed. So this is moving as fast as possible. The next one is power, and power is a function of speed, but it's also a function of the next one which is strength. So if you actually multiply strength By speed, you get power.[0:10:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: And the reason I'm making this distinction, by the way, is some of these are very close, and I'm going in a specific order on purpose here. For example, Power is, like I just said, it's a function of speed and strength. So if you get improve speed, you've also likely improved power, But not necessarily. Right? Because it could've come from the forest direction either.[0:11:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's carryover. So, like, a lot of things that you would do for development of strength and power, they are somewhat similar, but then there's differences. Right? So things that you would do correctly for power would really not develop much strength and vice versa. So we can get into all these details later.[0:11:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Once you get past strength, then the next one kinda down the list is hypertrophy. This is muscle size. Right? Growing muscle mass is one way to think about it. After hypertrophy, you get into these categories of the next one is, these are all globally endurance based issues, and the very first one is called muscular endurance.[0:11:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is your ability to do how many push ups can you do in 1 minute, you know, things like that. Past, muscular endurance, You're now into more of an energetic or even cardiovascular fatigue. So you've left the local muscle, and you're now into the entire physiological system and its ability to produce and sustain work. And we can get it to a bunch of differentiations within endurance, but just to keep it really simple right now. The very first one, think about this as, I call this anaerobic power.[0:12:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So this is your ability to produce A lot of work for, say, 30 seconds to maybe 1 minute, kinda 2 minutes like that. The next one down then is more closely aligned what we'll call your v o two max. So this is your ability to kinda do the same thing, but more of a time domain of, say, 3 to 12 minutes. So this is gonna be a maximum heart rate, but it's gonna be well Past just max heart rate.[0:12:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then after that, we have what I call long duration endurance. So this is your ability to sustain work. The time domain doesn't matter in terms of how fast go you're going. It's how how long can you sustain work? This is 30 plus minutes of no break like that.[0:12:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: So as just an high level overview, those are the the different things you can target. And, again, some of those crossover, and some are actually A little bit contrarian to the other ones. So pushing towards 1 is maybe gonna sacrifice something else. So as a as an overall start, that's really what we're looking at. Within all of those, though, they do have similar concepts in terms of there is a handful of things you have got to do to make all of those things work.[0:13:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: We could talk about as many of those as you want, but one of them is functionally called progressive overload. So whichever one you're trying to improve at, If you want to continue to improve, you have to have some method of overload. And as you well know, you've talked about a lot. Adaptation physiologically happens as a byproduct of stress. So you have to push a system.[0:13:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you continue to do, say, the exact same workout over time, You better not expect much improvement. You can keep maintenance, but you're not going to be adding additional stress. So in general, you have to have some sort of progressive load. And we can talk in detail about what that means for each category. But this could come from adding more weights.[0:13:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: This could come from adding more repetitions. It could come from Doing it more often in a week, it could come from adding complexity to the movement. So going from, say, a partial range of motion to a full range of motion or Adding other variables. So there's a lot of different ways to progress, but you have to have some sort of movement forward. So if you have this kind of routine where you've built Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday or something, and you just do that infinitely, you're not going to get very far.[0:14:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's, I guess the most high level overview of all the things people can go after, and then we can go from whatever direction you want from there.[0:14:29] Andrew Huberman: I'd love to do the deep dive on each one of these for several hours, but, and I imagine that over time, we probably will. I'd love to chat about a couple of these in a bit more depth. So in terms of defining what the progressive overload variables or Yeah. For these different categories. Maybe we could hit the, 2 most common combinations of these 9 things.[0:14:54] Andrew Huberman: The first one being, Strength and hypertrophy Yep. And maybe we could lump power in there. Maybe not. You're the you're the exercise physio Yes. Osteologists Yeah.[0:15:04] Andrew Huberman: Strengthen hypertrophy, which at least bear some relationship. Yep. And then maybe separately, we could explore, Sustained work endurance, this 30 minutes or longer continuously because I think many people train in that regime. Yep. And, Probably, something like, VO 2 max anaerobic as well because I know that a number of people now incorporate, so called HIT high intensity interval training, I think with the hopes of either shortening their workouts[0:15:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:15:31] Andrew Huberman: And or, gaining some additional cardiovascular benefit. So if we could start with strength and hypertrophy, I know many people want to be stronger. They want to grow larger muscles or at least maintain what they have. Yeah.[0:15:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what[0:15:43] Andrew Huberman: are the progressive overload principles, that are most effective over time for strength and hypertrophy?[0:15:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Okay. So I'll actually go A little step back. With every one of those categories I talked about, you have what we call your modifiable variables. So this is a very short list of All the things you can modify, the different variables within your workout that can be modified that will change the outcome.[0:16:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: A fancy way of saying, if you do this differently, you're gonna get a different result. So modifiable variables. The very first one of those is called choice. So this is the exercise choice you select. Now one of, I'm gonna go double back here.[0:16:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I'm kinda doing a little bit of inception. So follow me here as I'm going up a layer to come down a couple layers. I have these fundamental laws of strength and conditioning that that all they're kind of like a little bit of a joke, but progressive over those one of those laws. Another one of those laws is Your exercises themselves do not determine adaptations. So here's what I mean.[0:16:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're like, I wanna get stronger, you can't select an exercise. That doesn't determine you getting strong. If you don't do the exercise correctly, and I'm not even referring to the technique. That, of course, matters. But if you don't execute it in the right fashion, then you're not going to get that adaptation.[0:16:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you choose, I wanna get stronger. I'm gonna do a bench press. Well, if you do the wrong Set range, the wrong repetition range, the wrong speed. You won't get strength. You may be get muscular endurance and very little strength adaptation.[0:17:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the exercise selection itself is important, But it does not determine the outcome adaptation. So the very first thing that you need to think about if you're like, I wanna get stronger or add muscle is not the exercise choice. Right. It is the application of the exercise. What are the sets?[0:17:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: What are the reps? What are the, rest ranges that you're using? That's gonna be your primary determinant. Now some exercises are Certainly better for some adaptations. For example, a deadlift is probably not a great exercise to do for long duration endurance.[0:17:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, you could theoretically do 30 straight minutes of deadlifting, but it's Probably not our best choice. Right? It's probably a pretty good choice for strength development. Right? Because you're gonna do a little repetition, high set range.[0:17:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could theoretically do Bicep curls for power, probably not your best choice. Right? Single joint isolation movement is is not the best for developing power. You've ever Ever done a bicep curl as fast as you possibly can? Like, that's not gonna go well.[0:18:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in theory, any exercise can produce any adaptation given the execution is performed properly. So now that we've understood that a little bit, the exercise itself does not determine the adaptation. Coming within each one of these categories, exercise choice is an important variable because it does lend you to things like what movement pattern you're in. What muscle groups do I wanna use? And that's gonna be leading you towards the exercise choice.[0:18:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: For example, I wanna use my quads more. Okay. Fine. Maybe you're gonna choose more of a front squat type of variation, a goblet squat, so the bar the load is in front of you. If you wanna emphasize maybe more of your hamstrings and glutes, you're gonna maybe put A barbell on your back or do a different one.[0:18:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the exercise choice is important to the prescription because it's gonna determine a lot of your success. K. Another of simpler way to think about this. If you're a beginner or moderate to intermediate or maybe you don't have a coach, You probably wanna hedge towards an exercise selection that is a little bit easier technically. So you maybe don't wanna do a barbell back squat.[0:19:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's actually a pretty complicated movement. Something that's a little bit simpler because you don't have a coach, you're not a professional athlete. The likelihood of success is higher and the risk is now gone lower. So the very first variable within all of these is the exercise choice. The second one is the intensity, and that refers to in this context, not perceived effort.[0:19:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, wow. That was a really intense workout. It is quite literally either a percentage of your 1 rep at max or a percentage of your maximum heart rate or VO two max. So for the strength based things, You wanna think about what's percentage of the maximum weight I could lift one time, and that's that's what we're gonna call 1 rep max. Or it's a percentage of my heart rate.[0:19:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So if I tell you to get on a bike, and I want you to do intervals, and I want you at 75%. I'm typically referring to 75% of your max heart rate or VO2 max or, you know, something like that. If I tell you to do squats At 75%, that means 75% of the maximum amount of weight you could lift one time or close.[0:20:12] Andrew Huberman: In terms of Determining 1 rep max. I confess, I've never actually taken the 1 rep max for any exercise, but I have some internal sense of what that Might be or Yeah. What range it might be. Is it necessary for people to assess their one repetition maximum before going into These sorts of programs?[0:20:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. Not at all. I think a more intuitive way is to take a repetition range. Well, you could do this a couple different ways. So there are, equations you can run, and you could just Google these anywhere.[0:20:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: And and these are called conversion charts. And so it says, okay. If I did £75 on my bench press, I did it 8 times. You can just run an estimate to say that, okay. You're probably going to be able to bench about £95 For 1 rep max or something.[0:20:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's a very easy conversion chart. So just pick a little that you feel comfortable with, but it's it's kinda heavy, but not, Like, crazy heavy, and do as many repetitions as you can. What a really good technique. And then look what that number would be. So conversion[0:21:11] Andrew Huberman: safer than doing it 1 1 repetition maximum?[0:21:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: For for the the general public who has, again, no coaching, it's safer. For a professional athlete, it's not any safer, but, or not even a professional athlete, but a trained person with a coach. But for most people, yeah, that's a good way to go about it. You can also just kinda do it with feel in the sense that say you wanna do a set of 5 repetitions, And you do the load and you think, I could've done 1 or 2 more. And then then you kinda have an idea of of what that number is going to be.[0:21:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you think, man, that last 1 I had to kinda really, really, really get after it, then maybe just call that That number. Right? So you don't have to get overly concerned. In fact, when we start getting into these number ranges, you're gonna see that they're all ranges. I we're not gonna give a specific 95% for one of these exact reasons.[0:22:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not that precise, for most of them. In fact, some of them like hypertrophy have enormous ranges that you'd, like, almost can't miss. So the the intensity in that case doesn't even matter for the most part because that's not the primary determinant. Some of these you're gonna see intensity as a determinant, and some of these you're gonna see volume is the true determinant. So Intensity, though, is is a second one.[0:22:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Choice was the very first one, manipulatable variable. Intensity was the second one. The third one is what we call volume. And so this is just how many reps and how many sets are you doing. Right?[0:22:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're gonna do 3 sets of 10, that volume would be 30. Right? Five sets of 5, that volume is 25. It's just a simple equation. How much work are you totally doing?[0:22:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: The next one past that is called rest intervals. This is the amount of time you're taking in between typically a set. Then from there, you have progression, which is what we started to talk about this progressive overload. Are you increasing by weight or reps sore responables or complexity or whatever. So all of those things, can be changed as a method of progression.[0:23:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so maybe you wanna go, progressing from a single joint exercise like a A leg extension on a machine, and you wanna progress by moving to a whole body movement like a squat. That in of itself, you don't have to change the load Or the reps or the rest, that is a representation of progressive overload. And it's probably a pretty good place to start because number 1, especially for beginners, You wanna make sure that the movement pattern is correct. Don't worry about intensity. Don't worry about rep ranges or any of these things.[0:23:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: You need to learn to move correctly, And you need to give your body some time to develop some tissue tolerance so that you're not getting overtly sore. In general, soreness is a terrible proxy For exercise quality, it's a really bad way to estimate whether it was a good or a bad workout, especially for people in that beginner to middle To moderate. In fact, even the bat for our professional athletes, we do not use soreness as a metric of a good workout. It's it's a really bad idea for a bunch of reasons. On the same token because stress is required for adaptation, you don't wanna leave at the gym and feel like, I don't really do much.[0:24:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, There has to be there. So if you think about soreness on a scale of 1 to 10, you probably wanna spend most of your time in, like, the 3.[0:24:16] Andrew Huberman: You mean post exercise?[0:24:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:24:18] Andrew Huberman: In between workouts Totally. And I I know we'll talk about recovery extensively later, but, if 1 body part or set of body parts is sore, Is that an indication that one should stay out of training? I would imagine the answer is no in most cases. And secondarily to that, if a particular muscle is sore, does that mean that muscle is not ready to be trained again?[0:24:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. The answer to both those is the same, which is no. Right? You can certainly train a sore muscle. You you need to, I guess, have a little bit of feel On that, right?[0:24:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if if you're sore of, like, k. Like and you're moving around a little bit, and you're like, man, this is a little bit sore, you can train. If you're like, I can't sit on the couch without crying because my glutes are so sore. Like, we we probably don't need to train again. Right?[0:25:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: We[0:25:06] Andrew Huberman: Does whimpering count as crying?[0:25:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. In that particular case, I'd say you've actually gone to a place of detriment. Because now you're gonna have to skip a training session, And now you're behind. So your actual total volume, say across the month, is actually gonna be lower because you went way too hard in those workouts, had to take too many days off in between. You're gonna see that you're gonna cover less distance over the course of a month or 6 month or even a year.[0:25:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wanna walk a pretty fine line. And for most people, I would say hedge a little bit on the side of Less sore than more sore. Because frequency is very, very important for almost all these adaptations.[0:25:43] Andrew Huberman: Training frequency.[0:25:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Which is the last modifiable variable. Right? Frequency. Which is how many times per week are you are you doing that thing? So those are kind of our our global things that we can play with.[0:25:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So when I'm trying to manipulate and you can get strength versus hypertrophy, or you know what? I want, like, a little bit of both. All those variables are the things that are going through my mind. Which one do I need to move in which direction so that I can get this outcome and not this outcome over here? Example, some folks might wanna get stronger, but not put muscle mass on.[0:26:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some folks are just kinda want both, and that's a lot of the general public. I wanna get a little stronger and a little bit more muscle. Great. But there are instances where people for performance reasons or for purely personal preference, like, I don't wanna get any more muscle. Great.[0:26:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: But I wanna get stronger. Awesome. If you manipulate those variables correctly, you can get exactly that. Very little development of muscle size and a lot of development in strength. And this is why we continue to break World records in sports like powerlifting and weightlifting that have weight classes.[0:26:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's a top number that we can hit in terms of body size, but yet we continue to get stronger and faster. So this is very possible if you understand how to manipulate all those variables. So that being said, we can start off with do you wanted to go strength, then I[0:26:55] Andrew Huberman: can Yes. Strength. And and I'd I love that you mentioned the fact that it is possible to increase strength without increasing muscle size, at least not dramatically, because think it's not just weight class athletes. I know a lot of people who, For aesthetic reasons, they'd like to be stronger. They're hearing that having strong bones and strong muscles and tendons, it's great for longevity and for avoiding injury and so many other features of of life, and, and yet they don't want to fill out progressively larger and larger Totally.[0:27:21] Andrew Huberman: Sizes of clothing.[0:27:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we can go harder to the mechanisms on that piece if you want, and we can save that and come back to it.[0:27:27] Andrew Huberman: Sure. What I'd love to both. What I'd love to know or is If we could define some of these modifiable variables Yep. In the context of strength. So let's say I[0:27:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: we're some Yes. I do.[0:27:38] Andrew Huberman: We're somebody who Yeah. I come to you and I say And and let's just say for sake of of of balance here, because she actually does do some weight training, I bring my sister in, and I say, me and my sister both want to get stronger. Yep. What modifiable variables should, how should we modify the variables?[0:27:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Love it. Alright. Great. I'm gonna do inception on you one more time. So one of my other laws oh, this won't be fast, I promise, of strength and conditioning is in general.[0:28:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: The default is all joints through all range of motion. So this is important because it's gonna answer your very first question on this strength category. So in general, the ankle should go through the range of motion in the ankle. The knee should go through the full range of motion, the knee, the hip, the elbow, etcetera, etcetera. Right?[0:28:21] Andrew Huberman: Across the workout, not in a single movement.[0:28:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well right.[0:28:25] Andrew Huberman: I would hope. Unless there's an amazing exercise I haven't heard about.[0:28:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, there are some exercises that we're gonna call more full body. Think about a full snatch. Like, you're gonna take a lot of your muscles a lot of your joints through a lot of range of motions. Other ones, like in isolation, we call these single joint exercises. So imagine a a bicep curl.[0:28:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have 1 joint in that particular case, the elbow moving, the shoulder, and everything else is pretty much stable. And this is how we differentiate multi joint From single joint movements. But yeah. So across I would even say it doesn't even have to be the day, but maybe throughout the week. Try to get every joint through full range of motion.[0:29:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now a couple of quick caveats to that. I am not advocating Using full range of motion and allowing really bad exercise technique. So when I say full range of motion, that's the default. That doesn't mean every single person can do that for every single exercise. It means that's where we should be striving to, and that's our starting point.[0:29:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna see a lot less injury And a lot more productivity out of your training sessions. In fact, the science is fairly clear on this one. Strength development as well as hypertrophy is generally enhanced with a larger range of motion of training. And the mechanisms are, like, somewhat understood on that. So that being said, If you have to get into, say, a bad right, position with your, say, low back, the spine is a very good one.[0:29:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: In general, the spine should say it's very neutral as we call it. So no no flexion, no extension, especially in the lumbar region. So if you need if you're doing, say, a deadlift, and in order to take your knee through a full range of motion Deadlift, you have to compromise your back position. That's no. So caveats there aside, don't kill me.[0:30:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, in good positions always. Kill yourselves[0:30:06] Andrew Huberman: Yes. More importantly.[0:30:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: So why that matters is if we walk through strength, the very first thing I'm gonna go through is the the exercise selection. So let's Choose an exercise which ideally has a full range of motion or close to it that doesn't induce injury for you, that you can still maintain good neck and Low back and and position and everything else, you feel comfortable with. So you can feel strong, but you don't feel like, oh my gosh. If you've never snatched before, Having you do a snatch for a maximum even, you know, 75%. Like, it's terrible idea.[0:30:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're not gonna feel confident it's gonna be a train wreck. I would rather put you on a machine bent press. So you can go, I feel stable, I feel safe here, and I could just express my strength. So exercise choice in generally, In general, full range of motion, and you wanna kinda balance between the movement areas. So this is an upper body press.[0:30:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is pushing away from you, bench press, Things like that. Upper body pull, pulling an implement towards you. Bent row, pull up. The pressing should be horizontal, So perpendicular to your body as well as vertical. So this is lifting a weight over top of your head, lifting away away from you.[0:31:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: The pull version is pulling horizontally to you and pulling vertically down, pull up, things like that. From the lower body, We typically call these hinges. It's sort of a funny muscle thing that no one's gonna laugh at, but, like, maybe me and you here, is we'll categorize muscles as Our movements, exercises as pushes and pulls. Right? So like a squat is tends to be a push, because you're pushing away the ground.[0:31:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: A deadlift is a pull because you're pulling the implement up to you. But in reality, every single exercise is only ever a pull. Because muscle doesn't push things away. Muscle can only contract and pull on itself. And so, Again, super nerdy thing that, like, most people are like, yeah.[0:31:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: And everyone's like, that's so dumb.[0:31:48] Andrew Huberman: No. But I think it's a really important point because it also, speaks to something I think we'll get into later, which is that, You know, posterior chain, anterior chain Totally. And if that's mysterious to people, it'll become clear, before long. Posterior chain, anterior chain, makes a lot of sense to me because of the way it's grounded in the firing of motor neurons, which is ultimately what controls muscle. So it's[0:32:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: also nerves all the time.[0:32:11] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. So it also depends on the lens through which one looks at life and and exercise. Of course, my lens is primarily neuroscience. So, but I but I realized that the importance I like this idea of Pushing, perpendicular to the body overhead, pulling both toward, toward the body and from overhead, just makes really good intuitive sense, especially since a lot of people were just listening to this and not watching it. So in in your minds, folks, you can think about, Pushing away like a punch or overhead, like lifting something overhead and then pulling toward, your midline or toward your body rather, And then pulling yourself up like a pull up in, PE class for those Yep.[0:32:48] Andrew Huberman: That, that[0:32:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the lower body is the same thing. Right? It's some sort of pushing away, like a a squat or a split squat or a lunge or something like that, and then some sort of, again, what we call pull or hinge. So a deadlift or Romanian deadlift Or a hamstring curl or something where you're contracting and calling pulling the thing. And then and you could split these into, like, a 1000 different categories.[0:33:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're really in that field, you're gonna wanna add a bunch of other ones. But that's just like a rough conception. So if you're going to do a single workout, you could choose 4 exercises, And you could choose 1 of each. 1 press, upper body press, 1 upper body pull, 1 lower body hinge, 1 lower body Press. And and that would be, like, a decently well rounded exercise.[0:33:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's your exercise selection. And if you're taking those through a full range of motion, you're at a pretty good spot as close as you can. The next one is intensity. So if you wanna develop strength, this comes back to But I have to give Heneman some credit here. Right?[0:33:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I know you know who that is.[0:33:50] Andrew Huberman: Heneman's size principle.[0:33:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Of course. Right? So this is a series of papers. I think in the I think it was in nature.[0:33:57] Andrew Huberman: At least some of them. Yeah.[0:33:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. In 1954, 56, or, like, something, you know, you can fact check me. I'm sure you will. But he basically outlined this idea that, Okay. There's a certain recruitment threshold needed for neuron so far, and we have muscle fibers in what we call fast twitch muscle fibers and slow muscle fibers.[0:34:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: And in general, you're going to activate the slow twitch ones first because they tend to be associated with low threshold motor neurons. It's not exactly that way, but it's it's close enough. Right? Well, the only way that you activate some of these higher threshold neurons is to demand the muscle to produce more force, And it's fairly specific to force. Right?[0:34:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not something you can do over an endurance thing. Right? Unless it gets really extreme and particularly happens. So in general, the only way to use these big chunks of your muscle, which are incredibly important for aging, by the way. One of the major problems we have with aging developing Our development of aging related issues with muscle is the fact that we lose fast twitch fibers preferentially.[0:34:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then we have major problems we go down the line because we've lost a big chunk of our strength and size. So you wanna make sure these fibers stay alive and intact. Okay. So with that being said, The only way to develop strength is then to challenge the muscle to produce more total force. If you are fairly untrained or new, I guess I should have stated this all at the beginning as well.[0:35:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: One more inception then I'll stop. When it comes to this level of detail of exercise prescription, a a fairly untrained person is gonna respond basically the same to every single thing you do. In fact, we've done this in the lab many times. We've done training studies doing things like 30 minutes of cycling, and seen huge increases in muscle strength and size, which is not a prescription for most people tins or your size, but people that are really untrained. If you did plyometrics or strength training or endurance running, they all just get better at everything.[0:35:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that caveat kind of aside, If you wanna be more intentional and more specific to this to the goal of strength, you need to produce more force. Specificity matters. Right? So we have Size principle to help understand this. And we have our laws of specificity, which say said principle.[0:36:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Specific adaptation to imposed demand. So the adaptation you get or the result of your training is going to be a reflection of the demand that you imposed. So if you want to get stronger, You need to impose a demand of strength, not repetitions. So this has to be the load has to be very high.[0:36:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: In general, you're probably looking at Above 85% of your winner at max, if you're moderately trained, maybe 75% will work. Lowly trained again, everything works. But in general, we wanna be pressing a load that's very hyped. So because the intensity demand is so high, That is going to enforce you to do a low repetition range. You can't do 12 reps at 95%.[0:36:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: That then it wouldn't be 95% of your one rep max. So by definition, True strength training is really going to be in, like, 5 repetitions per set or less range. That's where most of it's going to occur for specificity. So we've covered choice, Intensity and, repetitions. Right?[0:37:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: The total amount of sets that you do is is really kinda up to your personal fitness level. Right? If you did as little as, like, 3 sets per exercise, that's probably enough.[0:37:16] Andrew Huberman: Work sets.[0:37:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. Yeah. Totally work right. So get fully warmed up and build up to that 85%. Don't just walk into the gym and throw 85% on and go, thank you.[0:37:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's a that's a important distinction. So work your way up. Do some, like, a very classic warm up thing would be, like, a set of 10 at 50%, A set of 8 at 60%, a set of maybe 8 again at 70%, and then maybe, like, a set of 5 at 75%. So 2 or 3 or 4 sets kinda building intensity and lowering rep range, and then you would go after your 2 or 3 working sets. Also, in terms of rest intervals.[0:37:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now because we're trying to the primary driver of strength is intensity. It's it's not the volume. Right? It's the intensity. So in order to maintain that, we have to do a low repetition range.[0:38:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: But in addition, we also have to have a high rest interval. Because if we start to if we have any amount of fatigue incur, and we have to then ease or reduce the reps or reduce the intensity, we've lost the primary driver. We've lost that main signal. So the number we're gonna throw out typically is, like, 2 to 4 minutes. So imagine you did, You know, your set of bench press and you did 5 repetitions at 85%, you probably wanna rest 2 to 4 minutes before coming back to the bench.[0:38:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: That doesn't mean you have to sit there on your phone. Like, act fact, please don't. Like, everyone will thank you for not doing that. I promise. You can engage other muscle groups.[0:38:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is what we call super setting. So you're doing your bench press, and while that 2 minute clock is running for your chest To rest. You can go over and do your deadlifts. And so, you know, you you can kinda move back and forth, and this is how you can make Strength training, not 7 hour workout. If you're a professional athlete, you're gonna take that time because you wanna maximize the outcome.[0:39:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Soup we've done this actually in our lab too. Supersets will reduce the strength gains, but by a tiny amount. And most of us don't care enough Relative to it's going to triple the length of your training session, it's not worth it. So for the average person, I will tell them, yeah, superset. For someone who's trying to break a world record In weight lifting or power lifting, I don't superset.[0:39:23] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Yeah. I think I found that, I don't recover particularly well From strength and hypertrophy training. So[0:39:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, either workout or the next[0:39:32] Andrew Huberman: from workout to workout. Unless I keep the total duration of those workouts, I like to say no more than 60 minutes of work of real work.[0:39:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Yep.[0:39:43] Andrew Huberman: Maybe 75. Past 75, I find that I just start to[0:39:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's a lot.[0:39:46] Andrew Huberman: I have to introduce additional rest days, or I just get weaker over time. So I'd I'd set a Kind of a limit at 50 minutes, and then, I usually violate that limit and end up doing 60 minutes. So I'm, excited to hear that one can superset Exercises as long as they work different muscle groups, of course. Yeah. Right?[0:40:07] Andrew Huberman: So I wouldn't wanna do, like, bench press and overhead press supersetted because you can Yeah. We can eat, I think that This goes without saying for most people, but just to point that out. But that I could, do some push pull push pull without compromising Total intensity that much. And I I certainly would be willing to give up a lit a a rep here or there or a a few, pounds here or there. And may I ask whether or not, in doing that, one gets any even tiny bit or more of Additional benefit in terms of cardiovascular work, because I imagine after all, even a 1 rep max, which I've never done, as I mentioned.[0:40:44] Andrew Huberman: But let's say I get 3 reps on the, overhead press, and then I get, 4 reps on a weighted pull up, and I'm going back and forth. I'm no doubt gonna be breathing harder than if I was sitting there Texting away on my phone Yeah. In between sets.[0:40:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Of course. Yeah. And so in fact, in general, one of the things that I'll present in my class is a giant list of in fact, like, on the top is all these different exercise adaptations I started the conversation with. And on the the vertical column are As many of the physiological potential adaptations one would get.[0:41:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: So changes in endogenous pH, blood pressure, lymphatic changes, Bone density, all these things. Right? And you just have this giant list. And then you can run a matrix, and you can start to look at okay. If I do speed training, am I gonna see changes the nerve nervous system.[0:41:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, like, very much so. Right? That's the primary actual reason those things work. Very little change in the muscle system. It's almost Exclusively explained by the central or peripheral nervous system.[0:41:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? On that same token, are you gonna expect many cardiovascular adaptation from speed? The answer is no because although we didn't cover it, speed is very low intensity, very low rep range, very high rest. Well, as you go to, like, strength and then you go to hypertrophy, you start seeing more and more increases in cardiovascular adaptations because you're doing exactly that. Right?[0:41:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're starting to reduce stress, you're starting to increase volume. But you're gonna lose things like bone mineral adaptations because the load starts to go down. So you can look at this matrix and and kinda understand if I'm a person who wants to kinda maximize the adaptations I get across my entire physiology For the, least amount of work, you can choose these different adaptations to go after that are gonna kinda land on things. Right? And and exactly as you mentioned, if you're going to take 5 minutes rest between each rep.[0:42:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So let's say the extreme, you're going to do 3 sets of 1 repetition for strength at 95%. You're gonna take probably 5, maybe 7 minutes between each attempt. Like, you better not expect many, like, changes in your resting blood pressure that there's no cardiovascular strain there. Gonna put it together in a circuit where you're gonna lose some potential strength adaptation, but you're gonna gain something there. So all these things are it's not about Good or bad or right or wrong.[0:42:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's always about what advantage do you want and what disadvantage do you want. And I can cut, like, really end to the chase here on one of these things because we'll get to this eventually. If you wanna know the ones that are going to generally give you the most physiological adaptations across the most categories,[0:43:20] Andrew Huberman: That's great to know, and we should definitely, go a little bit deeper on those types of, what the modifiable variables are for those categories, because I think that I'm guessing the vast majority of people want to be a bit stronger, maybe add some a little bit of muscle or more, get make sure their heart is healthy and etcetera. This is wonderful, and and I think it's clarifying certainly a lot for me. So for strength, let's, I guess training frequency.[0:43:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Frequency.[0:43:47] Andrew Huberman: So what should determine training frequency? And I had the great, benefit of a long time ago when I was in High school, actually, I paid for a session over the phone with Mike Mentzer. Oh, lovely. Lee Mike Mentzer. Sure.[0:44:01] Andrew Huberman: We got to be friends[0:44:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: before over time.[0:44:04] Andrew Huberman: At the time, I was pretty young, and my mother kept saying, like, why is this, like, grown man calling the house? And then we would talk all the time about training, but he tried to convince me To train once every 5 to 7 days, very few sets, very high intensity, and I must say It worked incredibly well. Sure. It was I think with my recovery, quotient, which was not very good I think it's improved over time, but it was not very good. It was Remarkable.[0:44:31] Andrew Huberman: But, of course, this was a time when I was, you know[0:44:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Full of the most anabolic gene[0:44:35] Andrew Huberman: I've ever had. My own version of of anabolics. Right? I was I was, You know, really had a I had a long arc of puberty.[0:44:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you were untrained?[0:44:43] Andrew Huberman: And I was mostly untrained. I've been running cross country and skateboarding and playing soccer.[0:44:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: So And doing all the things that are, like, the Antithesis of growing muscle.[0:44:50] Andrew Huberman: It was literally and people will probably say impossible. It was something like 40 pounds of muscle inside of 12 months. It was crazy.[0:44:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: I would believe that.[0:44:56] Andrew Huberman: You know? But but and so then, of course, that stopped working over time.[0:45:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Gotcha.[0:45:01] Andrew Huberman: And then you start going down the the, the odyssey of trying to find the thing that's gonna work that well, and you eventually realized that it was because you were untrained. Right? So training frequency is is crucial. Let's say that people are doing these whole body workouts As you've described them, not alternating upper body, lower body, because there's so many different splits that we've talked. It doesn't probably doesn't make sense to go into, splits in in right now.[0:45:26] Andrew Huberman: But how often can can and should one train a muscle, and how do you know if a muscle is recovered locally, And how do you know if your nervous system is recovered systemically?[0:45:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. This is a bunch of really interesting questions. I'm not sure exactly what route you wanna go, so I'll start here. As I Mentioned earlier, soreness is not a good barometer of exercise quality because some types of training are going to induce more soreness and some are going to induce less. That's important to this conversation because when you ask about how do you know if a muscle is ready to train again, one of the questions is, what are you training for?[0:45:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're training for hypertrophy, right, muscle size, muscle growth, we need to hedge towards recovery. Because what you're trying to do is cause a massive insult there, Allow then protein synthesis to occur, building of new tissue which takes time, 48 to 72 hours, like, kind of about a minimum, That process needs to occur. If you're doing actually more strength, and this is a differentiation between hypertrophy and strength, then you didn't induce much damage. In fact, you're generally not going to get very sore from true strength training. Very little.[0:46:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Unless you get really heavy, you did a lot. The primary driver of hypertrophy is not the same primary driver of strength. We talked about that already. That's intensity driven. For vol for hypertrophy, it's not intensity.[0:46:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: So because we have different mechanisms, we have different outcomes even though they're closely aligned, Strength is not gonna cause a lot of soreness. Therefore, intensity is the driver. Therefore, frequency can be as high as you want. So you can train every single day the same exact muscle if speed or power or strength are the primary training training tools, Because you need stimulus there. Skills skill as well.[0:47:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Practice. That you know that as much as anybody. Developing a new motor pattern requires a lot of repetitions. Right?[0:47:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't need a tremendous amount of rest. That's not it's it's not a damage thing. Right? It's a repatterning issue. So strength training in fact, if you look at, again, true strength professional athletes, they're going to train the same muscles basically every day.[0:47:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Wow. They're gonna squat every day.[0:47:29] Andrew Huberman: And and is that because the the primary mode of adaptation is recruitment of these high threshold motor units? It's so it's mainly neural.[0:47:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. So everyone's gonna say that, and this is where I get all feisty.[0:47:40] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm not saying that. That was actually there was a question mark there.[0:47:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Okay.[0:47:43] Andrew Huberman: If we if we were online putting comments, we there'd be a question mark.[0:47:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: We would've fought.[0:47:47] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I would've blocked you.[0:47:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: I was just kidding. That's not[0:47:50] Andrew Huberman: you already blocked. No.[0:47:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Probably twice. Okay. The early adaptations to exercise, especially strength training, are hedged towards the nervous system. It's nerve. If you train today, tomorrow morning, you're not gonna wake up with a, actually, increase in contractile proteins in muscle.[0:48:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your muscle might be a little bit bigger due to some acute swelling. But you could have an a pretty acute that persists change in and the nervous system, we'll call it, that allows you to be stronger, like, Within a couple of days. Sustained hypertrophy is probably more along the lines of 4 weeks where we can see that. Right? We can actually see Changes like in the ultrasound.[0:48:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you're making changes immediately. That protein synthesis process is happening, like, very fast, and it's gonna last it just takes us time to measure it terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle size. So that being said, the 1st 4 weeks, we typical say are primarily, nervous system. After that, now we're see starting to see most of the changes coming from the muscle side of the equation. So with strength development, It's a combination of 3 areas.[0:49:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, all muscle contraction has the same three things. It starts off with some signal. Right from somewhere in the body, whether it's all the way up the top or at the level of the spine depending on if this is a reaction or an actual conscious control. From there, that some signal has to tell the muscle to contract. K?[0:49:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So signal is 1. 2, it's muscular contraction, and there's a lot of variables inside the muscle tissue itself That determines functionality. And so if we took an individual biopsy and took a muscle fiber from you and took one from me, and we took those muscles out and put them in a petri dish, And I tied 1 end to a force transducer, the other end to a thing that pulls it, and we soaked it in a bath of calcium and a bunch of other stuff. Even if they were the same size, your fibers might contract a lot faster than mine, even relative to size, or not or slower or there's various properties. So the intrinsic fibers themselves determine a lot of functionality.[0:49:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: From there, muscle fibers don't cause movements. Muscle fibers simply contract. They're all surrounded with connective tissue, and then that's all surrounded with a bunch of more connective tissue. That all surrounds to do a muscle. That muscle is in surrounded with more connective tissue.[0:50:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: That all comes together into a giant tendon. That tendon attached to the bone. It's pulling on those tendon that actually move the bone that cause human movement. So that's area 3. Area 1, the nervous system area 2, the muscle contraction area 3, some sort of connective tissue thing.[0:50:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Changes happen at all 3 of those levels. And we're not even now talking well, even you entered the discussion of biomechanics and you changed, Say the pennation angle of the muscle, which is the angle at which the muscle fibers lay relative to the bone. Right? So this is basic mechanics. Is it pulling Perpendicular to the bone, is it pulling horizontal to the bone or some sort of angle?[0:50:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: All of these things determine human performance. So when you're talking about, again, that strength development, You can see tremendous improvements in total force production by manipulating all of those areas, and you have not touched changes in muscle size. If you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion, whether this is sarcoplasmic or contractile proteins, You have given yourself more opportunity to produce more force. It doesn't guarantee you produce more force. Bodybuilders are not stronger than power lifters even though they have more muscle.[0:51:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: But bodybuilders are probably stronger than most people. So there is a relationship between muscle size and strength. It's not a one to one guaranteed ratio, and that's generally because the although the muscle has been aided, they may have not changed the biomechanical considerations. Say, may I have not changed the connective tissue nor the nervous system stuff. And so that's why we see this giant relationship that our value is pretty high Between strength and hypertrophy, but if you really wanna get to the ends of it, it's not.[0:51:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that matters to your actual question 10 minutes ago, Because, again, you can train strength daily on the same muscle, but if you want to allow for that process of connect A contractile proteins to to add and grow, then you're gonna have to allow some recovery. Because if you go back into that muscle too soon, You're gonna blunt the response. You're gonna stop it. You're gonna cut it off. You have all kinds of of problems going on in the cell that are gonna, just attenuate that that growth response.[0:52:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I gave you the answer for strength training. The answer for hypertrophy is Probably less than 3 out of 10 on level of soreness, you can go again. In general, you're probably looking at 72 hours is the optimal window. So if you trained your your shoulders on Monday, you probably wouldn't wanna train them again on Tuesday. If hypertrophy is the goal, Maybe Wednesday, maybe Thursday's best.[0:52:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: So something like in every 2 to 3 day window is is probably, and we know a little bit more now about why that is. The gene cascade, the signaling response happens well, the signaling happens instantaneously. Right? Within seconds. The gene cascade is probably in the Peaked in the 4 hour window, like, the depending on which gene you'd wanna look at, but it's just kind of a snapshot.[0:53:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: But the protein synthesis process is 24 to 48 hour thing. And so it tends to kinda look like let that thing finish and let that signal go back to baseline, and then hit it again And then hit it again. And now as long as you're providing the nutrients, the recovery should happen, and you should be able to sustain the same work output in the training session. So the stimulus stays high And the recovery is there, and you can now continue to grow muscle.[0:53:26] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned 48 to 72 hours for hypertrophy. What if be for whatever reasons, the the training split, lifestyle factors, etcetera, Somebody, say, let's use your example, trains, shoulders on Monday. Ideally, they would train them again on Thursday. Yep. In their particular instance, somewhere Wednesday or Thursday, but they don't.[0:53:51] Andrew Huberman: They wait until Saturday or Sunday For whatever reason, maybe it's more compatible with their work, work another exercise schedule, whatever the reason, are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gained, or they've missed A a window to induce further hypertrophy.[0:54:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's probably better to think about it the the latter. It's not that you're you've lost. It's just you've just kinda lost an opportunity to to make more progress. I will save you a little bit in kinda going back to your hit program. This is the original high intensity training, the the Mensa thing.[0:54:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Which is not The[0:54:24] Andrew Huberman: hit with 1 eye, not the high intensity interval training, but high intensity training. Like, one set to absolute failure Totally. Maybe 2 For each muscle group[0:54:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Twenty minute workouts.[0:54:35] Andrew Huberman: Dividing your body into 3 into a three way split and then literally training[0:54:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Smashing.[0:54:39] Andrew Huberman: 6 times a month, which most people think that is absolutely crazy.[0:54:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:54:43] Andrew Huberman: There's no way that's gonna work, and I can tell you It does. If you are untrained, you you grow like a weed Just If you train hard enough[0:54:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Even if you're trained. Look at the people who Mike trained. He put a lot of bodybuilders on really high levels. Now they had The same similar help you had at that time frame?[0:54:58] Andrew Huberman: Wait. To be very clear, I was not taking exogenous antibiotics. In fact,[0:55:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: I would your endogenous was just as Good.[0:55:03] Andrew Huberman: I I probably was. I wasn't measuring my levels there, but I probably would. I grew easy. And in general, I tend to grow pretty easily, from weight training. But the But and I should say that to Mike's credit, and I think this is an important message, that he was the one who really said, Look.[0:55:21] Andrew Huberman: Unless you're gonna make a professional career out of it Yeah. Do not run the health hazards of exogenous hormones. It you know, it's certainly not at your age. So he deterred me from that, which was great because it never entered my mind. It just was one of those things where[0:55:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:55:34] Andrew Huberman: Mike Mentzer said don't do it, and he had clearly done it. Right? And so he's speaking from an informed place. Never entered my mind, but, also, I was what was really wild is I was continuing to run across country. And so there was a there was a, trade off there at some point.[0:55:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: A little bit of an interference.[0:55:50] Andrew Huberman: Young, you can get many people can get away with Totally. With what at this age would surely place me into a state of overtraining Even at low volume.[0:55:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: We'll see. Well, I mean, like, the the whole field on interference effect has changed quite a bit, recently, which we could come back to if you want. But just to to finish out the The idea here with that last question, if you wanna take 5 days or 6 days in between each muscle group, You can do that. In fact, if you look at the research, it's gonna show that frequency is not that important. It it will something that's unimportant, but it's it it can handle changes As long as you get to the same total volume.[0:56:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you can do that. You just have to do a lot more work in that one workout. If you care about the 6 week, 8 week thing. If you're like, I'm in this for the next 60 years, like, it's probably okay. Right?[0:56:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it can be there. The the challenge with splitting up your training sessions for hypertrophy into smaller numbers, like once or twice a week, It's just difficult to get that number. It's difficult to get that volume done. Volume wise, The more recent meta analysis are gonna say that you're probably looking at around 10 working sets per muscle group per week. Seems to be kind of the minimum threshold that you're gonna wanna hit.[0:57:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you did 3 sets of 10 at your shoulders on Monday, 3 sets of 10 shoulders Wednesday and 3 on Friday, that's 9 working sets. If you wanted to do this 3 different shoulder work, exercises on Monday and hit your 9 sets, not really actually gonna be that much different. The problem is 10 is kind of a minimum. You probably wanna look for more like 15 to 20, and in fact, well trained folks, 2025. That becomes very challenging in one workout.[0:57:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, Defunct, you're not gonna be able to do it. Right? And so that is where it's not frequency that looks like it kills you. It's just the fact you have got to get because the total driver of Strength is intensity, but the total driver of hypertrophy is volume. Assume you're taking it to fatigue, right, or muscular failure.[0:57:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: So It's just tough to get enough done. If you can, and if you wanna set your schedule up that way, like, you probably remember, if you do those types of training sessions where you're just gonna completely exhaust a muscle, It's gonna be it's gonna be sore for a while. You're you're you're probably not going to come back, and that's sort of the logic behind that was let's take this thing to tremendous failure And give it 6 days to recover. It can work. It's just not the best.[0:58:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think it's one way to think about it for most people.[0:58:20] Andrew Huberman: It's also hard to do those workouts without a training partner. You really wanna do them correctly[0:58:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: stimulants and headphones and all kinds of other things.[0:58:26] Andrew Huberman: Right? Well, anyway, the yeah. Stimulants are not I don't certainly don't recommend those. Yeah. It may be a cup of coffee or 2, if that's your thing, but and maybe some of the safer supplements, but certainly not the sorts of stimulants that the guys in the Seventies and eighties were famous[0:58:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: for savings.[0:58:42] Andrew Huberman: Or still use. You talked about repetition ranges broadly for strength training, so 5 or less.[0:58:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:58:49] Andrew Huberman: You said frequency could be as often as every day.[0:58:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:58:52] Andrew Huberman: Rest 2 to 4 minutes, maybe even longer if you're going for 1 repetition maximum. For hypertrophy Sure. What are the repetition ranges that are effective, and what are the ones that are most effective if one is Trying to maximize some of the other variables. Like, people don't wanna spend more than an hour to 75 minutes in the gym because I think that, while the rep ranges might be quite broad as you alluded to earlier, there's the practical there are the practical constraints. Yeah.[0:59:20] Andrew Huberman: So what what repetition ranges or percent of 1 repetition maximum, should people consider when thinking about hypertrophy?[0:59:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. The quick answer there is anywhere between, like, 5 to 30 reps per set. That's gonna show across literature pretty much equal Hi, Burcham. And we can have a really intro discussion about why that is, but I'm just remembering one thing from a 2nd ago. I wanna give a better answer for the frequency.[0:59:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Strength twice per week. That that's a good number to get most people really strong.[0:59:59] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:00:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can do every single day. You don't need to, though. So I I wanna make sure that like, I wasn't saying you have to train a muscle 85% every single day to get it strong. 2 is a good number. 3 is great, but probably even 2 is really effective.[1:00:12] Andrew Huberman: Got it. This explains the the high frequency of of training for strength athletes. That's always mystified me. Yeah. And the very long workouts make sense because very long They're[1:00:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: not gonna even train twice a day. Like, even though it's a squat. In the morning, squat in the afternoon everyday.[1:00:25] Andrew Huberman: With their eating and their sleeping, they probably don't have time for anything else.[1:00:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's why they're pros. So that's a job. Right? That's what they do. So yeah.[1:00:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your hypertrophy. Strength training programming is somewhat complicated. Right? Because of that's not the danger, you're gonna have to pay one way or the other. Right?[1:00:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: The risk is a little bit higher because the load's higher, and you have to be a little bit more technically proficient. It comes to hypertrophy training, the way I like to explain it is it's kinda idiot proof. The programming is idiot proof. The work is hard though. So here's your range.[1:00:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Anywhere between, you know, 5 reps and 30. Can you hit somewhere in there? Perfect. It's all equally effective. You can't screw that up.[1:01:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: The only caveat for hypertrophy is you have to take it to muscular failure.[1:01:10] Andrew Huberman: And you need enough rest for the adaptation and protein synthesis to occur.[1:01:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Yeah. Right. And if you recover faster, you can maybe do it more frequently. And if you don't, maybe less frequently.[1:01:19] Andrew Huberman: By that logic, should people perhaps experiment and figure out what Repetition range allows them to recover, in concert with the training frequency that they can do consistently.[1:01:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: My recommendation is I think you should actually set your, use the repetition range as a way to have some variation. Because most people don't wanna go in the gym and do 3 sets of 10. They're gonna get very bored very quickly. And so I I think you should actually intentionally change the rep schemes for simple sake of having more fun. It is a very different challenge.[1:01:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: The mechanisms that are inducing hypertrophy are different, but there's only a maximum amount of growth that one can get. Right? And so you have As best we think it now and and some people actually will espouse that we know really clearly about the mechanisms of most likely approach. We we don't. It is still very much a guessing game, but the 3 most likely drivers are 1, metabolic stress, 2, mechanical tension, and then 3, muscular damage.[1:02:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't have to have all 3. 1 is sufficient. You can have a little bit of 1 or 2, and you can kinda so you get it to play here. We've already talked about the muscular damage. Again, it's very clear.[1:02:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: More damage is not better, But it is somewhat a decent proxy. Right? Like, I've got a little bit of soreness is good. Just don't get so sore. It's compromising your total volume.[1:02:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Mechanical tension is kinda like strength. This is why if you do even set to 5 or 8 and you're kinda close that strength range, you will gain a little bit of muscle. Not optimal muscle gain, but you're gonna gain some because everything in these like physiology didn't cut off at 4 reps, and then 5 reps is a different thing. Right?[1:02:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's it's always a blend. So think of it as like a A fading curve. As you get closer to the end, it fades less effective. As you get closer to the middle, it's more effective. Anywhere between 8 Reps per set to 30, it's equally effective.[1:03:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Past 30, it's gonna blend out. Past 8 to 5 to 4 to 3, it's gonna blend, you know, lesser there. So metabolic stress is 1. The damage is the other or sorry. Mechanical tension is the one that's heavy.[1:03:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Muscle damage is the other one. The third one is metabolic stress. And this is, I get a a bit of an area of scientific contention, but something's there. I know something's there. We just we're just Kind of fumbling to figure out what exactly it is, and this is metabolic stress is the burn.[1:03:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? It it's there. It's why blood flow restriction training probably works. That's done very light, so no mechanical tension. There's very little damage, but somehow it induces a good amount of hypertrophy.[1:03:46] Andrew Huberman: Very painful.[1:03:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, boy.[1:03:48] Andrew Huberman: I tried this. I have a Friend, former special operator who, was on the East Coast and took me through a blood flow restriction, Training protocol in a park, and I I don't think I I actually cried, but, you[1:04:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: probably did.[1:04:03] Andrew Huberman: But I might have cried out Once or twice. It was unbelievable, especially the lower body movements. Yeah. Now it was a humid day. I'll claim a little bit of jet lag, but No.[1:04:13] Andrew Huberman: It was brutal. It was really brutal, and I also the[1:04:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: best day of your life, and it's still brutal.[1:04:17] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Well, that makes me feel a little bit better. It was intense, and And and people should know that it it is important to use the proper cuffs for these things. I don't have any, relationship to any of the companies that sell these cuffs, the reason is that you actually need to block particular avenues of blood flow. You can't simply cinch off a muscle.[1:04:34] Andrew Huberman: You can't turn and get a muscle and train.[1:04:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not a good one.[1:04:37] Andrew Huberman: Actually, kill yourself that way. Yeah.[1:04:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can get a blood clot.[1:04:39] Andrew Huberman: Yep. And, so if you're interested in blood flow restriction training, I imagine you have some content about this or will at some point, but also there there are resources online that people can look up.[1:04:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:04:50] Andrew Huberman: A question about hypertrophy training. I think, many people are wondering about Train to failure or don't train to failure? Assuming good form.[1:05:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. K. Assuming good form. Great. The answer is both.[1:05:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wanna train to failure, But you don't need to go to extreme failure. So you don't need to necessarily go to that, like, partner has to lift the barbell off my chest, but you have to get close. You have to drive either heavy, stress, Damage, right, or or pump. And so a really easy practical way to think about this, I heard Mike a company on Renaissance periodization years ago, outlined this at a NSCA talk. And it was beautiful, and I thought this is the most eloquent way to explain The context about training hypertrophy.[1:05:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: So only to look for 3 things in your workout. And let's say that you have a particular muscle to grow. Let's say you want your glutes to get larger. Okay. When you're doing your glute exercises, number 1, are you feeling the glute contract?[1:05:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. It doesn't have to be there, but that's a good sign if it is. Okay. Let's say I didn't really feel my glute contract. I felt it more on my quads or my back.[1:05:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Did you feel a big pump afterwards? No. I didn't really feel a pump there either words or during. Okay.[1:06:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. Number 3. Next day, did you feel a little bit of soreness there at all? No. I didn't.[1:06:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, that's a very good indicator. You didn't feel it during the workout. You felt no sort of pump, and it didn't get sore. Don't expect much growth.[1:06:17] Andrew Huberman: Didn't have distributed the work across a bunch of muscle groups.[1:06:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most likely, other muscle groups were too involved. Right? Especially if you're like, no. But, man, my back Got really well, that's a really good indication of telling you what the hell was moving. And so in terms of targets, if you were to put, again, a one to, You know, 10 scale.[1:06:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: How much should I feel it burning during? Anything less than a 3, okay, it's probably not doing much. Right? But it doesn't, Like, 7 is not a 10 is not better than 7. You need to feel it, but it doesn't have to be like, oh my gosh.[1:06:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm dying here. Soreness, Same barometer. Right? So if you can get, like, 3, 3, and 3, you're probably in a pretty good spot. 5, 5, and 5 is maybe better, But you don't need to go much past that.[1:07:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I want you to feel the muscle group either working or if you're like, I didn't feel it much. I didn't really get a pump, but the next day it got really sore. Then you're you're still, you know, on a good path. Again, really sore isn't like, oh, little tender, but next day it's okay. Day after that, I could I could train.[1:07:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: No problem. That's really what you wanna go after. And in terms of understanding, is this likely to produce some growth or not?[1:07:23] Andrew Huberman: Excellent. Excellent. Very clear parameters and recommendations I know are benefiting me and will benefit a lot of people. If you'd be willing to throw out a few sort of sets and rep parameters that could, act as broad guidelines[1:07:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: for[1:07:37] Andrew Huberman: people who want to, explore further. I realized that with all these modifiable variables that there's no one size fits all for strength. I love this 5 to 30 for hypertrophy. That's the rebuttal thing. I don't think I've ever done a 30 rep set of anything.[1:07:52] Andrew Huberman: But but now that you've thrown that out there, I see it as a bit of challenge.[1:07:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Awesome about 30, You're gonna get an insane pump. You're gonna burn like crazy, but you won't get super sore. Because the mechanical tension is a little low so low. It's so light. So you you can you can get away with those things and you it's hard because your mind is gonna wander.[1:08:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna get it, like, rep 20. You're gonna be like, I'm done, and you're like, no. There's there's a lot left here to get 30, Where, like, a set of 10 is is much easier. Like, you're just like, okay. 2 more.[1:08:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: 2 more. Instead of 30, it's like, I got 16 more. It's it's awful, but you're just counting is work. It's terrible. Right?[1:08:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: And people tend to just kinda like check out. So thirty is possible, but a little bit extreme extreme. But I would recommend them all of them. Like, it's a really fun play. You could do different the same workout too, by the way.[1:08:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, you could do 1 set of 10, push ups and then take a little break and then do a set of 25. Like, you can you can mix and match these things. There's no magic recipe that has to happen, for all those, or do it different. So Mondays are my sets of 10 days, Wednesdays are my set of 20 days, and Fridays are my set of 30 days, and you can have all kinds of fun there, and it's hard to screw up.[1:08:54] Andrew Huberman: Great. I love that phrase is always reassuring. So for strength, is there a, sets and reps protocol that Yeah. That is, pretty surefire?[1:09:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: So a way to to just think about A really fast answer for power well, speed, power, and strength is what I just call the 3 to 5 concept. Alright. So pick 3 to 5 exercises. If you're feeling better that day, choose on the higher end. If you're feeling less that day or you have a shorter time frame to train, go less.[1:09:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: This would be 3 sets or 3 exercises rather or 5 exercises the most. So 3 to 5 exercises. Do 3 to 5 reps, 3 to 5 sets. Take 3 to 5 minutes rest in between, and do it 3 to 5 times a week. So that can be as little as 3 sets of 3 for 3 exercises, Three times a week.[1:09:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: That that's a 20 minute workout 3 times a week. It can be as high as 5 sets of 5 for 5 exercises 5 days a week. So it's very broad and allows people to still stay within the domains of strength and power while still being able to move And contour toward their lifestyle and and soreness and time and all those things. The only differentiator to pay attention to between power And strength is intensity. So if you want strength, this is now 85% plus of your max.[1:10:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? If you want power, it needs to be a lot lighter because you need to move more towards the velocity end of the spectrum, because power is strength multiplied by speed. So while getting stronger, by definition, can help power, you probably wanna spend more of your time in the 40% to 70% range, Like, plus or minus? So that's it. Both of them, conceptually, they'll work everything else.[1:10:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: The exercise, the reps, the the frequency, all that can be still in the 3 to 5 range. Just change the intensity depending on which outcome you want.[1:10:45] Andrew Huberman: The nervous system obviously plays an important role at the level of nerves controlling the contraction of muscle fibers. But, of course, we have these upper motor neurons, which are the ones that reside in our brain that control the lower motor neurons that control muscle.[1:10:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:10:58] Andrew Huberman: And This takes us into the realm of where the mind is at during a particular movement, and to me, this is not an abstract thing. I can imagine doing workouts that are mainly focused on strength or mainly focused on hypertrophy. And In the case of strength, am I trying to move weights? And when I'm trying to generate hypertrophy, am I trying to, quote, unquote, challenge muscles? In other words Yeah.[1:11:25] Andrew Huberman: If I am just trying to move a weight away from my body, you know, push pushing a bench press or an overhead press, I don't know that I want my mind thinking about the contraction of my medial delts. I think I want my mind in getting the weight overhead with the best proper form best, excuse me, and proper form. And, certainly, with hypertrophy training, best and proper form is going to be the target as well. But that simple Or I should say subtle mental shift changes the patterns of nerve fiber recruitment. So can we say to get stronger, focus on moving weights still with proper form and safely, and to get hypertrophy, Focus on challenging muscles still with proper form and safely.[1:12:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's very fair. Yeah. As a as a Snapshot answer, it is a very fair thing to think about. Intentionality matters for both. In other words, if you look at some interesting Science has been done on power development and speed development.[1:12:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: The intent to move is actually more important than the actual movement velocity. So if if you're doing, say, something for power or strength and you're doing just enough to get the bar up, that will result in less improvements in strength than Even if you're moving at the exact same speed, but you're intending to move faster. And this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters. So if you're coaching an athlete through a power workout especially, and they're doing enough to just lift 50% of their one rep max, it's not going to generate as much speed development as them trying to move that bar as fast as they can even if the net result is the same barbell velocity. Turns out nerves matter.[1:13:04] Andrew Huberman: That's a I mean, I I I was about to say amazing, but as a neuroscientist, if I say amazing, the nerves matter. What's amazing to me is what if I understand correctly, what you're saying is that Even if the bar is moving at the same speed, same weight[1:13:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:13:18] Andrew Huberman: If my internal representation, my thoughts are, I'm trying to move this as Fast as possible Yeah. Versus I'm just trying to get the bar away from me and and get the weight up. I'm going to get different[1:13:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. This is quality of work. Right? This is did you do enough to just check off the box, or did you actually strive for adaptation? Right?[1:13:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Similar concept actually works for hypertrophy in terms of there is a handful of very recent studies that have looked at what we call the mind muscle connection. This is doing things like imagine a bicep curl, and you're simply looking at and watching your biceps, and you're thinking about contracting it harder. Even though you execute Same repetitions at the same exact intensity. Initial indications are the mind body connection are going to result in more growth than not. You just gave[1:14:08] Andrew Huberman: authorization for for people to look at their muscles contracting in the gym. Please do.[1:14:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Of course. Right? Like[1:14:13] Andrew Huberman: Does this but the selfie is still ruled out.[1:14:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'd rather you look at your muscles than your phone. So I'm fine with it. Those are initial. We don't have a Mhmm. Large depth of research to support that, and maybe some stuff will come encounter it.[1:14:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: But it it does it matches what Folks in that community have been saying for a very long time. Right? There's actually some stuff on simply flexing in between. So if you've ever seen a bodybuilder, they'll they'll do their set of bicep and then they'll get on the flex, and they'll check. And they're they're literally this is what Arnold did.[1:14:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? This is if you go back to pumping an iron[1:14:43] Andrew Huberman: Or college weight rooms, I should say. Right. For some reason, there's something about that age group. Yeah. There's a lot of checking of biceps in college weight rooms for reasons that escape me.[1:14:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you ever interact with my wife, Like, she will be the 1st to tell you I cannot walk past a mirror without, like, checking something out.[1:15:00] Andrew Huberman: That you can't or she can't?[1:15:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can't.[1:15:02] Andrew Huberman: Okay.[1:15:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not her. Me. I'm the one that cannot[1:15:04] Andrew Huberman: walk past. Well, then I'll be careful not to disparage that.[1:15:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: It has nothing to do with hypertrophy, but I'm just, like I'm a muscle guy, so I'm always, like, Thinking and tinkering or whatever. But yeah. It is, I think it's very much worth your time to do a higher quality training session. Be more intentional, be present, than just executing the same exact workout. I think that's globally very clear So if you're thinking, like, I'm gonna like, I don't wanna work out today.[1:15:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: I got all this going on, or I'm tired or whatever. I'm just gonna do the workout anyways and get through it. Okay. If you can go, you know what though? Like, I'm gonna cut 15 minutes out of this thing.[1:15:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm gonna get my head right. I'm gonna go get 2:20 minutes of quality work done. That's that's your best option by far.[1:15:49] Andrew Huberman: You alluded to the fact that even just looking at a particular muscle might, Benefit, in terms of the number of fibers you can recruit or its its potential for hypertrophy. I've heard before, and I certainly, have experienced that Muscles that, for whatever reason, genetics or, sports that one played, etcetera, muscles that, we find that we can contract to the point of almost a Slightly painful contraction seem to grow more readily than muscles that we can't recruit very easily. And, and there and the reason I mentioned sports that we played earlier is I've been you just have to Watch the Olympics to see that, you know, swimmers obviously are very good at engaging their lats. You look at the gymnasts, they seem to be very good at engaging everything.[1:16:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:16:33] Andrew Huberman: And they go through a huge number of dynamic movements, that explains that. So I find that, you know, if people say, oh, you know, I can't get stronger in this or My, whatever body part is weak in terms of its inability to engage hypertrophy Yeah.[1:16:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I see your gut.[1:16:49] Andrew Huberman: That oftentimes that can be because of an inability to jet to engage those upper motor neurons to deliberately isolate those muscles. Are there ways that people can Learn to, engage particular muscle groups more effectively over time for sake of hypertrophy or strength or For cases of trying to overcome injury potential or injury because imbalances are bad across the board.[1:17:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. This is actually very common, and I think everyone has probably gone to this. There's some part that you just can't get going. For me, that was the lats. That was the rhomboid.[1:17:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So my back muscles. For years, I couldn't activate my lats or my rhomboids. These are the the muscle groups that connect your shoulder blades. So if you try to squeeze your shoulder blades together, that set of muscles there are called your rhomboids. Your lats, of course, are more vertical and and pull you kinda up and down.[1:17:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: And no matter how many lat pull downs I did, bent rows, pull ups, I I could never see any development there. No increase in strength, and it took me probably a decade to figure out how the hell to actually get these things on. In fact, if you would have asked me Even in my college years as a college football player, hey. Flex your lats. Like, show me your lats.[1:17:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: You would have seen no no movement there. When I was doing a pull up in that particular case, the only way I could get the bar to move was be was by using my biceps. Right? So it's a synergistic muscle. It's supposed to be a secondary muscle in that movement.[1:18:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: But for me, it was primer because of my overstrength in my biceps come coupled with my Lack of activation in the lats. So you're compensating the same movement. Actually, kind of a easy way to think about this is imagine doing a bent row. So imagine you're you're bent over kind of at a 45 degree or a horizontal angle, and you're gonna pull a a a barbell to your belly button. Alright?[1:18:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you can actually do that exact same movement with very little back muscle activation by simply flexing your elbows more. So you think you're the barbell is going all the way down. It's coming all the way up to touching my belly, and you think you're doing a great back development exercise. When in fact, Because of the way that you're executing the movement, you're getting very little back development. And this is an a really good example of why someone has done A specific exercise many, many, many times, but yet failed to see development in a muscle group, which goes back to earlier part our conversation, which is why exercises themselves do not determine the adaptation.[1:19:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's the execution that matters. Right? It's the technique. It's the rep range. All of those are gonna determine your Actual result.[1:19:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if anytime you were you're you're banging your head against the wall and thinking, like, why am I not getting movement here? Growth or strength or whatever, it's almost one of those it's guaranteed to be one of those areas. Right? You're probably not getting, the muscle groups to activate. In that particular example, just because we're here, try, imagine doing that bent row.[1:19:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Instead of pulling the barbell to your belly, Squeeze your shoulder blades together first as far as they can possibly go, and then bring your elbows up without changing the angle of your elbow. So in other words, without bringing your hand closer to your shoulder, just keep that same angle and come up as high as you possibly can, and then finish out the movement. That's going to guarantee a a utilization first of the back muscles and a a finishing with the biceps, at the end, which is how that movement is supposed to go. So how do you coach into that? Well, it can be a number of things.[1:20:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Whenever I'm diagnosing movement quality, I look for a handful of things, but very first one is awareness. You'd be surprised how many folks, when you simply tell them that muscle group right there, and maybe you give them prompt. So you touch it or you put something against it. This is actually why sorry. I'm jumping over the place, but this is why, things like a belt Work very well for actually increasing abdominal strength.[1:20:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: So a a misconception out there is if you wear, like, a belt when you're lifting, Then the belt kinda does all the work for you and your abs get weaker. That can happen, but the exact opposite can happen as well. So if you take a belt, for example, and you and you cinch it down really tight, and then you just completely disregard your midsection, you will see a loss of strength in your midsection because now the belt is doing the work. But if you put the belt on just a little bit, kinda tight to where you get some sensory feedback and you think about using That belt is a way to activate the core musculature. You will actually see a higher and if we look at, like, EMG activation, the core muscles would be activated higher to a greater extent than when the belt is off.[1:21:09] Andrew Huberman: Because of proprioceptive feedback. 100%. And for those that are wondering what proprioceptive feedback is, proprioceptive feedback is that, there are nerves, that extend out to the muscles that control muscle contractions, but then there are sensory inputs from the skin and muscle that go back into the nervous system, and those work in in concert. And that That feedback is proprioceptive. I think it it literally translates to a knowledge of where one's limbs are and what's happening on those limbs.[1:21:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Space. Yep.[1:21:35] Andrew Huberman: I've seen I don't you I don't have a training partner, but I've seen, in gyms where someone will be training and someone would tap The muscle Yep. Of the person who's doing the work in order to, with this is consensual tapping of other people's muscles, not, walking around Please. Touching people's muscles, please. That to provide that proprioceptive feedback so that the person doing the exercises, it becomes more aware of the muscle that they're supposed to be training, and it seems That that's probably an effective practice.[1:22:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I'll give you 2 examples. I'll go to the back with that pulling movement, and but then I'll I'll stay on the belt really quickly. So A very easy example that you can do right now, listening. And I learned this from Brian McKenzie, your mutual friend.[1:22:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So if you take your hands and open them up, like you make an l with both your hands. And now take those and put them around your waist just above your hip bones. Mhmm. Now what I want you to do is press out as hard as you can on your hands with your core, and you can feel a lot of core activation.[1:22:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: And most people think core activation is the front of your stomach. Right? Your 6 pack. What you need to do is create a cylinder around your back. So it's the front, it's the side, and it's the back.[1:22:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you take your 2 fingers, point them. Now put them just outside your belly button. Can you move your fingers by just moving your ab muscles? 90% of people can sit do yes. Same exact thing.[1:22:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now go to that same position just above what's called your As is. So your anterior superior iliac spine right up that front of your hip bone. Right in the front. Can you now move? Great.[1:23:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: 50% of people are not gonna get any movement there.[1:23:08] Andrew Huberman: Really?[1:23:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Take your thumb And go right above your PSIS.[1:23:12] Andrew Huberman: My what?[1:23:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: PSIS. Posterior superior. That's fine. Right? Now can you move?[1:23:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most likely, no.[1:23:21] Andrew Huberman: Sort of if I do a mini low back extension.[1:23:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Don't. Just with your core musculature. Barely.[1:23:28] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Maybe a[1:23:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: 90% of people can't. If you can't perform that contraction, you can't stabilize your spine. So only way to get stabilization your spine is then to go through hyperextension. And now there's a compression strategy you're putting on your spine. It's better than rounding your back, like in going forward, but overextension is not great either.[1:23:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you wanna be able to flex the musculature in a cylindric fashion you have con control. So if you go back to our very first things and with your hands open and you put them right here and if you're like, I can't get activation, if you pay attention to your thumb Right? Now just move your thumb, and now you see activation back there. Right? Mhmm.[1:24:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Boom. Now if you can imagine turning that on just a little bit And now notice how I can do this, by the way, at the same time I'm talking. If you have to go, we don't have control. Right? So you have to be able to separate breath from brace.[1:24:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So now if I can put my possess self in a position and and Kelly Starrett has always said 20%. Give me 20% activation here, and now I can squat. I can hinge. I can jump. I don't need[1:24:32] Andrew Huberman: to be locked down to[1:24:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: a 100% scream to be able to brace my spine. That's gonna be ineffective and wasteful. I wanna be here. Well, the belt provides that proprioceptive feedback where I can put it on 20%, and it just is a reminder. If I don't press against the belt, the belt slides and falls down a little bit because it's not on super tight.[1:24:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: If it's on so dang tight, it's doing the work and I forget. So we just want a little bit of feedback There. Same thing with your upper back. If you're having a difficult time activating those rhomboids or those lats, someone can do a simple thing where they take their finger, put it right between your shoulder blades, And you just tell them things like, hey. Squeeze my finger.[1:25:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Squeeze my finger. As you're doing your bent row or your pull down, you can touch the lat. You can do, just visualization stuff. So just imagine, like, a 3 d rendering of that muscle group, and you're watching that muscle group contract. It's very powerful and very effective, to do it so a touch, a visual, all this stuff can help get people, to activate.[1:25:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Outside of simple awareness, typically, eccentric overload is a very effective way for, activation of a difficult to target muscle.[1:25:38] Andrew Huberman: So the lowering of the bar Or the lowering of the weight.[1:25:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: The movement of the weight away from the body is not necessarily was lowering because that kinda depends on what the[1:25:46] Andrew Huberman: whole group[1:25:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: you're doing.[1:25:47] Andrew Huberman: Right? This book.[1:25:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Things like a pull up. K. So if if if I'm going to do a pull up and I have poor lat activation, I can still get the pull up muscle movement executed by contraction of the biceps and things like that. However, to make the movement simpler, I'm gonna go all the way to the top.[1:26:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: So imagine stepping on a box or something going all the way to that top of that pull up position. And starting from there, I want you to simply lower it under control. And so you're just simply breaking the movement down into smaller pieces that allow you to to focus on the execution more. It's gonna be great. Eccentrics are great for strength development, Very good for hypertrophy and allow you to focus on control.[1:26:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I I'm willing to bet a huge percentage of you out there who've like I've never had a sore lat. You know, I've done a lot of pull ups and things like that. If you do that eccentric only, you'll probably wake up the next day going, oh gosh. I feel it there. And that's a sign even if you didn't feel it in the workout, but it got a little sore the next day, keep down that path.[1:26:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then eventually, you'd be able to do a concentric, maybe take a break, Maybe do an isometric where you just hold that position, and eventually work that into a into, progression where you can do the concentric, eccentric, and isometric portions and get activation. So that that may take you 6 weeks. It might take you 6 months, but that's generally a pretty good strategy for learning how to activate a muscle group.[1:27:04] Andrew Huberman: Terrific suggestions. Is it true that eccentric, emphasized movements might require a little bit longer recovery, or they lead to more soreness then concentric movements.[1:27:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. They they typically can, but they're also higher force output. So very good for strength development, but they're going to lead On average, 2 more soreness. So more potential for interest failure disruption that is gonna be associated with pain. There's there's not as much, people would like to explain Muscle soreness as a result of microtrauma and micro tears in the muscle, that can happen, but that's not the norm.[1:27:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most of the time, It is things like disruption of calcium that's gonna lead to excessive swelling, excessive pressure, and that's gonna be then translated as Extreme pain. So that's probably explaining more muscle soreness than actually microtrauma.[1:27:50] Andrew Huberman: Terrific. I was gonna get To breathing later, but maybe just for now, if we can do a a brief, little foray into to breathing As it relates to weight training[1:28:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:28:02] Andrew Huberman: Is there a prescriptive for how to breathe during resistance training? Here, I'm thinking with weights, not necessarily body weight only movements, although I suppose it could be. That applies 75% of the time to 75% of the people. What I was taught, and I'm hoping you're gonna tell me this was wrong because then there might be more benefits awaiting me, is that I should exhale on the effort And inhale on the lesser effort portion of an exercise. Is that true?[1:28:34] Andrew Huberman: Is there a better way to breathe?[1:28:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: There is a better way to think about it. So number 1, if you can breathe and embrace, then this conversation goes away. So if you can main remain, you can maintain intramuscular intra abdominal pressure while breathing, then I don't really care when you breathe. Very challenging to do at very heavyweights. If we flag this on 2 areas of a paradigm, Paradigm 1 over here, you're gonna do a set of 30, and you're gonna do front squats where a barbell is sitting on your throat.[1:29:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you don't take a breath, like, this is going to end one way and one way only, you passing out. Clearly has to be some breathing strategy. The other end of the spectrum is, let's say you're gonna do a vertical jump. You don't need any amount of breath there. It's never gonna happen.[1:29:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? The question is, what about in the middle? Right. So I'm doing some sort of strength training there. Well, number 1, make sure you're braced, and then you can get away with less need to worry about it.[1:29:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: In general, a a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold during the lowering or eccentric or most dangerous of the movement, and then you can exhale on the concentric portion. So if the bench presses are example, if you held in, braced, Lowered in a control and now started the concentric pushing away for it, and then you wanted to take an expiration During the last half of the concentric portion, that that's an okay strategy. If you're going to do a single rep, you don't need to worry about it. You you can just avoid or omit breathing entirely. You're gonna be Fine.[1:30:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're doing more than that, especially 3 to 4 to 5 to 7, 8, you're gonna have to have some breathing strategy. A very common one is, probably every 3rd breath, I'm gonna do like exhale on the 3rd. Reset, rebreathe, Something like that. If you feel like you need to breathe after every one, that's okay, but it's gonna get wasteful because you have to take time in between reps of sitting there. If it's a squat, that's different, versus a dead lift, if you're resting at the bottom.[1:30:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there there is a little bit of game here. So in general though is is that 75 75 kinda really thrown out you threw out. Breathe in, do the lowering, and exhale on the out if you have to. Less reps, don't worry about it. More reps, then you need to come up with some sort of breathing strategy.[1:30:50] Andrew Huberman: How about breathing in between sets, and maybe even after the workout? Yeah. This is something I think a lot of people overlook. Like and because that it is the case that recovery has to do both with the specific activation and, to muscles and the nervous system, but also the attacks on the nervous system can also take place between sets. I mean, if you're really geared up between sets and you got adrenaline, you know, As high in between sets or close to it as you are during your sets, you can imagine that the recovery would take longer or at least that you're not spending adrenaline in the most efficient way if there is such a thing.[1:31:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Fair. You're not gonna see any athlete that I work with just breathe in between. Whether it's in between innings or in between rounds, Even, PJ golfer. There's gonna be a we just hit our ball, and we're moving to the next one.[1:31:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna go in our breathing strategy. Everyone of them. It's it's a huge area of potential benefit and consequence if you're just ignoring it. In general, we wanna do any sort of Calming breath. We wanna restore.[1:32:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: It depends on if the well, it depends on what we're combating. Are we combating low oxygen or high c o two? So that strategy is gonna be a little bit different. But in general, that is a huge time opportunity to get better. In fact, can go back and listen to some of your earlier episodes where you talked about or you have spoken about, I think, on this show.[1:32:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: When, neuroplasticity works, and if you're losing that opportunity post exercise, You're leaving gains on the table if you will. So not only are you gonna see everything athletes that I work with mostly have a Breeze strategy in competition. We're not gonna just finish a workout, high five, drink water, and walk out of the gym. There will be a down regulation strategy that is heavily involved with some sort of light control as well as breath control. The individual prescription on that, there's a ton of variation with what you can do.[1:32:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: The easiest thing is do something that calms you down. Most likely that's going to be moved towards as much nasal breathing as you can possibly do, and a a really easy rule of thumb is a double exhale length Relative to inhale. So if you need to take a, like, 4 second inhale, double that time and breathe out for 8 seconds. Box breathing is fine. So equal inhale, Equal hold, equal exhale, equal hold.[1:33:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So 4 second inhale, 4 second exhale, 4 second exhale, etcetera, etcetera. A triangle is fine too. There's a lot of ways you can get really complicated, like what Brian McKenzie will do and Rob. Those guys have you can get all kinds of systems for Inhale, exhale, control, and it can be optimized, but some strategy of calm. We're gonna almost always put you on your back or close, and then we're gonna cover light.[1:33:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: We can do some like, we've done actually a number of, musical interventions as well, but you can as just As simple as sit down a locker room if you have to and just breathe for 5 minutes. That alone is gonna be productive.[1:34:01] Andrew Huberman: That's great. If you're breathing in the locker room for 5 minutes, I suggest closing your eyes or you get some funny looks. And if, you'll still get funny looks, but you won't see people looking at it.[1:34:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Exactly.[1:34:09] Andrew Huberman: I love this, and I started doing this because you and Brian McKenzie informed me about this, and it completely changed the Rate of recovery for me. I realized that I was leaving workouts, both endurance workouts and strength hypertrophy workouts, feeling great, But looking at my phone, getting right into email and meetings[1:34:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, rough.[1:34:28] Andrew Huberman: Not concentrating on my breathing, and all I did was to introduce a, on your recommendation, a 5 minute Down regulation, so exhale emphasized breathing, a a a bunch of different varieties, physiological size, box breathing. Exhale emphasized inhale, component for 5 minutes. And I noticed 2 things. 1, I recovered more quickly, Workout to workout, no question about it. Yeah.[1:34:50] Andrew Huberman: The numbers told me that. And the other is that I used to have this, dip in energy that would occur 3 or 4 hours after a hard workout, and I always thought that had to do with the fact that I generally eaten a meal at some point Post workout, turns out it wasn't the meal at all.[1:35:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:35:07] Andrew Huberman: It's that that that adrenaline, ramp up during the workouts, I wasn't clamping that at the end, and so I think, eventually, it just crashed. And then 3 or 4 hours later, I'm I'm having a hard time even reading what's on the screen in my computer thinking maybe screen. Maybe it was what I ate for lunch. Turns out the down regulations allowed me to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever. It's really been quite powerful, and so I'm grateful to you for that.[1:35:32] Andrew Huberman: And I think this is something that I think 98% of people are not doing, and it's only 5 minutes.[1:35:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: You didn't have to do 5. Give me 3. If you really have to push it, give me 3. And you can even do this you can save time. You can do this in the shower if you have to.[1:35:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're you're done. You're finished. Drink of water. Whatever it has to be, and you're getting in a shower. You're getting ready.[1:35:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just give me 3 minutes in the shower. It's not ideal, but[1:35:56] Andrew Huberman: As little[1:35:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: as that, it it can pay huge dividends. You need some sort of internal signal that we're safe. Mhmm. Like, Throttle down here. We're gonna move on.[1:36:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: That has to happen. I I could go around here, but I I think we're making the same point kinda on over again. It's it's big deal and do it.[1:36:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. And you're saving energy. I mean, the energy here is neural energy. I think fighters do this good fighters learn to do this between rounds. Yeah.[1:36:21] Andrew Huberman: Printers learn to do this between events. I think humans should learn how to do this between any, you know, sort of interval type activity, including work, Social engagement. Yeah. I'll say so such a powerful tool.[1:36:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Do this for 1 minute after every important, Whether it's an individual high volatile interaction or if it's a you just did a nice 45 minute sprint to work and you're deep into it or whatever. Fine. Just give me 1 minute. Set your alarm just 1 minute, and that also will pay dividends.[1:36:50] Andrew Huberman: I I love it. And as I said, it's made Outsize, different positive difference on my training, but also activities outside my training, which is, me, I'm not a professional athlete. I train for health and because I enjoy it. But when a really hard workout starts to interfere with the ability to do the other things in life, That's not a good situation, so this is really terrific. There's a lot more in each of the those categories of strength and, hypertrophy, but you've given us a tremendous amount of valuable information there.[1:37:20] Andrew Huberman: Maybe now would be a good time to shift to endurance. And of the 4 types of endurance, and maybe you could remind us what those are. What do you think are the 2 that most people are seeking or pursuing in terms of health and aesthetics? Right. I mean, realize that we probably have athletes out there as well, but I think, when I think health in the studies, I think, okay.[1:37:41] Andrew Huberman: The ability to do sustained endurance, thirty Plus minutes of some ongoing activity, how does one maximize that work? What are the modifiable variables? Then maybe you could tell us what the, the other major category is Yep. That people ought to have in their, kit.[1:37:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. So starting off with exercise choice. One thing. As soon as we cross into the endurance world, and this is true for all 4 of those categories, exercise choice needs to be very concerned with eccentric landing. Alright.[1:38:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you don't need to avoid it, but you need to recognize it relative or compared against those other strength and speed ones. The volume is low on those ones. So if you have some eccentric absorption, it's okay. But as we sort of talked about 5 minutes ago, more eccentric means greater chance of muscle damage, Soreness. So if you take something and magnify it across 30 minutes or even 5 minutes, but of maximum exertion, you have a recipe for Blowing up.[1:38:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can imagine I haven't run-in forever, and I've just I've listened to this Huberman Lab Podcast, and I'm okay. I'm gonna get into my zone 2 training, whatever that whatever. And I start jogging. I'm a do I you know, I remember when I was I used to be able to do 25, and you just do a 25 minute jog. The amount of eccentric landing that just occurred on every single step because you're never, with running, even slow running, you never have 2 feet on the ground at the same time.[1:39:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is a 1 foot land 1 foot land, your entire body mass plus gravity onto 1 leg at a time repeated now Hundreds of times. That eccentric landing is gonna cause tremendous soreness. Your quads are gonna go. You're, probably gonna get shin splints, which is what This isn't those are entirely caused by eccentric landing, and when the tissue is not ready to tolerate that. If you're not landing correctly, this is when knee pain happens, back pain, shoulder, neck pain because of movement compensation.[1:39:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: So anytime we start pressing to fatigue, let's be very concerned with their so my initial, recommendation is start with activities exercise choice wise that are mostly concentric based. So think about a cycle. So when you're riding on a bike, you're pushing the pedal, but you're never landing and absorbing it. So you could go out and do a 45 minute bike ride, and you're not gonna get that sore because there's not a lot of eccentric Load. Swimming, similar thing here.[1:39:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? There's some eccentrics when your hand hits the water, but fairly minimal. It's mostly a push, push, push, push, push, no load. Rowing, similar thing, mostly concentric. Pushing a sled is fantastic.[1:40:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Going uphill, running, or even walking hard uphill, all good because they're very minimal landing relative to, like, running downhill, Which would be a very, very bad idea, to start. So when you if you're first jumping into these things, progress your volume for endurance Very slowly if it involves eccentric landing. A really bad strategy would be to jump in and do, say, circuit training class that involves a bunch of box jumps. Right. This is not a good way You're going to get incredibly sore because you're jumping and landing.[1:40:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're now looking at 3 to 10 x body weight in terms of absorption with a single landing even if you're just jumping. So be careful of that, in any of those endurance areas of exercise choice. So what to pick? The one that you are most technically proficient because you're gonna do it a lot. It's gonna be a lot of repetitions.[1:41:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Whatever one you feel the most joy in. If that's rowing, great. If that's pushing a sled, It doesn't really matter. You can do this actually with weights. This is our preferred way, by the way, with our athletes.[1:41:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we might do a 30 minute circuit Where we do a 5 minute farmer's carry with a pretty light weight. So you're just gonna carry some weights in your hand, and you're just gonna walk up and down the street for 5 minutes. You're gonna set that down, and then you're gonna do, say, a 3 minute plank. And then you're gonna pick that up, and you're gonna do body weight squats, like slowly and just tempo. And you're gonna do a handful of different exercises so the athletes don't get super bored, or a very simple one if a 30 minute workout, 10 minutes on a Treadmill, 10 minutes on a bike, 10 minutes on a rower.[1:41:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: But for those of you that are like, oh my god. I can't do 30 straight minutes of running. Cool. Break it up into 3 or 4 different exercises that are All fairly safe. So that's how I would do that long duration piece.[1:41:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Got it. For exercise choice.[1:41:57] Andrew Huberman: And then in terms of heart rate during that That period. I mean, how much attention should we pay to this? I the that a very broad, prescriptive I've thrown out on this podcast a few times based on my read of the literature is for most people that are Oriented toward health, including people that are working on size and strength gains, hypertrophy and strength, of course, that getting a 150 to a 180 minutes of so called zone two Cardio Yeah. You know, can just have a comp just barely have a conversation, but if one were to push any harder, you wouldn't be able to. That kind of thing.[1:42:25] Andrew Huberman: It's just as a kind of a generic recommendation that almost everybody should follow in order to just keep their cardiovascular system healthy. But I know there's a lot of nuance there, and some people would like to be able to run continuously for an hour at speed. Right? Obviously, not sprinting, but What are some of the, finer finer points on[1:42:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:42:47] Andrew Huberman: Long distance endurance? So I have How often should one do it?[1:42:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Frequency, you could do it as daily.[1:42:53] Andrew Huberman: Even when strength doing strength and hypertrophy[1:42:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: No question.[1:42:55] Andrew Huberman: Well, that I think is an important point for people to hear because a lot of people think that they are going to greatly diminish their strength and hypertrophy gains as it's often called, by doing in zone 2 cardio[1:43:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Zone 2, you have almost no ability to block your hypertrophy. Zone 2. Truly, if it's really, within that category, if you're talking about conversational pace, there is very in fact, there's strong reason to think that is not gonna influence hypertrophy For the overwhelming majority of people.[1:43:22] Andrew Huberman: It might even help it by increasing blood flow to the various Absolutely. Does it matter let's say someone's doing primarily strength and hypertrophy. Their their primary goals are strength and hypertrophy, and then they're going to do they're gonna gonna hit that 150 to a 180 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week, assuming they're breaking that up into 3 or 4 sessions. Does it matter if they do it in the same workout before Or after, does that matter? I tend to do just by way of example for people.[1:43:48] Andrew Huberman: Certainly, I'm just 1, one example. I tend to do, Resistance training one day, then I'll do zone 2 cardio. The next day, I jog because that's the thing I prefer. Then I'll do strength hypertrophy training the next day and then And jog for my zone 2 cardio, and then I take 1 full day off a week. I've never actually done the zone 2 cardio on the same day, but were I to do it on the same day, Would it matter if I did it before or after my my strength hypertrophy training?[1:44:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not really. Okay. You're gonna be just fine. Interference effects the interference effect is what this is called. So this is all the way back to 1980, Bob Hickman stuff.[1:44:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? And and he was actually working in a lab with John Hlazy who's One of the the fathers of exercise biochemistry. And the so the story goes that, Hickman came in. He was a strength training guy, And, Lazi, almost all those initial exercise physiologists were conditioning folks. Right?[1:44:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's almost always swimmers and runners. That's Why a bulk of the exercise physiology historically is is shaped in that direction. It's what those scientists were interested in. So Hickman was there in the lab and then the How much of this is myth or not? Whoever really knows, but so the story goes.[1:44:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: That this is sort of chipping back and forth, and you know how from a PI to a postdoc and Kind of that razzing works a little bit. And eventually, he was like, you gotta start running with us, and he was like, you gotta start lifting with me, and kinda goes back and forth. Well, you know who wins in that equation. It's not the postdoc. Right?[1:45:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's the PI gets in and says Hickman says, okay. Fine. So he starts running with Al Aazi, and then eventually starts to realize I'm getting weak. I'm losing strength and, like, I just can't. I think it was his bench press specifically was going down or maybe his squat.[1:45:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: I can't remember. Who knows if it's even real? But point is so it's going along, and so eventually, like, starts to create a little bit of animosity. And it's like, actually, I don't think it's good for me and then blah blah blah. And so they Did what any good scientist would do and said, well, let's find out.[1:45:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? And so they he run a really famous experiment where he took a group 3 groups. 1 group did a, endurance piece. Right? The steady state cardio.[1:45:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: 1 group did a strength training piece, and then the 3rd group did both of those workouts combined. Not like a reduction, so both both volumes stacked on top of other. And the results are it's fairly predictable in terms of the endurance group only had the greatest increases in VO two max and endurance markers. The strength training group had the greatest increases in muscle hypertrophy. But where the interesting part was, where this whole field started was the combined group.[1:46:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is concurrent training is what it's generally called. So you're doing concurrent things, and, typically, that means hypertrophy and strength stacked on top of some in steady state endurance. In the same Same same same workout[1:46:21] Andrew Huberman: 2 hour block.[1:46:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or same, like, week. It doesn't really it can be Got it. Kind of all these. Well, The concurrent group saw the same improvements in v o two max as the endurance group. And he's like, well, okay.[1:46:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So so strength training did not compromise the endurance adaptations. However, they saw much lower Increases in strength and hypertrophy. And so it was the conclusion was the addition of endurance work Compromised muscle growth and strength development. However, the addition of strength training to your endurance work will not compromise your endurance gains. Now that 2nd piece has been shown countless more times.[1:47:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So if you're an endurance athlete, adding strength training is almost always going to be massively beneficial. Very little chance of detriment, or it is why every endurance athlete is gonna have some sort of strength and power component to their training. The controversy though came in the interference effects. So how much endurance training really blocks muscular development?[1:47:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: And for years, myself included, was we preached hard. You know? Don't don't do these 2 things at the same time. My friend, my colleague Kevin Murek, has has a really nice review article, Jimmy Bagley. Those 2 guys put this thing out.[1:47:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can go read that, where they cover all these things, and they've got some nice figures in there. But the general answer here is Interference effect is sort of real, but it's probably greatly overblown. It matters. So you're talking about a 20 minute jog At conversation pace, that's probably doing very little. With the assumption that are you doing an eccentric based exercise like running.[1:47:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, then you're gonna have more of an interference effect than cycling. That makes a ton of sense if you think about it. Right? What's your total energy intake? If you're eating sufficient calories, you can still be in an anabolic state.[1:48:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: If the addition of extra energy expenditure, it's all it really is, mark The cardio put you in a negative energy state. It's being it's gonna become very difficult to go through anabolism. So those things matter. If you're talking about doing, like, running a few laps around the track as a warm up, like, that's not interference effect. What we're really talking about is a big volume performed consistently.[1:48:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now after Hickman came out with this paper paper in 1980, people followed it up in the nineties and 2000 with Mechanism. And we started to look and see we started to see, hey. There's this cell cell signaling pathway that goes down to called mTOR, and that's What leads to muscle growth, and then on the other side of that equation, there's a thing called AMPK, which is more associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and endurance. And there's this little molecule in between at the time most people would point to TSC 2. Well, turns out AMPK activation is fine.[1:49:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you activate mTOR, it has no bearing on AMPK. But if you activate AMPK, it's gonna activate TSC 2 which inhibited mTOR. And so it was like we had practical outcome, I. E. Hickman.[1:49:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna get Weaker. Now we had mechanism. So that story became very, very strong at this interference effect. This is how science should work. Right?[1:49:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: When you see mechanism match up with practical human outcome. Yeah.[1:49:26] Andrew Huberman: It's a strong state. Yep.[1:49:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: He was still wrong, though. It it just took more science. Right? And this is why we always have to give science a bit of time, And, you you have to be willing to to follow. Right?[1:49:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: And, again, even me in the field who has a practitioner background in science, I felt very strongly this is a big problem. It just didn't turn out to be the case. Enough studies came out where I'm like, okay. It's probably not that big a deal Unless the e the movement is heavily eccentric based, the volume is very high, you're trying to maximize muscle growth, and energy is not controlled. If that's not all the case, interference effect is probably not something most people should worry about.[1:50:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: When you especially when you compare that against The well roundedness that you need for total physiological health, probably not a big deal.[1:50:17] Andrew Huberman: Very reassuring for me to hear because I Do enjoy lifting weights, and I really enjoy running. And I I love running outside. I believe I used to experience the interference effect when I I used to do a very long run on Sundays.[1:50:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: I[1:50:29] Andrew Huberman: would just go out for, you know, 2 hours or something like that. I don't know that I ate enough or who knows? I always feel like I eat enough or more. I love to eat, But that long Sunday run always made it hard for me to make progressive Yeah. Gains in strength and hypertrophy in the gym.[1:50:49] Andrew Huberman: Whereas when I cut that to 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a week, I don't see any interference effect at all.[1:50:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Probably very real.[1:50:56] Andrew Huberman: And I haven't trained specifically for endurance in a very long time, so I don't, I haven't experienced the noninterference effect, Which, as you said before, most, if not all endurance athletes probably are or at least should be doing some sort of strength work just to keep the undercarriage Strong as I think Yeah.[1:51:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a bunch of reasons. Yeah. But yeah.[1:51:12] Andrew Huberman: So, so what are some protocols that people could explore for Continuous endurance training. I mean, I've thrown out this 150 to 180 minute zone 2 cardio, but that's really the, that's really the kinda kindergarten of endurance. Yeah. And there, I'm probably being generous. It's probably the nursery school of endurance that everyone should do.[1:51:31] Andrew Huberman: What sorts of other protocols? I realize that can be very goal directed, But is it unreasonable, for instance, for somebody to do, 4 hours of of continuous endurance training with intervals in there as well to get it kind of all around heart health and the ability to go long distances.[1:51:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I'll answer this 2 ways. The very first one, to tackle the the long duration endurance is I refer to it. You asked really about heart rate zones. To me, that's almost totally irrelevant.[1:51:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: It it doesn't matter. Right? If you're moving, you're moving. That's that's the functional piece here. If you wanna push it and go at a non conversational pace, that has tremendous health benefits.[1:52:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you wanna do it a little bit slower, fine. If you're at the pace where you can have a conversation, to me, I don't even count that as exercise. That's not to that's not a pejorative, by the way. That is just general physical movement, It is extraordinarily clear you need a lot of that. You need a lot more of that than we get.[1:52:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can do this in a couple of efficient ways. Just taking your phone calls moving. If you got a 30 minute call every day or most days of the week and you can do that while moving, you've checked not that whole box, but But a pretty good chunk of it.[1:52:38] Andrew Huberman: And that could even be done inside 100%. Pacing back and forth. I'm a big pacer.[1:52:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: The oh, yeah. Me too. Like, you probably saw me. Like, I'm gonna walk up and down all over the place. Most of the time when I'm in my office working, like, I'm I'm shadow boxing, like, I'm doing air squats.[1:52:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not even intentionally. I'm just like Do[1:52:54] Andrew Huberman: you have one of those treadmills under the dust?[1:52:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't, but, Like, every lab I ever came through, somebody did.[1:52:59] Andrew Huberman: We did an episode on workspace optimization, and the data on those treadmills[1:53:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: are[1:53:03] Andrew Huberman: pretty interesting. They definitely increase alertness, for which for obvious reasons, even a little bit of movement is gonna generate a little bit of adrenaline. So pacing around, moving, taking calls, moving, getting walks when you can. And then in terms of building endurance, let's say somebody wants to, quote, unquote, get into better shape.[1:53:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:53:22] Andrew Huberman: They already may or may not already have some size and strength that they're happy with, and they just wanna get in they wanna improve their health.[1:53:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:53:30] Andrew Huberman: So what when does that 150, 180 this thing tick over into a different protocol?[1:53:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Okay. So I think the way that I can outline a weekly schedule Just as a conceptual model here, that long duration stuff is not even counting as I mentioned. Right? It's just a this is what you need to do as a human Moving forward, we haven't improved.[1:53:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're extremely unfit, you may see some changes in cardiovascular health care. But for the most part, this is just knocking out the general physical practice you need to be Higher functioning. So whatever that time domain is, I don't really care. It's it's not a huge concern of mine. What I think you need to hit are these nodes.[1:54:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: You need to do something once a week that gets you to a maximum heart rate. Now I don't have to literally mean max, but close.[1:54:11] Andrew Huberman: This means really sucking for air.[1:54:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Really. Like, as high as you can possibly get. You can wear a heart rate monitor if you want. But maximal heart rate, the The rough equation we say is 220 minus your age. So if you're 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is probably about a 180 beats per minute.[1:54:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now I can tell you flat out right now, my max heart rate is close to 210, which means I'm 10 years old. So take that number with a grain of salt. I have had a bunch of professional athletes who are in their twenties, and their max heart rate's 175, and they are in way better shape than I am. So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for physical fitness. It's a rough number.[1:54:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: An easy way to do it is if you have a heart rate monitor or anything like that, do the hardest workout you can possibly do, See what the highest number you get as soon as that's close. That's if you wanna just start at 2 20 miles per age, that's fine too. Do something though where you're like, yep. This is death. Like, this is really, really challenging.[1:55:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: For how long? However long that takes you. That can be a 30 second go on an aerodyne or aerosol bike. That could be a, do one of those things where you kinda like sprint. Run as hard as you can during the straightaway on a track and then walk the corners, kind of an old classic backing when you and I were kids, interval training.[1:55:26] Andrew Huberman: They don't do that anymore.[1:55:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Guess I don't know. I don't know. I don't even talk about it.[1:55:29] Andrew Huberman: In PE class, we had to change, and if you didn't bring running shoes, you had to do it barefoot.[1:55:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, I love it.[1:55:34] Andrew Huberman: And, I love your teacher. Yeah. It wasn't a we our football, basketball, baseball teams weren't that good, but, anything like running, cross country just because of where I grew up Oh, yeah. Brutal Brutal coaches so that, yeah, they'd make the all kids do these runs.[1:55:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. So it can be in the the 30 probably seconds at a minimum. It it's hard to get you to a true heart rate max in shorter than 30 seconds. You can get the total suck in under 20 seconds, but getting to a true heart rate max probably gonna take more than 30 seconds. So it doesn't really matter what you wanna do.[1:56:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: It can be, again, a sprint uphill. It could be what you're talking it could be burpees to death. You know, like, whatever whatever you wanna do[1:56:14] Andrew Huberman: Oh, those have an eccentric component. Right? Yeah.[1:56:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: They do. Yeah. No question about it.[1:56:18] Andrew Huberman: But if you did to actual death, by the way.[1:56:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. If you just did, I'm gonna do as many burpees as I can for 90 seconds. It probably won't take you much longer than that to get to close to.[1:56:28] Andrew Huberman: Is that a whole workout?[1:56:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Could be.[1:56:30] Andrew Huberman: So once a week, get to max heart rate. Touch it. I love it.[1:56:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Touch it. It's not the best, but it'll It'll work.[1:56:37] Andrew Huberman: And and what are the specific benefits that that provides?[1:56:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. So earlier in our in our chat, we We outlined the rule of specificity. Specific adaptation to impose demand. If you're never getting to that high of a pace, you're never it would be like trying to get stronger, but only going to 60%. So every cardiovascular adaptation that occurs with cardiovascular training is just simply going to get to the top or end doing this.[1:57:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you just start at the heart itself, stroke volume increase. So this is amount of blood that's kicked out per contraction. Cardiac output, Resting heart rate. If you go to the endothelial function, you're talking about nitric oxide release, endothelial health in general, Capillary, mitochondria, all the way down. Like, you just walk through the whole system, pulmonary exchange to the lungs.[1:57:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: All of those are going to benefit by being challenged to their maximum.[1:57:28] Andrew Huberman: Also teach you where your vomit reflex is.[1:57:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. There you go. Right?[1:57:31] Andrew Huberman: Let's hope not.[1:57:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Stress is what causes adaptation. Right? So if you push your Okay. Here's the difference. If you did 25 minutes of steady state, you're not challenging the same thing as what we just talked about.[1:57:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: The way that I explain this is if you understand the point the point of physiological failure, then you understand the place of adaptation. That's it. So if you and I both go run on a we did a both did a v o two max test. So classic v o two max test is gonna take 8 to 12 minutes, and it's gonna look something like this. We're gonna get in a treadmill, and we're gonna run.[1:58:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: And every minute, I'm gonna just slightly increase that treadmill, either the speed or the grade. Most of the time it's the speed. Right? So we we get to a high grade, say 10% grade or something, and then we go 5 miles per hour, 5.2, 5.4. 5 and we just go until you can't go any longer.[1:58:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now let's say you and I did that and we had the same exact time frame, And so we we both want 8 minutes. The time that you last is not the thing that we care about. Right? It's the it's the volume of oxygen that you breathe out is what determines it. Well, let's take a look at the same time domain, and we have the same VO two max.[1:58:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Let's say they are both 50 milliliters per kilogram per minute, which is like a okay number, but that's nothing to be extremely proud about just because we have the same number does not mean we have the same point point of physiological failure. And This matters because it's gonna answer the the what do I do about it then question. Right? So if you got off and I and I started asking you a series of questions and you're like basically said, why'd you quit? You know, why did why did you jump off the treadmill?[1:59:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why'd you stop? And you were like, my chest like, I couldn't catch my breath. I thought my heart was gonna explode. Okay. Great.[1:59:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you ask me and I said my legs were on fire, like, I was breathing hard, but I couldn't take another step, This is a very rough indicator of different places of physiological disruption. Now what I've seen a lot with my professional athletes, especially like fighters, They are 10 they're going to generally fail on their legs because they don't often do a lot of strength training in their legs. They don't do a lot of leg work. They're fighting on their back literally a lot or on top or on their knees. So their their legs tend to give out before there.[1:59:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Someone who feels in the cardiovascular system like, say, you did a lot of leg training, typically, like an endurance athlete who's that's not gonna be their issue. It's just gonna be they're gonna reach a heart rate and ventilation threshold that's they can no longer handle. If I put you on the exact same training protocols, it's not gonna be as effective because you're going to always fail at your legs, and they're gonna always fail at their Cardiovascular system. I need to flip that. Right?[2:00:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: I need to put you in a position to where you can reach a true heart rate or ventilation challenge While your legs are still hanging in there, or the opposite. So the training protocol is based on that point of failure. The adaptation is in the same thing. So if you are failing because of your legs, then you might see a greater increase in capitalization in your legs Relative to somebody else who's failing in their, cardiovascular system, they may see a greater change in in something on that side of the equation. So that it it matters how you're failing at all times.[2:00:35] Andrew Huberman: What I love about this is that it's it's sounds like it's like a thermometer for where one is weak and needs work, but also provides a stimulus to improve The very thing that you need[2:00:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's that's the trick.[2:00:46] Andrew Huberman: Right. So, to just get real brass tacks about it, it would be once a week.[2:00:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Yeah.[2:00:52] Andrew Huberman: At 90 90 seconds near maximum heart rate[2:00:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'll make it do more?[2:00:57] Andrew Huberman: Could I, you know, could I do 5 or 6 of those 92nd bouts?[2:01:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: No question. You can do, as long as you touch that max heart rate, I'm good. Right? Ideal world, probably 4 to 8. In that single session?[2:01:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Ideal. Okay. Right? If that takes you 20 seconds or 90 seconds, it's fine. If you wanna do 30 on, 30 off, you wanna do 20 on, 40 off, 40 on, 20 off, those numbers don't matter.[2:01:19] Andrew Huberman: Is there an interference effect of this on the other sorts of training that we've talked about?[2:01:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Tends to be complementary. There there is the the evidence available suggests that this high interval stuff is is more likely to be complementary to hypertrophy training, probably because of lactate, and some other cool things, Which are very beneficial molecules that people don't understand. They they think it's bad. It's actually a hugely beneficial thing. It can be interference.[2:01:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: It can provide interference if Calories are not accounted for, or breasts are not accounted for, and and other things. But in general, it's it's probably okay. I wouldn't add it to your equation if you don't need it for maximizing hypertrophy. But for the person who wants to just get well rounded physiology, yeah, I wouldn't hesitate, to do these even in the same session or different sessions.[2:02:03] Andrew Huberman: Terrific. So and if that's done once a week and the Yep. 150 to a 180 minutes or so of zone 2 cardio is done, You know, in the rest of the week, you the person's doing their strength and hypertrophy training, we would hope. What other sorts of endurance Practices could one incorporate you mentioned muscular endurance, like the ability would like a wall sit or the ability to do a plank. Was that that something is that useful for anything?[2:02:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yes. Is[2:02:28] Andrew Huberman: that be be doing planks and wall sitting?[2:02:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. No. It's extraordinarily useful. Let's hold on muscular endurance. I wanna finish 1 more thing on this side.[2:02:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if we're building this week of endurance, Once a week, hit that number. If you can do repeated bouts, you know, we talked 4 to 8, that's fantastic. If you can't muscle the The if you can't manage the mental energy every week, do it every other week. It's still very good. Right?[2:02:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because I I get it. I'm a working person too. Sometimes you're just like, I cannot like, those workouts feel incredible afterwards, but, man, they are daunting. If you love this stuff, you could do it 4 times a week. If you hate it, though, it's not realistic to think you're gonna be able to knock this out.[2:03:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna end up doing 70, 80%, which is not gonna get you the benefits, so just don't do it.[2:03:15] Andrew Huberman: You really have to hit that ceiling.[2:03:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: You gotta get up there. Close.[2:03:18] Andrew Huberman: Oh, Have someone chase I always say, you know, the, to when doing this this kind of work, in in my mind, I'm thinking that I'm basically being chased by somebody with a with a syringe full of poison. Yep. And while there are other ways out of the situation and for the benefit of what we're talking about, the one I'm referring to is to just run.[2:03:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah. My motivation is typically, If you just get this done, we're done in a couple of minutes. Just get it done. Like, don't go here if you're not gonna do it, but when you show up, Check-in, and it's over really quickly.[2:03:47] Andrew Huberman: Breathing down regulation afterwards? 100%. You have to.[2:03:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So it's a huge key. So if you absolutely can't do it, do it every other week. That's twice a month. Give me twice a month.[2:03:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: It can be done on the road. It can be done in 20 minutes. Like, do a really good thorough warm up. Don't just jump into those, by the way, right away. It's not gonna be as beneficial.[2:04:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Really nice, good sweat broke, a really good warm up, and then give me 4 minutes of hard work and we're done. Right. Get out of there. If you wanna use, like, a bath or hot thermal stress to kinda, like, aid in that warm up process, fine. Get in a sauna, get in a hot bath, get really hot, get up there, warm up, Knock it out.[2:04:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Whole thing is 20 minutes plus 5 minutes breathing. You're out[2:04:25] Andrew Huberman: of there. I'm gonna start doing this.[2:04:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's so bad. You got a bike right there.[2:04:29] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I've got all sort every every every room in this studio that has a different piece of equipment, it seems.[2:04:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I want that once a week, Realistically, every week if I have to. I want that physical activity piece. Call it whatever you want, long duration thing. Ideally, you'll do as much of that Through your nose only. You're not gonna be able to do the interval stuff at nose only.[2:04:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You the don't even try. But if you can go that whole 30 minute time or 20 or 40 minutes, whatever it's gonna be, that's actually a good way to regulate intensity. So go as hard as you can while still being able to breathe through your nose only. If you have to open up your mouth a little bit, Fine, but try to stay there. What you'll see is very quickly, you'll be able to increase your work output while just breathing through your nose, which has a bunch of other Beyond to benefits.[2:05:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: The other piece I want is this middle ground, which is can you sustain hard work For 8 to 12, maybe as little as 4 minutes. I'll give you 4 to 12 minutes. This doesn't have to be quite as high As the first one, you don't have to get to Hart and Max. But can you get somewhere in the 80% range? And can you hold that for 4 minutes?[2:05:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe give me 2 minutes, 2 minutes of rest and do that twice. Something like that. I ideal situation is what a runner would do is, like, what we call mile repeats, because they're running 4 or 5 minute miles. Whatever time it takes them to finish, they're gonna rest that. So it's a one to 1 work to rest ratio.[2:05:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So a 5 minute mile, Rest 5 minutes and go again. That's probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks. Well, the[2:05:56] Andrew Huberman: well, the 5 minute part is unrealistic for most folks. For me, it would be, you know, 8 minutes 8 minutes. Fine. Probably something like that now.[2:06:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: In your particular case, just do the 800 meter. So do 800 meters. Do something that takes 2 to 6 minutes of work. It is a lower intensity than the max stuff, but is a much higher workload. That is probably gonna give you You might even argue the most cardiovascular benefit because it is sustained work output, and that's very critical.[2:06:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: The downside of kinda like that conversational pace, It's physical activity. It's movement. It's blood flow. It's lymphatic drainage. It's not very cardiovascularly challenging, though.[2:06:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're you're just not gonna get an optimal Health from just walking actively.[2:06:41] Andrew Huberman: So 2 to 6 minutes of of Hard work. Of hard work with Then an equivalent amount of rest in between, and then repeat how many times?[2:06:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Once if you have to. Mhmm. If it needs to be 1 rep, if it needs to be a 6 minute thing and then Down regulate breathe. Twice, if you can do that, 6 times, 8 times, like, whatever whatever you can really do. And you can just take that as long of the training session as you want or short.[2:07:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Exercise choice could be whatever you want. So, again, you can do sled pushes or it could be a kettlebell circuit or any combination of things where you're just working and you're not giving yourself a break. You have got to be able to hold on at a very high waste product production level as well as a high demand for energy. And then bring it down.[2:07:26] Andrew Huberman: And breathing during this 2 to 6 minutes of of hard, output is Mainly through the nose or combination nose and mouth, or is that getting too technical?[2:07:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, it's probably like, I like it, but you tell me if it's too technical. You're gonna try to maintain these lonely as much as you can, but you're gonna lose it at some point. As you you can go through their Brian and and Rob's gear system learn more, and then you can kinda see what gear to be in. If you have to go nose in, mouth out, or something like that, but I don't really care too much honestly in that range. I'm getting most of my nasal only stuff at night and training and everything.[2:08:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you have to open up the throttle there to get the work done, that's okay. Oh, then then we'll actually go to your answer your question, which is muscular endurance. Let's go back to that piece. Muscular endurance is incredibly important For general maintenance of joint health. In other words, you have got form follows function.[2:08:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? It's a very classic sciency physiology saying. Meaning, you've got a couple of different there's a bunch. But to make it easy, 2 different types of muscle fibers, fast twitch and slow twitch. Fast twitch fibers tend to be, but they're not always bigger.[2:08:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: They contract with a higher velocity. That's why they are called fast twitch. But they tend to be more glycolytic and thus fatigable. Slow twitch are tend to be smaller, well, not always. They are more packed with mitochondria.[2:08:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: They were generally better at burning fat as fuel, but contract with lower velocity. Well, we have these 2 types so that we can regulate function more. You have some muscle groups that we're going to oh, sorry. Let me let me go back up a quick second. Each individual muscle in human body has Combination of some amount of fast and some amount of slow.[2:09:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: That percentage of fast versus slow differs from muscle to muscle. So it also differs from person to person. Easy example is your calf muscle. There's there's 3, but there's 2 primary muscles in your calf. One's called the soleus, one's the gastroc.[2:09:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: These the gastroc is the one where if you take your toe and point it towards your face and then flex, that's the one that pops out, you know, on on the medial side, the inside. The soleus is what we call anti gravity muscle, and it is generally about 80% to even 90% slow twitch. And that's because it's supposed to be contracted lightly all time. It's supposed to be on permanently. It's it's meant to keep we call it anti gravity because it's meant to keep your erect Up and moving.[2:09:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Your spinal erector is supposed to do this. Various muscles for postural are are generally slow twitch muscles. So we're supposed to be on all times, Not produce fast, not produce force, but don't get tired. The gas rock is the opposite. It's not activated very often, but when it's activated, it's it's meant for extreme propulsion.[2:10:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this gives us the ability to reach up and scratch our eyeball and also punch somebody. Right. We have to be able to regulate force output, which is going back to Henneman. Right? Controlling what we use and we don't use while also not wasting energy, Which is the the downside of activating a big threshold motor neuron is it's it requires a ton of energy.[2:10:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a more efficient mode of energy, but the total amount is really, really high. So muscular endurance is going to help those slow twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch predominant muscles Maintain their working job. So if you lose your muscular endurance ability in your spinal erectors or your calf, you're gonna start slumping into bad positions. You're gonna be getting, putting joints in a in a movement pattern that they're not going to be the most happy with. So it's more than about them being able to just maintain a 2 minute Wall squat, it's about maintaining joint integrity and allowing that musculature to not fatigue when you ask it to do heavy and fast.[2:11:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what I mean by that is you've got a whole combination of muscles in your shoulder, and we will generally call these, like, the rotator cuff muscles. Well, let's imagine those Slow twitch postural muscles get fatigued, and they start to lose contractile tension. And then you go to do something heavy or fast or an emergency situation. Those are already pre fatigued. You're gonna rely more upon the fast twitch muscle fibers, which are there less for postural integrity.[2:11:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're likely to get out of position. And this is a whole recipe of like, god, why is my shoulder just hurting? God, my back. That's very often a case of the slow twitch fibers, the slow twitch muscle groups losing muscular endurance. So you need to build that back up that they can control and hold the joint in the position so the fast twitch virus can then contract with force.[2:11:53] Andrew Huberman: I'm hoping that What I'm gonna say next meets, what you said, accurately. My experience is that getting injured, lifting weights or even doing housework or yard work almost always happens when I'm not paying attention, fatigued, that's kind of obvious, but also getting in position to initiate a movement, setting down a weight or lifting weights off the rack or or picking up dumbbells. That's Almost always when I seem to activate this lower back thing that happens every, you know, 6 or 8 months. And What you're saying, if I understand correctly, is that this muscular endurance from wall sits or planks or things of that sort, maybe you could give us a few other examples of[2:12:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:12:34] Andrew Huberman: Of of these, can Help us because they actually prepare the system to do what we normally think of as the more intense work. So it's it's really the it sounds like it's really the architecture of the of the body, that includes nerves and muscles and everything else, of course, that lets the limbs and and other kind of action end of the body do do its best work.[2:12:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Let it express its own power and force. Yep. We've actually landed on one of my final laws of strength conditioning, which is similar to what I said earlier. Right?[2:13:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I said exercises do not determine adaptations. Application determines adaptation. So it sounds similar, but it's quite different. There are no good or bad exercises. There's only good or bad application.[2:13:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Here's a great example of that. Right. So you do not get hurt deadlifting because deadlifts are dangerous. You only get hurt deadlifting because you either got in bad position. You you got in bad position because you either started in bad position, which is one of the things you just said, or you ended up in bad position.[2:13:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: You did too much volume, you did too much intensity, or you did too much complexity. Those last 3 things all hurt you because they result in the first one, Which is out of position. Or another way to think about this is if it's not a a a visible change in position is Stress got put into a part of the system that should not absorb that much stress. So you did too much of it. You did it too heavy.[2:14:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: You got fatigued and so you broke position. You got too heavy so you broke position. You do you made that exercise too complex. You put too many moving parts in it. You put too many joints in it, And you got out of position.[2:14:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: You did that too many times over time. Now we've led for either an acute injury. Bam. You know, back pops and you fall on the floor or just like, man, this thing is hurting over time. All these are result of the same thing.[2:14:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you cannot ever blame the exercise For causing the problem, it's always either the user or the coach. You programmed way too much here, and I can't handle that position, or you yourself Went into it too much. So if you're getting these little tweaks and and problems going on, you've made an error in one of those things. So simply back off. Reduce the complexity.[2:14:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Give yourself more stability, less moving parts. Do less volume, Douless intensity. In fact, if you look at the people from the physical therapy world in terms of the pain literature, it's very clear that just stopping a movement is very rarely going to work. What you wanna do is back off all the way down to just below that threshold of that's what aggravates it, and you wanna train right there.[2:15:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's gonna allow you to do 2 things. Number 1, tissue tolerance, and then number 2, desensitization. A lot of pain stuff, and you could probably speak a lot about this, is Especially with things like low back pain is there's not necessarily often much damage there. It's a lot of hypersensitization of just pain signal pain signal. Omitting the movement entirely does not get that signal to go away.[2:15:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: You need to train just below that signal and desensitize it. So you wanna make sure that muscular endurance allows you you're just putting volume right below where you start to get a tweak, and it is beautifully effective for that.[2:15:44] Andrew Huberman: I've experienced this right side lower back pain for years, sometimes shooting down the hip. The 2 things that really helped, were doing anterior tip work. So, you know, hats off to knees over toes, Skye Benpatrick, who has, you know, created a lot of popularity around[2:15:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:16:00] Andrew Huberman: Tib work. But I[2:16:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Turns out, Joints, full range of motion, you're in a better spot.[2:16:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They something about stabilizing the stuff from the knee down helped my back and then also some some neck of mine are always teasing me that my gym is filled with the the most bizarre equipment. You know, it doesn't look like any other gym. A lot of it is just designed to keep me healthy and and still training, but, I love this idea of of getting right at the below the threshold of pain activation and not simply going into to complete, nonaction or just taking complete rest, that actually can be detrimental. I'd love to talk about a few items that support training of all kinds and where there's a lot of confusion and, indeed, misconception and mystery.[2:16:41] Andrew Huberman: And just get your take on these. And and I Just wanna acknowledge at the outset that for some of these, there's a lot of science. For some of them, there's less science, but there certainly is a lot of, experience in in your camp, and and those categories are cold, heat, and hydration. Because, obviously, whether or not you're a runner, whether or not strength training, if you're a human being, you you need to hydrate. But in terms of work output and Physical work output, maybe even cognitive work output.[2:17:10] Andrew Huberman: Maybe tackle hydration first. I mean, there is what, what I call and what I think has now Come to be known as the the Galpin equation[2:17:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:17:18] Andrew Huberman: Which, you really do deserve credit for because I think that people, realize that there are a range of solutions out there, But there is a really, a desperate need for, straightforward solutions that work for 75% of people 75% of the time. So Hydration is key. Maybe you could underscore just how how key it is for us. And then what is the Galpin equation as as I call it, and I think others are now referring to it?[2:17:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Okay. Benefits of hydration slash consequences of, mishydration. So whether that's dehydration or overload, you Physiology has hermetic curves. Right?[2:17:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now typically, we think about this in terms of toxicology. So what this means is at some point, Giving you a dose of something. Testosterone's a very easy example. If you're clinically deficient or low in testosterone and I give you a little bit it brings you back to a normal range. You generally see an improvement in health and functionality.[2:18:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Taking you though from normal To super high doesn't always necessarily provide additional benefit. In fact, if you continue to go, it's gonna provide detriment. Right? So everything has this curve. And then some things are hormetic stressors, which means, like, a a small, short, fast insult is actually beneficial, because then you come back Bigger, faster, stronger.[2:18:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's that's how an adaptation works. Basic hormesis. Okay? Hydration is the same way. So at the end of the curve here, if you are under hydrated, We all know.[2:18:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could die. Right? You have to have things. In fact, water is the only thing that is ubiquitous across Biology is in terms of every living thing has to have it. There's no other vitamin, mineral, nutrient that is required among all living things with exception of water.[2:18:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that should give you a pretty good indication of It's importante. Right? Like, you gotta have this thing. Down here at the bottom, if you're dehydrated and they give you more, it's beneficial effects. However, if you're up the top already, and I continue to give you more water past that, now we run into actual problems.[2:19:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we can get what's called hyponatremia, Which is more common than people realize. Atremia being actually not referring to the water, but the the sodium concentration being too low. And you've probably talked about that at length of of why that's an issue. If sodium potassium balances inside outside a cell come off, you heart stops. Right?[2:19:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Muscle contraction ends, and all these things. So you don't wanna be over or under hydrated. So understanding the this rough equation I Sort of loosely calculated one day is helpful for that. I think the the most context is is talking about how much water to drink throughout the day, and how much water to drink during exercise? So the the very easy answer is half your body weight in ounces per day is a Very loose guideline for total amount of fluid consumption.[2:19:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you weigh 200 pounds, aim for a 100 ounces of water. It's like a very Easy number. If you hit that, you're probably, I'd say, 90% of you are a good 90% of the time alone. If you then go to exercise, You need to then account for that fluid loss with exercise. And in general, you wanna consume a 125% to a 150% Of the amount of weight you lost in fluid.[2:20:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: In other words, if you worked out and you were 200 pounds naked, and you and did your workout, and then you dried off, and you weighed yourself again, and now you're a 198 pounds. You lost 2 pounds of water. That's 32 ounces. You wanna drink back about a 125% of that. So instead of drinking 32 ounces, I want you to drink 40, 42, 45, like, something like this.[2:20:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because one of the reasons why is unless you're drinking something that is isotonic, Meaning the same exact concentration in your blood and that you're in your fluid, you're just gonna go closer to that hyponatremia. You're gonna get a bunch of barrel refractor Reflect responses, and you're going to actually think you have too much fluid, and you're gonna urinate it out.[2:21:02] Andrew Huberman: What if I'm not weighing myself before and after workouts? And, is there a, shorthand version of this that, you know, after training for an hour, I should drink at least x ounces. Yeah.[2:21:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: That does[2:21:15] Andrew Huberman: Assuming it's at at kind of taller you know, I'm not sweating super heavily.[2:21:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. In that particular case, You could probably go something like, if everyone in the world did, I don't know, 12 to 20 ounces, That's probably, like, pretty decent.[2:21:34] Andrew Huberman: And they're probably doing that. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And what about electrolytes, like, consuming salt, potassium, and manganese?[2:21:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: But that only works though if you're coming in at Optimum Hydration. And this is the problem. This is why you have to you have to flag this starting with A good total daily amount of water. Because if if you're coming in and you're like, oh, I drink 2 or 3 glasses of water a day, then you might need to drink 50 or 60 ounces post workout because you're way behind. So that, like, oh, 12 ounces or so works if you're already generally very well hydrated.[2:22:03] Andrew Huberman: And if people are drinking, you know, 4 to 6 glasses of water a day, but the they're also drinking a lot of Caffeine in any form, then they're going to be excreting more water in most cases. Right?[2:22:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well Because caffeine's a diuretic. Okay. Kinda is, but it kinda isn't either. It's not the diuretic that we used to think about it as. It is still fluid consumption.[2:22:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's only a diuretic if it had caused you to excrete more fluid than it actually was being intake. So, if caffeine intake is in a normal range, I don't I don't have to worry about the diuretic effects. If someone is drinking 12 cups of coffee a day, we're we're gonna or they're taking caffeine pills or something. Now The excretion is gonna outkick the coverage. So now we're gonna have problems.[2:22:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Because there's no fluid consumption with the caffeine pill. So in general, things like tea assumption. Like, I I'm not super worried about those things. You can count those towards your total total fluid intake if you want.[2:22:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're like, I drink 60 ounces of water plus Twenty ounces of coffee and then, you know, this like, you're gonna add that all up, and you're gonna be totally okay. So natural you also have problems with synthetic of caffeine versus natural forms of caffeine. Natural forms are are are pretty okay. It can be[2:23:14] Andrew Huberman: just fine. Tea, etcetera. Yeah. All that stuff. Form is where it gets tricky.[2:23:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Always. Like, always. Right? So general, just eat real food and things. You're gonna be just fine.[2:23:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: The last piece to consider is your diet quality matters Because, the fluid content in your food can vary wildly. So something like a bagel Might be, you know, 5 to 10% water or something like a watermelon is 98%, 95%, something in a huge range. Even meat It's very high percentage of fluid intake. Like, it's a really high. Even after you cook it, there's still a lot of fluid in there.[2:23:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're eating a whole food, Mostly whole food based diet. Your endogenous hydration is actually pretty high already just from your food. If you're eating a very highly processed dehydrated over salted Diet. You've you're way low on hydration just in your food. So you have to factor all these things.[2:24:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: And in fact, one of the things that happens to us constantly with folks that go from a, like, Highly processed, low quality diet to a high quality one is they just they're just peeing nonstop. Like, what the hell is going on? I'm like, well, you're actually have brought in 60 additional ounces of water in your diet relative to what you used to have, and you've gone from 10 grams of sodium There to 4 to 2. Sometimes 1. Sometimes it gets very low because you're not like salt.[2:24:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Are you salting your food? No? Okay. Well, we don't have sodium intake then. Like, we're way down.[2:24:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So everything that we're considering is based on that. So let's assume someone's eating a a pretty well balanced diet. They're drinking 60 ounces of water and maybe some caffeine, Coffee and tea, things like that. We don't exactly know the optimal amount of sodium one should intake. It is very clear high Sodium concentrations are still associated with a lot of negative health outcomes, especially in combination with poor physical activity, in combination with low food quality, And other comorbidities.[2:25:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's a very bad thing. You need to be very careful about those things. If everything else is okay, we're okay playing with a little bit higher salt. In fact, you're you're probably gonna feel better. You're gonna feel generally pretty good.[2:25:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: You just it seems to be very clear. If you are overweight, highly stressed, and you don't have a lot of these things ticked off and you have known comorbidities, you really need to pay attention to salt intake. It can be very nasty. So that being said, what we're generally going to look at folks is, are you at least can we categorize you as a low sodium or high sodium sweater? If so, there's a whole list of electrolytes you can look on that are gonna have something like 200 to 400 milligrams Per serving.[2:25:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a whole list of these things. If you're a low sodium sweater, you're I'm probably gonna send you after one of those. If you're sodium sweater, there's a lot of electrolyte supplements that are closer to 6 or 800, even a even a whole gram, per single serving size. So you wanna play with that. A very you[2:26:07] Andrew Huberman: know if you're a low sodium or high sodium sweater? We actually have an episode on salt we put out that, or is coming out soon, if hasn't come out already, which is, you know, when you look at the hazard ratios Yeah. For salt intake, basically, your probability of Really bad things happen to you, goes way up as you get towards, you know, a lot of sodium intake, you know, 10, 12 grams per day, and, And this is translated to teaspoons of salt, etcetera, but also very low sodium intake is a problem.[2:26:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: No question about it.[2:26:35] Andrew Huberman: It's a it's not a perfect u shape. It's kind of a j shaped Gerber, a kinda hockey stick shape more or less, but, how would I know if I'm a low sodium or high sodium sweat?[2:26:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So you can get[2:26:46] Andrew Huberman: just kinda lick my sweat or have someone else do You can.[2:26:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Find a super friend who'll lick your sweat for you. Same with how[2:26:53] Andrew Huberman: No no willing volunteers that I'm aware of, but I be able to tell?[2:26:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. You can get sweat testing done. Actually, you have a a number of options. The kind of the original one that most of us use in the background for many years is called Levoline. They'll send you out a little patch.[2:27:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can wear that, send it in the lab, and they'll measure it directly in the lab and send it back. A $150 or[2:27:14] Andrew Huberman: Did they bin you into low, medium, and high? So They're gonna[2:27:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: give they're gonna do that, but they're gonna give you very they're gonna tell you exactly the milligrams. And then they're gonna actually tell you, like, what products and stuff and, that they're exactly matched.[2:27:25] Andrew Huberman: Do you do this with that with professional athletes?[2:27:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: We have many times. Yes. Interesting. You can do a more consumer grade version. Gatorade has a patch.[2:27:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: For $25, you can get 2 of them. You can put that cat patch on your left forearm and download the Gatorade app, and you can do a workout, measure it right there, and click it over, and they'll tell you exactly, Not only higher low, but, again, they'll tell you the milligrams of sodium that are in your sweat, and you then you can figure out, again, kinda high, medium, or or interesting.[2:27:51] Andrew Huberman: I do much better on a, Slightly higher sodium intake.[2:27:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most do.[2:27:56] Andrew Huberman: But and my carbohydrate I do eat carbohydrates. I'm one of those that it is pretty moderate, but I try and eat clean foods. So I, I'd noticed and I tend to be slightly low blood pressure. So, again, to reiterate the the warning there that if somebody is, prehypertension or has hypertension or obese, you really do need to be Careful with your sodium intake, but many people seem to find that they feel better when they increase their sodium intake, and they're still in that healthy portion of the Hazard ratio[2:28:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: cure. Most of the athletes, I would say, in general, we're gonna go higher in salt. When they come, we're gonna run their stuff, and we're gonna add salt. Almost always. Very few times have I gone, ah, we need to cut this back.[2:28:31] Andrew Huberman: One of[2:28:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: the exception, the ones that come in that eat like 14 year olds. And I'm like, okay. You're at 15 milligrams or you're 15 grams a day because you're eating nothing but[2:28:40] Andrew Huberman: Garbage.[2:28:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we're we're, like, we're gonna come down. You're gonna feel way better. All this bloating and everything else that's gonna happen go down. You can do that. There are actually more there are biosensors that are coming out, that are not available yet, but they're coming very soon in this space.[2:28:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're gonna be able Give you real time metrics on, salt. So you can pay attention to those. I haven't seen 1 and used 1 personally, so I don't wanna this spouse about how good or bad it is, but I know that those are coming from a handful of companies. An easy way to do is just look at, wear a hat wear some sort of headband or something and do your workout. Take it off.[2:29:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you see a just huge white band Or if it's completely clear, and that's gonna tell you. Big white band, you're probably a high salt sweater. Completely clear, very little coming out.[2:29:26] Andrew Huberman: That's great. And I I can see the the post on Instagram now, people showing their their salt band from from from sweating. Yeah. I mean, obviously, salt is So essential for so many physiological functions. You don't want too high or too low.[2:29:38] Andrew Huberman: But if you're losing more, it makes sense. You would need to take in more. Yep. So half of my body weight In ounces as a just foundation of of a fluid intake, coffee and tea could be included in that, but that should probably be mostly water or things similar to it. What and then during exercise, the how do I wanna think about this again?[2:29:58] Andrew Huberman: Let's say I'm a let's say I'm a high salt output, I'd wanna drink maybe 40 ounces of water with or or more.[2:30:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Okay. I'll I'll do this easier. Let's talk about pre And mid and post. Right?[2:30:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what to drink pre if you if you come in having hit these rules, you're you're okay. And pre Workout can be as little as, like, 5 or 6 ounces. Basically, a couple sips of water. Fine. If you come in Poorly hydrated, then you maybe need to go more like 12.[2:30:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: But here's the deal. If you start off a session in a bad spot, you're not gonna kept catch back up. Like, you you're just you're you're in trouble. Let's say you come and you did you follow direction. 500 milligrams salt before, 500 milligrams after.[2:30:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: A very easy rule. Pick whatever source you want. That's a couple of sprinkles of table salt. If you want Himalayan, that's fine. You don't have to.[2:30:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Himalayan is actually a fairly low sodium salt, it's not the best for for this purposes. If you're higher, salt or sweat a little bit more. If you wanna go choose an electrolyte of which there are infinite, you can look on the packet, and it'll tell you, you know, 250 milligrams per serving or 400 or 600 or whatever happens to be. But around 500 pre 500 post is a very general rule. And then during is thanks to you, my famous Galpin equation now that is is all over the world.[2:31:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: All I did is I took the literature and I said, okay. In general, the research shows pretty clearly 2 milligrams per kilogram body weight over 15 minutes seems to put you in a pretty good spot. Most people don't think about kilograms or milliliters. So can I just Run that over, and it turns out it's about your body weight divided by 30 in ounces? Like, that's that's all you have.[2:31:32] Andrew Huberman: Body weight in pounds divided by 30.[2:31:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Exactly. Right? So you weigh 200 pounds divided by 30, and that's number of ounces. You don't wanna go every 15 or 20 minutes or so.[2:31:42] Andrew Huberman: Getting that amount every 15 to Yep. 20 minutes throughout the training. Yep. And now in the weight room, that's pretty easy to do because there are rest intervals, but you people will need to do this while running or cycling, and that can cause a little bit of gastric distress[2:31:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:31:57] Andrew Huberman: If you're not used to it. Is that right? You can you can learn to run with a with some water in your belly.[2:32:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: A 100%. The the gut is very trainable in a lot of directions, but in terms of fluid as well as carbohydrate, which is another thing that is gonna get people, but that's, yeah, very trainable. It'll be uncomfortable initially, but you'll you'll quickly get into it. The better solution for those folks, Just come in hydrated, and you might not even need any water. You could probably perform just fine.[2:32:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the ones that don't have as much of an opportunity, You really have to emphasize walking in. We have this problem with, like, professional golfers. They have plenty of time to drink water, but they're so focused on the shot, and there's a lot of variables coming up. Once they their shot and then moving on to the next one. They're thinking about I mean, they're going over a scorecard of a 185 yards away.[2:32:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Can I go a 184 and a half yards? Can I go a 186 yard? What's the slope of that? Where do I what's the wind up here? What's the wind up there?[2:32:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: What's it like, it is just they're just thinking, and they just forget. Wake up the next morning. They're in a good spot. We crush recovery. And now I was like, hey.[2:33:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you can remember to drink this, great. If not, we're still fine. If it's not a big a deal and you have time like in a a a lifter because I deal with that problem with fighters too. Like, I I I we can only drink so much in the middle of a fight. A couple sips over here, but we we can't go mix and 2 milliliter of it.[2:33:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: So can you get a couple sips in? Yeah. Oh, shit. Forgot. Like, it's not gonna happen.[2:33:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we have to take more of an episode before and after. Start your recovery process immediately, and then come in the next day. That's your window. And then whatever you can get in during the workout, that's fine too. If you're a higher salt sweater, do you want 500, 500?[2:33:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe go 750, 750. If you have a longer bout of exercise, especially if it's hot, or humid, then you might wanna consider some salt in the workout as well. And 300 milligrams during the workout, totally fine. It's enough. If it is a really long workout and it's really hot and you're gonna lose pounds during it, you need a specific strategy.[2:34:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're gonna lose less than a pound, You don't need to worry about it. You're gonna be it's not gonna be enough of a detriment for you to really care. So that's a kind of a a rough rule. Now if you're 200 plus pounds, number moves from 1 pound to £2. But, really, the number we're looking at is what 1% of your body weight.[2:34:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're losing more than 1% of your body weight, We need to start caring. If it's less than 1%, it's not gonna really pay that much of a difference.[2:34:26] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So for myself, because I don't get super technical, I don't wear any devices Besides a wristwatch, what wristwatch? Thanks. I'll yeah. Do they're very attached to this watch, or it's attached to me, I suppose.[2:34:40] Andrew Huberman: My body weight in pounds divided by 2, that's what I'm gonna try and get across the entire day, as a kind of baseline, and then my body weight[2:34:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, yeah.[2:34:48] Andrew Huberman: In pounds divided by 30. Yeah. During the workout Yeah. Every 15 or 20 minutes, that I'm going to try and consume that amount. And then I definitely do better when I increase the amount of salt I'm taking in anywhere from 500 to, a 500 milligrams to a gram of salt, several times a day, actually, but I'm not eating that often, which leads me to my other question, which is, I prefer to train fasted or semi fasted, meaning first thing in the morning Yeah.[2:35:15] Andrew Huberman: Or Within an hour or 2 of waking, where, obviously, I've been fasting while I'm asleep or having not eaten anything for 3 or 4 hours before, I just feel Lighter and, like, more, more energetic. Yep. If that works for me, is that okay, or, or should I try is it better to eat something before one Drains.[2:35:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Personal preference. Easy easy answer there. Great. It depends on, of course, how hard you trained, What the training was like, what sport you're involved with, how many total counts, etcetera. But in general, personal preference for the average person.[2:35:48] Andrew Huberman: That probably handles 90% of the Yeah. Questions about that. Cold. Cold showers, ice baths, and cold immersion up to the neck. I I always, preface this by saying there are not a a lot of studies.[2:36:01] Andrew Huberman: There are some, but not a lot of controlled studies looking at Cold showers because it's harder to control the variables of where people stand. So I would say if you have access to cold immersion of some sort, ice bath or cold immersion, great. But if you don't, cold showers will be the next best thing. The lore goes that if you do an ice bath or cold water immersion after strength or hypertrophy training, that you are short circuiting some of that. The lore also goes that cold showers might be okay, and my interpretation of Those data and that discussion is that all that is probably true, but I have a hard time imagining that the effects are so robust That it can completely prevent strength gains and hypertrophy such that my stance for myself is try and do the cold exposure training away from the strength and hypertrophy training, But if you can't do it any other time, right afterward, probably isn't gonna throw my whole system out of whack, and prevent the improvements.[2:37:04] Andrew Huberman: Am I deluding myself?[2:37:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Couple of caveats here. Number 1, I would say I have a personal vested interest in cold. I've been around this stuff for a long time. Being involved and and being an adviser for XPT and being in this space a long time, I'm a big believer in cold, Especially cold water. Deliberate cold exposure.[2:37:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: 100%. Right? So that being said, I do think getting into An ice bath immediately after a hypertrophy session is getting pretty close to you just shouldn't have done the session. It is detrimental.[2:37:38] Andrew Huberman: Good to know.[2:37:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: I wouldn't do it. I guess it's the most blunt way to put it. If you're like, hey. Like, I'm not super concerned with growing muscle, and I want these other things that come with cold water immersion. Fine.[2:37:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not a 0. It's not 0. It's not taking you backwards. How much does it cut you down? I don't know.[2:38:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: We don't know. Like, that'd be a difficult number to come up with. Is it 1% reduction? No. It's more than that.[2:38:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is it a 100? Not even close. I don't know where it lands though. It's enough though for me to go in general, best practices don't get in the ice after workout.[2:38:14] Andrew Huberman: How long should I wait?[2:38:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, in theory, the best answer we could give you would be 4 hours because of we talked about earlier today of of going okay. Immediately, you got the signaling cascade that takes seconds. You've got gene expression that's happening in this rough 4 hour window. After the genes have Gone off, and now you're just going to the protein synthesis process. The signal's already there, and it's gone back down to baseline.[2:38:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: So then reintroducing or introducing cold here is not gonna disrupt that signal. That's a very, nonscientifically founded because we don't know at this point at all. What is very clear though is if you get off your workout, go right into the ice, It's probably 10% attenuation of growth. I don't know. Maybe more.[2:38:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Depends on the person. Some people, if you look at the individual data, it's pretty bad. Enough to where it's like that that's a really big deal. The benefits of the ice, I don't think now outweigh the benefits of of the hypertrophy training.[2:39:05] Andrew Huberman: What about cold showers? I don't[2:39:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: think cold showers are gonna do much. You if you've been on both, you know that this is like, we're not playing the same game here.[2:39:13] Andrew Huberman: Right. An ice bath or a cold true cold water immersion up to the neck with limbs in, for 1 to 5 minutes is a completely different stimulus than in the cold shower.[2:39:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Especially also compared to a similar like cryo. Right? It is not even the same same thing here. So in general, I would say don't do this. Cold shower, I don't really care.[2:39:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Can you work it out so you don't do them at the same time? That would be my hope. Right? I would actually prefer you do the cold before. If you really had to do it, Certainly,[2:39:41] Andrew Huberman: it will wake you up. Get that adrenaline burst.[2:39:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. We've played with that actually years ago, doing that. There's actually some fun stuff you can do with the endurance piece with cold stuff, but it it's totally not feasible for most people because you get out of a you're getting water everywhere. They're gonna jump on your bike and just get shit, and it's just a giant mess. It's fun.[2:39:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: But Yeah. I would say walk away from it if you can. That's actually that's where I stand based on the data. Based on my intuition and experience, I don't I don't think it's a good thing to do. Now having said that, That's mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy.[2:40:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Strength is not as clear. There are some data to it actual blocks strength adaptations. But because of what we talked about earlier, the mechanisms and the drivers are different. And so I don't think it's as big a concern, forced rank development. Though, I would still generally say if you can get away with staying out of the ice immediately after the workout and you can at least wait a few hours, That's the better approach.[2:40:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Less concerned with strength, more concerned with hypertrophy in terms of interference effect. If you can do it on off days or before or any other time, That's that's the place to land.[2:40:43] Andrew Huberman: That's generally when I try to do it. Yeah. Just kinda throwing out an extreme case because I get asked that question a lot. What about the use of, ice bath or cold water immersion We're cold shower after endurance training.[2:40:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. So a couple of interesting things here. You mentioned we don't have a tremendous amount of data on cold water Immersion overall. So a lot of this is moving. There have been some papers to show that cold water immersion can actually enhance mitochondrial biogenesis.[2:41:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: And actually even for endurance stuff, it's been shown to to cause improvement endurance adaptations relative to not. Not enough for me to be truly confident in that statement yet. I would like to see that repeated. Not not that I have a problem with the paper, the methodology that they use in that particular study, but Is this is this a like, this is a weird thing. So I wanna see this repeated more often.[2:41:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: So I have less concern with doing it immediately post endurance, you could even argue that there may be some benefit. I don't think you need to go out of your way to try to make sure you get into ice immediately afterwards and thinking you're gonna get some massive adaptation. We use ice a decent amount when I can get athletes to do it, but this context is different. Number 1, when we're in camp and we've got a world title fight coming up Or something else. We've just pitched in it at a major baseball game.[2:41:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: I am not concerned about hypertrophy. I'm not even the strength development. I am now pushing towards recovery. There's a paradigm that I think is important with all these things to understand, which is are you pushing for optimization or adaptation? When you're pushing for adaptation, you don't wanna block the signal for adaptation.[2:42:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: This means less recovery, you're not going to feel as good, And you probably should be hedging towards stress. When you're pushing for optimization, it's the opposite. So if I'm in season and I had a pitcher just throw a 125 pitches, I'm not trying to cause adaptation. I'm trying to recover as quickly as possible because 4 days from now, we gotta do this again. And I gotta do this across a 162 games.[2:42:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: I've you're gonna play 6 day 5 days in a PGA golf tournament, and you're gonna have to do it again every week for a bunch of weeks in a row. I need recovery as fast as I possibly can. So if I'm blunting adaptation, fine. I'm not actually trying to do so. I'm trying to optimize.[2:42:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you spend all of your time in One of those 2 areas you're gonna have problems. So you need to be judicious about thinking, is this a point in my life or training cycle that I want to cause adaptations, Or am I trying to optimize? You spend too much time in in one of the other ones, again, you're gonna have problems. So that's in generally how I will treat The ice for for all those adaptations.[2:43:14] Andrew Huberman: What about heat? Yeah. When and I'll frame this question differently Because I I'm sure there are a number of ways in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things. I mean, heat can in excess can kill you. Yeah.[2:43:26] Andrew Huberman: It can shut down fertility. It can, in excess, right, it can do all sorts of things, but it can also increase growth hormone, increase Basal dilation improve one's ability to sweat, which can be very beneficial in a number of context. Yeah. For the typical for 75% of people, 75% of the time, When do you think heat is most useful? And here, I'm referring to dry sauna or wet sauna.[2:43:50] Andrew Huberman: I'm not specifically talking about infrared sauna because the data there are a little unclear to me, and I I don't even know that my sense with infrared saunas is they don't go hot enough for my particular taste.[2:44:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: You and I have a similar taste there. Okay. Yeah. Not crushing 200 past, I'm I'm not interested.[2:44:04] Andrew Huberman: Right. And and my sense about infrared sauna is that maybe I haven't seen the data. Is that, but that a lot of people like it because they like the way they look in the Infrared sauna, it feels cool. It feels like you're doing something unusual. Now infrared lights are beneficial for other reasons, actually, for mitochondrial health and the retinas.[2:44:21] Andrew Huberman: They're good they're good data. But Infrared sauna to me that never goes hot enough. So I'm talking about 200 or hotter, maybe a 18220. Obviously, do what's safe, folks, and Heed all the warnings about pregnant people not going in saunas, etcetera.[2:44:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: I assume you're lumping in hot water immersion this week.[2:44:36] Andrew Huberman: Hot water immersion. Yeah. So hot baths, hot sauna. When would you like when do you think most people could leverage sauna or hot baths to benefit their training and Fitness and and health.[2:44:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Okay. I have a handful of things to say about this topic. One of them is you never have a hard time convincing people to get hot. Everyone feels good.[2:44:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, yeah. Get a hot bath. Like, can you take more hot showers? Sure. Like, no problem there.[2:44:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? There are a handful of studies that have looked at, this immediately post, and it seems to even augment hypertrophy.[2:45:08] Andrew Huberman: So after hypertrophy training, getting in the sauna for 20 minutes?[2:45:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Whatever. Whatever it needs to be. We don't have a good titration. What's the number minutes wise?[2:45:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: We don't have a temperature titration.[2:45:18] Andrew Huberman: Hot shower would would be a second that would be a weak second best.[2:45:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: I would say it's a very weak.[2:45:24] Andrew Huberman: Let's take a hot bath.[2:45:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: I think a hot bath is probably a lot closer to what you're looking for. It actually kinda goes back to our initial conversations. Theoretically, you're just going to aid in blood flow. So you're gonna put more nutrients in, more waste product out, metabolic stress. All that stuff is going through.[2:45:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: So but that's the thought anyways. We we far from no sense. Plausible. Right? Absolutely plausible.[2:45:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Something people will do. Feels good. I let's say with cold and hot, I wanna caution you Against a couple of things. This is true across all physiology, but you need to be really careful about moving percentages from Molecular to outcome. Very careful.[2:46:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So for example, it's easy to see a paper, that says, okay. We put in a hot bath or something, and we saw growth hormone increase 300%. That is not going to result in 300% increase in muscle size. Right? In fact, 300% might result in absolutely no change in a physical size.[2:46:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So the and the reason I'm saying this is because there's a lot of people in this space that will misapply the mechanisms, And they'll they'll grossly overestimate what these things can do and what they do do because they'll find something like that. Know this, you've done enough cellular work to in in the lab, if I see mTOR doubled, I think, shit. It didn't work. Need to see a 10 x increase before I know it's even physiologically relevant.[2:46:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So reading that paper, reading someone's social media post, you're like, wow. It increased mTOR, 38%. I'm like, well, it didn't work. And you're like, well, that's huge. I'm like, that's not 38% increase in muscle size.[2:46:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's a very important point I wanna make because I'm gonna Talk about the benefits here in a second, but, I I do want I don't want people to be fooled into thinking that this is some crazy miracle. The same thing with the sauna. In terms of general health health outcomes, it is a clearly a beneficial thing. This is a really good idea to get hot a lot. It is not a substitute for exercise though.[2:47:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a very important distinction. If the an if the options are nothing or sauna, get in the sauna. Really, really good idea. If the the exchanges though, I don't need to work out because I did the sauna, bad. You you this is not a winning solution.[2:47:36] Andrew Huberman: You and I don't know some maniacs that actually work out in the sauna.[2:47:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, we do. Yeah. It's kind of not fun.[2:47:41] Andrew Huberman: I don't necessarily recommend that. That actually could would probably kill a large number of people, But it can be worked it can be worked up to. Yeah. It certainly.[2:47:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So it I I want I like, every time I talk about that, I I flag that because It's just too easy to hear that and go, oh, well, I think doctor Huberman said, if I just get in the sauna, I don't have to work out. Like, no. No. Those words have never come out.[2:48:02] Andrew Huberman: Say that. I'm definitely not working out in the sauna. If I'm in the sauna, I'm either sitting or I'm lying down, and I'm trying to make it through. I tend to do 3 20 minute bouts Yeah. Across the entire week.[2:48:12] Andrew Huberman: So I aim for 60 minutes per week[2:48:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:48:14] Andrew Huberman: Of heat exposure I would be fine. Not a ton.[2:48:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: If I said I've never worked out in the sauna?[2:48:18] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so you're one of those. I love it. Yeah. People will do air squats. They'll bring the Airdyne bike in there.[2:48:22] Andrew Huberman: I'm I look at the sauna as kind of a time to get lazy and sweat.[2:48:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally fine. Going back to your question. So potential to aid, plausible aid, we need to see more research on that to really get a to put this in practice. I think if you try it, very little harm. I I I struggle to see a downside if you make sure your hydration's on point.[2:48:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Because now you gotta factor in the fact you just kicked out 2 or 3 pounds. If you're you at At 200 plus pounds, I assume or roughly. If you're in the sauna for 20 minutes, I would imagine you could do 2, £3.[2:48:51] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Usually, I'm I'm hover somewhere around, like, 225. And I drink, I drink a 32 ounce[2:48:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[2:48:59] Andrew Huberman: Beverage it's water with a electrolyte solution that's pretty high salt Afterwards and sometimes during[2:49:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:49:04] Andrew Huberman: And sometimes after that, if I do it late in the evening, I'll go to sleep, and I'll wake up in the middle of the night Yeah. Just Feeling so parched. It's amazing how much water one loses in the sauna.[2:49:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, a normal sweat rate for someone 2/25, especially in 20 minutes on a sauna, I would absolutely you to do £3 easy without, like, really even more.[2:49:23] Andrew Huberman: Probably even more water.[2:49:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. You're probably half the water that you need to get.[2:49:26] Andrew Huberman: And you mentioned the The possible benefits of doing it after strength hypertrophy training, which are makes sense for plausible mechanistic reasons on not no official data there yet. What about after endurance training? Assuming somebody hydrates well enough and they're not overheated from their endurance work Yep. Could also be a benefit.[2:49:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:49:45] Andrew Huberman: Wow. So more and more what I'm thinking the framework here is, in an ideal world, one would train and then do sauna Yep. Or heat exposure of some kind. Endurance training or strength hypertrophy training and then do sauna and then do cold exposure on off days or at least 4 hours away from the From any kind of training, or if you had to do it close to training, do it before training.[2:50:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I love the cold in the morning. We we've actually run this experiment on professional athletes, so we do enough tracking with things like HRV, Which is a global metric of, like, overall fatigue. Okay? And you've you probably talked about that before, but Problems with it, but roughly idea, but, obviously, I'd love to take.[2:50:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: HRV in general, higher the score, the better. Right? So a low HRV is Fatigue. Right? Well, if you wake up and take your HRV in the morning and then you get into ice, what's gonna happen is you're gonna see that number plummet.[2:50:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Second you get out, that's gonna fall off the Earth, which means roughly you've moved into a sympathetic Place. Surprising. You get in 30 degree water. You're gonna go very sympathetic very quickly. However, if you continue to watch for HRV for 30, 60, 90, and up to 2 to 3 hours post, you will generally see a an improved HRV score relative to where you started.[2:50:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So It's it's back to this hormetic stressor. Right? A really cold, shocking exposure will be a net result of you being more relaxed throughout the day in general, And we've seen that now, like, very consistently across years with with athletes. So so I think it's a great way to start your day. You won't need nearly as much coffee After spending 3 minutes in 30 degree water.[2:51:22] Andrew Huberman: 30 degrees is pretty pretty darn cold. I was in the ocean this morning for about 3 minutes, It felt I didn't bring a thermometer, but it felt like somewhere in the low fifties.[2:51:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: But 15 moving is really cold. Yeah. Water's moving. Yeah. Right?[2:51:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's really cool.[2:51:36] Andrew Huberman: That's right. The thermal layer that that, surrounds you when you sit still in, cold water immersion, I'm encouraging people now if they really I was the joke that, you know, people like to look real stoic and tough when they're in there, like, they're just grinding through with no pain at all, but the the stillness is actually, Reducing the Yeah. The stimulus. If they sift around a little bit, you break up that thermal layer. That's where the real action is.[2:51:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: We we've joked about this for years. Like, Do 50 degrees with a Whirlpool Jet on. Now I'm impressed. Because that that is hard. You sit in 35 degree for 3 minutes.[2:52:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, it's But with x p t, I've seen I can't even tell you how many hundreds of people from all walks of life on all age that we've been able to get In 30 some degree water for 3 minutes. Fifty degrees with a Whirlpool going, that number gets very small. Yeah.[2:52:20] Andrew Huberman: And if you don't have access to Whirlpool, this is this should be reassuring to you. You can some people say, oh, you know, I don't have access to ice, and ice can actually get pretty expensive if you're doing a $50 ice bath every day. So you can fill your bathtub with, cool to cold water, get in, but just make sure that you keep sifting your limbs, and it it's chilly.[2:52:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:52:37] Andrew Huberman: And this the studies on The very well now well established increases in dopamine and epinephrine that occur in cold water exposure were actually done at an hour and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah. And so it you don't necessarily need it ice cold or an ice bath, but immersion is really better than the cold shower. The cold shower is kind of a It's the, it's it's kind of the espresso shot[2:52:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Version. You know? Yep. No.[2:53:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's, it's sort of funny because if you look at most of those initial studies and you think, man, How did they get people to sign up to spend 45 minutes in 55 degree water? 55 degrees is cold even if it's not moving, and then they're gonna not spend 5 minutes in it. They're gonna go an hour. If you've ever done ice baths at that temperature, you know, like, alright. After a few minutes, it's not that bad, but man, that's a protocol.[2:53:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It's it just it's kind of an end a cold endurance protocol. Because it's one thing to get in for 1 minute to 3 minutes and you know you're getting out. You could sing a song. You could do anything to distract yourself, but 45 minutes to an hour is is intense.[2:53:33] Andrew Huberman: Maybe they I don't know. I don't think they paid the subjects, but, anyway, that that that study was done in Europe. I forget where it was done, but, anyway, they were they were hardy subjects. I wanna talk a bit about overtraining and gauging recovery.[2:53:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[2:53:49] Andrew Huberman: So there are couple methods that, I've heard about and that I use, based on some data that I've seen, but mainly discussions with really informed people like yourself, Mackenzie, Kelly Starrett, and others. The 2 that I'm aware of for gauging recovery of the nervous system and kind of systemic recovery are, grip strength, especially, grip strength on waking in the morning Yeah. And, the so called carbon dioxide tolerance Test. The ability to do a long controlled exhale after a few, rhythmic deep breaths, just which I'm assuming taps into both, One's ability to mechanically control the diaphragm, but also how well one is regulating carbon dioxide. First question is, Is this stuff, fiction, fact, or, a combination of kind of anecdata, as I call it?[2:54:43] Andrew Huberman: Are there any peer reviewed published data? Is your lab working on these things, and, am I deluding myself using these tools, or or are they useful?[2:54:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not fiction at all. There are, with with, like, c o two tolerance, there's less published data. We've run, a study in our lab Looking at the associations between the c o two tolerance and what we call it, trait and state anxiety. And those are in the publication process is what I'll say. Great.[2:55:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you can't really talk about that stuff as you know and until it's out. But in general, I'd say, like, there's a reason I'm still doing it. Mhmm. I'll just Great. I'll just leave it at that.[2:55:17] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, assuming it's not a clinical trial, I mean, I think sharing, preliminary findings is fine as long as we highlight them as preliminary. Yeah. I'm not a reviewer, I look forward to reading the paper.[2:55:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. But, as you know, scientific, ethically like, you need to be careful about saying telling people results before you've gone through that process. Right.[2:55:32] Andrew Huberman: Which is why I'm flagging this Yeah. These results are not yet peer passed through the peer review process, so you're hearing about it prior to peer review.[2:55:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Yep. Having said that, There's enough in that field. I'm not the 1st one into that field. And so it it I'm very confident that that's that's a real thing.[2:55:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: In terms of actual tracking recovery, The big picture is this. When we run through a full analysis, when we when we have an athlete go through our bio a biomolecular athlete program, We're gonna run and we're look at 3 major categories. K? Category 1 are what we call visible stressors, and then we have hidden stressors, and then we have recovery capacity. Anytime the total stress load outpaces recovery capacity, you're either going backwards in your physical ability Or you're reducing adaptability.[2:56:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you have levers to pull here. You can reduce stress intake, or you can increase recovery capacity. Right? What we want in an ideal situation is to be able to implement the most stress possible because that's the driver of adaptation. Recover from that.[2:56:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now we get the most adaptation, and adaptation being simply a change. Whatever change you want it to be. That's that's our gold standard. Right? It's pie in the eye.[2:56:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some people have endogenous differences. They just Recover better. They don't. There are genetic factors. But let's talk about the ones that are manipulatable.[2:56:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: If we go to the stress side of it, You want the throttle to be pushed as far down on the ones you want stress from and as far off of the ones you don't want stress so that the adaptation comes in the exact area You want and you're not burning gas in something you don't care about because you're just you're you're taking that total stress bucket too high. Recovery capacity over there. Here's how you can do that. You can run some analytics and measure what we do with everyone to these these very comprehensive breakdowns to figure out what's that physiology look like hidden and visible, then what's the recovery capacity? Once we have that blueprint, we can now figure out what are the 2 or 3 things we need to track that are these indicators of what we call performance anchors.[2:57:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: So an anchor is something that kind of drags behind you or below you that slows you down. The analogy being let's say we're going down one of these amazing canyon roads, and I won't say which canyon we're in so you can stay hidden here. And your car is going down at a certain velocity and you wanna go faster. Most people's first impulse is to hit the gas, the accelerator. We wanna push.[2:57:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, that's fine. But if your foot is on the brake and you push the accelerator, you might go a little bit faster. But number 1, you're wasting a lot of literal gas To go a little bit faster. And 2, you're burning your engine. You might you're gonna blow.[2:58:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: The easier solution is just take your foot off the brake. You're going to go faster by just stopping yourself. Then if that's not fast enough, we can hit the accelerator. Everyone wants to just push down. Right?[2:58:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: More stimulus, more optimization. Bing, bing, bing, bing here. Our first analytics are where are these performance anchors? What's dragging you back? What's through what's putting down the brake?[2:58:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: I wanna move those 2 or 3 things out of the way, and now let's see how far you get. Oh, look at that. Your recovery capacity has gone way up. Your adapt your adaptations are happening faster now, or we can do more work because you're recovering quicker. So we're trying to figure out in those buckets, and we have a whole host of things that we measure, biomarkers and surveys and and everything else that we go through To find out what's there.[2:58:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So after we've done that, now we're just gonna track a few of these recovery markers along the way to figure out what's globally happening. So that could mean grip strength. I have some folks who we're gonna test grip strength daily. Others, we're gonna look at HRV or combinations. We may look at Performance metrics like a a force plate.[2:59:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're gonna do a vertical jump every single day, and we're gonna see where that's at. We've used the tap test before, which is how many times you can tap fingers fast as possible. It's a rough indicator of central nervous system.[2:59:18] Andrew Huberman: In in, say, 1 minute in[2:59:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: a row? Exactly. And this is apps you can do on this. Like, you his finger as fast as you can. It's gonna say, hey.[2:59:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: You did 60 taps today, and your your average is 75.[2:59:26] Andrew Huberman: I like that because it taps into, no pun intended, into upper motor neuron capacity. Because a lot of things like like, grip strength, obviously, I have to send the deliberate signal to my hand to grip, but at some point, the lower motor neurons are be taking over the majority of the work. Like, the signal is probably 1 and done, whereas the, tapping is going to be, repetitive, Yeah. Sending of signals from upper motor neurons.[2:59:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. So some of the athletes I work with, we track blood every day. We track urine every day. We track, Ideally, a combination of subjective and objective measures. Everything from how did you feel last night to environmental sensors of their bedroom.[3:00:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Full PSGs going on running, like, actual sleep diagnostics. Not or ring nothing against or but, like, full analytics. And some of them, it's as simple as did you feel today, and what was your vertical jump? Right. So we're going to put people in a position to succeed.[3:00:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna figure out what's the lever that they need to pull as well as what's their aptitude, What sport are they in? What can we realistically get away with? And some of them will take machines with them, and we'll do blood every day, and urine, and and all kinds of stuff. And some of them, it's a it's a lot lower.[3:00:31] Andrew Huberman: For myself, I I'm not a as I mentioned before, I'm not a big fan of devices. I'm trying to, like, wear the wrist wristwatch. I tend to go off feel, which It's not, it's not the ideal objective way to gauge things, but, part of my reasoning for this is my Colleague from the psychology department, doctor Aliyah Crum, has done some studies where they've, given peep deliberately given people false feedback about their sleep. So told people, you didn't sleep very well, or they've told people, you slept really well, and performance can be driven in the Expected direction based on feedback independent of how well people slept or didn't sleep. Now that doesn't mean you can take someone that only slept 2 hours or Was out every 2, 30 seconds because of apnea and tell them they slept great, and they're gonna perform great cognitive tasks.[3:01:15] Andrew Huberman: But you can't take someone who slept very well, Tell them that the recovery quotient wasn't very good, and their their output is going to be worse. And that's my concern about a lot of devices out there, not to name specific devices, but It's still unclear to the general public what the specific algorithms are to generate these recovery scores. Right? And so many of the things that reportedly, track sleep aren't tracking sleep. They're tracking heart rate and breathing, which are correlates of sleep depth, but that's different.[3:01:44] Andrew Huberman: And, again, I'm not knocking those. I I think the sleep trackers, if nothing else, have provided a forum whereby people are very conscious of getting good sleep. It's sort of like Knowing the total caloric intake of your food, people go, wow. I'm actually eating a lot more than I thought Calibration. Or less in some cases, but often the case is that it's more.[3:02:02] Andrew Huberman: So I think for the typical person, I'm wondering whether or not like myself, because I'm not a a a competitive athlete or certainly not a professional athlete, Competitive with myself, I suppose, but no one else. Morning pulse rate, I tend to take when I on waking. If I wake out of a really stressful dream, I might relax a little bit and then just take my pulse rate, kinda get a range, and see if it's spiking for whatever reason. I don't tend to measure grip strength, although I've heard you can just use a classic, scale. Yeah.[3:02:30] Andrew Huberman: Old fashioned scale with the Sure. Neo now old fashioned, or some other more technical device is probably, good if there's a low cost one.[3:02:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. They're all low.[3:02:38] Andrew Huberman: And then the carbon dioxide tolerance test. So we haven't really talked about that in in specific ways. My understanding of it is it's, 4 deep, slow breaths In through the nose, out through the nose, and then a big inhale as max exhale, and then time duration of exhale through the nose, and then stopping the stopwatch at the point where lungs are empty, not necessarily as long as one could hold their breath. Did I get that right?[3:03:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Pretty much.[3:03:01] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And I guess we should credit you and Brian McKenzie.[3:03:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Those guys.[3:03:06] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. For sure. And, and the folks, under, Brian's umbrella for, Really establishing this as a really good metric. When and how can I use the carbon dioxide tolerance test To gauge recovery, upon waking, post training session Yeah? Would that be a good time?[3:03:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Number 1 answer is whatever you do, do be consistent. So do it under the like any good science experiment, do it under the exact same conditions as you can. That generally means Wake up. Get under control. Get stabilized.[3:03:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Take your metric.[3:03:49] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[3:03:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Gonna be pretty good. Got it.[3:03:53] Andrew Huberman: Sodium bicarb, baking soda. Rumor has it and data has it that it can actually be a pretty effective training tool.[3:04:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Very effective.[3:04:03] Andrew Huberman: Could you explain a little bit of about how it works and how one might explore using sodium bicarb to enhance training output in a couple of different context?[3:04:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. There's a handful of these ubiquitously effective supplements for performance. Sodium bicarbonate is one of them. It's a very Ingenious idea? Because it's so simple.[3:04:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Effectively, muscle contraction happens Because enzymatic function occurs within a fairly specific pH range. Right? So if it gets extremely acidic, it doesn't like it. And so whether you're running through aerobic glycolysis Or anaerobic or anything else, all these things require even ATP hydrolysis requires ATPase. An enzyme has the enzymes don't function well outside of this Fairly special range.[3:04:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what happens is generally fatigue this the sensations of fatigue are actually caused by some signal that, hey. We're starting to run at a pH or we're getting in the wrong range. You're not out of gas usually. You're not Too low on oxygen. You're not running low on muscle glycogen yet.[3:05:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're typically gonna see sign or feel signals of fatigue way prior to that, Mostly being pH issues. That being said, what if we could regulate pH better? Enter bicarbonate. Right? So, without going too far into metabolism, Effectively, what happens is this.[3:05:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: You take an inhale and you're mostly breathing in oxygen, o two. When you exhale, you're breathing out c o two. The difference is you've gained a carbon somehow. Well, all of your carbohydrates in your body come in the form of long Carbon chains. In fact, that's what a carbohydrate means.[3:05:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is a 1 carbon molecule that has 1 water molecule attached to it. It's carbon that has been hydrated. In the case of, like, glucose, blood sugar, It's a 6 carbon molecule. Right? In terms of fat, which are the only 2 places you're gonna get most of your cellular energy, carbohydrates into fat, that is also a big long block carbons.[3:05:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So whether you're getting your energy from fat or carbohydrate, you're going to split Those atoms. So in other words, you've got 6 carbons attached to each other. And in this part of chemistry, it's exergonic. So when you break that carbon bond, so break one of those Carbons off from the other, that's going to release energy. Just like if you had a pencil in here and I snapped it, and go bang and pop.[3:06:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: I broke the bonds that were connecting that graphite the next piece of graphite, and that released energy because I put energy in the system, etcetera. Okay. As a result though, we've now had, you know, say 5 or 6 carbons chained together. We broke 1 off the end, which is not how it works, but Making the point. And now you have 1 free floating carbon.[3:06:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: You use that energy release to then go make ATP, to then go make your muscles contract. But now you've got carbon floating around. You can associate free floating carbon with being at a higher acidic level. It's not gonna happen. The only way that you're gonna go through this process is if your body says, do we have an oxygen molecule available that we can bind this to immediately?[3:07:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yes. We do. That carbon attaches to that oxygen molecule. You can't just put c o two in the blood because of what we just talked about. So you're gonna bind it through this bicarbonate process.[3:07:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Gonna go through your blood. It's gonna go into the lungs. It's gonna go back into its carbon dioxide molecule. It's gonna trans go through the alveoli into the lungs, and you're gonna exhale. So you went from carbon is bicarbonate system back into carbon exhale.[3:07:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So inhaled o two plants go the opposite by the way. So they're gonna breathe in the c o two. They're gonna Cleave off that carbon, stack those carbons together, and that's how they get larger. In your in your blood, those 6 carbon chains are called glucose. If we store that in your muscle, we call it glycogen.[3:07:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we take a bunch of glucose and stack it together in a plant. We call that starch. That's effectively what it is. Right? So you took a bunch of carbon from the atmosphere, stuck it all together, and that's a starch.[3:07:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you wanna do it in the form of fruit, We take that starch, like, from the ground. You put it up through, the tree. Go all the way up to the top, put it into the flower, break it up into these big huge chunks of starch into little forms called fructose or glucose. That's why fruit has fructose in it, and that's why tubers and stuff have starch in them. Basically, starch in an animal is is glycogenon us.[3:08:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. All that to say, if that's happening and we know that a byproduct specifically of anaerobic glycolysis, meaning The breakdown of carbohydrates for fuel, typically in a very fast pace with low oxygen availability. The downside of that equation is acid production. We know that that's a problem because I I started the conversation off there intentionally. So what if we could reduce the acid buildup?[3:08:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you know how pH kinda works. I went and kinda double negatives there. Right? You don't want too much acid buildup. Then could we prolong and sustain energy, in a more effective pace, especially in this anaerobic, interval kind of environment?[3:08:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: And, again, that's important because in those things, Failure is not a result of running out of fuel or oxygen. It's a result of fatigue building up way too quickly.[3:08:59] Andrew Huberman: Is that also true for resistance training? There's maybe more of the the creatine phosphate system.[3:09:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: That can be an issue. It could simply be an issue of force production. You just don't have enough force. At least you're not out of energy. You just can't muster enough, force.[3:09:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: You do enough reps, then it's gonna be an issue there. Creatine phosphate would be the big winner. Mhmm. Depending. So to come back a little bit to the beginning, then I'll I'm circling this all together intentionally.[3:09:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Well, the way that we produce energy is gonna be in 2 primary categories. Anaerobic, Anaerobic. Aerobic, meaning with oxygen, anaerobic, meaning without. In terms of muscle contraction, you're pretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat.[3:09:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now fat is going to be exclusively aerobic. Meaning, I'm gonna use fat from the entire body roughly equally. So you're doing a sprint up a hill, And your hamstrings or your glutes or your quads are on fire. You can't you're not just going to use the fat that's directly in those hamstrings. You're gonna lose it from the entire body.[3:10:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: It has to go through lipolysis, so it's in the stored form in adipose tissue. It's gotta get broken down, put into blood. Blood's gonna have to go through your body, get taken up in a muscle, up through muscle into the mitochondria. Then we're gonna have to go through this process called beta oxidation. So remember, Carbohydrates and glucose especially is a 6 carbon molecule.[3:10:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fat, if it's in the form of a triglyceride, it is a 3 carbon glycerol backbone and 3, know, try 1, 2, 3, fatty acids. Three carbon backbone and those fatty acids are just big long chains of carbon. That's all it is. Right? So we're gonna break that thing down, put it in the blood, move it up, move it into our mitochondria.[3:10:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can't walk those things across the mitochondria wall. They're too big. So what you have to do is cleave them off into little chunks, and it turns out we break them off into 2 carbon chunks. We call it beta as in 2. Move those into mitochondria.[3:10:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: That can go through this little thing called Krebs cycle or triaxialic acid cycle, and you kick out a bunch of energy out of that. You had 2 carbons. So as a result of that process, you're gonna generate 2 carbon dioxide. But remember, you can only go through that process oxygen is available because you have to be able to place those carbons onto something or acid gets up way too high too fast. This is one of the reasons why fat is a nice fuel source, but it's very slow.[3:11:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's takes physical time to move from the back of your shoulder into your blood, Down your hamstring, uptake, uptake, uptake. In addition, it's required oxygen availability. If you need energy Faster. You simply don't have the time to bring in the oxygen, transport it through, go through capillaries, exchange through tissue, etcetera. Carbohydrate, on the other hand, is gonna be stored locally in the exercising muscle cell and specifically in the cytoplasm.[3:11:44] Andrew Huberman: As glycogen?[3:11:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: As glu yeah. As glycogen in the store in there. So what's gonna happen initially, your initial demands for extra or for fuel are gonna come from the glycogen stored within the muscle fiber itself. It's just gonna break right there, you're gonna be off the races. So you have the 6 carbon molecules.[3:11:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna break it into 2 separate 3 carbon molecules. Okay. Boom. That breaking provides you a tiny bit of energy. Very small, but some.[3:12:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you're gonna take those 2, 3 carbon molecules, and you wanna be able to oxidize them because that's your only next But in order to do that, you gotta go those into mitochondria. So you gotta break one of those molecules off, so then you'll be back to your 2 carbon molecule just like you did with fat. That's gonna go into mitochondria, and then it's gonna go to the exact same Krebs cycle, 2 carbons, etcetera. But hold on. If you don't have sufficient oxygen or sufficient mitochondrial availability and you're stuck at that 2, 3 carbon place, what the do you do?[3:12:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have problems. Right? Now we have to say, okay. Wait a minute. We have 2 a 3 carbon molecule, And we have a bunch of this acid buildup.[3:12:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now acid functionally is is hydrogen. That that's what pH potential hydrogen is what pH stands for. Right? So if hydrogen is building up as a byproduct of muscular contraction, and then you're having this 3 carbon molecule, what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogens. And those 3 carbon molecules, by the way, are called pyruvate pyruvic acid.[3:13:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? If you take a pyruvic acid and you grab hydrogen, put it on top of it, we now have a different name for it. It's called Hydrogen peroxide. Lactate. Bingo.[3:13:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? That's what lactate or lactic acid is. Right? So we've now built that up. So Number 1 reason why lactate is not causing you fatigue, it's actually preventing it, and then it does a bunch of other really cool stuff.[3:13:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: But the point is that system can only last so so long. That gets overwhelmed very quickly. What are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen? Well, if you started off in a normal pH range, You you don't have very far to go before you've now gone into that level of too much acidity. If you start off in a more basic and and basic, I don't mean simple.[3:13:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I mean, Chemistry. Right? And more alkaline, then that same amount of increase in pH is no longer now just puts you back in your physiological range. This is something you can take right now before your your workout. You're going to delay what we call delay the progression of fatigue.[3:14:11] Andrew Huberman: And how how would People start to approach this practice. I my understanding is you can do this with common, you know, store bought baking soda.[3:14:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: No question.[3:14:21] Andrew Huberman: There's always a concern about gastric distress[3:14:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, boy.[3:14:24] Andrew Huberman: That it's a very effective laxative, sometimes an unwanted laxative effect. But how would one approach this before? Let's say I'm I'm going to I'm doing the mile repeats. Yep. Exercise, mile repeats protocol that we talked about earlier.[3:14:42] Andrew Huberman: I'm doing that for a few months, and now I wanna try the sodium bicarb Yep. I'm well hydrated. Hopefully, I'm well rested. I'm ready to go. When am I gonna drink this, sodium bicarb solution?[3:14:54] Andrew Huberman: What how would I make the solution? Let's say I'm I take 10 ounces of water. Yeah. How much bicarb do I wanna sodium bicarb should I put in there? Can we come up with a is it half a teaspoon?[3:15:04] Andrew Huberman: Is it a teaspoon?[3:15:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fine. Half honestly, half is fine. Half[3:15:16] Andrew Huberman: a teaspoon[3:15:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally fine.[3:15:17] Andrew Huberman: Dissolve that, slug that down.[3:15:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I[3:15:20] Andrew Huberman: read a study recently that showed that people will hit their, the the peak benefits of this at different times, but it's somewhere, if I if memory serves me correctly, somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes later. So I might wanna drink it on the way to the track? It can.[3:15:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: It can be as low as 20.[3:15:34] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So maybe, as I get to the tracks and someone to do some warm up with some walk and jogging.[3:15:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I say 45 minutes. Okay. That's just a very rough standard. But, yeah, you're right. It is it is individualized, and you probably wanna play with that a little bit.[3:15:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: If not, just somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to an hour.[3:15:49] Andrew Huberman: Okay. And then, the perceived and real fatigue if done correctly, the perceived and real fatigue ought to be reduced. Yes. I can do more work without feeling exhausted. Will I feel less of a lactate burn?[3:16:04] Andrew Huberman: Yep. Done in air quotes for those listening. I realize that's a very crude way to describe a complex physiological process. Yep. Fantastic.[3:16:12] Andrew Huberman: Can sodium bicarb be used repeatedly for longer duration training?[3:16:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[3:16:18] Andrew Huberman: And if I were gonna use it with, weight training for whatever reason, maybe I'm doing circuit type training or I'm doing the superset type Strength training that you talked about before, push, pull, push, pull, where it's a little bit more cardiovascularly demanding. Yep. Then maybe I'd sip that the workout, make sure there's a bathroom nearby, it sounds like. Because I do I am aware that, many people get pretty serious gastric distress.[3:16:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Happen very quickly.[3:16:40] Andrew Huberman: Okay. Great. Well, it sounds like an amazing training tool. I really appreciate you sharing because I think it's it's one that doesn't get a lot of airtime these days because it's been around, but, sounds like it has some pretty impressive effects.[3:16:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: You know what's sort of funny about that is I mean, I get it. Pop culture is what it is, but Still to this day, if you wanna talk about sort of your most effective general health slash performance supplementation, it's the same 3 to 4 to 5. And I've written it it's because they work really well.[3:17:07] Andrew Huberman: Without going into the chemistry of each one and the practice of each one, because I definitely wanna get you back to talk about Nutrition and supplementation Oh, yeah. At some point, but I think we need a full couple of hours to get that right Yep. At least. If you as a teaser, would you mind just listing off the other, supplements that you have found are very effective for for many people? So sodium bicarb or baking soda is 1.[3:17:32] Andrew Huberman: What are some of the other ones? Yep.[3:17:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we'll go kind of reverse order. Beta alanine is another very classically effective one. Similar idea, assuming bicarbonate. So it's it's it's going to beta alanine is gonna come in. It's gonna be converted and stored as it's called carnosine in the muscle.[3:17:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: And carnosine is an intracellular buffer. So in other words, it's just going to delay the buildup of acid. So so fatigue blocker, if you will. So very effective, very cheap, very safe, well studied. The top one though of all of them by far that has an incredibly strong safety profile, it has It is a cheap.[3:18:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is a simple form to get, has a important magnitude of effect, and is, Effective across multiple domains of physical health and performance, and it is because of that, it is my crown jewel. It is, In my opinion, without question, the Michael Jordan of all supplementation, and that's creatine monohydrate. It affects so many things. We typically think about it as it's muscle stuff. Right?[3:18:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: You've you've talked kind of you quickly were talking about the creatine phosphate system. But we have to realize, the mass majority of research on creatine phosphate is not in sport performance and has not been for 20 years. It's in clinical. And it has everything from effects, on neurological system to there have been associations to mental Health and depression. And to be very clear, I am certainly not saying you could take creatine and cure anything.[3:18:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I'm not saying it's gonna stop you from depression or anything, but I'm saying there's there's a lot of research in these areas, and there's a reason people are doing it.[3:19:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I completely agree. And if you're willing, I'd love to have you back us to do a discussion on creatine and the brain or creatine and the nervous system Yeah. That would be a lot of fun, and maybe we can do a a kind of a journal club in advance of that. For those that don't know, journal club is where, scientists, read a bunch of papers and then argue about them, discuss them, and try and extract the the kind of, agreed upon center of mass, if you will.[3:19:26] Andrew Huberman: I I think, I've long been taking 5 grams of creatine monohydrate per day for mainly for the cognitive effects.[3:19:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[3:19:33] Andrew Huberman: It, I sense an effect. That's all, obviously, anecdotal, but there I think there are a lot of data out there as as you There's enough.[3:19:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're not you're not crazy. There's enough there, and in fact, there's enough mechanism now, to understand the metabolic needs. People think the med I'm a muscle guy. Right? So I'm gonna think about the metabolism needed to fuel muscle.[3:19:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: But we forget cells, immune cells, red blood cells, nerve cells, Astrocytes, brain, all this stuff requires energy, and it's all going through metabolism.[3:20:02] Andrew Huberman: Super interesting. We we will do the deep dive on that Soon, I have a final question for you. You're involved in a really interesting, I think, really cutting edge project that I first learned about from you. I don't know of anyone else doing anything, as forward thinking and, frankly, as Relevant to the general population because of, my interest in people getting better sleep and learning how to do that, avoiding stress and learning how to do that. Tell us a little bit about what I believe is called absolute rest.[3:20:35] Andrew Huberman: Right.[3:20:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is something that we've been playing with behind the scenes, for a long time. This is typically how high performance stuff works. Right? People want exclusivity, and and so this has been built. Effectively, what happened is A friend of mine, Cody Burkhardt I don't know if you know Cody, but if[3:20:51] Andrew Huberman: down in Texas. Yeah. Yeah. NASA. NASA guy.[3:20:54] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I do know Cody.[3:20:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Wonderful. Just down the road thinker. Everyone's interested in sleep. Right? And for forever, I would We're using with athletes, but everything available tells you how you're sleeping.[3:21:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Nothing can tell you why you're sleeping that way. And so we we got together, in Boulder, and then I met some of his former colleagues, computer science folks, Harvard MD, and and some really impressive tech folks. And we were just thinking about an idea, and we came up with we start to realize the problems. Right? We use first principle thinking.[3:21:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's one of my favorite approaches. If you've not familiar with that, go go Google that. Like, that's just a recipe to solve problems, this first principle thinking. And we just started to think about, like, man, all the sleep tech is is there. It's real.[3:21:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't need to convince people that they need sleep. Everyone's done that. You need high quality sleep, but how can I provide solutions? And with the people I work with, I can't just tell them your testosterone's down your sleep's down or recover. I need to be able to be like, this is down and here's why, and here's our solution.[3:21:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: That that's how our high performance world works. So enter absolute rest. This is saying, okay. What are the actual nodes that go into high effective, high quality sleep? Number 1 is psychology.[3:22:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there has to be some sort of screening diagnostic for, are you not sleeping because of simply you can't control yourself? And you've done a wonderful job of giving people tools. Or if you can't quiet your mind before sleep to this, if you wake up and you can't go back to sleep, here are a bunch of things. Right? So we have some screens that we can do, and there's some other Stuff we can do to analyze.[3:22:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is a psychological issue. Let's say it's not. Right? You're under control, and we have different tricks we use and and stuff. Jim Hack would talk about but it's not that.[3:22:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Is it physiology? Which is know what your serotonin levels are like? What's melatonin look like? What's this what's adrenaline?[3:22:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: What's cortisol? Cortisol being the primary driver. What what is this relationship DHEA? Where are these things at? So we're gonna measure all that and and track that.[3:22:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna measure that during the day. Prior to sleep, we're gonna measure that next morning and even sometimes throughout sleep. And we're gonna figure out if this is a physiology problem. If it is, then we have clear corrections. If not, we're gonna go on the next step, which is, is this possibly pathology?[3:23:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have some sort of sleep disorder. We're gonna run full p what's called PSG. So polycynography. A full the exact same stuff you would get in a sleep clinic. It's a sensor that's gonna go on measuring EEG and EOG, and we're gonna have, muscle activation sensors to see if your legs are moving and everything else is going on.[3:23:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: And gonna get a full diagnostic, and it is if anyone's ever done this, the amount of, sleep issues that are happening in people that they don't even realize is extraordinarily high. So we're gonna figure this out. One very quick example. We just did this with a professional athlete, and he was having, like, 280, Roughly of these episodes per night. And to be categorized as an episode, you have to meet these 4 specific criteria.[3:23:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oxygen saturation, ventilation changes, Brain changes the sector, and and he hit that over 200 e times a night. And what this technology allowed us to do is figure out what position did all these things occur in. Well, in his particular case, most of them are happening was on his back. And so he bought a a very simple, like, pillow, basically, that went on his back That kept him from sleeping on his back. And we saw an 85% reduction in sleep awakeness issues the very 1st night.[3:24:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now we did that. Testosterone eventually tripled after 3 months by just improving sleep, and all we did is move him on to his left or right side. So huge improvements, just by understanding where the problem occurred and why it occurred there. We didn't have to change hardly anything else. He had the basic hygiene stuff down and temperature and and all that stuff, and he had his chili pad and all that to keep the ankle.[3:24:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: We couldn't fix it. Years, by the way. This took us 2 years Of just trying everything. We're like, man. And it was just like, I I wish I wish we could get you to sleep better.[3:24:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we'd I pulled out every trick I knew, and it's just as soon as we built this dinner, I'm like, oh my god. It's all he's not overweight, by the way. He doesn't have any he's not iron deficient. He doesn't have any of these other classical symptoms that are associated with bad sleep. Supplementation, everything we've done, a 1,000 protocols that fixed it overnight.[3:25:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if it's not psychology and it's not physiology and it's not Pathology. Then the last one that people don't have any idea about is environment. And so what you don't realize is we have a box. We can sit right next to your bed. You just plug it in.[3:25:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't have to do anything. And it's gonna run full environmental scans. So it's gonna look at the temperature in your room. It's gonna look at the humidity in your room. It's gonna look at the volatile organic acids.[3:25:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: These are things that are seeping out from your mattress. It's gonna look at particulates in the air and possible allergens and things that are floating around that are closing your nose off so you can't sleep at night, and Now your mouth breathing and you've talked a lot, I'm sure, on the previous episodes about why that's bad. It's gonna look at your c o two cloud. So we've do talked hey. We've already set this point up.[3:25:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? You're inhaling o 2, but then you're exhaling c o 2. Well, during the day and when we're conversing, you have a quite a bit of force Without exhalation. Right? But at night, it's just barely seeping out of your mouth.[3:25:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what happens is c o two sends to cloud up and build around your face, and then you end up rebreathing that c o two. And this can cause a a large number of sleep problems because you're simply Rebreathing in the panic, whether you fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage, the c o two around your face is a big issue. This stuff has all been known, by the way, with the astronauts for a very long time. It just hasn't translated into the to the commercial spaces. Of course, gone into our High performer space.[3:26:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we can measure that as well, and then we can figure out, like, for the most extreme, we can actually come into a bedroom And build an entire sleep optimization, setup and control the entire thing. But for most folks, the minimum we can do is Runfold Diagnostics and check off, is this environmental related? Is it pathology? Is there something else?[3:26:42] Andrew Huberman: So is this a commercial device that people can eventually access? It is now. So where can people learn more about Absolute Rest?[3:26:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolute rest .com.[3:26:51] Andrew Huberman: Very cool. And just for our full disclosure, I wasn't aware that you had done this prior to Today, what you'd mentioned, I always like to ask people, scientists or otherwise, I always love to ask you, what are you most excited about lately? And this sounds like an amazing technology.[3:27:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: And just to be really clear, that's not like something we're working on. That's that's landed.[3:27:08] Andrew Huberman: That's landed.[3:27:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're ready to go.[3:27:10] Andrew Huberman: Great. Well and that's one of the things I appreciate about you is that you're You're willing to sometimes speculate, but you always say it's speculation. But in general, you're you seem like the kind of guy where if you're gonna be Public facing about something. If you're gonna make a statement, there's gotta be quite a bit behind it. You're not gonna allude to the in 10 years, we might be able to do this or in 5 years.[3:27:30] Andrew Huberman: You're very data Driven kinda guy.[3:27:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Well, the people I work with, we need answers. Right? We don't have that time frame, and we typically have, like, hey. We start the season in 4 weeks.[3:27:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So that's just where I'm at.[3:27:42] Andrew Huberman: Well, as I said, I appreciate that about you, but it is but one of the many things I appreciate, I think, the listeners and I can well appreciate on the basis of today's discussion what a enormous wealth of information You are how clear and, and potently you communicate that information, and, also, how you can, take a huge cloud of information and still distill it into, protocols that ought to work for 75% of people, 75 Percent of the time, which is an immensely valuable, thing to do. So for me and from the listeners, I just wanna say thank you so much for taking the Several now hours I lose track of time, which is a good, reflects all good things. Several hours to Take a break from teaching, take a break from research, take a break from the other important commitments of your life, and really share with us all this incredible information. I'm so so grateful.[3:28:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: My pleasure, man. I'm fine I'm glad we finally got to connect. This has been a a long time in the making.[3:28:42] Andrew Huberman: It has, and I'm going to, I'm going to Bring the breathing protocols to my training. I'm going to start doing more of the endurance type and interval type training. I'm gonna start moving when I do heat. I'm gonna start moving when I do cold. I might even start throwing some, sodium bicarb into, a very small amount of sodium bicarb into, some water before I train.[3:29:02] Andrew Huberman: And Listen, Andy professor Andy Galpin, thank you ever so much.[3:29:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: My pleasure.[3:29:08] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor Andy Galpin.

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like sleep and focus and energy and many other features of our physiology and mental functioning. There are some important issues to consider when considering supplements. One of those issues is the quality of the ingredients. For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, t h o r n e, because Thorne supplements have the highest possible standards with respect to the quality of the ingredients they include.[3:30:40] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorn, that's thorne.com/theletteru/huberman, And there, you'll see the supplements that I take, and you can get 20% off any of those supplements. If you navigate further into the Thorne site through that website, thorne .com/u/huberman. You can also get 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
