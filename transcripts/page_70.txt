Kronikle AI - Dr. Kyle Gillett: How to Optimize Your Hormones for Health & Vitality | Huberman Lab Podcast #67 - TranscriptDr. Kyle Gillett: How to Optimize Your Hormones for Health & Vitality | Huberman Lab Podcast #67 - TranscriptTranscript[0:00:00] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Kyle Gillette. Doctor Gillette is dual board certified in family medicine and obesity medicine and practices out of a clinic in Kansas and via At telemedicine, he provides full spectrum medicine including hormone health, preventative medicine, obstetrics, which is the branch of medicine and surgery concerned with Childbirth and the care of women giving birth and pediatrics. I first learned about doctor Gillette from a podcast of all things and was immediately struck by the Breadth and depth of his knowledge on all things hormones and hormone optimization.[0:00:47] Andrew Huberman: As you'll see very soon today, Doctor Gillette can teach you how to optimize your hormones using behavioral tools, nutrition, exercise based tools, supplementation, and hormone therapies if those are appropriate for you. There are many professionals out there, including many medical doctors, of course, talking about hormone health. What really sets doctor Gillette apart from the pack is his ability to understand how the different factors that I described before, nutrition, supplementation, exercise, and hormone therapies, how those interact with one another, and the safest and most rational ways to approach hormone optimization. During today's episode, you will learn how to optimize your hormones, not just testosterone and estrogen, but also prolactin and other hormone pathways that impact your mood, mental health, and physical health. Doctor Gillette is also an avid educator about hormones and other aspects of health.[0:01:37] Andrew Huberman: He does this on zero cost to consumer platforms such as Instagram and other social media. On Instagram, he is kylegillettmd. That's k y l e g I l l e t t, no e at the end, m d. So Kyle Gillette MD on Instagram, and he is Gillette Health on all other platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. If you go to his Instagram or his other social media, You will learn a lot about hormone health, about the latest science impacting obesity and metabolic health.[0:02:07] Andrew Huberman: He has a wealth of knowledge, and, again, he's providing all that information at Zero cost to you, the consumer. What you are soon to hear is a conversation between me and doctor Gillette about all things hormones and hormone health and hormone optimization. We dive deep into mechanisms, but we are clear to establish what each word or set of concepts mean. So if you have no background in biology or even if you do, I'm sure that you'll come away with a wealth of valuable knowledge. We also talk about Specific protocols related, again, to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation, and where appropriate, hormone replacement therapy.[0:02:43] Andrew Huberman: I know there's a lot of interest about these topics. Doctor Gillette is very thorough about addressing both male and female issues and addressing hormone health for people at all stages of life. Sure that you'll come away from this episode with the same impression that I did, which is that doctor Gillette is an extraordinarily clear communicator and that he has tremendous compassion for his patients, and that he has a deep love of understanding biology and medicine in ways that can benefit you. Pleased to announce that I am hosting 2 live events in May 2022. The 1st live event will take place in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.[0:03:19] Andrew Huberman: The 2nd live event will take place in Portland, Oregon on May 18th. Both are part of a lecture series entitled The Brain Body Contract, During which I will talk about science and science based tools, many of which overlap with the topics covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast, but most of which will not and will be completely new topics and tools never discussed publicly before. Both live events will also include a question and answer period during which you, the audience, can ask me questions directly about any aspect of science or science based tools, and I will attempt to answer them. Tickets for the 2 events, Again, Seattle on May 17th and Portland on May 18th are both available at hubermanlab.com/tour. Before we begin with today's episode, I want to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:04:06] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort To bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes nootropics. In fact, they make custom nootropics.[0:04:24] Andrew Huberman: Now what is a nootropic? Technically, nootropic means Smart drug. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics because what is smart? I mean, there's creativity, there's focus, task switching. Different aspects of our brain and body engage different aspects of cognition, many of which we can call smart.[0:04:41] Andrew Huberman: There's emotional intelligence. Is analytic intelligence. There's logic. There's creativity. Thesis understands this and has designed custom nootropics designed to bring your body and brain into the Specific state that you want.[0:04:53] Andrew Huberman: So for instance, they have specific nootropics for creativity, other nootropics for focus, Other nootropics for motivation and so on and so forth. In addition to that, each nootropic is custom designed for you. They use only the highest quality ingredients, Things like alpha GPC and phosphatidylserine, which I've talked about on this podcast before. They also use ingredients like ginkgo biloba, which many people use, like, and benefit from. However, there are also people like me who can't take ginkgo biloba because it gives me terrible headaches.[0:05:24] Andrew Huberman: I learned that a long time ago, and so I simply can't take any nootropic or any supplement for that matter That includes Ginkgo Biloba. I'm sure I'm not alone in the fact that some ingredients work for me and others do not. Thesis has solved this problem of individual variation by creating a brief quiz. So if you go online to take thesis.com/huberman and take a 3 minute quiz, And then Thesis will send you to 4 different formulas that match your specific preferences. Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman.[0:05:53] Andrew Huberman: And if you use the code Huberman, get 10% off your 1st box of custom nootropics. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. There are a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, But a major issue with many of them is that you get numbers back about levels of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information.[0:06:31] Andrew Huberman: InsideTracker has solved that problem by creating a personalized dashboard. So you take your blood and or your DNA test, you get the results back, and Where certain values might be too high or too low for your preference, you can click on that and it will direct you immediately to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation, etcetera, that can help you bring those numbers back into the ranges that are ideal for you. So it not only gives you information about where your health stands, it gives you directives as to how to improve your health.

That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.[0:07:12] Andrew Huberman: Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime studying the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system is Incredibly sophisticated. It allows you to do things like move from a shady area outside to a sunny area outside and to adjust your visual system so you don't even notice that transition. A lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses are not designed with those sorts of biological transitions in mind.[0:07:40] Andrew Huberman: ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses are different. Every one of their glasses is designed with the biology of the visual system in mind. First of all, they're incredibly lightweight, so you don't even notice that they're on your face. Second of all, they were designed to be worn during activities like running and cycling, etcetera, and they won't slip off your face even if you get sweaty, they have a terrific aesthetic. So even though they were originally designed as active eyewear, they look great.[0:08:03] Andrew Huberman: So you can wear them out to dinner, to school, at work, etcetera. If you'd like to try ROKA sunglasses or eyeglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, and enter the code huberman to save 20% Your first order.

Doctor Gillette, welcome.[0:08:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Thank you for having me.[0:08:27] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm super excited to talk to you because I found out about you on a podcast, and it immediately became clear that you are an encyclopedia of knowledge about hormone health for men and for women across the lifespan. So I have many, many questions. But before we dive into those questions, I'd love to just get a little bit of your background In terms of your medical training and what your particular orientation is toward treating your patients, and how do you think about this Whole landscape that we call hormone health. What is a hormone? How do you envision, people managing their hormones?[0:09:07] Andrew Huberman: If you could just kinda fill in a few of those blanks for us, I think a lot of people would appreciate it.[0:09:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Absolutely. So I'm dual board certified in family medicine and obesity medicine. I've kind of tailored my training in order to provide what I call a balanced approach to total health, which includes body, mind, and soul. I recently saw a podcast with Joe Rogan and mister Beast. And Joe asked, mister beast, how do you become such an amazing YouTuber and have all these, know, great clickbait videos, and how did you become good at it?[0:09:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And it turns out he just became obsessed when he was a teenager, and that's essentially How I've tailored my education as well, I've become obsessed with optimal human performance, their body, their mind, and even their spirit. So I attended med school at the University of Kansas, which is, one of the few med schools that still emphasizes Full spectrum care. They emphasize exercise as medicine. They emphasize food as medicine, of which I was active in both of those interest groups. In residency, I was active in a lot of, mindfulness curriculum and then also things like walk with a doc, where you emphasize preventative medicine.[0:10:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's something that we've kinda got away from, and that niche led me to hormone health. It didn't really start as hormone health, But it's a very important component of health in general that many people don't emphasize.[0:10:33] Andrew Huberman: Great. Well, this idea of Preventative medicine, I think, is starting to really take hold in the general population, especially given the events of the last few years. People realize that they are showing up to health challenges at a bunch of different levels and with some people feeling very robust, other people feeling back on their heels. When someone comes to you as a patient, what are some of the first things that you want to know about them? I mean, obviously, you wanna know their blood pressure.[0:10:58] Andrew Huberman: You wanna know, something about their mental health and family history. But in terms of hormone health, what what are the sorts of probe questions that you ask, and and what are you looking for? And I ask this because I'd like people to be able to Ask some of these very same questions for themselves.[0:11:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So when you do a physical exam and a history, you have a lot of different parts. Have your history of present illness. If they have a complaint, maybe the patient doesn't have a complaint. In that case, things like their social history and their family history are extremely important Because that gives you, an insight in their into their genetics and an insight into their hormone health.[0:11:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So patients will tell me, I'm doing okay, but It helps to ask them, well, how are you now? Let's say the patient is 50. How are you now versus when you were 20, and what has changed? So I've got the question a lot. How do you get your doctor to order a better lab workup or to even include your basic hormones?[0:11:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And there's no magic answer to that. But what really helps is you tell them, you know, my energy is not as good as it used to My focus is not as good as it used to be. My athletic performance is not as good as it used to be. So you don't have to have a pathology in order for a lab to be indicated. You just need to have that Pertinent symptom.[0:12:14] Andrew Huberman: I think this can be really helpful, because for many people, the the idea of getting a blood test to look at their home hormones just seems like such an enormous hurdle to get over, And many doctors won't prescribe them. And would you say that it's using the approach you just described that it's, Equally effective for men and women, or do you find that, for one reason or another, that men and women have different challenges in in advantages in trying to access their deeper hormone data.[0:12:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. It's slightly different. With women, there's a lot more Objective data. So if they're having menstrual irregularities or, you know, if they're going in if they're not having a period, if they're having too heavy of periods, then Then those are things that they talk about very frequent frequently with their doctor. Men are more hesitant.[0:13:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So men really wanna know what their testosterone is, But they at the same time, they really don't wanna tell their doctor how their libido is or how their energy is because it it's almost like, They feel less masculine or they feel less like a guy when they say that, even if they're just talking to their doctor about it.[0:13:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I think that that raise a really important point, which is that the whole discussion around hormone health is a bit of a barbed wire topic. Because in many ways, when we hear the word hormone, we think Testosterone and estrogen, we think notions of masculinity and femininity. And, of course, testosterone and estrogen are present in All sexes. Right?[0:13:42] Andrew Huberman: All chromosomal backgrounds, and just to varying degrees and ratios. But it also raises all these issues about sexual health that It's kind of interesting because I'm surrounded by medical doctors in my lab at Stanford. And the more physicians that I surround myself with, the more open is the discussion around sexual health and reproductive health. But in the general population, I think some of these topics are a little bit, Taboo or against kind of barbed wire. And so I think that people are seeking a lot of this information on YouTube and through communities that may or may not be very educated about the actual biology.[0:14:15] Andrew Huberman: So along those lines, you know, we could probably assume that hormones are changing across the lifespan, I think. Right? Certainly, from from childhood up Then puberty and onward, if if you would, I'd love to just kind of take a snapshot of what you think everybody should be thinking about or doing to optimize their hormone health, male or female, in the let's say, in their twenties, And then maybe we could migrate that to their thirties and forties. But before that, could you just tell us what everyone should be doing for their hormone health From puberty onward?[0:14:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. The law of diminishing returns applies. So doing a little amount of what I call lifestyle interventions over a long period of time is gonna be far more helpful or efficacious been doing a lot and then doing nothing or doing a lot and then doing nothing. So I talk about the big 6 pillars. The 2 strongest ones are likely diet and exercise.[0:15:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: For hormone health, specifically, resistance training is particularly helpful. For, diet, caloric restriction can be particularly helpful, especially with the epidemic of metabolic syndrome that is Continuing to ongo in this country and in developed countries in general. So those are the 2 most powerful. So number 1 and number 2 are diet and exercise. For the last 4, I had a little bit of alliteration.[0:15:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So there's stress and stress optimization That has to do with cortisol. That has to do with your mental health. That has to do with societal health and collective health of your family as well. When you're a member of a family Or even a very close friend, trying to achieve optimal health together is very important. It's the same thing with nicotine cessation.[0:16:05] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's the same thing with Hormone optimization, if you do it as a household unit, it's far more helpful. So after stress, you have sleep optimization. Sleep is extremely important, especially for mitochondrial health as well. And then you have sunlight, which encompasses anything that's outdoors. So You move more, you have cold exposure, you have heat exposure.[0:16:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's sunlight. And then last 1 is spirit. So, that's kind of the body, mind, and soul. If you have all the other 5 in, they're dialed in completely, but you don't have your spiritual health, whatever you believe, then that's going to profoundly impact Your body and your mind as well.[0:16:44] Andrew Huberman: And we're definitely gonna touch into this notion of spiritual health because I think for some people, that might, draw connotations of of, Certain things that may or may not be accurate, but, I know a number of academic laboratories that are focused on this and a number of of, not just, functional medicine clinics, but, research clinics and hospitals throughout the country that are are achieving some really interesting data, not just in in people that are Quite sick, but in healthy people who are trying to further optimize health. So we will definitely touch back to that. If you, We'd be so kind as to maybe give us a little bit more detail about some of these other areas. So when people hear diet, I immediately think, okay. Now we get into the, the combat around Yeah.[0:17:26] Andrew Huberman: Vegan, plant based, carnivore, etcetera. But I think that my General view of this is that most people should probably be eating as few highly processed foods, highly palatable foods as possible, which doesn't mean eating foods that don't taste good, of course. But What other sorts of things do do you recommend in the realm of diet? And then I also want to know about caloric restriction, Because my understanding is that a caloric surplus can actually support certain hormones, like testosterone. So how does one combine caloric restriction and still optimize Hormones.[0:17:59] Andrew Huberman: But what would you say is a really terrific way to think about and approach diet?[0:18:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Diet should be an individualized approach. So if you have a A car each car is made different and requires a different sort of fuel. Whether it's a race car, whether it's a diesel truck, they have different fuels for different Performance outcomes. So if you're trying to tow something or you're trying to go fast.[0:18:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it's the same way with athletes. It's, pretty well studied. The more intra workout carbs, ultra long distance athletes take, in general, they do better. I think they've studied this in cyclists quite often. It also depends on your genetics.[0:18:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So you can have a genetic polymorphism, and you metabolize carbs and sugar better even when they're unopposed by fiber.[0:18:44] Andrew Huberman: How does one determine whether or not they have such a polymorphism? I mean, I've I'm an omnivore, so I I do eat some high quality meats, not in huge quantities, but I also eat vegetables and starches. I feel fine. I've never done an elimination diet. May I think I did a Very low carb diet once, and all it gave me was a lot of psoriasis and poor sleep, so I backed off.[0:19:04] Andrew Huberman: I probably didn't do it correctly, but I know a lot of people that do Quite well on on a very low carb or zero carb diet.[0:19:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Particularly those who are at risk of cancer Because you have less, glucose that can be easily uptaken into cells, and then also people with autoimmune diseases. They tend to do well on our On lower carb diets. Yeah. But, yeah, as far as the, how do you know, basically, you can use your biofeedback, how you're feeling to guess What you tolerate well, or you can just get genetic testing, which can be fairly expensive, but most of all, it requires a Physician or someone who knows how to interpret the test accurately.[0:19:42] Andrew Huberman: And if someone had the means or the, would you say that getting regular blood testing a good idea. And if so, what is regular blood testing? Is it every 3 months? Is it every 6 months? Of course, the backdrop of of life is changing too, stress levels, etcetera.[0:19:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Every 3 to 6 months for preventative purposes. At times, you need blood tests at, faster frequencies than that. And then you should also get a blood test when you're fasting and when you're not fasting. So if you're looking for damage to the beach, You wanna you don't just look at low tide.[0:20:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You look at high tide, and you see what's happening at high tide as well.[0:20:17] Andrew Huberman: And it's a great way to put it. And in terms of, general recommendations around Exercise. I mean, I'm of the mind based on the data that I've seen that almost everybody should or everybody should be getting 150 to a 180 minutes minimum of zone 2 cardio per week that kind of could continue, while having a conversation, but with If one were to exert any more effort, it would have a hard time getting the words out. At least that, right, for cardiovascular health and general brain health and musculoskeletal health Plus resistance exercise. Is that more or less the contour of what you recommend?[0:20:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. That's more or less the contour. The More you're doing your zone 2 cardiovascular exercise, the slightly less important a long duration of caloric restriction is. Interesting.[0:21:06] Andrew Huberman: And that brings us to caloric restriction. Yeah. So it's very clear that caloric restriction can Allow one to lose weight. Right? This is the the classic CICO, c I c o, calories in, calories out.[0:21:18] Andrew Huberman: We are not disputing calories in, calories out. Somehow, that always has be stated 50 times, in any forum because of whatever follows, people, I think, will anchor to and assume that we don't mean that. But I know you and I both agree on Calories in, calories out is a fundamental law of thermodynamics. Yeah. But it's clear to me that based on what I've read that when One is in a slight caloric surplus that hormones like testosterone can be optimized, but is that true for somebody who's showing up with excessive body fat?[0:21:48] Andrew Huberman: Does this all work? Because body fat is manufacturing enzymes that convert testosterone to estrogen. So in other words, how does someone know if they should Use caloric restriction or avoid caloric restriction.[0:21:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Here's how to parse that out. So before I delve into the details a bit more, I should say as a board certified obesity medicine physician, obviously, the laws of thermodynamics apply. And then In addition to that, there is nothing special about intermittent fasting or caloric restriction or exercise when it pertains to Losing body weight in general. When you do lose weight, about 33% of that is lean body mass, and about 10% of Fat cells, you know, adipose cells are actually lean body mass as well because it has proteins and water and things like that too.[0:22:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So the Reason for exercise and the reason for caloric restriction in general, including intermittent fasting, is health reasons. That's how you increase your health span. It's not necessarily gonna make the weight on the scale change, but that doesn't matter as much. It's been fairly well studied in both mice and humans. It's much easier to study in mice.[0:22:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So that's a precursor to our 6 types of people, the ones that care about my studies and the ones that care about human studies. But if you calorically restrict mice by 40%, then, they can have improved testosterone parameters, but only if they're obese to start. And it appears to be that same way in humans as well. So the easy way to think about it is If you're obese or you have metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve your testosterone. There has been a study, they talk about all these studies in a systematic review from the Mayo Clinic proceedings in March of last year.[0:23:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And, they note that There is a study in young, healthy men, and they restrict them, and their testosterone does decrease. So if you're young and healthy and you don't have metabolic syndrome, I think caloric restriction will likely decrease your testosterone.[0:23:51] Andrew Huberman: That clarifies a lot for me, and I I believe it will clarify a lot for other people as well. And I'm delighted that you pointed out this distinction about intermittent fasting not being the only way to achieve caloric restriction. There are a number of, young, healthy or older healthy, people I know who like using intermittent fasting, even if they're not trying to lose weight for a couple of reasons. Some believe that it might extend lifespan. I think there's still that's still a bit of an open question.[0:24:21] Andrew Huberman: It's a bit of a hard experiment to do because the control group is no one wants to be in the control group, as I say.[0:24:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A dozen mice.[0:24:27] Andrew Huberman: Right. Right. Exactly. Audience. Exactly.[0:24:30] Andrew Huberman: And the other, feature of it that's a little bit tricky is that Many people like intermittent fasting because of the mental effects, the clarity of mind that they feel during fasting, the increased pleasure in eating when they finally do eat. And here, I'm referring to intermittent fasting of the sort where eating windows are anywhere from 8 to 12 hours a day, not extended fasts of 24 hours or more. So the question, therefore, is for the healthy, lean enough person, right, non obese person, Is intermittent fasting a bad idea in terms of hormone health? Is oscillating between this period of of kind of feast and famine within a 24 hours A problem if one is getting sufficient calories to maintain weight.[0:25:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So if they're in a caloric maintenance, then it's not going to be, it's not gonna be deleterious. It's not gonna be bad for their hormone health. There's a couple different hormones that we can about we can talk about testosterone. We can talk about DHEA, which usually go hand in hand.[0:25:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And then we can also talk about growth hormone, which is not a steroid hormone, but it's a hormone. So it's, a chain of proteins, amino acids that are put together instead of a sterile. Think of Sterile hormones is coming from cholesterol. So intermittent fasting, you do get a little spike in growth hormone after you eat, But you also get a huge spike in growth hormone, a more significant less negligible spike overnight, And that is improved if you are intermittent fasting. So it's probably gonna help your growth hormone and Subsequently, IGF one levels, which will help more in older age groups than younger age groups.[0:26:15] Andrew Huberman: And I like to eat dinner. So for me, that means sometime around 6 or 7 o'clock, sometimes 8 o'clock. I confessed last night. So I was working late. I ate I ate pretty big.[0:26:24] Andrew Huberman: I it's what basically, my only meal of the day. At 10 o'clock, that's a rare thing for me. Can I still achieve a high degree of growth hormone output if I let's say I avoid food in the 2 to 3 hours before going to sleep, or does one have to be very deep into a fast in order to achieve this the increase in growth hormone?[0:26:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's still pretty good growth hormone output even if you eat 2 or 3 hours before you sleep. It's just the law of diminishing returns. The longer you go, you get Slightly more and slightly more.[0:26:55] Andrew Huberman: Great. And I know a number of people think of growth hormone in the context of the exogenous growth hormone, and the fact that that can, in some cases, be associated with cancers. I've been asked many times before, can the increasing growth hormone from things like Saunas or intermittent fasting cause levels of growth hormone that are so high that they cause cancers. I my impulse is to say No. That doesn't it seems like it's not, likely to happen, but I I should probably verify that statement with you.[0:27:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So Quite unlikely. I think about growth hormone and especially IGF one. And there's actually an IGF one and IGF 2, but I think about it In terms of endocrine IGF one, mostly IGF one that's, synthesized in the liver and released in the in the liver versus IGF one that's released. Classically, an example of this would be your IGF one levels increase after resistance training or exercise.[0:27:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And that's more of like Paracrine or autocrine, and they have more local action. So that IGF one, it's pretty well studied that if you just Give people IGF one. It's not going to at, physiologic levels, it's not gonna improve their body composition. However, That IGF one that's autocrine and paracrine just working in those local tissues and muscles is likely part of the reason why you get a Improved body composition response after exercise. I see.[0:28:22] Andrew Huberman: And, just to clarify for me and for for others, what can we say are the major functions of IGF one and IGF two that are distinct from just growth hormone? Are they just kind of the active form of growth hormone? The kind of the The, the pickaxe end of the of the of the assembly line.[0:28:40] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So they have a much longer duration of action. I believe the half life of IGF one is several days, almost a week, whereas growth hormone has an extremely fast half life of only hours. So growth hormone acts, significantly on the liver to produce IGF one. So it's, It's around in the serum in the blood long enough to where it's producing an effect, pretty much all the time. Very interesting.[0:29:09] Andrew Huberman: Well and then your other pillars, stress, you know, we've talked a lot about stress on this podcast before and tools for managing stress. Sleep, obviously, is a big one. I think, you know, if if nothing else, I will, either put people to sleep with my podcast, certainly not this one, but my my solo episodes or, hopefully, convince people that sleep is the foundation of mental and physical health and and performance. Are there any aspects of Hormone optimization that can improve sleep. I know sleep can improve hormone optimization, but are there any aspects of hormone optimization that can improve sleep?[0:29:44] Andrew Huberman: And for people that, are suffering from this common syndrome of going to sleep and then waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning, we know that can be associated with depression. But Are there any hormone hormonal indications that might lead to that kind of situation?[0:29:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's 3 big ones. The first one is not super common, but it's a very direct correlation. If you have a growth hormone deficiency, A true deficiency, whether you're an adult or a child, then your sleep is likely going to be affected. And, let's say you're a child with growth hormone deficiency.[0:30:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Once that is replaced with therapy, your sleep is gonna get significantly better. The second one that's a very common scenario is If you're having what's called vasomotor symptoms of menopause or vasomotor symptoms of andropause, which are also applicable, And that's where your progestogenic activity. So your, main progestogens are progesterone And then pregnant alone, and then 5 alpha three alpha progesterone, which is Where[0:30:46] Andrew Huberman: are those manufactured in the body? So they're manufactured in[0:30:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: a few places. In men, they're manufactured some in the testes, in the leydig cells. In women, they're manufactured in the ovaries until menopause, And then they're also manufactured in the adrenal glands. So, if you're in if you're preadrenopausal, Where your adrenal glands are still working fairly well, usually still have a decent amount of progesterone around, and this can be measured too. So, after menopause, women make progesterone from their, ovaries Or sorry.[0:31:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: From their adrenal glands. If that progesterone crosses the blood brain barrier, especially if it's 5 alpha and 3 alpha reduced, so it's modified a little bit, Then it is both a GABA agonist, which helps sleep just like GABA does. Gamma aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of which lots of things work on. Alcohol works on GABA as well. Gabapentin also works on GABA.[0:31:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Migraine medicines, many of them work on GABA. Benzodiazepines and also nonbenzos. So an example of a benzo would be Xanax. An example of A, nonbenzo would be Ambien. So those all work on GABA.[0:32:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So GABA is also helped by The progestogenic activity as well. That's why a lot of women in menopause feel like their sleep is much worse is because they have lower activity of those progestogens.[0:32:15] Andrew Huberman: Is that and for men in so called andropause, low testosterone, is that also one of the causes of poor sleep?[0:32:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Low testosterone can lead to poor sleep, but my 3rd scenario, is actually if a man begins TRT, Then they develop a poor sleep because of sleep apnea. It drastically raises the risk that somebody is going to have sleep apnea. And then a lot of people, especially when they first started in the 1st month or 2, it puts them into this hyper sympathetic state because they have, overactive androgen receptors, especially after a long time of being hypogonadal, then they have, A physiologic dose of TRT, and that causes the sleep issue itself. Interesting.[0:33:01] Andrew Huberman: I have a lot of questions about TRT testosterone replacement therapy. I should just mention that when you say, it increases sympathetic activity, you don't mean, that taking testosterone increases sympathy for others. It may, in fact, do the opposite. Although it's very clear from my discussions with, my colleagues in on the in the endocrinology side and also with, the great doctor Robert Sapolsky, that that increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing Features of people. So the jerks become bigger jerks.[0:33:31] Andrew Huberman: Kind people become even more kind in general. But we will I wanna get Into TRT in-depth, but it's very interesting me to hear that testosterone replacement therapy, increases the risk of sleep apnea. And I wanna make sure that I ask that is that also the case in people that are using TRT who are not hypogonadal? Because In the classic situation, if somebody isn't making enough testosterone, they're below 300 nanograms per deciliter on the chart, they go in and take TRT. But many people nowadays, Let's be honest, our our taking doses of of testosterone even though they are in the sort of standard range because the range is so large because of other symptomology.[0:34:10] Andrew Huberman: Is that right?[0:34:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. I do love the analogy that doctor Sapolsky had about monks taking testosterone and making them more and more generous.[0:34:19] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm.[0:34:19] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So That does appear to be what testosterone usually does is it exacerbates, if you will, what you're previously like, so it's not gonna change you as a person. But, if you're eugonadal before you start testosterone[0:34:33] Andrew Huberman: Meaning you're meaning?[0:34:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Meaning, you have normal testosterone, and then you start TRT or, self administered TRT, steroids, what however you wanna look at it, then your risk of sleep apnea still goes up in a dose dependent fashion. So the higher the dose, the more risky. With the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, the sympathetic is the fight or flight nervous system. The parasympathetic is the rest and digest. So if you have too much fight or flight, and stress can cause that too, then you're not gonna rest as well at night.[0:35:04] Andrew Huberman: I wanna touch on testosterone in women because there is testosterone in women. I'd like to know where that testosterone comes from, which tissues. I'd like to know whether or not testosterone replacement therapy makes sense in women. I'm hearing more and more about women using testosterone, and I'd like to know whether or not knowing a woman's test for her to know her testosterone is of Equal, less than, or more value than knowing, for instance, progesterone and estrogen levels, because I think there are a lot of misconceptions about the roles of testosterone in women.[0:35:38] Dr. Kyle Gillett: For health optimization, testosterone is just as important to know. For pathology prevention, for example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, Estrogen and progesterone are more important to know. So when you're thinking about women, women think that they have such a tiny amount of testosterone because you could you test it. Most people test a free testosterone. So a testosterone that's unbound, which is by far the the smallest proportion of testosterone.[0:36:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Any androgen is bound by lots of different steroid binding proteins, but the ones that are most pertinent called SHBG or sex hormone binding globulin, and that binds the androgenic steroid. For example, DHT to your dihydrotestosterone, it's associated with prostate enlargement, associated with male pattern baldness. It binds that the most strongly, and then it binds testosterone next most strongly, and then it binds things like androstenedione or DHEA, dehydro At the androsterone, and then it binds the estrogens, the weakest, like estradiol. So if you look at the Total amount of testosterone, women actually have, almost all women, not all women, but almost all of them have Significantly more testosterone than estradiol, but it's because it's in different, measurements. So estradiol, a lot of time, is, you know, picograms per ml as opposed to nanograms per deciliter.[0:37:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So women have more testosterone than estrogen And significantly more DHEA than either.[0:37:14] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Do women make dihydrotestosterone?[0:37:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. And where does it[0:37:18] Andrew Huberman: where does this Testosterone come from because they don't have testes.[0:37:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So most testosterone in women that are premenopausal can come from theca cells, t h e c a. So theca cells are cells in the ovaries that can produce testosterone. And a lot of people, have actually heard about hyperthecosis, not the term itself, But a lot of Olympians that are, their chromosomes are x y, they're females, and They are not taking any ketamine. X y, but they're females.[0:37:48] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They're XX. Oh, okay. Thank you. So they're XX. They're not XY.[0:37:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And they have never transitioned or been on any sort of, hormone replacement or testosterone, but they naturally produce A huge amount of testosterone as much as many men. And some of these women, I believe they were from Botswana, were banned from competing in the Olympics In certain distances, I believe they were banned from the 400 meter and 800 meter because their natural testosterone was deemed to be too high.[0:38:19] Andrew Huberman: They mistakenly thought that they were using steroids.[0:38:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They actually knew they were not using steroids. They knew it was their theca cells were just Genetically gifted, I suppose, and they still made them change distances.[0:38:31] Andrew Huberman: Wow.[0:38:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So 1 or 2 of these athletes changed to I believe it was a 3 k over the five k. And they still did quite well, but it was not their best event. Interesting. Yeah.[0:38:41] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's turning out to be a very interesting and controversial area of this notion hormone therapies and natural variation in hormones on different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating. We should probably do a whole episode about that because it's very much of the times. So men and women both make DHT.[0:38:59] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to ask about DHT in men. So often we hear about testosterone in men and free testosterone and, being the unbound form, of course. But dihydrotestosterone, where does it come from in men? What is the cascade of of events that takes testosterone to dihydrous testosterone? And what are some of the, quote, unquote, positive and negative effects of of here, I'm only referring to endogenous hydrotestosterone.[0:39:28] Andrew Huberman: And in fact, I'll I'll make it very clear whether or not, I'm talking about taking something or one's own natural production. Here, we're just up until now, we've just been talking about natural production. So tell us about DHT in men. It's such a powerful hormone during development, obviously. Yeah.[0:39:43] Andrew Huberman: But what's it what is it doing?[0:39:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: DHT is a very androgenic hormone. So whether you're talking about DHEA, which is a mild, a weak androgen, or testosterone, which is a relatively strong androgen, or DHT, which is a very strong androgen. They bind to the androgen receptor in both men and in women. So the, effect of all 3 of those is mediated by the androgen receptor. There's a couple different beta estradiol receptors and a alpha estradiol receptors, but there's only 1 androgen receptor.[0:40:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Intriguingly, it is on the X chromosome. So men get their androgen receptor gene from their mother. Women get 1 androgen receptor gene from their father, one from their mother. Often the one that is more sensitive to androgens and peep people with PCOS, that's the one that's active. The other one is methylated and inactive.[0:40:38] Andrew Huberman: Can I just pause you once I sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask this question, before I forget, and I know a number of people are probably wondering? I've heard that whether or not one develops male pattern baldness whether or not a, male develops male pattern baldness, just to be very precise. You could get some information about that by looking at your mother's father, And that would be in keeping with what you just described, that the X chromosome, which, of course, is handed off through the mother, is carrying the, genes that encode for the Number and distribution of these d of these androgen receptors that DHT will bind to. Because, of course, I think as you'll probably tell us, the DHT is responsible for male pattern baldness and beard growth. Is that right?[0:41:19] Andrew Huberman: Should I look at my grandfather on my mother's side to determine what I'm likely to look like in terms of my DHTness? Is that a word?[0:41:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. It's the best guess that you could make Purely from phenotypes. Now you can measure your genotype and, you know, get a better idea of that. Assuming that it's true male and baldness, it's related to the gene transcription of the androgen receptor. So I like to think of it as how much of this Androgen receptor gene is activated by any androgen.[0:41:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you have an extremely sensitive gene, which usually means you have very few CAG repeats, which is basically just a a certain CAG encodes for a certain, amino acid. And if you have very few of the repeats, then your androgen receptor gene works better. Think of it as a corollary to Huntington's disease, Where if you have very few of called trinucleotide repeats, then it's not as severe of a disease. But after you get more and more CAG repeats, which by the way are, in the population, you're getting more and more CAG repeats. So it's a a natural selection of process that has been ongoing for a a variety of number of reasons.[0:42:32] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But, anyway, if you have more repeats than that gene activates in the cytoplasm and moves to the nucleus and causes gene transcription more often and hair loss more often.[0:42:42] Andrew Huberman: Does that mean that we're seeing more hair loss now due to elevated levels of DHT than we were 50 years ago?[0:42:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Probably not. The hair loss 50 years ago well, not 50 years ago, but 500 years ago was Probably more significant because on average, 500 years ago, people were more sensitive to androgens. So there's a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome, AIS. And that syndrome was related to when men who have The copy from their mother who is a carrier, their AR gene or androgen receptor gene is completely insensitive. So think of it.[0:43:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It doesn't have a it's not related to the CAG repeats, but think of that, receptor as just not working at all. So there's a continuum. So everybody's receptor works a little bit better or a little bit worse. And the better your receptor works, the more likely you are to have male pattern baldness.[0:43:40] Andrew Huberman: To zoom out from this, but still keeping a, an eye on DHT, what do you like to see all Women and all men do to optimize DHT, and here, I'm talking about regardless of age. So we're still in this From puberty onward phase, we haven't yet, microdissected out decade by decade, which we will do. But, what do you like to see people do to keep DHT in check? But before you tell us that, Could you tell us what positive things DHT does when it's in the proper range?[0:44:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So DHT helps a lot for, Same reason why testosterone helps. It activates the androgen receptor gene. It helps effort feel good, so it can be motivating. So that's how it's active in the CNS.[0:44:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It also is active in cardiovascular tissue. So if you look at, someone that has heart failure Or if someone has cardiac hypertrophy, the level of DHT can matter because it's also binding to the androgen receptor in the myocardium or in the heart itself. So you think of the classic bodybuilder heart. It's an easy example to make. They have very thickened muscle.[0:44:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Their muscle is very strong because they're Pumping blood often with high blood pressure, and that DHT and the testosterone and any DHT derivatives like Masterone or, oxandrolone, primobolin also bind to the heart, and they cause even more Hypertrophy or enlargement of that muscle tissue. So then let's say the person stops and they're recovering, and they're trying to have Cardiac remodeling, which is where you take a very thick heart. And cardiac remodeling is important in a lot of different, cardiac pathologies. But if you give them finasteride or dutasteride, which inhibit the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT, so making less activity at the androgen receptor gene, They have cardiac remodeling, and their heart health improves.[0:45:40] Andrew Huberman: I see. So for the non bodybuilder, the typical woman or man or, young younger or older, what sorts of things support DHT and thereby heart health? Presumably, DHT is involved in some of the other things that Testosterone is famous for in both men and women, things like libido. As you mentioned, making effort feel good, so motivation, drive, and, vitality is at odds, I guess, could be the the general phrase. What what sorts of things support DHT?[0:46:07] Andrew Huberman: What sorts of things Create problems for DHT.[0:46:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's lots of dietary changes and supplementation that you're probably doing right now that's affecting your DHT. Tea. You and me personally? Well, every everybody. All all of the listeners, because let's say you have a diet high in plant polyphenols.[0:46:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Many of those inhibit the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT. Could, could you[0:46:32] Andrew Huberman: give us an example of of One of those, either in supplementation form or in food form.[0:46:39] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Curcumins. Certain curcuminoids, depending on the structure, Will inhibit the enzyme called 5 alpha reductase that converts testosterone to DHT. Turmeric. Yeah. Turmeric.[0:46:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Black pepper extract. So if you It's used often to increase bioavailability. It's also called Bio Purine. It's also a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor.[0:47:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So, and on top of that, people have different genetics too. So some people, there are 5 alpha reductase enzymes. There's 3 of them. They're on chromosome 2, 3, and 4, I believe. But, some of them are active in the prostate.[0:47:15] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Some of them are active in the brain. And some of the so it depends on which tissue. They're tissue specific enzymes that depend on how much DHT you convert.[0:47:26] Andrew Huberman: Do you recommend that people avoid curcumin and turmeric for that reason? And is there any specific recommendations for men versus women?[0:47:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If a man or a woman by the way, in women, a lot of times, if you just ask your doctor for a DHT check, it's the same unit as in men, so it's essentially undetectable. So, you have to, you know, especially if they're on oral contraceptives, which is a different topic. Their DHT is very likely undetectable, Especially if it's free DHT. You can measure both a DHT and a free DHT. But if someone's DHT is already low or if they have Somewhat insensitive androgen receptor via genetics or via lifestyle, then I recommend they avoid Bioavailable curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, and they might be a good candidate for creatine.[0:48:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Creatine, like creatine monohydrate can significantly increase the conversion of testosterone to DHT.[0:48:23] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. There's also a lot of really interesting data coming out now about the, the role of of creatine as a brain fuel and maybe even as a cognitive enhancer over time. The data of the studies in humans are pretty impressive, at least to me. I I'm glad you mentioned this thing about curcumin and black pepper. I wish we'd had this conversation 6 years ago because I had the experience of, jumping on the bandwagon of the excitement around turmeric, and I took a turmeric supplement.[0:48:49] Andrew Huberman: It was a couple capsules of what I thought to be and I think was high quality Turmeric and I've never felt as poor as I did in the subsequent few days. Flat line of, let's just say, everything that One would want to have in life energy, vitality, just it was a cliff. And, a friend somehow knew, that curcumin could inhibit 5 alpha reductase. It converts testosterone to DHT, as you pointed out. I stopped taking it.[0:49:18] Andrew Huberman: It was the only New addition to my diet and supplementation, and things bounced back within about 3, 4 days, but it was remarkable. Mean, I felt like garbage, and it was actually kind of frightening to to experience the the, sharpness of that cliff. But, I know that some people like turmeric for its, anti inflammatory, properties, etcetera. Sounds like people either need to experiment Or, and if they do, obviously, to approach that with caution, anytime you add or remove something, you need to talk to your your doctor. You're a doctor, and I'm guessing that, if one were to experiment, would you say that most of these effects of things like curcumin are reversible as they were in me, or Is there any potential of permanent damage if people have been taking them for a long time?[0:50:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The effects are nearly always reversible. When you're talking about 5 alpha reductase inhibition, so what turmeric does but stronger, the most common story that we hear is regarding A supplement known as saw palmetto, which a lot of older men take for their prostate health, or finasteride, which you can take for your prostate or your heart or your hair or Dutasteride. So if you're having side effects on these, then it's probably because of a couple different reasons. One can be Your ratio of androgens to estrogens is off, and that needs addressed. Another one can be it's inhibiting the conversion of your progesterone to that Other type of progesterone, the 5 alpha, 3 alpha that we talked about earlier that's helping with your sleep and your brain and your calmness.[0:50:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And, that's definitely in effect. Another one is depending on the type of supplement or med, They inhibit different isoenzymes of that 5 alpha reductase. So if it's if they're just inhibiting 12, Then that's gonna be a different effect than if they're inhibiting 2 and 3. So finasteride does 2 and 3, saw palmetto does 1 and 2, and then dutasteride does all 3. The third one is active in the brain, and dutasteride inhibits that third one a little bit weaker in vivo, but strongly in vitro.[0:51:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So It's really hard to parse out. You can use biofeedback and experimentation. I do think with supplements, it's safe to experiment. The time that it takes to set in is usually about 3 months. So the risk of and this is anecdotally.[0:51:39] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's been lots of research published about If post finasteride post finasteride syndrome is real or fake, and it is real, but it's one of those things that's A combination of organic and inorganic disease, almost kinda like fibromyalgia, where it's definitely real and there's lots of things that you can do to help with it, But it's very unlikely to occur if you stop taking your supplement or medication after you have side effects. Interesting.[0:52:06] Andrew Huberman: I certainly feel better when I'm taking 5 grams of creatine monohydrate per day. I know most people take it for muscle growth and tissue repair and things of that sort. Mainly, I think, brings water into the muscle tissue, etcetera. But I I take it for the brain effects and also because I like to think that it gives me a little bit of a DHT bump, that I can actually see in my my blood charts when I've done them. I know many people want to avoid the hair loss that can sometimes be associated with DHT levels going too high.[0:52:36] Andrew Huberman: And so I've been asked many times, does creatine monohydrate cause hair loss? It would make sense that if creatine increases DHT and DHT, binding to the androgen receptor on the scalp can induce hair loss that that would be the case. Is that true, or, is are people just overly concerned about something that's trivial or nonexistent?[0:52:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Each male and so, yes, it can potentially add it. I don't like to say it causes it, but it's it can be a little bit more fuel to the fire. So just like everybody has a different sensitivity of their androgen receptor, they have a different amount of gene transcription that is going to cause death of the follicle. That's an arbitrary threshold, so you don't really know until you start losing hair.[0:53:20] Andrew Huberman: And if somebody takes a little bit of creatine for the, to increase their DHT, maybe for the cognitive enhancing effects or for whatever reason, and they notice a little bit more hair falling off out in the sink, and they stopped taking it. You said death of the follicle, which sounds very dramatic. Yeah. Are those fall are those little stem cell niches that reside in the follicle, which Hairs grow from are those then abolished, like, there's there's no going back, or can you one rescue the the hair?[0:53:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It takes months. If they're still there, the hair will come back. So the loss of the hair itself is a normal part of the hair cycle. So you have your antigen phase, your catagen phase, your phase and then your hair loss and[0:54:00] Andrew Huberman: then a new Of the stem cell niche in the in the hair follicle.[0:54:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Think think of it like sharks have teeth. So shark loses a tooth, and they have a new one that comes through. Or losing your baby tooth, and you have a new one. But your hair just always keeps coming through, so it's natural for it to die and lose. That's way that's why when you start 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, often you have a big shed.[0:54:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So what happens during that big shed is All of these cells that are unhealthy, they immediately jettison that hair, and they start making a much healthier new follicle. So out of the hairs that are in at the end of their telogen phase, then, they have what's called Telogen effluvium, which also happens after pregnancy, also happens in, thyroid pathologies. So you shed it, a new one comes in place, and you think that you're having a A horrible hair loss caused by your finasteride or whatever your whatever you're doing. And minoxidil does this too, but you're really just having a new healthier follicle. If you go a really long time, if you go a year, then those hairs might come back, and they might not.[0:55:03] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. So for, simplicity's sake, If somebody is concerned about or is experiencing hair loss, male or female, what are their options of, ways to offset that hair loss that are not going to negatively impact other tissues sensitive to DHT. And and what I'm what I'm basically saying here is, I can imagine taking a d a DHT inhibitor, a pill of some sort or an injection of some sort and Offsetting hair loss, maybe even stimulate more hair growth. It's clear that I'm not doing that, but but I know people that do, but then experience some of the other negative effects of Blunting DHT, reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions in, prostate function or or even, sexual function generally. So what could can people do if they wanna maintain or grow back hair, but they don't want all those other effects?[0:55:54] Andrew Huberman: What should they avoid, And what should they perhaps consider talking to their doctor about?[0:55:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's a whole host of options. I I try to separate alopecia or hair loss into 2 different categories. Male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia, also known as androgenetic alopecia, versus other types of alopecia, usually telogen effluviums. And if it's androgenetic alopecia or male male pattern baldness, Even if they're female, perhaps, say, PCOS, something like that, then you want some sort of strategy to decrease The activity of that androgen receptor.[0:56:31] Andrew Huberman: So women fall get male pattern baldness?[0:56:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Absolutely.[0:56:34] Andrew Huberman: Okay. I'm a I'm a have to wrap my head around that one, but okay.[0:56:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So There's a lot of different things that you can do that are topical. The most promising is called Dutasteride Mesotherapy. Essentially, what it is Is it's very localized injections in areas that are prone to male pattern baldness, whether they're female or a male, And it acts locally only, and you repeat these injections from time to time. It decreases the conversion of testosterone to DHT just in the scalp[0:57:04] Andrew Huberman: so that can avoid prostate effects. And what are some of the negative effects of of blocking DHT in, females in the periphery, meaning not in not on the scalp or in the brain. But where is DHT doing its stuff?[0:57:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So it's both DHT and then also that 5 alpha 3 alpha progesterone, which is called, THP or Dihydroprogesterone or tetrahydro trihydroprogesterone. So they're active in the central nervous system, but it's also just Active, again, binding to the androgen receptor in a female as well, causing them to have that effort feel good motivation. A lot of women that are sensitive to DHT, because women can be sensitive to DHT as well, feel very different when they start an oral contraceptive. Not because it Alters their DHT to a huge amount.[0:57:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It does to some degree because the negative feedback inhibition in the pituitary and less produced in the ovaries, But it increases SHBG really high. So because their SHBGs are significantly higher, their free DHT t is way lower. Let's see.[0:58:13] Andrew Huberman: How does a woman know if she has PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome? What are the issues with polycystic ovarian syndrome? What can be done about PCOS? I confess I was naive to PCOS. That wasn't supposed to rhyme, but since it does, I do confess I was completely naive to it, and I start getting a lot of questions about it in various forums.[0:58:35] Andrew Huberman: And I think that's that's actually the reason why I initially approached you. I know you, have treated a lot of PCOS. What age women, should be thinking about PCOS. What's PCOS? Tisha's about PCOS, please.[0:58:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome, And this is one of those conditions which is underdiagnosed. So its prevalence is much higher than we think it is. There's been a lot of studies, and some some studies say prevalence of 10%, some say 20%. It's not completely clinically penetrant.[0:59:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So most people don't know they have PCOS until they have infertility or subfertility. And is this[0:59:16] Andrew Huberman: is PCOS happening this frequency in 20 year old women and 30 year old women and 40 and onward. Most women find[0:59:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: out they have PCOS in their thirties, especially because it's it's on a spectrum or a continuum like a lot of things where you can have A weaker version or a very severe version, what are the symptoms? There's, criteria called the Rotterdam criteria. And in the Rotterdam criteria, there's a couple different ways that you can diagnose it. You're looking for androgen excess, insulin resistance, And you can also look for polycystic ovaries. You don't actually have to have polycystic ovaries or get an ultrasound of your ovaries to be diagnosed.[0:59:53] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If you have androgen excess, for example, androgenic acne or hormonal acne, if you have hair growth, like a hair growth on the chin, it's called, hirsutism. Or if you have, you know, like, deepening of the voice, any symptom of too much and male pattern baldness If you're a female, that's a a symptom of PCOS as well. Then you can also have insulin resistance. So this is obesity. It's prediabetes, A high fasting insulin, a HOMA IR over 2, a fasting insulin of over 6.[1:00:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you have Significant insulin resistance and also, androgen dominance, that's a sign of it. Androgen dominance often leads to what's called oligomenorrhea. So if you're having more than 35 day intervals in between a period or if you have less than 9 per year, Then that can be a sign that you have oligo, which means too little, menorrhea, which means menses. So that's a very common sign of PCOS. If you have infertility, so if you're under the age of 35 and you've been trying for more than a year or if you're over the age of 35 and you've been trying for more than 6 months, Then that can also be it's a very common presenting complaint when somebody presents with PCOS.[1:01:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And assuming that, a woman is doing, The[1:01:15] Andrew Huberman: all these other things is paying attention to the 6 pillars that we you talked about earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, in some cases. Right? Not everyone needs to be caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, and sunlight, spirit. Assuming that they're doing all those things, what other things in the realm of Diet or supplementation can help them avoid PCOS if they have subclinical PCOS or they have not developed it but don't want to develop it, because it doesn't sound like a good thing.[1:01:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So depending on where they are, if they're very strong on the insulin resistance spectrum, then, optimizing their body composition, decreasing their body fat, and treating that metabolic syndrome can help. So, a lot of people ask, well, does everybody that's on, like, does everybody need to be on Metformin that has PCOS? Not necessarily, but But metformin is one of the tools that can help with insulin sensitization. Other tools that can help are inositol.[1:02:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So myo inositol is an insulin sensitizer. Its, cousin D Chiroinostatol is a a weak anti androgen. A lot of types of inositol have both of those in it. So depending on if you're, A female or a male and you're on an inositol, the type of an inositol does matter.[1:02:33] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. This is a very important point. I I Just today, I said, I'm trying this new supplement, inositol, for its role in help, perhaps enhancing sleep even further. My sleep's generally pretty good. Lately, it's been a little bit off for a number of reasons.[1:02:48] Andrew Huberman: So I took it for the 1st time last night, and and I said, I I thought it helped, And, just subjectively and you said, what kind of inositol is it? Because inositol is a very potent androgen inhibitor. It turns out I was taking myo inositol, which is not an androgen inhibitor. The type the other type that you mentioned, which is an androgen inhibitor is?[1:03:09] Dr. Kyle Gillett: D Chiroinositol. Mhmm. It's usually in a ratio of 1 to 25 or 1 to 40 in a much lower amount[1:03:16] Andrew Huberman: Compared to myelinostotal? In a in a supplement or in the body?[1:03:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: In a supplement to help induce ovulation.[1:03:23] Andrew Huberman: But for Women who have PCOS who might want to try and reduce androgen, then they would perhaps want to take a form of anoceletol that reduce the androgen receptor activity. Correct?[1:03:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They want both. So if you're a woman and you've ever talked to your doctor about getting on the oral contraceptive or spironolactone, Receptive or spironolactone, which is also an anti androgen, but it happens to be a potassium sparing diuretic blood pressure medicine as well. D Cylinositol might be a better option. Dim or diendomethane is other another kind of weak anti estrogen, anti androgen that a lot of women should consider as well.[1:04:00] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned oral contraception. I've done a few posts, on These, let's just call them they they really are perceptual effects whereby, it's been demonstrated in humans several times now in in what I would appear to me to be very solid studies where, women that take, oral contraceptives, there is both a shift in their perception of Men, because these these studies only looked at heterosexual, the sort of arrangements here, where women who are on oral contraception, because it blunts some of the peaks and valleys of of hormone output, No longer, experience the same peaks and valleys in their assessment of other men's attractiveness, so it sort of flattens the The their perception, so to speak, they still find certain men attractive and certain men unattractive, but the the the the degree of difference is kind of mellowed out. And, likewise, men purse these data say that men perceiving women's attractiveness, They still see women on oral contraceptives as attractive, but they're a woman taking oral contraception eliminates This kind of peak in her attractiveness that men would otherwise perceive. In other words, oral contraceptives are changing the way that we perceive each other, at least in terms of these male female, experiments.[1:05:23] Andrew Huberman: What is going on with that? Is that because oral contraceptives Blunt the increase in testosterone that occurs just before ovulation, or is it because of a complex cascade? What what is going on? I find this fascinating.[1:05:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So There's differences in how your and I wouldn't use the word change necessarily, but alter the severity or alter the, peak, as you said. So it's just like TRT is not gonna change you as a person, an oral contraceptive will not change you as a person. It will just change your, day to day peaks and troughs in, libido and attractiveness. So one of the main effects of oral contraceptives, almost all of them have a synthetic estrogen and a synthetic progestogen in them.[1:06:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: One common type of synthetic estrogen is Ethinyl Estradiol. There is another new, synthetic estrogen that's out there as well, but That anecdotally, that seems to have even more side effects. So this ethinylestradiol is 100 times more potent than endogenous or bioidentical estradiol in the liver. So it binds to the estrogen receptor in the liver, And it's going to increase sex hormone binding globulin, which secondarily, as you mentioned, decreases your free testosterone and especially your free DHT. So that little testosterone pump that you get when you're a female that's ovulating, that's really flat lined, and it's already it's a pretty Insignificant difference.[1:06:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's not negligible, but it's a little bit of a hump. And you have significantly less of that when you're on a oral contraceptive.[1:07:03] Andrew Huberman: And does that blunt increase in libido that normally would occur from that increase in in androgen. Yes. Interesting. And what about other forms of contraception? Right?[1:07:13] Andrew Huberman: Because there are, There's copper IUD. There's, various implants. There's rings. There's a a huge number of of different, forms of these. So what we're talking about is, as I understand it, is only the effect of, oral contraception that impacts Hormone output.[1:07:32] Andrew Huberman: Is that is that correct?[1:07:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's a lot of other effects as well. For example, your choice of synthetic progestin will alter how high your platelets and SHBG go. It appears to be the higher your platelets and the higher your SHBG, The higher risk of a blood clot. So a lot of women know that if they're on a oral contraceptive and they're already predisposed to a blood clot or a venous thromboembolism, In their vein, they have a blood clot in either their leg or their lung, then it can increase that chance.[1:08:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So you can Choose a synthetic progestin that is not going to have as high of a response, but there's there's various pros and cons. Some Synthetic progestins are weak anti androgens as well. For example, there's there's one known as SLEND, which is made from spironolactone. So some women are on spironolactone and that as well, which is made from spironolactone, which probably isn't Particularly necessary unless they need it for a diuretic or hypertensive effect.[1:08:32] Andrew Huberman: I see. I I I'm just gonna, intentionally interrupt, and I apologize. But, specifically, because I wanted to ask about, there is this notion that, You know, that oral contraception taken over long periods of time can disrupt fertility in ways that are independent of just the, The age related decrease in in fertility. Is that true?[1:08:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It depends on what you mean by a long time. 6 to 12 months, it's possible. Past that, It seems very unlikely. However, the persistently elevated SHBG can be present for quite some time.[1:09:08] Andrew Huberman: Wait. So if If a woman takes oral contraception for 6 to 12 months and then stops, will she essentially be where she would have been anyway in terms of her fertility at that age, Or are you saying that it can cause permanent damage?[1:09:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Her fertility would be equitable as if she had never taken it, if she's Certainly 12 months, but probably 6 months off.[1:09:29] Andrew Huberman: And what is she, what I know of women that have taken oral contraception for many years are addition to the age related decline in fertility that occurs, that's inevitable. Of course, the slope is gonna be different depending on, the individual, but It it are they, quickening the, the transition to infertility? Probably not.[1:09:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You could make a case that because they've been in a oral contraceptive, they may have been slightly more predisposed to insulin resistance and or lower lean body mass. But that's Probably gonna be a negligible difference compared to their resistance training and also their caloric restriction or caloric maintenance.[1:10:13] Andrew Huberman: So there are also effects of having children.[1:10:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[1:10:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right? I mean, on all these parameters, right, because it's a severe it's a major lifestyle shift, right, that, obviously, people contend with and have first since the beginning of, human time anyway. I wanna ask some questions about male hormone therapy and male hormones generally. But before I do that, I I have a couple of burning questions that I get very often that I'm just gonna insert now.[1:10:43] Andrew Huberman: Marijuana. I've heard that it can decrease testosterone In men and women, I've heard that it can increase testosterone. Alcohol, I think there's general consensus that High alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake can does in fact reduce testosterone. What about modest increase of I'm not a drinker, so I'm not asking these questions for me. I don't smoke pot.[1:11:06] Andrew Huberman: I'm quite open. I've just never really liked, you know, marijuana or alcohol. They're not my thing. But Many people want to know the answers to these, and the the data that I've seen are very confused and conflicting. So what about marijuana?[1:11:19] Andrew Huberman: Does it reduce testosterone To a significant degree or not.[1:11:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Cannabinoids itself, whether it's THC or CBD, are not going to reduce testosterone by themselves. If it smokes marijuana, then it's very likely to increase your aromatase, which increases your estrogen. And, you know, that's gonna it's aromatizing from testosterone, so that is going to decrease testosterone. When you have an increased estrogen, like estradiol, That's gonna work on your pituitary to make less hormones that cause the release of of testosterone. So you're gonna have less LH and less FSH.[1:11:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it's almost kind of like, you know, opiates are well known to, opiate agonists. They're going to decrease LH and FSH and, subsequently, testosterone. Smoked marinara will as well. As far as alcohol, High alcohol will decrease testosterone as will any very potent GABA agonist, whether it's a barbiturate or a Benzodiazepine or a nonbenzo or alcohol. They're definitely going to.[1:12:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Moderate alcohol, I guess it depends on what your definition of that is. The the[1:12:29] Andrew Huberman: American like a like, I Some people I know that don't seem to be alcoholics, at least by my, you know, assessment, will have a glass or 2 of wine Four nights a week, which to me seems like a tremendous amount only because I don't like alcohol. I I don't have a problem with other people liking alcohol, but But I think many peep for many people, that would be considered low or or moderate intake.[1:12:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. I I would consider that low intake. The American Heart Association for men recommends between 1 2 drinks a day on average.[1:13:02] Andrew Huberman: They recommend it.[1:13:03] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So around 1 per week.[1:13:04] Andrew Huberman: Wait. So I'm making my heart less healthy by not drinking alcohol?[1:13:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. They they recommend a very low amount of alcohol intake for men. For women, they recommend 0 to 1. So that's kinda hard to interpret, 0 to 1. But the protective effect of Paul, especially if it's a red wine, with polyphenols in it, outweighs the deleterious effect.[1:13:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Interesting.[1:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Because I've seen some studies that point to the idea that even low intake of alcohol over a prolonged period of time might actually decrease Brain volume or at least volume of particular brain areas. But, of course, we don't know the consequence of of decreasing the volume of give of a given brain area either. I one can imagine it's decreasing the size of one's amygdala and making them less stressed, although there's no evidence to support that. I've been told that I need a drink many, many times, but I always reply that I don't need to drink anything in order to speak my mind. So, again, individual differences.[1:13:59] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. So it sounds like smoked marijuana may, in fact, reduce testosterone or at least increase the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. Yeah.[1:14:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Okay. And with alcohol and GABA agonist, It's important to remember that it shouldn't be daily. So 1 drink of alcohol a day is actually very mildly immunosuppressive. So it's better to have Two drinks of alcohol one day of the week and then 2 more drinks of alcohol another day of the week, and then no alcohol the rest of the time. The same could be said even for supplements that have GABA in them.[1:14:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A lot of sleep supplements have gamma aminobutyric acid, which[1:14:33] Andrew Huberman: is occasionally take oh, sorry to interrupt. I occasionally take[1:14:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's perfect. Okay. So there's a lot of sleep supplements that should not be taken daily, and GABA is one of them. Another one of them is Trazodone and and melatonin is kind of arguable, and it depends on the situation. But in general, if you're taking a sleep supplement, it should not be taken every night.[1:15:04] Andrew Huberman: The the sleep supplements that I understand are okay to take every night or nearly every night are things like magnesium threonate, Yes. Epigenin, if that's not true, correct me. I those are I certainly take them every night unless I forget them, in Yeah. Back home and I'm traveling.[1:15:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Magnesium is one of the exceptions. L theanine is also another exception.[1:15:24] Andrew Huberman: Great. Well, then, at least I haven't put anything into the world that's, that's wrong in that category, yet, And, hopefully, I won't. But if I do, I'll correct myself. So let's talk about testosterone in in males. There you see these, Headlines all the times now that testosterone levels are dropping, sperm counts are dropping, Phenotypes of men are changing over time, and and I can't quite follow the literature on that because, obviously, those are hard controlled experiments to do because techniques change over time and sensitivity of techniques change over time.[1:16:01] Andrew Huberman: But regardless, I I'm aware that a lot of People are considering increasing their testosterone by taking testosterone. That a few years ago, that was considered, you know, steroid use, and it was really extreme kind of stance. Nowadays, it seems like there's more discussion about it. 1st off, I'd like to know, does testosterone supplementation, and here, I'm talking about prescription from a doctor. Does it make one more prone to prostate cancer?[1:16:28] Andrew Huberman: That seems to always be the first question that comes out.[1:16:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. And there is a huge amount of misinformation about this too. So testosterone is not going to cause a prostate cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer, and testosterone will grow your prostate cancer. So if you're a 80 year old male and you have an autopsy, and there's at least a 50% chance that you have a prostate cancer, If you're 90 or a 100 years old, there's at least a 90% chance.[1:17:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So for humans with a prostate, it's only a matter of time until you get a prostate Answer. So that begs the question, do you wanna take something that's going to grow it for sure once you have it? So it's an individual assessment, and it's important to follow things like PSAs as well.[1:17:18] Andrew Huberman: So a PSA of of 4 or less, I mean, ideally, you wouldn't be at 4 because that's kind of the upper threshold is, the simplest readout of whether or not there's excessive prostate growth. There's benign prostate hyperplasia where the prostate is is growing, but, it's noncancerous. Correct? And then, of course, there are the symptomologies, like People have challenges with urination. They have sexual difficulties, etcetera.[1:17:42] Andrew Huberman: I'm always struck by the, correlation that people draw between testosterone and prostate health And the fact that or the I should say, the claim that testosterone makes prostate health worse, because if you think about it, young males have high testosterone Often, if not always, certainly often. And you don't see a lot of prostate overgrowth and cancer in young males. So something's going on here. How how should we conceptualize this?[1:18:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you have a PSA of 3.9 and You're a 25 year old male versus a 75 year old male, and you have a PSA of 5.9. The 3.9 PSA is significantly more concerning. So think of your prostate as taking cumulative damage from not only testosterone, but also estrogen and also growth hormone. So that's why obese Individuals have higher incidences of prostate cancer as well. It's because they don't have those cell checkpoints where, Your immune system takes a second and says, alright.[1:18:47] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Stop, replicating as fast prostate cells. Let's see if there's any atypical ones, and then it finds those, And it prevents them from reproducing. That's why immunotherapy and cancer is so promising is because they can target these certain things. So The older male is going to have that cumulative damage happen already, and, arguably, prostate cancer is a normal, you know, it with aging, you know, a fast aging is abnormal. Very slow aging is normal.[1:19:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's a fine line to walk between those 2, but there's a lot of things that can be done to decrease the turnover, Decrease the inflammation and decrease the congestion of the prostate over time. There's also a lot more than just PSAs that can be done. There's prostate MRIs and things like that They can look at the structure and the function of the prostate.[1:19:41] Andrew Huberman: So what should every male do to maintain the health of their prostate? And I realized that younger males probably aren't thinking about it at all. Although, it Seems like nowadays, I get these kind of what I call, cryptic questions. You know? I think women are more comfortable talking about their hormone and sexual health because of they they cycle, you know, because of menstrual cycles, they're used to fluctuations that a lot that sort of give them the experience of what it's like to have different levels of progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, etcetera.[1:20:06] Andrew Huberman: I get these kind of cryptic questions often in my direct messages, where what I think people are asking is, You know, what is there something wrong with my prostate? What should I do for my prostate? These are often indirect questions for other aspects of their life where they're suffering, but, and I don't say that, in jest. I I I think, more direct discussion would be great. So, what should All males do to main to maintain, prostate health throughout the lifespan.[1:20:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Maintaining prostate health can be looked at similarly how you can maintain a good natural optimal testosterone. So you look for things that can hurt it. You don't necessarily look for one thing that can improve it or boost it. So for young males, those are prostatitis. So, it goes hand in hand with epididymitis, So different infections of the prostate.[1:20:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The younger the male is, the more likely it is related to something that could be sexually transmitted. But another very common cause is what we call gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. The prostate is Right by the end of the colon. So if you have chronic constipation or if you have colitis Or, if you have you know, even just an E coli overgrowth in the colon is very likely to cause an infection of the prostate as well.[1:21:27] Andrew Huberman: What should males do to to prevent that?[1:21:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Have a diet that has good healthy prebiotic fiber, probiotics as well. Make sure that they're having regular bowel movements, that they don't have chronic constipation, have good sources of dietary fiber, which is also soluble fiber, and enough insoluble fiber. Most people get enough insoluble or nondietary fiber. So that can help prevent the chance of Diverticulitis, which is another type of infection. It can also decrease the chance of colitis and decrease the chance of prostate infections as well.[1:22:02] Andrew Huberman: Are there any foods and or supplements that men should take or avoid? What about you hear about saw palmetto. Yeah. Supplements for or, supplements that support or cause issues for the prostate.[1:22:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. If there's a strong genetic predisposition to enlarged prostates or even just really early prostate cancers that grow fast, Then they could consider taking saw palmetto or even curcumin as an antiandrogen as long as they're able to tolerate it. It's an individualized basis and depends on their History. As far as, making sure that their prostate is not congested, there's an interesting correlation between Having girls and having prostate[1:22:48] Andrew Huberman: cancer Having girl off[1:22:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So if your if your offspring are females, then you're slightly more likely to have prostate cancer. There is some, there's hypotheses that link estrogen to prostate Answer, rather than testosterone. So if you have hypereestrogenism, your prostate, has more atypical cells. In general, the higher your c reactive protein, which is a general marker of inflammation in your body, we call it CRP, And the test order is h s CRP or high sensitivity CRP.[1:23:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If your CRP, raises up very high, if you have an autoimmune disease, Like, if you have a Crohn's flare or if you have, lupus or an infection or a sexually transmitted infection Or even, colitis or even the flu. Your CRP is gonna raise significantly.[1:23:40] Andrew Huberman: That you would detect in a blood test, of course.[1:23:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So you wanna get a baseline CRP when you haven't had any of those things recently. And if your CRP is higher, you also have more female offspring. If your CRP is higher than your reactive oxygen species, which are causing mutations and atypical Cell turnover in the prostate are also likely higher, so you wanna keep a very low CRP.[1:24:05] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. And, what about blood flow and Pelvic floor in general. We should probably do a whole episode on pelvic floor. You know, there's so much interesting, data coming out of the the fields of clinical and research urology. I realize it's kind of the Netherlands of of, biology and medicine.[1:24:20] Andrew Huberman: People probably aren't thinking so much about this, but pelvic floor is obviously a, a confluence of a ton of of vasculature, of nerves, and, of course, the prostate resides there, and, of course, the genitals and, reside there as well. So I would imagine that the one of the 6 pillars, you know, exercise, being able to maintain adequate blood flow To those regions is key. What about just postural things? People sitting too much, not, hydrating well enough. You mentioned avoiding constipation.[1:24:51] Andrew Huberman: What are some other things including medications that can serve to support the prostate over time and maybe even support pelvic floor in general both in males and females over time?[1:25:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Absolutely. And this is something that's rightfully getting more and more attention. The way I explain the pelvic floor is your abdominal cavity, which includes your peritoneum where most of your organs are, your retroperitoneum, your pelvic space, think of it as a box, and your abs are the front of the box. Your back muscles are the back. Your diaphragm is the top of the box, and your pelvic floor, that's where your port is to the outside world.[1:25:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Especially important, it has muscles as well, you can do exercises. Elvic floor physical therapists are becoming more and more utilized, especially after childbirth, but in other situations as well, including by men getting care from urologists. So you want to both strengthen that pelvic floor and make sure that The tubes that are docked to the outside world are working well enough, but they're not too loose. They're not working too well. So there's a lot of medications that can be, positives or negatives for your pelvic floor.[1:26:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: We kinda talked about your gut and colon health in general. As far as your prostate health and as far as your, bladder and urinary system health, You think about a couple different classes. So you have your phosphodiesterases. You have your tadalafil. Basically, this is gonna help decrease congestion in the prostate.[1:26:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A lot of people take it for ED, But it can actually help you decrease your Did you define that? A lot of men take tadalafil. It's generic as Cialis. Has a much longer half life than Viagra Erlofetra, its half life is almost a day. So you can take a very low dose of it.[1:26:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Instead of taking 20 milligrams, you take 2 or 2 and a half milligrams.[1:26:41] Andrew Huberman: So they're taking You're saying that a lot of men take it for erectile dysfunction[1:26:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes.[1:26:45] Andrew Huberman: But that it at lower doses, it may have served purposes for prostate health independent of of erection.[1:26:53] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. The most common scenario is if a male is waking up twice at night to pee, On average, it'll cut that down to once. So if they're waking up 4 times at night, then it can cut that down to twice at night just because you have Easier blood flow. We used to use other medications like Flomax, which is Tamsulosin. That's an alpha antagonist, so it basically binds to a receptor and smooth muscle, and it helps relax that.[1:27:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's several other alpha antagonists. And then you also have your medications that are hormonal like finasteride a lot of people take for prostate health to decrease the enlargement of the prostate. The periurethral area or periurethral lobe. There are several lobes of the prostate. That tends to be especially enlarged in cases of BPH.[1:27:39] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And B BPH? Prostate hyperplasia or an enlarged prostate. And if you are able to shrink that area, then, at that point, it's just a plumbing problem, and the urine is able to get by easier.[1:27:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. My understanding is that now there's a, A growing I don't wanna say a movement, but, take the idea of taking very low dose, like 2.5 milligram or 5 milligram Tadalafil, Even daily is becoming pretty common for many men who do not have erectile dysfunction simply to Either maintain or enhance prostate health. Is that is that correct?[1:28:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. That's correct.[1:28:18] Andrew Huberman: And are there, do you see any negative effects of doing that?[1:28:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There can be negative effects. It can lower blood pressure. So, theoretically, it can increase your chance of vasovagal syncope. A lot of people take it As a alternative to pump, because it kinda works similarly to citrulline, or a different pump products and pre workout, And it can certainly help with that. But if you're about to go do a deadlift where you might pass that anyway, it can certainly increase the chance that that happens Because you don't have that compensatory exercise hypertension response.[1:28:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Could someone just take it away from exercise? They could. If you took Tadalafil, then it's that's gonna be has a long half life. Whereas Viagra and Levitra is just a few hours. Tadalafil is almost today.[1:29:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Some interesting studies on Viagra have been done as well. It can potentially alter your rays and cones in your eye. So the usual recommendation for pilots that need to have red, green discrimination from very long distances with very small Indicator lights is to not take, Viagra. So I usually say if you're if you're a pilot and that's your profession, Perhaps hold off from that for a while. There's also studies with Viagra that significantly which is also known as Sildenafil as the generic now.[1:29:38] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It can increase eyebrow hair growth. So, potentially, what it does is it helps vasodialy and relax the veins, especially in older men. And when those veins are relaxed, you have better blood flow. That's one of the proposals or theories behind why Older men get the androgenetic alopecia more. You're having less blood flow in the scalp.[1:30:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So, theoretically, it can also help prevent that. So it's the, in[1:30:05] Andrew Huberman: theory, increasing blood oh, because it increases blood flow, systemically throughout the body Yeah. Not just in in, specific tissues. Well, I find it incredibly interesting that, yeah, there are these online forums building up now around, low dose tadalafil, daily use of low dose Tadalafil, again, not for, sexual or erectile dysfunction, but for sake of of long term prostate health. It is there any reason why women might want to take low dose tadalafil?[1:30:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Tadalafil is also A weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind of like L carnitine where the density of the available androgen receptors to bind Increases slightly. So there could potentially be, a benefit from that, but, most of the time, it's used in men. Very interesting.[1:30:57] Andrew Huberman: We haven't really talked about testosterone and optimizing testosterone in males. Assuming someone is paying attention to the 6 pillars, There's a a kind of a gap as I see it between doing all those things and TRT, hormone replacement therapy. And, again, the the r, the replacement in TRT is a little bit of a, in quotes nowadays, because a lot of people who, have testosterone in that 300 to 900 nanogram per deciliter range Opt to take low dose testosterone anyway. My understanding is that, there have been some new kind of movements in this area toward, for instance, Not doing big, large doses in, injected, infrequently, but rather low doses quite frequently. Obviously, prescribed by a doctor, monitored by a doctor, etcetera.[1:31:49] Andrew Huberman: Is that generally what you like to see in your patients if they're gonna take this route?[1:31:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If they're a hypogonadal patient whose benefits outweigh risks of TRT, then you wanna have a nice even steady state. It's not gonna be exactly the same as producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously, from your own body. When you have a steady state, you don't have a peak or a trough. And when you have a peak, that's when the androgen receptor gene is overactive. That's when you get more erythropoietin or EPO release, And that leads to a lot of the side effects of thick blood, so higher hemoglobins and hematocrits.[1:32:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And then, when you have a crash, You don't feel good. So it's, definitely not optimal. There's a lot of ways to get around this. So when you're doing testosterone replacement, you're someone that needs it, you can have different types of esters or you could do topical testosterone. So the ester is basically something that's attached to increase the biological half life.[1:32:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The most common ones are scipionate and anthate. There's also a very short acting which has almost no clinical relevance. And there's also very long acting ones, decannoyate and undecannoyate, and different mixtures of all those. So if you're someone who has a very, very low SHBG, you're gonna have trouble of regulating your serum testosterone in the long run. If you do it topically and the testosterone is absorbed, hopefully bound to SHBG, and then a lot of times you reapply twice daily or once daily, But you have lots of variations.[1:33:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So for most people, especially for people who can't absorb it well, that's not gonna be a great option.[1:33:33] Andrew Huberman: So injections would be preferred?[1:33:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Most people end up injecting because they have either side effects from too high, too low, or just too much of a varied dose when they do topical. There's also a capsule with a special lymphatic absorption, so it's not being absorbed through the liver. It's not hepatically metabolized, but it's absorbed through the lymph. And it's essentially the testosterone undecanoate and then put into a capsule. So, and that's taken twice daily.[1:34:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It has fairly steady half lives, but you have to take it at specific times of the day. So, that being said and it it's new enough to where there isn't a huge amount of data on it, but it is FDA approved. So it is it is brand name now. It's called Jotenzo. But, the injectables, in general, the lower your SHBG, the longer of an ester you want.[1:34:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Because when you inject it, whether it's intramuscular or subcutaneous, just talk to your doctor about the risks and the benefits of those. Subcutaneous has slightly longer active half life because the esterases Take longer to reach that scipinate or an antheaster cleavage. So most men, a lot of people ask me about, like, what a usual dose is. For most people, it would be a total of about 100 to 120 per week for an actual replacement dose. Milligrams?[1:34:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Milligrams. 1 20 to one 100 milligrams per week administered 2 to 3 times per week.[1:34:56] Andrew Huberman: And you're not so you're saying dividing that into 2 or Right? Because I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there thinking, oh, yeah. A 103 times a week, which is actually quite quite high dose. Yeah. There there really does seem to be a shift in, toward, spreading these, dosages out into you know, dividing them into 2 or 3 smaller doses.[1:35:13] Andrew Huberman: And then, along those lines, 5, 10 years ago, it was common to hear about inhibiting estrogen through aromatase inhibitors. Nowadays, you hear and I think it's, True, at least by my read of the literature, that that inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues, and even can cause, reductions in libido. So a lot of, people think that estrogen if if you crash estrogen, That, basically, libido goes up, but, actually, the opposite is often true. You don't want estrogen too high or too low. Is that correct?[1:35:46] Andrew Huberman: And for that reason, do you, Shy away from people taking aromatase inhibitors. Yeah. Very few people truly need an aromatase inhibitor. There's almost always lifestyle interventions. It can just depend on which gene, how active[1:36:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: your aromatase gene is. Some people's aromatase gene is very active. A lot of times, these individuals have, pubertal gynecomastia, which is, breast tissue growth in males even despite no other risk factor.[1:36:18] Andrew Huberman: Eve even if they're lean?[1:36:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Some people get it if they're lean. I remember growing up, there[1:36:23] Andrew Huberman: were a few kids that got, mild cases of gynecomastia that were transient. Like, they it's sort of like they developed gynecomastia, and then it went away.[1:36:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Often, it's unilateral on one side too. So growth hormone, a lot of times, is the, Fuel to that fire.[1:36:38] Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. There were a couple kids. I mean, they they took some teasing, because back then, it, There wasn't online discussions about hormones and things like that, but then it it would seem transient.[1:36:47] Andrew Huberman: And they were the the people I'm thinking of were actually lean individuals, they they weren't overweight, which, of course, can cause gynecomastia because, adipose fat tissue can convert testosterone into estrogen. So it sounds like, except in special cases, that, avoiding aromatase inhibitors is probably gonna be a good idea.[1:37:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's several other ways that you can control your estrogen and keep it at a healthy level, which you do have to check. There's a lot of patients who, sure mean that their estrogen is going to be sky high, and it's actually very low and vice versa. But, calcium D glucarate is a supplement that can help with Estrogen control. What's a typical dosage of calcium?[1:37:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Do you Glucarate? 500 to 1,000 milligrams.[1:37:28] Andrew Huberman: But is there the risk that if someone's estrogen is in normal range and they take The supplement that their estrogen will go too low, is it that potent?[1:37:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's not that potent. It's not near as potent as an aromatase inhibitor, so it helps with Excretion and also the sensitivity of the estrogen receptor itself, and it kinda, like, helps outcompete it. Some people also take dim or, different cruciferous vegetable. They get them from cruciferous vegetables like kale, But, or broccoli. And that is both an antiestrogen and an antiandrogen.[1:38:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you're on TRT and you're on that, then you're probably just on too much TRT.[1:38:09] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I remember a few years ago, I had a friend and, truly, this is a it's not like I had a I have a friend thing, because I'm very cautious about which supplements I take. I think people might get the impression that I'm very cavalier about this, but I'm not. I always alter one thing at a time. I talk to physicians.[1:38:22] Andrew Huberman: I I you know, what I suggest other people do, I actually do and have done for a long period of time. And I recall, wanting to take DIM because I thought, well, you know, back then, you hear, okay. Reduce estrogen. My estrogen levels weren't out of range, so they were fine. But I thought, well, what what would the experience be of bringing those down?[1:38:38] Andrew Huberman: But someone I know is quite informed in this area. I said, yeah. Exactly what you said, which is that DIM can reduce estrogen, but also testosterone. So I just never opted to try and take it. I do want we're sort of airing in this direction, but we went straight from the 6 pillars to TRT or to what some people now call sports TRT, which is Basically, code language for saying, taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need it to get into a Semi superphysiological range or a, high end, like, 900 to a 1000 nanogram per deciliter range.[1:39:12] Andrew Huberman: And people always point out, I I should mention that, oh, well, in certain countries, the high end range is 1200 nanograms per deciliter. In the US, it's 900. And so if you're 1200, are you really super physiological? All that aside, I neglected to ask about that gap in between where individuals could think about supplementation, meaning nonprescription approaches to increasing testosterone. And here, we should probably also talk about things like, is it true that ice baths increase testosterone or not?[1:39:40] Andrew Huberman: Lifestyle factors that go beyond the 6 pillars for increasing testosterone. If you could comment on those, that would be terrific, supplements that are useful. And it'd be wonderful, if you can mention where some of these same practices and supplements might be useful for women as well as men to increase testosterone for all the reasons we talked about earlier.[1:39:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So this is where a true individualized approach comes in. When you're talking about what dose of TRT you should be on, One thing to keep in mind is the law of diminishing returns. Quality of life is a subjective thing, and it's different for each person. So some people are more willing to give up, a little bit of athleticism or body composition.[1:40:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Some people are more willing to give up or not willing to give up Libido or sexual health. And as we mentioned earlier, everybody's androgen receptor is less or more sensitive. So you can make a case that if somebody's androgen receptor is half as sensitive as somebody else, The 1 the person with the less sensitive receptor does need a level of 1,000 or 1200. There's no great way to know that. And you can alter the sensitivity of our androgen receptor are things like L Carnitine and Tadalafil as mentioned.[1:40:52] Andrew Huberman: And we'll definitely come back to L Carnitine because I'm, Really intrigued by the data on L Carnitine both for women and men in terms of egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, and a bunch of other interesting effects. So we'll we'll come back to L Carnitine.[1:41:05] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But a lot of how you feel, the biofeedback or subjective, I feel like this, comes from the ratio of your androgens to your estrogens, And a lot of that is lifestyle. So if someone's also on HCG, that could upregulate aromatase as well in HCG.[1:41:21] Andrew Huberman: You might wanna just, Human, chorionic gonadotropin Yeah. Found used to be found in pregnant is still found in pregnant women's urine.[1:41:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Still found in[1:41:28] Andrew Huberman: pregnant women's urine. Believe it or not, there was a black market for pregnant women's urine Yeah. Before it would this stuff was developed synthetically. So in other words, what we're saying is, men typically would buy pregnant women's urine[1:41:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes.[1:41:42] Andrew Huberman: Through, black markets in order to get the HCG, In order to get the testosterone enhancing effects of HCG so in other words, men were using pregnant women's urine for HCG. I do not wanna know how they they got it into their body. Let's just skip to what you were gonna say next instead.[1:41:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So that's HCG. There's a lot of other things that upregulate estrogen. Alcohol Significantly increases aromatase. So if you're very sensitive to estrogen, then you probably shouldn't even consume the 2 glasses 3 times a week.[1:42:13] Dr. Kyle Gillett: High fat meals also upgraded in aromatase. So if you're on a ketogenic diet, but you have Hyperestrogenism, then you should take care with that as well.[1:42:23] Andrew Huberman: All kinds of fats or just saturated fats?[1:42:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I'm not sure if it's just saturated fats, But fat definitely increases, both fat in your body and consumption of a high amount of calories increases.[1:42:35] Andrew Huberman: So the it's the ratio of testosterone to estrogen. I don't wanna break your flow, but that but since we're talking about fat, I have to ask, since estrogen and testosterone are both synthesized from the cholesterol molecule, I've heard that ingesting some amount of saturated fat can be useful because of the way that cholesterol can, serve as a precursor to these molecules. Now I once said, on a podcast that I like butter so much, I occasionally eat pats of butter. Somehow, that got, misinterpreted to mean that I eat entire many pats of butter. I'm talking like 1 or 2 pats of butter here and there, and I have no guilt or shame about it.[1:43:08] Andrew Huberman: My blood lipids are in great Shape also, so I feel good. But, is it possible that people who are ingesting too little of saturated fats could, directly or indirectly, reduce or somehow disrupt the proper ratio of testosterone to estrogen in men and women?[1:43:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's theoretically possible, but it probably doesn't happen in developed countries. Just like it's theoretically possible to have Not enough omega 6 fatty acids, but that probably does not happen in developed countries.[1:43:38] Andrew Huberman: So I don't need the butter pats, but, I'm gonna do it anyway. I'm just curious.[1:43:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Okay. Grass fed butter has good omega three content as well. So, grass fed foods in general, You know, it's not the end all, be all, and everybody doesn't need grass fed foods, but they are one of the only sources of healthy trans fat. So A naturally occurring trans fat comes from ruminants. So ruminants, I think of, like, cows.[1:44:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And, this the rumination in the different stomachs can change your omega 3 and omega 6 to transglenolinic and translinoleic fatty acids.[1:44:16] Andrew Huberman: Which are healthy for us.[1:44:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So it's it's actually omega threes and omega sixes That just happened to have a trans instead of a cis isomer.[1:44:24] Andrew Huberman: So, and these healthy, trans fats would be found in, ruminant cheese and milk and butter from ruminants and or the meats and the meats?[1:44:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. Uh-huh.[1:44:35] Andrew Huberman: So and for people who are following a purely plant based diet or or mostly plant based diet. Are they at risk of not getting enough of certain types of fats or other nutrients to maintain that healthy ratio of testosterone to estrogen or not.[1:44:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If they're a vegetarian, they're probably not at risk. If they're a vegan, they very well could be at risk. Most vegans are aware of this, very acutely, and they'll supplement with, you know, algae or they'll supplement with other sources of, healthy fats. I see.[1:45:07] Andrew Huberman: So the takeaway that I'm I'm drawing from this is that Less so than getting saturated fat, it's key to get these healthy trans fats from, ruminants[1:45:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes.[1:45:19] Andrew Huberman: Or the food products of those ruminants as well as, to get proper, amounts of omega threes. Yeah.[1:45:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And to be clear, you don't need any trans fats. It just happens that those omega threes and omega sixes are in a trans isomer.[1:45:33] Andrew Huberman: I see. Okay. So that's nutrition. What other supplements can support healthy testosterone to estrogen ratios?[1:45:39] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Anything that alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone to estrogen. And, your testosterone to estrogen ratio, think about it as How much estrogen activity do you have at the beta estradiol receptor and your alpha estradiol receptor? How would I know that? So, it it's hard to tell, but depending on what you're eating, if you have a lot of plant based diets or polyphenols, many of these are beta estradiol receptors. People know about Tergesterone and also beta echterone, which are 2 echteroids that are beta estradiol receptor Agonists.[1:46:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So they activate the beta estradiol receptor. So if you have a very low amount of estrogen naturally, you're probably a better candidate for it.[1:46:25] Andrew Huberman: Taking to, Terkesterone or Echostaren Echostaren. Echostaren. I've never tried them, but I know, my understanding is that they work Tremendously well for some people Yeah. And not at all for others, and so one just simply has to try. But in, in promoting the activity of this Estrogen receptor, is there a risk that Tergesterone or Echterone could cause some of the, quote, unquote problems associated with increasing estrogen activity, Like, reduced libido, water retention.[1:46:52] Andrew Huberman: Water water retention?[1:46:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yes. Reduced libido? Probably not. Closing growth plates in the bone? No.[1:47:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Because that's the alpha estradiol receptor.[1:47:03] Andrew Huberman: I've talked before on a couple of podcasts About, Tonga Ali in, which is this Indonesian herb, I guess, is also, man made and found in Malaysia, but it seems to be the Indonesian, variety of Tonga Ali that's most effective for potentially for reducing sex hormone and binding globulin and thereby freeing up testosterone. Whether or not the effects are through that pathway, through another pathway, a lot of people report improvements in things like libido and maybe, androgen like, phenotypes. Right? Feeling more vital, etcetera. And, of course, some of that could be placebo.[1:47:39] Andrew Huberman: Correct? But what are your thoughts on Tonga Ali? And please challenge my statements about Tonga Ali if they're incorrect. I'm I'm not looking for validation here. I just really wanna know what your thoughts are on it.[1:47:50] Andrew Huberman: Do you ever, I'll recommend it to patients, when, men, women, 1 or the other.[1:47:56] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So Tongkat Ali or long jack It has multiple mechanisms of action, and there have been several, placebo controlled studies on it. Some of them show decrease in SHBG. At least one of them did not show any change in SHBG. However, it is it does act on aromatase Very weakly.[1:48:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Probably not so strongly that you would have to be concerned of hypoestrogenism. Mhmm.[1:48:20] Andrew Huberman: So re it it reduces aromatase and thereby Can reduce estrogen. Correct. Okay.[1:48:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's also a weak it's not a serum, so it's not a selective estrogen receptor modifier, but it's probably a weak. It's probably an as well or a nonselective estrogen receptor modifier, and that should help with decreasing negative feedback inhibition of estradiol in various locations and also increasing testosterone. Interesting.[1:48:48] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The dosage that I've been using for years now is, I think it's 400 milligrams taken once a day, Typically, early in the day because it can kind of have a mild stimulant effect, very mild. And I know that some of the products out there recommend dosages that are much higher. Anytime I've taken more than 400, I don't feel very good. I don't know how to describe it other than it's just a little over like, stimulatory in terms of makes me kind of, like drinking too much coffee.[1:49:15] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[1:49:16] Andrew Huberman: So that's that's interesting. And so would women ever wanna take Tonga Ali for any reason?[1:49:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Absolutely. So there's a lot of women that have hyperestrogenism. And unlike adrenal fatigue or andropause, there's actually ICD 10 codes for hypereestrogenism. ICD 10 codes?[1:49:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's doctor speak.[1:49:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Right? So there there's codes to where your doctor can actually diagnose you something. So if you go to your doctor and you say, I have adrenal fatigue, they can't diagnose you with that. Or if you say I have andropause, they also can't diagnose you with that. But if you say you have hyperestrogenism, the most common complaint that comes with it is endometriosis, which is overgrowth of the lining of the uterus.[1:50:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And, those people could potentially I think that's one, area where we might see Tongkat supplementation More and more because not only does it decrease aromataste. Like we mentioned, testosterone in females is higher than estrogen in females. Mhmm. So a lot of females get estrogen from aromatization as well. Peripheral estrogen is sometimes what we call it because it's not directly produced in the ovaries, but they could be good candidates for Tongkat if that's the case.[1:50:27] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. And and my understanding is that people should be looking for sources of Indonesian Tongkat Ali in particular.[1:50:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct.[1:50:33] Andrew Huberman: Right.[1:50:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Another interesting application is essentially a I'll call it a PCT, but, essentially, what that means is PCT means how define it as post cycle therapy.[1:50:44] Andrew Huberman: Physicians love acronyms. Scientists love acronyms. Military love acronyms, but we yeah. ECT, post cycle therapy. So this would be peep people coming off hormone therapy or steroids.[1:50:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: This would actually be for women that are coming off of their birth control pill. Because perhaps it can help lower that SHBG back to normal, which is sometimes persistently elevated, and then it can help prevent the subsequent hyperestrogenism that happens.[1:51:05] Andrew Huberman: Does Tonga Ali need to be cycled? When I first started taking it, I would cycle it. I would do a few 3, 4 months, and I would take some time off. Now I've just been taking it continuously for years. And my and I should say I do blood work to check my liver enzymes and everything else, and, you know, I don't see any reason to to for me to cease taking it.[1:51:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Probably not. There's been human studies on both Tongkat and Fidosia. And full disclosure, I did help design Derek's new Testosterone optimization supplement, which has both Fadoja arrestris and also Tongkat Ali in it.[1:51:38] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Let's talk about Fadoja separately in a moment. But If let's say someone is only taking Tonga Ali for whatever reason Mhmm. Do they need to cycle off?[1:51:48] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Likely not, but I would just to be safe because it does both affect your aromatase, and it's an estrogen receptor Modifier.[1:51:57] Andrew Huberman: And and what, what would be a reasonable, cycle off? So how long to take and how long to to stop before taking again?[1:52:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's a couple different protocols that you can do, but 11 months on, 1 month off for Tomcat is pretty reasonable. Now this I guess this is we'll talk about this later too, but if it's combined with Fidosia, the protocol that I would do is 3 weeks on, 1 week off.[1:52:22] Andrew Huberman: So that's Tonga Ali. What I'm curious what your thoughts are on Fadogia agrestis, this Nigerian Shrub or this, extract from Nigerian shrubs that Yeah. At least in my experience, in my read of the literature, has the potential To increase testosterone and probably other hormones as well by way of increasing luteinizing hormone, something that we haven't really talked about much up until now. What are your thoughts about Fidogia Agrestis? What are your ideas about the proposed mechanism or mechanisms?[1:52:52] Andrew Huberman: And, where might this be useful for people on or off hormone replacement therapy?[1:53:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Fidosia Agrestis has Just reached a point where we have enough evidence till we know it probably helps both with hormone which stimulates leydic cells in the testes to produce more testosterone and probably with, LH receptor sensitivity as well, which is a good combination of the 2. It does come from the Nigerian shrub, but, there is not quite enough evidence For me to be able to say, it's safe for somebody to take this all the time, which, again, full disclosure. That's why I recommended that we, recommended for people to cycle this supplement. So 3 weeks on, 1 week off, That's likely safe.[1:53:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The only toxicity studies, in general are in rats. And in humans, it looks quite safe.[1:53:51] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that the toxicity, studies in rats showed, toxicity to the testicular cells, so that's certainly concerning, but that the dosages that were used, or translating the dosages used to humans, would lead to a situation where the dosages that humans would have to take would be very, very large. So the the amount of, I no longer take Fidogia, but I I took it at 600 milligrams per day for a long time. And I ceased taking it because, I was experimenting with other things, and I didn't wanna confound, those things, not because I had any negative side effects. In fact, I was monitoring blood work and and other by biological parameters that would would have told me if there was testicular toxicity, and there wasn't. Let's put it that way.[1:54:36] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. I think it's extremely safe, and, I'm I'm just not convinced that there's enough overwhelming evidence for a long term consistent, administration.[1:54:48] Andrew Huberman: So, do you recommend this to people who are not taking TRT, and do you recommend to men and women?[1:54:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So If you have a really high LH, then there's probably a gonadal issue, whether it's heat damage to the testes of varicoseal, a history of testicular cancer where your LH is, gonna be higher. So if your LH is already very high, increasing it even more is probably not gonna help. However, if your LH is low, then obviously try to find out if is it low. Is it deficient, or is it just a little bit low?[1:55:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If it's low and you don't have an issue with prolactin, you don't have an issue with, opioid receptor antagonism, the naltrexone can actually potentially help Antagonize that to increase LH as well, especially in people recovering from, opiates or likely even alcohol. So you're looking for a subclinical secondary hypogonadism, which is essentially just think of that as low LH. So in people with that Lower LH and their estrogen is fine and their prolactin is fine, then Fidosia is a particularly good option.[1:55:51] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. So 3 weeks on, 1 week off for, for 600 milligrams Fidogia, 400 milligrams Tonga Ali Indonesian Tonga Ali Yeah. Could potentially be be good. And, of course, everyone should always check with their physician, clear this, do blood work, etcetera. I always say, we don't just say that to protect us.[1:56:09] Andrew Huberman: We say that to protect you, meaning that the the consumer, is very, very important. You don't wanna get, you don't wanna fly blind with any of this stuff. You want blood work. Right?[1:56:20] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's the catch 22 with supplements is most of them are safer than medications, but the only difference between them and a medication is one's prescribed and one's not.[1:56:28] Andrew Huberman: And oftentimes with supplements, it's unclear whether or not what's listed on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle. But Yeah. But I think there are a number of reputable brands now. The, the other supplement I wanna talk about in terms of testosterone augmentation is boron. What is boron thought to do?[1:56:46] Andrew Huberman: Does it actually do that? And, do you ever recommend boron?[1:56:50] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So boron is actually an element, and you can find it on the periodic table. It's A more plentiful and rich soils. So frequent farming can deplete the soils of boron. It's very plentiful in the Mediterranean area like Greece and Turkey.[1:57:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So a lot of people will just eat dates or raisins that are grown there. I thought you[1:57:10] Andrew Huberman: were gonna tell me people eat dirt. But there are people who eat dirt.[1:57:12] Dr. Kyle Gillett: People who eat dirt.[1:57:13] Andrew Huberman: There's a phenomenon, called pica, right, where Yeah. People, in a and that's not a good thing. They they[1:57:19] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Often assign an iron deficiency. Okay.[1:57:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. But they're they're eating grapes and dates that were grown in soil that has high amounts of Boron.[1:57:26] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Is that right? Yep. So boron can help regulate SHBG, but its effect is mostly acute. So it's Unlikely to have a bad effect, so a lot of people take boron because it's probably not gonna hurt, and, it will lower SHBG even if it is for a short period of time. So I guess you could make a case that maybe cycline boron can help too.[1:57:48] Andrew Huberman: What sorts of dosages are are useful for boron supplementation?[1:57:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: 3 to 6 milligrams once to twice a day.[1:57:55] Andrew Huberman: Oh, interesting. So that's higher than the amounts that I I've, been taking. I've I've long been doing this cocktail of Of, Tonga Ali, again, I stopped taking Fidogia, but, for a long time with Fidogia and and boron, I think it was 2 to 4 milligrams per day, but maybe I could for it to go higher, although my blood work is where I want it, thankfully. So circling back to Fidogia. Fidogia, was attractive to me as a supplement because I saw increases in LH, testosterone, and free testosterone.[1:58:23] Andrew Huberman: My estrogen stayed in check, But I also did not see a downregulation of LH when I would cycle off, whereas with HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, which, does now arrive in, in forms not from pregnant women's urine only, but The synthetic forms that people inject, that, as I understand it, can actually suppress hormone out endogenous hormone output if one takes it for a long period of time. So why would A man or woman want to take HCG, and what are the potential risks and benefits of taking HCG?[1:58:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin is actually very similar to TSH.[1:59:04] Andrew Huberman: Thyroid simulating hormone?[1:59:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. So, when a woman is pregnant, She produces more HCG, especially in the 1st trimester. When you take a pregnancy test, whether it's qualitative or quantitative, You see the HCG rise, and it actually doubles every 48 hours. So, if you're 5 weeks pregnant, you can get a HCG level. And then 2 days later, 5 weeks 2 days, you can see your HCG, and maybe it went from 500 to a1000.[1:59:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it precipitously increases. It does a few things. One thing is it prevents hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia of pregnancy, which is one of the most Common causes of miscarriage. It's also why if you are, if you have hypothyroidism and you get pregnant In the 1st trimester, you wanna increase your dose from 25 to 40% to keep your free t four high as much as possible. And the reason why you have to do that as opposed to somebody who does not have hypothyroidism is if you have hypothyroidism, then likely Your thyroid will not respond to either TSH or HCG.[2:00:15] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So the increased HCG does not compensate for that. So If you take hCG, then it can potentially improve your thyroid function. So that along with selenium are likely the 2 best things that[2:00:27] Andrew Huberman: you can do for thyroid health. HCG and selenium?[2:00:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:00:30] Andrew Huberman: Well, I definitely, make sure I get enough selenium by eating, 3 to 5 Brazil nuts per day, Which I very much enjoy the taste of also. Who should take it? HCG, and can HCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output?[2:00:47] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. It suppresses LH in a dose dependent manner. So the higher the dose of hCG you take, the more it suppresses LH. A common dose for fertility, fertility is usually why hCG is prescribed. In men or women?[2:01:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: In both. Mhmm. Is, 10,000 IUs all at one time, which is quite a bit.[2:01:07] Andrew Huberman: That's a a a tremendous dose.[2:01:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. In fact, some formulation, some brand names of HCG Come in auto injector pins to where you cannot even dose lower than 5,000 units at a time.[2:01:19] Andrew Huberman: Wow. Yeah. But but I know a number of people who take HCG TG to maintain testicular function while on testosterone therapy or augmentation of some sort. Does it does it work to do that?[2:01:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Some people are on HCG monotherapy. It can be slightly better on your lipids than being on TRT?[2:01:40] Andrew Huberman: Oh, so people are using HCG alone as a kind of, neither sort of a hormone augment indirect hormone augmentation.[2:01:48] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Some clinics advertise it as a, nonsuppressive alternative to TRT, but it is suppressive of LH.[2:01:56] Andrew Huberman: But it could also increase estrogen pretty potently.[2:01:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:01:59] Andrew Huberman: And is it true that increasing l h, and or HCG can improve, sensitivity of the genitals. And is that true for men and women? Yeah. I've heard this anecdotally. People say, HCG makes, sexual activity more pleasurable for people because of, some is it a direct effect on on some of the nerve cells in the in the genitals?[2:02:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So LH is also, an agonist in the prostate and in genital tissue in general. So it's a very common, treatment for post finasteride syndrome or post 5 alpha reductase. When you've Blocked the conversion of DHT for a long time. It helps re upregulate DHT.[2:02:42] Andrew Huberman: So someone who's been taking finasteride to prevent hair loss Comes off. It feels may maybe because they felt lousy, but then feels even lousier for reasons you talked about earlier. And then they might use HCG as a transition treatment to, transition back to normal, hormone health. Is that right?[2:02:59] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's extremely helpful in many cases. Now when you come off the HCG, DG, then you need to have a strategy of how to return to your normal as fast as possible as well, but it will upregulate those 5 alpha reductase enzymes. You have In your genital skin, both scrotal skin and penile skin and perineum in general, you have, I believe it's called stratum lucidum. It's a skin layer That is very, very thin, but it has the highest concentration of 5 alpha reductase. So You have a lot of activity.[2:03:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And after you've been on something that inhibits the enzyme, the five a r enzyme in those tissues, Then you do something else to upregulate those enzymes, whether it's waiting and taking time, whether it's trying Tadalafil, whether it's trying creatine even, Or whether it's trying HCG. A lot of times, those are the go to's for post finasteride syndrome.[2:03:53] Andrew Huberman: Any risks for women taking HCG, on their ability to get pregnant or, or risk generally?[2:04:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Obviously, it'll make any pregnancy test positive, so That's a risk that some women don't know. So one could, in theory, fake[2:04:09] Andrew Huberman: a pregnancy test by injecting HCG. Absolutely. Interesting. Yeah. I I have no, motivation to do that.[2:04:15] Andrew Huberman: I was just curious. Yeah. What about, Prolactin. You know, the simple version of this that I was taught, because I was taught mainly from the neuroendocrine perspective, was, You know, dopamine is a kind of close cousin of testosterone and also estrogen, for that matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including, pursuit of sexual partners, sex itself, motivated behaviors, generally, then, postcopulatory, post orgasmic states are Accompanied by a prolactin increase, that's the refractory period for mating in males and maybe even in females as well, involved in milk letdown, etcetera. What are sort of the the general contours of of syndromes or things that people could, be on the lookout for of having too much prolactin or too little prolactin.[2:05:03] Andrew Huberman: And I I'm aware of a number of people who take, dopamine agonists, L Tyrosine, Cabergolene, like that to really boost their, dopamine levels, and that isn't always a good thing as it turns out. Oftentimes, people will become kind of hyper dopaminergic, And so they have the drive to do all these appetitive things, you know, fill in the blanks, but they don't always, have the ability because it seems Just as testosterone and estrogen need to be in the proper ratios, dopamine and prolactin need to be in the appropriate ratios. So what what what how should we think about, and perhaps Act on our prolactin systems.[2:05:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Absolutely. The way I describe it is the dopamine wave pool. So If you're increasing your dopamine too much, you're gonna overflow, and then you're gonna have that wave crash too much. So you wanna have nice even waves that are not going too far above the pool of dopamine, and prolactin will follow. So prolactin and estrogen are quite close cousins.[2:05:58] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Estrogen Upregulates a gene called the PRL gene or prolactin gene that directly increases prolactin synthesis. So prolactin is going to, also inhibit the release of testosterone from the pituitary. So if you're using a dopamine agonist, then you're going to help decrease the prolactin producing cells, including if you have a prolactin producing microadenoma In the pituitary,[2:06:26] Andrew Huberman: how common are those? Because, I mean, I hear a lot about these, you know, hypogonadism or and, of course, that can be due to an issue at the testicles, Or I hypergolasin, could also be, of course, in, like, ovarian syndromes. And then there's, of course, the brain side of it where the signals aren't coming from the brain. Not enough, gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone. And there are ways of teasing this apart through with an endocrinologist that are quite elegant, in fact, right, using stimulating hormones.[2:06:52] Andrew Huberman: Too much to dive into here. But how often does one actually have one of these pituitary tumors? I have heard, that people that Play a lot of high contact sports, so boxing, football, people that head headed the soccer ball quite a lot. Sadly, people whose jobs force them to take head blows, for you know, it could be military, and so they were firing, you know, 50 caliber guns and the kind of woodpeckering of the brain inside of the skull, and construction workers or just a concussion can cause the pituitary to go malfunction. Is that really common, or is this something that, you know, is is a rare, like, 1%?[2:07:33] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. It's extremely common. It's another one of those conditions where a lot of people never know they have it. They just feel a little bit more fatigue. They have that High prolactin feeling all the time.[2:07:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Pituitary microadenomas can be nonproducing as well. So your prolactin can be totally normal. Your hormone in IGF one can be totally normal. That's the 2nd most common producing microadenoma is growth hormone, causing either acromegaly, which is growth of cartilage or gigantism.[2:07:59] Andrew Huberman: This is the the big brow. Yeah. Yeah.[2:08:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So those are fairly common, causes of adenomas, but a lot of people that have a very small, adenoma, you know, much less than 1 centimeter. It's hard to see on imaging even if you have a contrast that specifically looks at the pituitary, And many people aren't symptomatic. So, it's one of those things along with PCOS and prediabetes that are much more frequent when it comes to prevalence, which is the amount, the percentage of people that have it in the general population.[2:08:34] Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you mentioned the dopamine wave pool. I know nowadays, there's a lot of interest in augmenting dopamine. I know a number of people that do this through prescription drugs, Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and those drugs, of course, hit many transmitter systems, but dopamine is certainly involved. People taking, antidepressants like Wellbutrin Tap into that system. And, of course, people are trying to inhibit prolactin and promote serotonin or reduce serotonin.[2:09:01] Andrew Huberman: To me, it all seems like a very delicate dance. Right? I mean, to just imagine the arousal arc of for Mating behavior for sexual reproduction is such an an elaborate dance between sympathetic drive and parasympathetic drive even with across the span of minutes. Right? I mean, I've talked about this before in the podcast that the arousal is kinda more parasympathetic.[2:09:23] Andrew Huberman: Orgasm in, itself is is a sympathetic response, a completely different set of neurons. And so where do you see people getting into trouble just trying to hit the gas pedal on dopamine? And where do you think there is a place for people who perhaps are experiencing low drive and motivation, not just sexual, but in general, to increase the amount of dopamine circulating in their brain and body, how do you how do you think about that given this wave pool, analogy?[2:09:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So it's important to parse it out and start with the least powerful interventions. So if someone's concerned about Dopamine or maybe they have a slightly higher prolactin, then they eliminate things that could be increasing that prolactin.[2:10:03] Andrew Huberman: So as?[2:10:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Casein or gluten, which are mu opioid receptor agonists or any mu opioid receptor agonist in the gut.[2:10:12] Andrew Huberman: Casein, so milk protein Correct. Can increase prolactin? Correct. Interesting.[2:10:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: In addition to that, they should, if they need a pituitary MRI, then they should get a pituitary MRI. If they don't have an adenoma or if they don't have a high enough prolactin level to where they need a MRI, if they're having visual symptoms or if they're having, olfactory symptoms with the nose, then it's more likely that they do that they do. But, if they don't, a lot of times, a prolactin under about 40 is not too big of a deal. They can take dopamine Agonist that agonize that d two receptor like p five p, which is essentially vitamin B6. It's Pyridoxine 5 Pyrophosphate, and Pyridoxine is vitamin b six.[2:10:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So that can help 50 milligrams once to twice a day. Vitamin e can also help, especially if it's mixed to Coferrals. A lot of people have the, high levels of, vitamin e, but low levels of the gamma form of vitamin e, so that can also help.[2:11:12] Andrew Huberman: Fascinating. I'm so glad you mentioned vitamin b 6 and p five p. I have heard that one can shorten the refractory period after, after orgasm To, essentially, to be able to, have sex again, to be quite direct about it, by, by way of vitamin b six, blunting of the prolactin response, which turns out to be quite potent. Yeah. But I've also heard that vitamin b 6 can be neurotoxic, In the in the periphery, they can cause peripheral neuropathies if it's taken at high doses, but that p five p is the safer form.[2:11:45] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. Is that true?[2:11:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's preactivated, so it does not build up. Think of it as a allegory to how, Folate can build up. It's not, Methylfolate, but it builds up, and it can increase levels of homocysteine. Or if you have too much vitamin b 12, another water soluble B vitamin. You can have too much methylmalonic acid or MMA.[2:12:08] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So depending on what your enzymatic conversion is to the The form of the enzyme, often it's just safer to take the active form of the enzyme.[2:12:16] Andrew Huberman: They're very interesting. Okay. Well, at risk of going down every hormonal pathway and talking about, supplementation lifestyle factors, I think touching on test as we have, testosterone and estrogen and now prolactin, I'd love to, chat a little bit about L Carnitine. We talked about this earlier and but I wanna raise this discussion About L Carnitine, not in the context of L Carnitine itself, but in the context of fertility. Because my read of the literature is that L Carnitine can be very beneficial for enhancing sperm quality and egg quality and even rates of conception.[2:12:53] Andrew Huberman: What forms does L Carnitine come in that people can reasonably, consider? Again, talk to your doctor, folks. What is it doing, And do we know how it's doing it? And do you often use this in your patients?[2:13:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So the way I think about L Carnitine, and I'll Try to tie this in with creatine and other things as well is if your cell is an energy factory or a car, then L Carnitine is the shuttle that helps Get the fuel into the motor to use the motor. The motor is mostly due to lifestyle factors, so, like, you know, your diet and your exercise. And the type of fuel itself is NAD plus. We don't need to get into NAD precursors or NMN or NR or anything.[2:13:38] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And then the accessory fuel tank is your creatine phosphate. So creatine is your accessory fuel tank. Your NAD Status which is largely determined by your REM sleep and quality sleep and exercise along with supplementation as the fuel. The carnitine shuttle is, Carnitine Palmitoyl Coenzyme a, and that takes medium chain fatty acids. It takes different molecules of fat.[2:14:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You have Two main energy sources other than ketones. You have your glucose or carbs. You have your fat or fatty acids. And that takes it across the layer of The mitochondria so that it can be utilized. So up regulates that.[2:14:15] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's why, things that have flagella in general, the flagella are gonna work better, Like sperm?[2:14:20] Andrew Huberman: Phalangeal being anything. Sort of the the wavy little tenders on cell types.[2:14:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Of which way,[2:14:25] Andrew Huberman: they're everywhere, right, in the gut too. Right? Yeah. Yeah.[2:14:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So Those are gonna work significantly better, and in general, your mitochondria are gonna work better. So the worst your mitochondria are off the bat, the better they're going to be helped by the shuttle that shuttles them across. They it also slightly increases the density of the androgen receptor as well.[2:14:44] Andrew Huberman: Is that a local effect? So if it L carnitine is injected into a particular muscle, will it increase the density of androgen receptors in that muscle?[2:14:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Likely so. So how are[2:14:52] Andrew Huberman: people taking L Carnitine? There are capsule forms and there are injectable forms. Most people are gonna be taking the capsule forms because that's all they're gonna have access to. And then we should also ask, you get L Carnitine from food?[2:15:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So L Carnitine is just a combination of it's actually a very small peptide. So glutathione is just, 3 amino acids. L Carnitine is the smallest peptide, 2. So peptide is just a protein that has amino between 2 and about 200, and, L Carnitine is just 2 amino acids.[2:15:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Amazing.[2:15:24] Andrew Huberman: So So it's like a mic micropeptide.[2:15:27] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So your body synthesizes enough. It likes to absorb the amino acids by themselves, and then if it puts them together, there it makes l carnitine. It's not very bioavailable if you take it. A lot of people will take L Carnitine, L tartrate, or ASO L Carnitine, and that's about 10% bioavailable.[2:15:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you want 1 gram or a 1000 milligrams of L Carnitine, you can take 10 grams of oral L Carnitine.[2:15:51] Andrew Huberman: Is it is the 1 gram The typical dose you recommend, 1 gram per day?[2:15:55] Dr. Kyle Gillett: For fertility and androgen receptor upregulation.[2:15:58] Andrew Huberman: So that means taking 10 grams of the capsule form.[2:16:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So it's about 15 to 20 capsules, which is a lot.[2:16:05] Andrew Huberman: That is a lot.[2:16:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It can also potentially increase TMAO.[2:16:08] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I want to ask about that because, TMAO on your blood chart is you know, that's when that's elevated, that's gonna cause some concern. You taught me a trick, however, that one can take 600 milligrams of garlic capsule, for the Allison. Is that what it's called?[2:16:24] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Allison is in it. Yeah.[2:16:25] Andrew Huberman: It's like the name Allison, but with 2 l's. Yeah. Okay. And that had a remarkable effect in reducing TMAO. So that's quite potent.[2:16:34] Andrew Huberman: And, also, and they was it, Just coincidence that it really brought my LDL down as well?[2:16:42] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I'm not sure if the LDL is a coincidence, sense. But depending on your gut microbiome or your microbiota, some microbiome, beneficial bacteria will convert, carnitine and also choline. So any choline precursor like alpha GPC or phosphatidylserine, They will convert them more or less to TMAO. So TMAO is something that you can get measured in a blood test and see if it's high or low. Some people might not not even need Alison.[2:17:11] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Interesting. People do benefit from it.[2:17:12] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Although, I think it I think it was you that also told me that that allison and garlic can have positive effects on on, cardiovascular tone and blood flow, generally. Is that right?[2:17:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Okay.[2:17:23] Andrew Huberman: So maybe, so is 600 milligrams garlic in excessive of, excessive amount, or can I just eat garlic?[2:17:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Can I[2:17:30] Andrew Huberman: mean, I like eating garlic?[2:17:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:17:31] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. So okay. So one could also just eat garlic. If one were gonna take, L carnitine in injectable form, how much of that is bioavailable? A 100%[2:17:40] Dr. Kyle Gillett: if you inject it. It is in a aqueous solution. So it's, bacteria static water, essentially. So it's not in a carrier oil. So it's really it's gonna burn a lot if you inject it subcutaneously.[2:17:53] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it's gonna be absorbed Faster and more evenly and also just hurt a lot less if you inject it into a muscle.[2:18:01] Andrew Huberman: But one could then just take one One gram per day injected or divided up into a couple doses.[2:18:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Or 500. The minimally efficacious dose for injectables, Probably around 200 when it comes to sperm motility, the androgen receptor upregulation. So it really depends on why you're taking it.[2:18:19] Andrew Huberman: In terms of fertility and in terms of blood test generally, you know, I always say that, if Possible, either by way of insurance or by way of, some other way of affording it. It would be great for people to have blood tests to know what their hormone levels and other levels of other things like metabolic markers and lipids were in their twenties, also in their thirties, also in their forties. I think there's this idea that only take a blood test when you have a problem, but then, of course, you one can't actually do the comparison that you mentioned earlier or state the comparison to one's physician, that things are changing over time. And it it seems to me that, basically, everyone should get at least a once a year blood test. Is there the hope that insurance will will someday just cover it for everybody?[2:19:06] Andrew Huberman: This will be standard care. I would think that everybody should know What sorts of things are floating around in their bloodstream and what they need more of and less of in life?[2:19:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I doubt it will ever be covered by insurance. In many cases, you could make an argument that it's indicated. As insurance begins to cover more of the population for pathologies, The, things like FSAs or HSAs or CareCredit will likely cover This advanced testing, which become it continues to come down and down in price. So it'll be affordable, but it won't be free. Got it.[2:19:40] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:19:41] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to shift gears slightly and and talk about social interactions and relational effects on hormones, Something that I just find fascinating. We touched on this a little bit earlier with in terms of oral contraception, but, now that we have the backdrop of what these various hormones do, Some involvement in neurotransmitter systems like dopamine and pro prolactin and associated pathways. Prolactin, of course, being a hormone, not a neurotransmitter. But, You know, there's a phenomenon, in human beings where people get very excited about a new partner, And that excitement, no doubt, is related to the dopamine system among other systems, and that excitement can be maintained or can wane over time. And here, I'm talking about attraction, but I'm also talking about just general excitement in the sense of novelty because that's what dopamine's associated with.[2:20:29] Andrew Huberman: Given that, you know, Europe, you work with human beings and they have lives lives and relationships and lifestyles And they have hormones and and all these things interact. What are some of the ways that we could think about adjusting our Relationships in order to optimize hormones as opposed to just thinking about how to optimize hormones for sake of our relationship, because it's bidirectional, Of course. And this assumes, I should say, that one is already paying attention to the 6 pillars talked about earlier, Is doing that people are doing most things right. How should we think about relationships and hormones? Friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, long term partners, Yeah.[2:21:11] Andrew Huberman: How do you think about this kind of stuff?[2:21:15] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So if you have a new partner, then it is largely regulated by the dopaminergic system, which changes over time. So people may have heard the saying that you have to go through a a full calendar year with someone that you're in a relationship so that you Very good advice,[2:21:30] Andrew Huberman: by the way.[2:21:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So that you you really know, what to do and what not to do. But, because they you know, you experience both of your families in the holidays and all the different situations. But I would argue until you have, moved in together, had a baby, and then raised that baby, preferably breastfeeding because that's when you get the prolactin spikes. You don't you aren't really gone through every stage in life yet. Now you can't really do that with every person that you're considering.[2:21:56] Andrew Huberman: Well, some people do, but it can, be quite, costly in terms of time and finances and emotionally costly. Any personal experience of having done all that many times over, but what would you suggest people, Do or think about as they enter relationship or for people that are in long term relationships where they feel like something has shifted, And, indeed, those shifts may reflect the output of different hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems. It almost certainly has to be the case. Right?[2:22:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So just like, women who spend a lot of time together, whether they're coworkers or whatever, a lot of times their men menstrual cycles will align. There is a lot of pheromonal and hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin between men and women. So Spending a 100% of the time together. This is why people think it's so hard to work together and live together.[2:22:51] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They're around each other 247. You don't have the reprieve where you let that dopamine settle down, and then you're excited when you see them again. A lot of guys know that If they've gone on a a hunting trip or if they go on a trip for a long time, they come back, and they see their partner, and it's like a new not quite like a new relationship, but almost like a new relationship. They have that excitement again. And purposely building that into every relationship can help significantly, especially if you choose to Have a child or get pregnant or be breastfeeding because you just plan ahead for both of your prolactins to be high and both of your dopamines to be low and both of your testosterones to be low.[2:23:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So, there's a there's a lot of planning that you can do. Essentially, every relationship goes through, a crisis. Mhmm. And that crisis is Personal between, the 2 of you, and you can plan ahead and figure out a way. Maybe it's not supplementation.[2:23:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Maybe it's Not even, the amount of time you spend away from each other, but plan ahead to have good times if you know you're about to go into a crisis.[2:24:02] Andrew Huberman: Got it. And so it sounds like time apart and time together, which is actually built into a number of cultures where Men and women will will purposefully avoid each other for some period of time, avoid physical touch and maybe in proximity, and then will reconvene. And yet those are very stable relationships over time often. Is the inverse also true? For instance, for people that are in long distance relationships, where they're only seeing each other 3 or 4 days a week or 2 days a week, Does this explain the fact that, some of those relationships can go on for a very long period of time without ever actually entering the, let's call it the hyperprolactin phase of actually moving in together and etcetera, etcetera.[2:24:40] Andrew Huberman: Like, in other words, is that a, a way in which people are, spiking and troughing dopamine that keeps them attached. This kind of elusive, this sort of, what is it called? I think it's called, like, a cat String. Like, if you play with a cat and you move the string away, they'll keep reaching, but you throw the string on their own, they're like, they're totally uninterested in it. Is that is that what's going on?[2:25:01] Andrew Huberman: Because that's a dopaminergic phenomenon, the the cat string Example. We know this experimentally.[2:25:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: In those cases, the relationship hasn't really progressed. In many of those cases, past the dopamine spike, The fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever you wanna call it. So it's almost kinda like a roommate. If you're looking for a roommate, if it was for college or after college or whatever, You know, you can fill out forms and look for common interests, but until you're actually together a significant proportion of the time, You're not really gonna know if you're gonna be compatible or not.[2:25:34] Andrew Huberman: And is there, evidence that the appearance of a of an infant Changes, obviously, they're gonna be hormonal shifts. We know actually it that for, in both women and in men, there's a prolactin increase When 1 when couples are expecting a child, this is the it's almost like a brooding phenomenon. You see this in birds where it's call actually caused called brooding, and it's caused by prolactin increase. But it turns out this also occurs in humans, and, some people would argue causes the the dad bod phenomenon because it actually prolactin's involved in laying down a body fat preparing for sleepless nights. And, presumably, that spike in prolactin is They're also to suppress sexual activity because there are periods of time immediately, near childbirth, where, sexual activity is not advantageous.[2:26:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. You see a prolactin spike right after breastfeeding. So if you think about it, often when you have an infant, you'll breastfeed, Put the infant to bed, and then immediately go to bed with your partner, which is not particularly conducive. It's almost like trying to have intercourse back to back. And, it's very difficult Because[2:26:41] Andrew Huberman: of the in the in the prolactin sense. Yeah.[2:26:43] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin is also increased significantly to help with milk light down as well. So, yeah, as far as brooding, there's definitely, a human equivalent of brooding. Some humans call it nesting instinct, which is both helpful, but It's a it's not necessarily a bad change in in relationship.[2:27:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's just a change. And as long as you know that it's coming, you're gonna do better with it. Just like any medication, if you are aware of the side effect and that it might happen, then when it happens, it's not only, less severe. It also happens less often. Very interesting.[2:27:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: You tell the patient.[2:27:26] Andrew Huberman: Well, as a neuroscientist, you know, I I come from the framework that you know? But, of course, hormones impact perception and behavior, but perception and behavior also impact hormones. I find this fascinating. I also really like the example you gave of, people taking time apart, but also these affiliative bonds that are, non romantic bonds can serve as kind of a a reservoir to replenish dopamine, that is then released upon experience going back to one's partner or some sort of regular feature of home. Very interesting.[2:27:57] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, this should exist on both sides. I'm guessing that, from both the male side and female side, there there's an interest in kind of separation and reunion as the as the theme. And I guess the frequency will vary for different different couples in different situations.[2:28:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. And I don't wanna make it seem like prolactin is all bad. So Prolactin does help with the nesting instinct. It helps with breastfeeding as well. A lot of women are diagnosed with luteal phase defects, which is basically The phase after ovulation but before a period or giving birth, the pregnancy is kind of a prolonged luteal phase.[2:28:29] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And a lot of them will go on progesterone for this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin, and prolactin is also helpful for the maturity of lungs in infants. It helps the sphingomyelin to lechothin ratio. So it can decrease if your if your prolactin is too low through pregnancy, it spikes up very high during pregnancy, then it can lead to increased risk of, respiratory distress of the newborn. Really interesting.[2:28:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:28:54] Andrew Huberman: So we do we certainly don't wanna paint a picture where prolactin is the bad Bad hormone to avoid. It's it's, without prolactin, none of us would be here, of course. It's so vital. I realized that earlier, I raised the question about whether or not cold exposure could modify hormone output, in particular, whether or not ice baths Or ice applied to specific tissues of the body as people are doing, one way or the other can change Testosterone levels, estrogen levels. In other words, do taking ice baths and cold showers increase testosterone and or estrogen?[2:29:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So taking a ice bath or a cold shower or a cold exposure in general, it's not gonna correct the vitamin d deficiency or a metabolic syndrome. So there's a lot of things that it will not correct that are causes of hypogonadism or low or low testosterone, but It will help acutely, specifically the application of cold to testes that are too warm. So, if you have a varicocele or if you have a little bit of a primary hypogonadism, which is where testosterone is not, released by the testes, but your LH and FSH signals are sufficiently high, then, you'll likely respond to Cold exposure better. And there's actually undergarments that are designed specifically to help with fertility.[2:30:15] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And there's probably gonna be more and more of that in the future. Just need to be careful not to get frostbite because it's a particularly bad spot to get frostbite. Noted.[2:30:25] Andrew Huberman: Could you define varicocele? You mentioned it a few times. Is that's a varicose vein?[2:30:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So it's essentially a varicose vein. It brings warm blood, and the venous flow or the flow back to the heart is not as good. Just like in the legs, it can happen in the scrotum. Usually, about 20 to 25% of people have one grade of varicocele.[2:30:46] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's grades 1 through 4, 1 through 5, And most people just have a very mild one, usually on the left side, because the blood has to go through further to get back to the heart, And it raises the temperature of the testes. Temperature is the enemy of testes, so they like to be 5 to 10 degrees cooler than the rest of the body.[2:31:05] Andrew Huberman: So are saunas particularly bad for sperm production?[2:31:09] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They can be. Yeah.[2:31:10] Andrew Huberman: What when you say can be, I mean, how long could one safely be in the sauna? Or would you want to Go back and forth between the cold and sauna. Is there any are there any data?[2:31:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: If Someone is having infertility, then I tell them to avoid all saunas empirically. If someone has, If they're not infertile, but they have a low sperm count, I also tell them to avoid. However, it's mostly, warmed water that can raise The temperature of the testes faster than the sauna.[2:31:43] Andrew Huberman: So hot tubs and things of that sort.[2:31:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So hot tub and a Jacuzzi, Those are enemies, number 1 and number 2, of sperm.[2:31:51] Andrew Huberman: What about ice baths and cold showers for women? Any evidence that it can shift hormone output in women?[2:31:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. It can. It increases the, activity of the beta adrenergic receptors, So even in the central nervous system and the astrocytes as well. So it can do a few things. It can slightly decrease, the drive for food, which astrocytes and beta adrenergic receptors have, some medications that are weight loss medicines also do similar things.[2:32:23] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But, it it can be beneficial in women too.[2:32:26] Andrew Huberman: But no evidence that it changes estrogen output in women. Correct?[2:32:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Not that I know of. Yeah.[2:32:33] Andrew Huberman: Me me either. Peptides. Lot of discussion these days about Peptides. Peptides, of course, just being strings of amino acids, as you mentioned. Yeah.[2:32:41] Andrew Huberman: Very straw small ones, like 2 2 amino acids, like L Carnitine all the way up to polypeptides, which just mean many many, many amino acids. There are so many peptides that there's we should probably just do an entire episode about peptides. But think one of the reasons I'm hearing so much about peptides these days is that they are not called steroids. You know, the the name steroids[2:33:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. I[2:33:03] Andrew Huberman: think has been, has come to be associated with anabolic steroids in the context of, you know, acne, testosterone, rage, etcetera. But, of course, Testast excuse me. Estrogen is a steroid hormone. Right? There are other steroid hormones, as we both know, but Peptides are gaining increasing popularity.[2:33:23] Andrew Huberman: I am willing to go on record saying that you can be sure that many of the incredible Transformations that you see in Hollywood are the consequence of, peptide use, and I I'd put my, my name behind that, Because I'm well aware of people that use these to prepare for roles, but athletes use them. And then everyday, people are using them too. For instance, Sirmorilant, testamorilant, ipomorilant to stimulate, the release of growth hormone rather than taking growth hormone. BPC 157, which is a essentially, a synthetic gastric juice that normally repairs the gut, the being used to treat injuries, And there are other ones as well. What can we say generally about peptides?[2:34:05] Andrew Huberman: Are they safe? Are they not safe? What about sourcing? And are there any peptides that you think could be use for people, and we should probably also touch on peptides that people shouldn't go anywhere near with a 10 foot pole.[2:34:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Definitely. So peptides are very heterogeneous. There's very dangerous ones and very safe ones. My favorite peptide is the original peptide, which is insulin.[2:34:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So Insulin is a peptide, and, you know, less than a 100 years ago, there was a scientist, Studying insulin, and at some point, they saw that an animal had its diabetes cured by insulin inject cured by insulin injection. Less than a year later, they were injecting insulin into every type one diabetic because it was saving their lives.[2:34:52] Andrew Huberman: And yet Insulin can kill you if you take it at the incorrect dose.[2:34:57] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So just like insulin should be prescribed by a doctor, There is over the counter insulin, rely on our NPH, but, ideally, your insulin is prescribed by your doctor for, your diabetes, as it's life saving, peptides should be prescribed by doctors as well. And there's several that are FDA approved. So you mentioned a lot of different ones. Let's start with Tessimorlin.[2:35:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So Tessimorlin was recently FDA approved for something called lipodystrophy. It happens where body fat is displaced into abnormal areas often as part of AIDS or severe burns, things like that, And it helps redistribute this body fat and give people their quality of life back. Tessa Moreland is a GHRH, Which I kind of loop into the category of GHRPs. So growth hormone releasing peptides. Mhmm.[2:35:47] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it's only a couple amino acids different from endogenously produced Growth hormone releasing hormone. So growth hormone itself is also a peptide. It's a peptide hormone, not a steroid hormone. So you have, different somatotrophs, which are, very similar to growth hormone. Another fun fact is that HPL, which is human placental lactogen we love acronyms.[2:36:14] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Right? Human placental lactogen is nearly identical a growth hormone. The growth hormone in pregnancy is not what causes the sugar spike and gestational diabetes. It's the human placental lactogen. So if you look at twin pregnancies, if they have 2 placentas or More placental tissue making more hemoplacental lactogen.[2:36:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The risk of gestational diabetes is exponentially higher. So This HPL is only a couple, molecules different from growth hormone. It is interesting that These different GHRHs and GHRPs actually have pretty different mechanisms of action. Ghrelin is also hormone that's released when you're hungry. This is probably one of the reasons why you have more growth hormone release overnight, and And there's a lot of peptides that are very similar to ghrelin.[2:37:07] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So these peptides are not bioidentical peptides, But they just have a couple different amino acids changed, so they're almost identical. And they're probably gonna be used in the future for Growth hormone deficiencies, including in kids, they've been studied.[2:37:22] Andrew Huberman: So if somebody wants to increase their growth hormone output, in addition to not eating within 2 hours of sleep, Getting good deep sleep, doing all the other things of in the 6 pillars that you mentioned earlier, especially resistance exercise, at some point earlier in the day, what are the risks and benefits of taking a growth hormone releasing hormone peptide like Sir Moreland, prescribed by a doctor, of course. What should one be concerned about? How long could one take I've even heard that they can modify gene expression so that they really are changing your hypothalamus, in very long lasting ways.[2:38:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's definitely a lot of risk, tumor growth and cancer. So you look at a type one diabetic. They have very high incidences of various types of cancer. They have very high growth hormone, but low IGF one, paradoxically.[2:38:19] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So They would likely give you a similar cancer risk to a type one diabetic that has very high, growth hormone. However, there are The benefits of it, you think of lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. A lot of those Can you can use other things to get those benefits. So then, you know, you don't need growth hormone for those benefits. It just leaves Cosmetic benefit to which you can usually use topicals to get, you know, your hair and your skin and your nails.[2:38:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's a lot of other things that you can do other than growth hormone. So a lot of people just don't need these GHRPs if they're if they don't have lipodystrophy or if they don't have growth hormone deficiency, there is other uses of them specifically in injuries. So I know that they've been studied. I'm not sure if it's in the military. We mentioned the woodpecker or the coup, contrecoup injury.[2:39:16] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So that[2:39:16] Andrew Huberman: obviously back and forth.[2:39:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:39:18] Andrew Huberman: The brain basically slamming up against the front of the skull. So football Yeah. Heading the ball in soccer, definitely, people who use the 50 caliber in military, although that's a fairly, small population, And I think anyone that's hit their head hard more than once.[2:39:34] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. We could talk about BPC 157 for a bit, GHK copper peptide for a bit, TB 500 or a thymosin beta 4 analog, and then we can also talk about, Brimelanotide, Which is melanotan 3. They have melanotan 1 and 2, and then they also have melanotan 3 and 4.[2:39:53] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Let's talk about BPC 157 and melanotan, because I think those are the ones that most people are, eyeing, so to speak.[2:40:01] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So BPC 157 is body protective compound 157. It's, identical or bioidentical to gastric protective compound, 157, that's produced in the stomach. So as you age, you get atrophic gastritis very often. That's why you have less intrinsic factor, is kind of another peptide that binds to vitamin b 12.[2:40:25] Dr. Kyle Gillett: That's why you can get age related b 12 deficiencies. So That's one reason why you have more colitis, more diverticulitis as you age. You don't have that gastric protective compound. It's, it increases VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor, which basically makes your blood vessels grow more. So that's what, causes your body to form a blood vessel.[2:40:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So another medication known as Avastin, it's on the WHO's list of essential medications for cancer. So many different types of cancer, including colon cancer, you treat it with Avastin, which is a VEGF inhibitor. So if you have cancer or a high cancer risk, you probably don't wanna be taking a medication that's the exact opposite mechanism of action As your essential anticancer med.[2:41:14] Andrew Huberman: In other words, if you have cancer or you're at risk of cancer, avoid BPC 157. Correct.[2:41:19] Dr. Kyle Gillett: A lot of people prescribe it for 6 weeks. And BPC 157, so Brimonotide that is FDA approved for a hypoactive, sexual disorder. Tessa Moreland, that's also approved for lipodystrophy. Interestingly, another one of the melanotans is also approved for lipodystrophy and also, deficiency in the melanocorticoid receptor. So the receptor that receives, The alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone, it's a very rare condition.[2:41:48] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It's also approved for that because if you don't take it, then you get obesity. But, BPC 157 is not FDA approved, but it is essentially standard of care at this point. I would say it's, you know, if you're not counting insulin or growth hormone as peptides, it's one of the most commonly used peptides. And anecdotally and in some clinical literature, it's fairly well tolerated for short periods of time. I'm not in the camp that everybody needs to do it 2 to 3 times a week or even daily for 6 weeks no matter what.[2:42:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: The major benefit is when you're gonna take it early on because it's gonna allow your Body to increase blood flow to the injured area. And the less blood flow it has, for example, cartilage, ligaments have horrible blood flow, especially as people age, It's gonna make a significant difference. So I would wager that that Russian gymnast that Achilles healed in 1 month and completely from a a full rupture Was likely taking BPC 157 or something very similar.[2:42:49] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'm willing to wager on that as well. A remarkable recovery. And so because it is Prescription there are nonprescription forms. My understanding of the nonprescription forms and the danger of going after nonprescription forms is that oftentimes, they will contain What they claim they contain, BPC 157, in this case, but they are not adequately cleaning out the LPS, the lipopolysaccharide, which can cause Inflammation.[2:43:13] Andrew Huberman: In fact, in the laboratory, we use LPS to deliberately induce fever and inflammation to study systemic inflammation. So this is a warning to people. If you're interested in peptides, you absolutely need to work with a physician, in my opinion. Yeah. Get it from a really good compounding pharmacy who will clean out who that cleans out the LPS.[2:43:31] Andrew Huberman: Yep. Because if you're buying it through a source that, you know, a lot of peep I don't wanna name sources, but there are these common sources on the Internet that everyone knows about. They're buying these sources, they'll ship it to anyone, essentially, but then the LPS is really causing inflammation, and many people experience a kind of mild fever or tingling from that When they inject it, and they're like, oh, I can feel it working, that's probably LPS action, which[2:43:54] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:43:54] Andrew Huberman: Is not good for the brain. I don't know about the on other peripheral tissues. I haven't heard of people dropping dead from this stuff yet, but I certainly wouldn't wanna be ingesting any LPS unnecessarily. So would you agree You should work with a doctor. After all, you are a doctor.[2:44:08] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Definitely talk to your doctor about this and talk to them about the dosing regimen as well. So if they have you doing it for 6 weeks, Ask them why am I doing it for 6 weeks? Why not 2 weeks or why not? As soon as I feel better, can I just stop it? Yeah.[2:44:21] Dr. Kyle Gillett: There's a lot of good questions like that that you should ask your doctor. If somebody's trying to prescribe you a a bunch of different things, then see, is this what they prescribe everybody, or is this individualized for me? There are peptides like GHK copper peptide, which is produced endogenously in the liver more at younger ages. That's why the liver can regenerate fully as this. A GHK copper peptide helps.[2:44:43] Dr. Kyle Gillett: And if you're copper deficient, which not a whole lot of people are, but a lot of people that have had bariatric surgery are copper deficient. GHK copper peptide can help significantly with your nervous system, and it's also synergistic. So any growth agonists like thymus and beta 4 Made in kids in the thymus, which shrinks. That's another reason why kids heal really well. That and GHK is Somewhat synergistic with VPC.[2:45:06] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But if you don't need all 3, you don't want them. And if you don't need it for more than a week, you don't want it for more than a[2:45:12] Andrew Huberman: I I really appreciate you saying that. I often say that sometimes the best dose of something to take is 0. It's often the case that the best dosage is 0. You mentioned Melanotan. There are several kinds of Melanotan.[2:45:24] Andrew Huberman: I find it a little bit of a funny conversation because the I first learned about Melanotan From, reading about peptides and discovering that people were taking injecting melanotan to get tan because it's in in the melanin, synthesis pathway, They also discovered, this isn't an individual. This is reading about this in various manuscripts and peer reviewed papers That, it could cause things like preapism, like like, sustained direction that might be the last one that anyone would ever have, because of damage to the to the a vasculature. Also, women taking melanotan as a as a way to get tan and lose body fat. So this sounds all very recreational. Are there any clinical usage of melanotan.[2:46:07] Andrew Huberman: So separate from the kind of extreme biohacking cosmetic world, which is really not the main focus of this podcast ever, more in terms of, You know, health pursuing health optimization.[2:46:18] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. There's actually 3 FDA approved indications, believe it or not. Not many people know about this, but there's Three well accepted indications. One of them is the hypoactive sexual disorder and more in women. That's for brimonotide.[2:46:31] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So those are those[2:46:32] Andrew Huberman: are women that have essentially no libido whatsoever.[2:46:35] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah.[2:46:35] Andrew Huberman: But other hormones are seem are in check.[2:46:37] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. Classically, it's, before menopause, so those hormonal issues are not contributing. And, When you give them this peptide, it's also known as PT 141. It helps significantly. A lot of times you use it in nasal spray.[2:46:53] Dr. Kyle Gillett: It goes straight into the central nervous system and acts centrally. You can also inject and you can also take it via troche.[2:46:59] Andrew Huberman: Men and women take it?[2:47:00] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Correct. It's approved for women, but it can also help men. And it's relatively safe. The only relative contraindication that I tell people and a lot of people say, oh, there's no side effects that I know of. But if you have a family history of melanoma or potentially have a melanoma and don't know about it, that's why I'm a big advocate of dermoscopy as well and regular skin checks, Then, theoretically, it's gonna increase that alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone, and it can grow that.[2:47:28] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So that's definitely not a good thing. So be very careful about long term administration of it. It's also approved for lipodystrophy, which is the same exact thing as Tesamorelin, Which I believe is also known as, Evista or EGRIFTA. And then it's also approved for the rare genetic condition where your, receptors or your melanocytes don't proliferate as well, so you usually have hypopigmentation. It's not true albinism, but it's associated with morbid morbid obesity and very bet poor outcomes from that in childhood.[2:48:02] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So it's used in kids, actually.[2:48:04] Andrew Huberman: Interesting. Well, peptides are a fascinating landscape, but thank you for that, deep dive into several of them. We will probably return To you, to talk about peptides again in the in the near future because I know there's a lot more there and a lot of interest. I wanna talk about the 6th pillar. Alright.[2:48:23] Andrew Huberman: So just to remind people, you said diet, exercise, where appropriate, caloric restriction, managing stress, Sleep and sunlight are critical for everyone at all ages to manage and optimize hormone health. Then you have the 6th category, which is a really intriguing one, which is Spirit, which is a kind of unusual thing to hear coming from a medical doctor, except that I have many colleagues and, and indeed, our, Former director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, has talked about this notion of spirit. We talked about belief effects on this podcast before with Ali Crum. How one's understanding of the things that they do and their world in general really creates an important effect on Everything at the level of physiology, not just psychology. So as a physician, how do you conceptualize the Spiritual aspect.[2:49:15] Andrew Huberman: And how do you talk to patients about this given that people walking into your clinic are presumably have a bunch of different religious and not a religious backgrounds? I'm sure some are atheists. Some are probably strong believers. How do you deal with that, and how should people think about this?[2:49:30] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. I believe it's It it is surprisingly well received. You wouldn't think at first glance that a patient really wants to talk about their spiritual health with their doctor. But the way I think about it and the way that it really is is it's like a Venn diagram, and you have a body and a mind and a soul. And you can't have 1 healthy without the other healthy.[2:49:49] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Even if your mental health is, phenomenal. And even if your physical health is phenomenal, the mental aspect of spirituality, if that piece is not there, Then that's gonna affect your body physiologically as well. And, Ali Crum's done some excellent work. There's also been a lot of other studies regarding prayer. And I'm a Christian.[2:50:10] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I believe in God, and that gives me a lot of that resilience and motivation. It gives me the the cornerstone or the groundwork, How I can interact with life. And regardless if someone's an atheist or regardless of regardless of what someone believes as far as religion or the origin of the species. They can know that their spirituality is going to have a profound effect On their mental and physical health as well, people like to compartmentalize it. So they like to talk to their doctor only about the physical health because comfortable to do that.[2:50:44] Dr. Kyle Gillett: They only talk to their pastor or a mom or, you know, Ricky Heeler for their spiritual health, and they just talk to their Therapists or psychiatrists about their mental health, but you need to bring all 3 of those things together. Preliminary clinics lead to improved patient outcomes, and that's just disciplines within medicine. So that's just, doctors that are specializing in this or this. So this takes a step back and upper, in the upper part of that tree before you reach those dichotomies or the split offs. You have your fit you have your body and your mind and your soul, so your spiritual health and your mental health and your physical health.[2:51:22] Dr. Kyle Gillett: So if you're, in line in all 3 of those things, that builds the cornerstone for the rest of your health and the rest of your life.[2:51:30] Andrew Huberman: So if someone comes into your clinic and they say, they're feeling one way in their body. They're feeling one way in their emotional life. You run their charts. You get their blood work, and They're an atheist or they're agnostic. What are some of the 6th pillar practices that they can consider that are In keeping with their, atheism or agnosticism, because I have to assume that people who are, in Participate or feel that they belong to, you know, a particular religious sect will have particular prescriptives from those religious, sects that will Direct them towards particular types of prayer, but how would, somebody who doesn't have a a prescriptive coming to them from some, other source, what would they What could they do or would they do?[2:52:17] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Yeah. So I certainly don't force prayer on anybody or anything like that. But it's my belief that being especially being an agnostic, It's almost the hardest thing because, if you're an atheist, then you have some groundwork and you have some spirituality even if it has to do with, the human spirit's interaction with the environment, things that can't be physically explained well, phenomenon like the work that Ali Crumb does. But if you're agnostic, you're still trying to find that. So I hope that everybody does find what they truly believe in as far as their own spirituality.[2:52:52] Dr. Kyle Gillett: But, yeah, that that's a a personal journey. From a physician standpoint and even if I'm friends with him as well a friend standpoint, I don't like to push anybody in any specific direction. So I don't think that everybody should believe what I believe, And, I don't feel like there should be any pressure for them to believe something different. So think that there can be excellent physician patient rapport regardless of what be of what we believe and what our backgrounds are.[2:53:22] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's wonderful to hear. I can say without revealing any names that I have close colleagues that, in every bin of this spectrum, like, hardcore atheists, Hardcore religious in different domains different religions. I don't know I don't know if if I know many I'm agnostic as to whether or not I know any agnostics, should say, I, it's not something that people commonly discuss, but, in the context of science and medicine, but it's starting to happen more and more. And, certainly, this issue of Virtuality is is one of the areas in which neuroscience is asking a lot of questions, like what, spiritual experiences really are in terms of how they're grounded in the brain or not grounded in the brain.[2:54:02] Andrew Huberman: Think it's a really interesting area for discovery, and I appreciate that you, that you bring it up and you bring it up in the in the non pressured way that you do. I think that a lot it will stimulate a lot Thinking, which is, ultimately the goal of of this podcast. Well, I have 1 final question that I it a a a listener insisted I ask, and it's a very straightforward one. It's It's not at all a curveball and not at all related to what we were just talking about, but it was the most common question when I told people that I was gonna be talking to you, which is, Is caffeine problematic for hormones? It's amazing.[2:54:39] Andrew Huberman: I received hundreds of the same question about caffeine. And since it's probably the most commonly Used drug on the planet. I know it's taking us back into the very practical, but in, in closing, we're not quite there yet, but in closing, is caffeine having a an effect one way or the other on testosterone, estrogen, or other hormones that, is positive, negative, or neutral?[2:55:04] Dr. Kyle Gillett: Only if it affects your sleep. So it works on adenosine, and it can actually slightly improve allergies as well, But, negligible effect otherwise. Great. Yep.[2:55:13] Andrew Huberman: Well, sorry to end on such a practical brass tacks type of, type of question, but I did promise to the listeners that I would, I would ask that question. Listen. I wanna sincerely thank you. We covered, Basically, an an endocrinology textbook, a neuroendocrinology textbook's worth of information, a ton of practical tips in there. Where can people find out more about you?[2:55:33] Andrew Huberman: We will certainly provide links. And, I guess the other question is, are you taking patients? I'm sure you'll hear that in the various, venues where can contact you, but but where are you active, in terms of public facing work?[2:55:45] Dr. Kyle Gillett: I'm active on Instagram, Kyle Gillette MD.

While supplements certainly aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them For things like optimizing sleep and focus and indeed hormone health. Anytime you're considering taking a supplement, you want to make sure that the supplements are of the very highest quality. For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, t h o r n e, because Thorne supplements are known to have the highest levels of stringency in terms of the quality of their ingredients And precision about the amounts of the ingredients that they put in each bottle, meaning what is listed on the packaging is actually what's contained in those supplements, is not true for many supplement companies out there. If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.[2:58:14] Andrew Huberman: That's thorne.com/ letter u /huberman, and you can get 20% off any of those supplements. Also, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site, so go to thorne.com/ u/huberman, but then pass into thorne.com. You can also get 20% off any of the other supplements in the Thorne catalog. If you're not already following us on Instagram and Twitter, please do so. It's Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.[2:58:39] Andrew Huberman: And there, I cover science and science based tools, Some of which overlap with the contents of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is distinct from the contents of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And again, we are hosting 2 live events, 1 in Seattle On May 17th, another in Portland on May 18th. That series is called The Brain Body Contract, where I'll talk about science based tools, some of which I have never talked about in a public forum before, and there will be an open question and answer format For you to ask me your questions, and I will do my best to answer them in real time. Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with doctor Kyle Gillett, and as always, thank you
