I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Robert Milenka. Doctor Robert Milenka is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is both a medical doctor, an MD, and a researcher, a PhD.[0:00:29] Andrew Huberman: His laboratory is famous for having discovered some of the key components allowing neuroplasticity, That is the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. In addition, doctor Milenka's research is considered central the textbook knowledge about how reward systems in the brain are organized and function. Indeed, doctor Milenka's research over the last 10 or 15 years Has merged what was once 2 disparate fields. The first being the study of neuroplasticity, again, the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience, And the other field being the field of dopamine as it relates to pleasure and addiction. His laboratory has shown, for instance, That when we seek out particular forms of pleasure, regardless of whether or not they are healthy for us, that changes the way that our reward circuitry works actually changes the way that dopamine is released and how it impacts the brain.[0:01:19] Andrew Huberman: And his work has also informed how we seek out healthy pleasures, including healthy food and social connection. Today's discussion explores all of these topics. And by the end of today's discussion, You will have a rich understanding of how neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin work in parallel to reinforce, that is to increase the probability we will engage in certain types of thinking and behaviors. So if you are somebody interested in neuroplasticity, that is how the nervous system can change in response to experience, And or you are interested in reward systems, what motivates us and what we are likely to pursue in the future given our choices of past. And if you are interested in things like social connection and empathy or lack thereof, today's discussion encompasses all of those topics.[0:02:06] Andrew Huberman: It is worth mentioning that doctor Malenka is a true luminary in all of the fields I just mentioned, as well as several other fields. In fact, when you look out on the landscape of modern neuroscience, what you'll discover is that a very large percentage of the top laboratory studying neuroplasticity and reward systems so on, all stemmed from having trained in doctor Milankar's laboratory. So it's a real honor and pleasure to be able to host him today, and I'm sure that Our discussion is going to greatly enrich the way that you think about brain function, neuroplasticity, and reward. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this cast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.[0:02:50] Andrew Huberman: In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes Eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by 2 all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA Eyeglasses and Sunglasses were designed performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see Clearly, ROKA understands those challenges and the biology of the visual system such that they've designed sunglasses and eyeglasses that always allow you to see with crystal Clarity.[0:03:25] Andrew Huberman: Now initially, ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed for sports performance. And as a consequence, all of their glasses are designed to be very lightweight and to not slip off your face if you get sweaty. However, the design of the glasses include some that are specifically for sport and others whose aesthetic really allows you to use them for Sport as well as out to dinner or to work, etcetera, and that's how I use them. If you'd like to try ROKA Eyeglasses and Sunglasses, you can go to roka.com.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and behaviors your health by giving you real time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. One of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels. To maintain energy and focus throughout the day, You want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or dips.[0:04:26] Andrew Huberman: Using levels, you can monitor how different types of foods and different food combinations, as well as food timing and things like exercise combined to impact your blood glucose levels. I started using Levels a little over a year ago, And it gave me a lot of insight into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards, as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my overall energy. And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize how I eat, What I eat, when I exercise, and so on such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day. If you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Right now, Levels is offering an additional 2 free months of membership.[0:05:12] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's levels.link, l I n k, slash huberman, to get 2 free months of membership. And now for my discussion with doctor Robert Milenka. Doctor Milenka, Rob, welcome.[0:05:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Thanks for having me.[0:05:26] Andrew Huberman: Delighted to have you here both for sake of your medical knowledge and training as a psychiatrist and, of course, as a luminary in the field of Neuroplasticity, dopamine and reward systems, social systems, your knowledge of autism and social interactions, A newer interest in or perhaps old interest in psychedelics and what they're doing and potential for mental health. There are just so many things that, you've done in this field. I've been a long, long time fan of your work since your days as an assistant professor. I've tracked your career. I've learned tremendous amount from you by observing you and from being your colleague, so really delighted to have you here.[0:06:07] Andrew Huberman: You're making[0:06:08] Dr. Robert Malenka: me blush, I don't blush easily.[0:06:10] Andrew Huberman: Well, it's it's it's all true, and I and I will say as well, you've also trained an enormous number of Incredible scientists, Carl Deisseroth, the Carl Deisseroth. Anna Lemke always speaks incredibly highly of you as a mentor and, somebody she's learned a tremendous amount from and pretty much anyone that's worked on neuroplasticity, on dopamine and reward systems, addiction, And now in the fields of autism and soon psychedelics as well, references as you often and you've been mentioned many times before on this podcast, if not by name, by work. So, Again, thank you for being here. I'd love to kick off the conversation by talking about something which is very fundamental to everything going to talk about, but certainly fundamental to our daily lives, which is dopamine.[0:06:56] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm. Yeah.[0:06:56] Andrew Huberman: We hear so much about dopamine. People talk about dopamine hits. People think about dopamine as pleasure, dopamine reward. For the novice, how how would you frame the dopamine system? I mean, it does a bunch of different things in different areas of the brain and body.[0:07:11] Andrew Huberman: But to you, what what does dopamine represent as its major function in the brain? And Could you give us a kind of general contour of the neural circuits that allow this chemical to more or less, put Value on our experiences.[0:07:27] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. That's very well put. As you point out, dopamine is one of the major, what we term neuromodulators in the brain, a chemical signaling messenger that the brain uses to mediate a complex Array of actions. Its best well known function is in what we call the brain's reward circuitry. So this is a circuit in the brain.[0:07:54] Dr. Robert Malenka: And when we use the term circuit, what we really mean is one part of the communicating with another part of the brain because the brain is this very complex you know, it's the most complex organ is organ in the universe, with lots of different nerve cells talking to each other simultaneously, and as neuroscientists, we try to parse What different brain areas are doing and what different neuromodulators might be doing. And dopamine was discovered, oh, I should know this, Many decades ago, and it's it's, as I said, the major chemical messenger molecule In the so called brain's reward circuitry and when you're talking about so what what is the brain's reward circuitry? This is a part of the brain That tells us something is reinforcing in our environment, some stimuli or In quotes, is rewarding. Makes us feel better or good, although that's a gross oversimplification. And before getting into the details of dopamine and its function in the reward circuitry, I think it's useful to talk about why do we need a reward circuitry?[0:09:13] Dr. Robert Malenka: Why do we need something in our brain that tells us this feels good or this feels bad? And it goes back to evolution. I I am a biological scientist. That means I believe in evolution. And if you think about the evolution of our species, Everything is driven by developing mechanisms that increase our survival, And it's really useful.[0:09:41] Dr. Robert Malenka: You need something in your nervous system that tells you some stimuli in your environment is important for your survival or some stimulus in your environment is dangerous. So it's not magic that, Sugary, high fat laden foods are highly reinforcing and rewarding rewarding. It's not an accident. There has to be a mechanism in the brain that tells us that. It's not an accident that most of the time, for most of us, A sexual experience is pretty reinforcing.[0:10:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's pretty rewarding. It's not an accident that warmth feels really good When you're cold, that water tastes much better when you're really thirsty. There have what evolved is a mechanism To tell our nervous systems and tell our brains, this feels pretty good. I should Repeat the behavior that leads to that rewarding experience. And similarly, it's really important when You you know, there is an event in your life that's highly dangerous for some mechanism in your brain to say, woah.[0:10:54] Dr. Robert Malenka: I don't wanna go back to where that lion was, and we can get into that. So this was a long way of saying what the reward circuitry tells us is This event, this stimulus, it could be an external stimulus. Like I said, you know, a a Krispy Kreme doughnut, which I happen to love, and I have to be very disciplined so I don't eat too many of them. It, it could be a drug of abuse, And maybe we'll talk about that a little bit. All of these stimuli seem to activate and cause the release of dopamine in this brain's reward circuitry.[0:11:31] Dr. Robert Malenka: So now we need to get into a little bit of detail. Neuroscientists use these Very unfriendly terms to describe different brain regions. So the home of dopamine cells Or brain cells are called neurons. So the home of dopamine neurons, are in a part of the brain sort of What we call the lower midbrain, the dopamine neurons that are part of the reward circuitry are found in this area Called the ventral tegmental area, which I'm sorry to have to use such technical jargon, and we call it the VTA. That's the acronym.[0:12:13] Andrew Huberman: I think, the roof of the midbrain is the tectum. It means roof, and the base of the midbrain, it means Flor, which is tegmentum. Yeah. I think that's the so there's a rationale, but it doesn't help much at all to know the names.[0:12:27] Dr. Robert Malenka: And in fact, you are absolutely correct, and I always forget So thank you for pointing that out.[0:12:32] Andrew Huberman: It's a it's a it's a side effect of teaching your own anatomy.[0:12:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: And then, which I once did back in the early eighties, but I've forgotten everything I taught. It's okay. Anyhow, so these dopamine neurons and we can talk about other types of dopamine neurons. They send messages, what we call projections, using telegraph wires that we call SONS. They send projections to many different brain regions.[0:12:58] Dr. Robert Malenka: The key one in the brain's reward circuitry Being an area, again, with a very complicated name called the nucleus accumbens, and maybe, Andrew, you know. I actually don't know How that name evolved, the nucleus accumbens?[0:13:13] Andrew Huberman: I don't know.[0:13:14] Dr. Robert Malenka: Sure I should know because I've been studying it for 30 years, But I have never looked up the, genesis of that name.[0:13:22] Andrew Huberman: Well, the fortunate thing about this podcast is it's both on audio platforms like Spotify and Apple, but also on YouTube. And so now we can be absolutely sure that somebody has put it into the YouTube comments underneath this episode, And, therefore, everyone will learn, including us. So I don't know the origins of the word nucleus accrues.[0:13:40] Dr. Robert Malenka: And It it's it's a gross oversimplification, but it's the activity of these dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, that then caused the release of this powerful neuromodulator to neuromodulator dopamine In the nucleus accumbens, which has a is part of another brain structure with a tough to remember name called the ventral Triadum. And then magic happens. And when I say magic happens, even though we've been studying how dopamine modifies The properties of cells in this nucleus accumbens. The truth is we don't have a deep mechanistic understanding Why when dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens, we experience that as, I'm being very cautious here. The simple way would be to say as highly rewarding, but it's a little more complicated than that.[0:14:43] Dr. Robert Malenka: What What it tells us is that there's something really important happening in our environment. So then could we say[0:14:51] Andrew Huberman: that it Cues the arousal system.[0:14:53] Dr. Robert Malenka: It it it it gets the arousal system going. There's close ties to our memory systems, Which hopefully, intuitively makes some sense if something really important is happening in your environment. Because, again, we I think what's helpful for your audience is to always be thinking about how these systems evolved from an evolutionary perspective, And if dopamine is signaling something really important and salient is happening in your environment, you wanna remember that. It could be a highly rewarding experience, like a source of food. For me, it's a I hope I I like all doughnuts, so I don't want to[0:15:34] Andrew Huberman: I do too.[0:15:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: Emphasize any one manufacturer of 1 doughnut versus the other. I I like Sugar laden, fat laden foods, that's why I never eat them because I like them so much, and I use that as an example. But Because that was an important event for my survival, this reward circuitry, yes, it it stimulates my arousal system. It gets me to pay attention. It also has very close ties to memory systems.[0:16:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: I mean, to to go off on a little bit of a tangent, I think the one, I don't wanna say it's a mistake. I think perhaps somewhat oversimplification of how people conceptualize Dopamine's role in the brain is even though it's a major important role is for it to be active and released During highly reinforcing experiences like sex, like really good food, like drugs of abuse, It also can get activated subdivisions of this system during painful stimuli and during aversive stimuli, which again are really important for you to be aware of, to say, oh my god. That's really bad for me. And So the dopamine system, this reward circuitry and its subcomponents that may be perhaps signal more Salients or a version a version in the environment are closely tied to arousal systems and memory systems. Again, hopefully, for somewhat obvious reasons, you wanna remember powerfully reinforcing events in your life as well as powerfully, emotionally, or physically painful events in your life.[0:17:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: So I hope I answered, Yeah. Your question to a modest degree.[0:17:26] Andrew Huberman: No. Far better than a modest read. That that's an excellent description of the dopamine system from a true expert. And the question I have is about some of the context and nuance of the system. But in In sort of real world terms, how how should I think about this?[0:17:44] Andrew Huberman: Even in my training as a neuroscientist, I know neurons can be a little active, a lot active, everything in they could be active over long periods of time or short periods of time. But let's use the example of the doughnut. I'm I'm I like a glazed old fashioned doughnut. I actually don't have a craving for sweet things, but doughnuts is is is an exception. I like the glazed old fashioned doughnut.[0:18:04] Andrew Huberman: But If I were to see just a little piece of a glazed old fashioned Yeah. Yeah. Doughnut versus a full glazed old fashioned doughnut, could I expect that More dopamine is released to the anticipation of the complete doughnut, and then the other question is, how does context Influence the dopamine system. For instance, if I'm very full[0:18:25] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yep.[0:18:26] Andrew Huberman: A glazed old fashioned doughnut might be aversive to me.[0:18:28] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah.[0:18:29] Andrew Huberman: Whereas if I'm just a little bit hungry, or if I'm actually more, on a schedule of rewarding myself for abstaining from Mhmm. Sweet, fatty foods, then abstaining from the food might be its own form of reward. Yeah. I mean And so to me, the dopamine system seems incredibly simple and yet incredibly prone to Immediate context and the kinds of nuance that I mean, we're constantly juggling I'll interrupt myself to say that we're constantly juggling a bunch of different Reward contingencies. We want to, you know, have good health metrics and maybe have a certain aesthetic qualities to our body, but we also want the doughnut.[0:19:05] Andrew Huberman: And so How does a simp a system as simple as a 1 neuromodulator system and the VTA to nucleus accumbens Yeah. And with some connections to the memory area, How does it balance all of that information in real time? To me, that's just, like, staggeringly complex, but also incredibly interesting.[0:19:25] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I think you beautifully put. Beaut very eloquent description. You just said it. It's staggeringly simple, simultaneously Daggeringly complex. And you you asked several different questions.[0:19:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: So context makes an enormous importance, and that's one of the reasons I became interested in the dopamine reward circuitry is, as you know, as a colleague in the academic neuroscience world, but your listeners probably don't. I started out my career studying very basic mechanisms of plasticity. How does the brain modify itself? And what makes the brain different than compute the comp computer hardware Is our the physical connections in the brain are constantly changing the strength of the communication. Similarly for the dopamine reward circuitry, it's highly plastic, and it's highly contextually dependent.[0:20:25] Dr. Robert Malenka: And so you gave the example of donuts and feeding, and I'll answer your question about the cues. Yes. It's I I used to give the example of Thanksgiving, so let me give that example. You know, in the morning of Thanksgiving, all For most of us in in the United States, the morning of Thanksgiving, if you're at home visiting your parents, the Smells of the apple pie, the smells of the turkey cooking are highly appetitive, highly reinforcing. You're anticipating that fun event.[0:20:58] Dr. Robert Malenka: You're anticipating uncle Joe coming to visit you for Thanksgiving, and that's all because these cues, The smells, the anticipation of uncle Joe's, your previous experiences are part are part of your memory system sort of talking to, In a simple way, your reward circuitry so you're building up this anticipation. One could almost say this craving, which maybe we'll talk about in the context of addiction. And then to make a long story short, think about that evening at the end of Thanksgiving, those exact Same cues. The exact same smell of the apple pie, turkey, and uncle Joe himself. At the very least, They're no longer repetitive, meaning they might actually be averse.[0:21:48] Dr. Robert Malenka: The last thing you want is a piece of apple pie. You can't wait uncle Joe to leave your Thanksgiving dinner, and I always argue that does not happen magically. That happens because your brain Has been modified by the context in which it sits, and this very important modulatory system, this reward circuitry, is responding to the exact same stimuli with a very different response. So that I'm just telling you, I'm repeating what you said, the phenomenology, and and, again, my other favorite example is any of us who have been in an intimate Relationship knows that the the love of your life can turn to the bane of your existence in 20 seconds. And again, that doesn't happen magically.[0:22:34] Dr. Robert Malenka: This person who you crave, who you love, does something, and 2 minutes Later, your brain is saying, oh my god. I, you know, I may have to break up with this person or this isn't an incredibly painful exper emotional experience. And what fascinates me about the brain is how does the brain mediate that rapid change? So now back to so, yes, context makes Is everything about how this powerful neuromodulatory system that uses dopamine works? And the truth is we don't know.[0:23:08] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's because the inputs onto these dopamine neurons, the other nerve cells that are driving the activity of the dopamine neurons and I I've actually Studied this in my lab at Stanford University with a colleague you know well, Liqun Luo, who's a, you know, a world class neuroscientist. We've studied the complexity of the neuroanatomy of the dopamine system, and these dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, the The the source of the reward circuitry dopamine are receiving inputs from all over the brain. They're receiving, you know, indirectly or directly, inputs From visual areas, from somatosensory areas, and I'm not giving you a really good answer because That's one of the goals of my research to try to understand how context, how the history that you've had With these cues, which we're gonna get back to, of the doughnut or of a drug, how is that modified how this neuromodulator system responds. Similarly, the the nucleus accumbens, the the target of this powerful modulator dopamine, is receiving communications, what what we call inputs from all sorts of brain regions that You know about Andrew. Your audience may not.[0:24:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: They it receives inputs from an area called the hippocampus, which you may have covered in previous podcasts, Which is very powerfully very important for memories, both establishing new memories. And, again, remember, that makes sense. You want this system, this dopamine reward circuitry to be very connected to memory systems. So the the nucleus accumbens, The activity in the nucleus accumbens is modulated by dopamine while it is receiving information from the hippocampus, Which helps encode new memories while it's receiving information from a brain area called the amygdala, which tells is a Part of the brain involved in our emotional experiences, the incumbents also receives inputs from the prefrontal cortex, which Is this brain area as you know better than me, Andrew, is important for Decision making for planning our activity, and I could go on and on.[0:25:38] Andrew Huberman: Well, could we talk about prefrontal cortex for a moment? Because It always was surprising to me that prefrontal cortex is talked about as this Higher executive function area. But then when you look at the neuroanatomy[0:25:54] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[0:25:55] Andrew Huberman: It's, as we say, monosynaptically, as you and I know, we have one connection away from structures like the amygdala, one connection away from structures like the the nucleus accumbens. In other words, prefrontal cortex to me is every bit as ancient, as some of these other structures that we think of as more ancient. And, really, the whole ancient evolved thing gets a little bit dicey because certain areas are like the prefrontal it's This thing of scaling the reward response or context of the reward response because It can set rules. It it seems to know, okay. We're recording a podcast now, and there are certain rules.[0:26:40] Andrew Huberman: There are certain things that we're going to do and not do. Yeah. But what's fascinating about the and I'm so glad you gave a bunch of different examples because what's fascinating, for instance, about the, the relationship example is that, yes, at one moment, we can adore somebody. In another moment, later, if they do something or don't do something, we can be incredibly frustrated with them. They can even become Averse sip to us.[0:27:03] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Hopefully, that doesn't happen too frequently.[0:27:05] Dr. Robert Malenka: Hopefully.[0:27:06] Andrew Huberman: But, I think we've all had the experience of A doughnut, an event, or a person actually looking different to us in a, you know, from one moment to the next. Hopefully, not at random. Right? And so to me, it seems like, the prefrontal cortex is uniquely positioned To really say, okay. Right now, we are in a mode of, for lack of a better word, love and loving.[0:27:31] Andrew Huberman: Like, be in the in the verb Tense of loving, be in the verb tense of arguing. We're now arguing. You know, we're in the verb tense of of of reconciliation. Mhmm. You know, kinda somewhere in between or something of that sort.[0:27:43] Andrew Huberman: And how a structure in a circuit as Simple as the dopamine system. Right? 1 molecule Yeah. Could suddenly say, oh, you know what? Now getting over my anger is rewarding, whereas 5 minutes ago, being right and being the most Angry was rewarding, and then 5 minutes before that again, we're accelerating this movie, but 5 minutes or 5 days or 5 years before that, This person could do no wrong, and the dopamine system is just cranking out dopamine, saying whatever you do, I'm just delighted by it.[0:28:13] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Incredible. Yeah. Like, to me, I can't think of a more interesting system in neuroscience. Well[0:28:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. I mean, that was eloquently put. I agree with Pretty much everything you said. I don't have much to add because you what you're pointing out is The challenges of studying these systems, the importance of studying these systems, and the challenge of presenting How the brain works to this podcast audience. Because on the one hand, You have done a mark you know, fantastic job over the last few years in your podcast of making complex, Subjects accessible to a lay audience, and get them to be thinking about how Our modern view of how the brain works may could be used to enhance health, could enhance mental well-being, But as neuroscientists academic neuroscientists ourselves, we we know you know, you are Oversimplifying things and the actual functioning of a system like the dopamine reward circuitry, As you just eloquently point out, it's so much more complex.[0:29:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's modified by these prefrontal, inputs which are simultaneously telling our memory systems, you know, pay attention here. I'm repeating what you just said. The context makes a big difference. The history you have with The person or stimuli with whom you're interacting. Like, to bring this back to your you know, which I never the initial question, is a small piece of a doughnut Activate the cue that that small piece of a doughnut, activate the reward circuitry, and cause release of dopamine To the same extent as the full doughnut, depends on your experience with doughnuts.[0:30:15] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm. I mean Mhmm. I think for you and me, because we seem to both, you know, white doughnuts, they're highly appetitive for us. Probably doesn't matter because we have learned even a little piece of a doughnut activates all of our memory I'm saying, man, that's an old fashioned Lay's doughnut. I wanna eat that, or I wanna get 1, or I wanna have the discipline not to eat it.[0:30:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: So I hope I'm answering your question. It and I'm I'm shifting topics completely, but that's why Addiction is so challenging. Well,[0:30:48] Andrew Huberman: let's talk about that. Let's talk about that because you've done a a ton of important work in this area of addiction. I mean, one of the basic questions I have about addiction is, you know, we hear that certain drugs are more addicting than other drugs or certain behaviors. Also hear that every that we can become addicted to anything. When Anna Lemke was on this podcast, I said, what's the most, unusual addiction you've ever seen?[0:31:09] Andrew Huberman: And she talked about a patient, who sadly, committed suicide at some point later that, she told us had been addicted to water, to drinking of any kind. 1st, alcohol, but then water eventually. And so so my question about addiction in the dopamine system is, You know, for let's pick a drug, like cocaine.[0:31:30] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[0:31:31] Andrew Huberman: I've never done cocaine. Mhmm. But people who have done cocaine tell me that it Feels very good, and one of the more salient features of the cocaine high is that it comes on very fast and it ends pretty quickly too. Is the rate of dopamine increase related to the addictive property, of a drug or behavior, as much as how much dopamine is released?[0:31:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: And that's a very sophisticated question, and the answer is yes. And that's usually the, the lecture I give. The way I think about addiction, and Obviously, my friend and colleague Anna Lemke is one of the world's experts in terms of the understanding the human experience of addiction. I have studied it as a Cellular molecular neuroscientists trying to understand how addictive substances Modify reward circuitry. Modify the connections in the reward circuitry.[0:32:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: Modify how dopamine neurons act. And the way I you know, like any what appears to be a simple term, it's layered with complexity. Addiction is somewhat of a continuum, and I like to think about whether you're talking about substances like cocaine, and I will explicitly answer your question consume or opioids as we as you know, we're going in this country. There is an opioid epidemic. I I I do like to think about addictive liability, and it is in my view, it is pretty clear that when we're talking about drugs, They have different degrees of addictive liability.[0:33:16] Dr. Robert Malenka: I mean, I had a cup of coffee this morning, Am I and many of us listening to this podcast, it's really hard to start our day without getting that hit of caffeine. But are we addicted to caffeine? That's a tricky question, because I've never heard of anybody robbing a bank to get caffeine, Destroying their personal life to get caffeine. So I would say caffeine causes tolerance, But I would not say it has a particularly high addictive liability. Whereas drugs like psychosimulants, Like cocaine, have a very or opioids have a very high addictive liability.[0:33:58] Dr. Robert Malenka: So to answer your mechanistic question, There have been some famous studies done, by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Nora Volkoff. Simultaneously, there have been studies in animal models of addiction where you you nailed it. The In a rough way, the addictive liability of a substance is directly correlated with 2 aspects of dopamine. How much dopamine is released in the incumbents and the kinetics of the dopamine release? As you said, how rapidly it's released.[0:34:36] Dr. Robert Malenka: To get a little technical, even with the drug like cocaine or opioids, it's not only the drug itself, it's the root of administration. Because the root of administration influences the kinetics, meaning how fast that drugs gets into your brain Influences the reward circuitry and how fast it causes a big rapid release of dopamine. And some of your Podcast listeners may be old enough to remember the crack cocaine epidemic or free based cocaine. And Cocaine does have, like methamphetamine, a very high addictive liability. I teach The neurobi I I give lectures to students at Stanford about neurobiology of addiction as part of a team course team taught course.[0:35:28] Dr. Robert Malenka: I have kids, who I had to deal with. And what, you know, what I always say is, you know, you it's not that if you use this drug, you're automatically gonna become an addict, but you're taking that risk, and it is impossible to become addicted to a substance if you've never used it by definition. Back to the root of administration. So I I went off[0:35:50] Andrew Huberman: to say that statement. Yeah. You know, because I think we may have heard that in high school, although I, to be honest, wasn't the most attentive high school student, and I regret that. High school students pay attention.[0:36:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: Okay for yourselves.[0:36:02] Andrew Huberman: Eventually, I came around, but but it there was an uphill battle there. But you that you can't become addicted to something that you've never done, which, I just wanna earmark that because I think it's a profound statement because It points to the importance of the memory system, but also plasticity. Yep. And so I I wanna make sure that, eventually, we get around to talking about how, the amount of dopamine released and the kinetics, how that might influence plasticity. Absolutely.[0:36:29] Andrew Huberman: What I'm asking here, queuing up in the back of your mind, is Whether or not addiction is just related to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior or When we are under the influence of a drug or whether or not it actually modifies neural circuitry in a way that, makes A broader range of, drugs or experiences attractive[0:36:55] Dr. Robert Malenka: to us. It's probably the latter, but so let me get Back, and I will answer that in a second to the point I was making. So it's not only the substance, it's the root of administration. So and, You know, as I said, you can't develop a problem with a substance and develop a substance abuse problem if you never take it, But snorting cocaine is a different experience than smoking it or injecting it. And one of the reasons the crack cocaine, epidemic was so powerful is It it gets into when you're smoking it or injecting it.[0:37:36] Dr. Robert Malenka: It gets in, and the the and people do this now with methamphetamine. I mean, meth addicts, most of them and that is another epidemic in our country. Most of them smoke it. And that The danger of that is the drug, whether it's cocaine, methamphetamine, gets into your brain almost instantaneously, causes a very rapid, powerful surge of dopamine in the incumbents in this reward circuitry, And that the feeling you get, which and we're gonna get into this, is not necessarily a happy feeling, And it only lasts it can last for tens of seconds or a few minutes, and it's a feeling that For gives you this overwhelming compulsion and urge, I wanna do it again. So even though it may not actually feel all that good, it's it's it's and and again, this gets into You know, we didn't have an addiction problem for any substance other than alcohol, You know, for most of humanity's existence, because these substances like cocaine, methamphetamine, Synthetic opioids like Fentanyl, they didn't exist.[0:38:57] Dr. Robert Malenka: And our brain you know, the truth is our brains are were not are not designed to handle those kinds of very powerful substances.[0:39:07] Andrew Huberman: As many of you know, I've been taking AG one daily since 2012, I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG one, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG one.[0:39:38] Andrew Huberman: I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better, and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just 1 supplement, what would it be? I answer, a g one. If you'd like to try a g one, go to drink a g one dot com /huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you 5 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two.[0:40:00] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drinkagone.com/[0:40:04] Dr. Robert Malenka: Huberman. So where do you wanna go from here? You asked a question about, you know, the the neuromechanisms of the of what we call addiction.[0:40:12] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I'd like to know about the role of neuroplasticity in addiction. I I do wanna highlight something you said, and I apologize for, interrupting a moment ago, I never thought it was an interruption based on real excitement because a, a person I know quite well who is a recovered cocaine addict, told me and that, by the way, folks, this isn't I have a friend, and I'm actually you know, I truly have never tried cocaine. And this person said that the 1st time they did cocaine, his thought was, I hate this, And I can't wait to do it again. Ex and And that's exactly how you described it.[0:40:49] Dr. Robert Malenka: And I think that is a fairly common experience With people suffering from an addiction disorder, we're not supposed to use the word addicts anymore because that's a little bit judgmental.[0:41:04] Andrew Huberman: Is that and that's the new nomenclature?[0:41:06] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's something along those lines.[0:41:07] Andrew Huberman: Got it. I'm calling someone an addict[0:41:09] Dr. Robert Malenka: You know?[0:41:09] Andrew Huberman: As opposed to being addicted.[0:41:11] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Being, and, that is a beautiful description. I hate it, but I wanna do it again. And again, it just shows the which remember evolved for our survival. So a very simple way of thinking about it is these drugs are tricking the reward circuitry To say this stimulus, this experience is really important for my survival.[0:41:38] Dr. Robert Malenka: I have to go do it again and again. And, again, a side question is the huge question is why do some people develop an addiction problem And others who have used this substance just don't. Self, you know the answer. It's always a complex combination of underlying genetics, the environment in which They find themselves the environment in which they grew up and how that modified their reward circuitry. So to get at your question, one set of experiments my lab did, which Other labs did too.[0:42:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: I don't deserve the sole credit for this. It's showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity In the neurons that make up the cells that make up the reward circuitry, and in fact, drugs of abuse like Cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids like morphine, heroin change the, what, The synapses. The synapses are the connections from other nerve cells onto dopamine neurons onto the nerve cells in the accumbens, And these connections, these synapses can change, and drugs of abuse cause powerful changes in those connections, And therefore, powerful changes in the activity of the dopamine neurons and the neurons in the in the ventral in the in the nucleus accumbens. And in fact, the types of changes that occur appear to be similar to the types of changes That have evolved for good uses, for adaptive forms of learning and memory. So, again, this is an example that this superficially simple dopamine reward circuitry It's changing all the time.[0:43:40] Dr. Robert Malenka: It is highly plastic and can become more sensitive to certain experiences, you know, etcetera, etcetera.[0:43:48] Andrew Huberman: Well, could I ask you a question about some of the general contours of the plasticity in the dopamine system? You said before, And I love this statement even though it's very simple, but in its simplicity, it's really elegant that we can't become addicted to a substance or a behavior that we haven't, taken or Mhmm. Partaken in. So is there data to support the idea that just one exposure To cocaine or one exposure to some sort of behavior can lead to a lasting change in the dopamine system such that one's propensity to be addicted to that substance, again, if one were to indulge in the future or behavior, again, in the future is increased. And I have a very particular reason for asking this, but I'm very curious what the answer is.[0:44:38] Dr. Robert Malenka: I mean, in in the work My lab and other labs have done in preclinical rodent models. I wanna, the answer is yes. A single Administration of a drug of abuse like cocaine, like morphine, Can cause relatively several days, several weeks of changes in the connections onto mean neurons and onto, the neurons in the nucleus accumbens. Those changes that does not mean these changes are permanent, Or, or or irreversible, but the changes last a long time. And again, the big question for Understanding the neurobiology of addiction is, you know, those changes are probably happening in most People who take the drug in this case and we can talk about other stimuli, nondrug stimuli that can become, in quotes, addictive.[0:45:40] Dr. Robert Malenka: You know, again, why in certain individuals to be honest, it's it's not a big deal. Yeah. I did cocaine at this party. It was nice, But I don't feel any craving or urge to do it again. Whereas other individuals, it sets them down, You know, a a very bad path and really badly affects their life.[0:46:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: And that's a huge question in the research field Because, obviously, if we could make predictions on which individuals are more susceptible, And, you know, not to get too political here, but it's also you know, whether you become Develop a problem with addiction or not is influenced by the other Parts of your life, do you have other ways of getting reinforcing stimuli, getting satisfaction, Having an outlet that other ways of activating your reward or dopamine circuitry Health ways. You know, healthy ways. Right. Like, You know, as you have articulated, I think, in in your podcast, getting exercise. You know, you and I both like to get exercise.[0:46:50] Dr. Robert Malenka: I feel really good. Sometimes it's painful during the exercise, but afterwards, I feel great.[0:46:57] Andrew Huberman: Very almost the inverse of of the cocaine response.[0:47:00] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Yeah.[0:47:01] Andrew Huberman: The desire and then the I hate this, but I can't wait to do it again. It seems like exercise is often the opposite. Because I hate this. I don't wanna do this. And then at Afterwards, gosh, I always feel better, and I'd be happy to do it again.[0:47:13] Dr. Robert Malenka: I mean, yes. I mean, I like to exercise chasing a ball. That because that gets me off Thinking about this hurts. But, so anyhow, back to addiction. So, yes, these drugs can cause I don't wanna definitely not permanent changes from a single exposure.[0:47:33] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, you know, and and the types of studies I'm talking about were all done In, you know, experimental animals, so how that relates to what happens in Our brains and human subjects' brains is, you know, is not completely clear, but I think there are parallels. So the changes might last, You know, a few days, a week or two, but one can see if somebody there have been Studies done where in an animal model, if you give repeated administration of a drug like cocaine, The changes get stronger and they last longer, which is kind of intuitively obvious. But, again, the big question is why, In human subjects, there are people who can use these substances and not develop a serious problem, and there are others where They're they're very, very damaging. And, you know, and then that's why I still make the point. If you're a young person, if you you're you wanna take that risk?[0:48:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: Is it worth it, to have that experience? And that's an individual decision.[0:48:44] Andrew Huberman: We've we've done some podcast episodes about alcohol, cannabis, etcetera, and there does seem to be a pretty wide variation in people's response to the information, I think, because There are people out there who well, I've I've got friends who are recovered alcoholics[0:48:57] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yes. Who are?[0:48:58] Andrew Huberman: Who will tell me the first drink they took[0:49:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yep.[0:49:01] Andrew Huberman: They use language like, You know, the it combined with the, chemistry of my body in a way that nothing before ever had, And they felt like it was like this magic elixir. Right? That has not been my experience at all. And I And I have heard[0:49:19] Dr. Robert Malenka: The same stories, and it's it's hard for me to relate because like you, alcohol does not have that effect on me. And that's where that's it's hard to believe that kind of immediate response to alcohol is due to their in the environments in which they grew up. Although that can have an influence. That just feels almost more Genetically encoded. And there is evidence that issues with the use of alcohol and developing alcohol use disorder Does run-in families.[0:49:53] Dr. Robert Malenka: And obviously, if it runs in family, you have to worry about how the environment of that family influences it. But there's a lot of studies saying there is a genetic component. Maybe like you, if I have a drink or 2 in the afternoon, I just fall asleep. Yeah. I And it does not have that effect on me.[0:50:09] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[0:50:09] Andrew Huberman: And Yeah.[0:50:10] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, and anyone could imagine similar things for other drugs of abuse. There are people who have used cocaine, have used methamphetamine, Who, you know, who find it modestly enjoyable, but it's not, you know, the be all or end all. It isn't this Credibly powerful experience. And you just talked about, I think, a a friend or a colleague who said, I hate it. I hate that, but I wanna do it again, And that's fascinating.[0:50:39] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. They're now a recovered, alcoholic and cocaine addict, and they've they've abstained for many years, but still get a little bit of a gleam in their eye when they talk about Alcohol or cocaine in a way that I just can't relate to. You know can relate.[0:50:52] Dr. Robert Malenka: I mean, can I tell you a little vignette about me, which I love to tell? Sure. Sure. And it gets into To how the reward circuitry is so closely associated with memory systems and how cues Associate it with powerful experiences, develop their own reinforcing or averse of quality. So long story short, when I was Young in I can't remember.[0:51:19] Dr. Robert Malenka: In my twenties, maybe 20, I spent a few weeks in Paris. I started smoking cigarettes. I mean, this is a Long time ago, and I got it's cigarettes are very interesting. Nicotine is highly addictive As our as the tobacco companies were fully aware of High addictive liability. Very high addictive liability.[0:51:40] Andrew Huberman: Rob people for the money to buy cigarettes?[0:51:45] Dr. Robert Malenka: They may not rob because although they're my understanding is they've become quite expensive, but I guess, what's the vote significant? Counterfeit cigarettes are a huge market for organized crime. There are Parts of our of our in the world, third world countries, where organized crime produce Counterfeit cigarettes and are making 100 of 1,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 of dollars. And So I think nicotine as it is delivered in cigarettes as you know, I mean, tobacco companies put in a lot of work To figure out the exact dose of nicotine that will make you get that kind of feeling That only lasts for a few minutes, so you wanna do it again and again. So we can talk about the and nicotine, you know, What becomes a an a problem in a specific society with addiction is not only based on the neurobiological actions, if we're talking still about drugs or substances of that substance, it's heavily influenced by the availability of the substance too.[0:52:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: But my my little story is I smoked some cigarettes in Paris. I I I I I learned why people like to smoke. It was very satisfying To have a cigarette in a Parisian cafe, it just you know, and it's very interesting because the first few times you inhale tobacco, you get Dizzy, it's kind of aversive, and it's exactly what you articulated. Despite that, you wanna do it again. So I I it was just a lot of fun for me, and I enjoyed it, and I was disciplined.[0:53:28] Dr. Robert Malenka: You know? At some point, whenever this was, I came back to the United States. I didn't smoke, because I knew it was bad for you. But to this day, 40 years later, every time I go back to Paris, I get cravings. I actually just wanna get a pack of cigarettes.[0:53:47] Dr. Robert Malenka: I want to, See have that feeling again of inhaling the smoke. But the point is of how, you know, powerful these rewarding experiences can be or reinforcing variances. And for your audience, technically, you know, what I have been taught by some of my psychology Colleagues, is we use the term reinforcing in a very behaviorally defined way. Something is reinforcing is if it the behavior that led to that stimuli, It makes you wanna do that behavior again. Rewarding means it actually felt, in quotes, good.[0:54:30] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's an important day to can be different, again, as you defined by your friend who his I forget. It I think it Cocaine. Cocaine was highly reinforcing, but it was not necessarily enjoyable or rewarding. And isn't that fascinating? I have Some colleagues in the addiction field, I one of them is retired now, Kent Berridge and Terry Robinson.[0:54:56] Dr. Robert Malenka: They they coin they distinguish between the terms wanting and liking, And think about that. Mhmm. Liking something means it's something you like, you enjoy. Wanting means you want it, but you don't necessarily like it or enjoy it. And that's a description of your friend's experience with cocaine.[0:55:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: Some of us have been in destructive relationships Where you want that individual, but you're not sure you necessarily like that individual.[0:55:33] Andrew Huberman: People will be in relationships where they actively dislike the other person Isn't that? Which is a bit foreign of a concept to me, but well, it's interesting this this separation of reinforcing and rewarding, wanting, and liking because, one of the things that's very prominent in 12 step programs[0:55:48] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[0:55:49] Andrew Huberman: Is to create rewards around Abstaining from the drug or behavior. Yep. And I should mention that programs like 12 Step, when followed, seem to have very high success rates. At least, that's what Anna Lemke tells me, That in some ways, they are modifying the wanting and liking. They're splitting the wanting and liking of, You know, alcohol, for instance, creating a a liking of sobriety more than the wanting of alcohol,[0:56:16] Dr. Robert Malenka: for instance. That's beautifully put, And I think that's right. How that plays out in the neuromechanisms that as a neuroscientist, I'm interested in it. Man, that's a tough one. But I think that's why the those programs are pretty successful.[0:56:37] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's helping the person Make those dissociations. And I I don't know that much about those programs because, you know, I have not seen Patients myself for whatever it's been 27, 28 years, but I think part of them are to help that individual find As you both other sources of liking and reward, getting some Satisfaction and reward from the actual abstinence, being able to cognitively teach themselves that I deserve a pat on the back. I deserve credit. I feel good that I did not take a drink at that party, that I did not Use that substance again, and how that plays out in our brains is a really tough one.[0:57:30] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Those are, way you described it is exactly right. Those those programs are highly reinforcing for abstinence behaviors. Yeah. Everything from the social connection, which we we're gonna get to social connection as you know, to the way that people start to conceptualize their addict self versus other self, it's actually involves a a splitting of the self in in interesting ways.[0:57:51] Andrew Huberman: As long as we're talking about donuts, cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, I'm curious, before we move to, A bit more on neuroplasticity, is there anything that people ought to know about how different substances And behaviors that are addicting might impact the dopamine reward circuitry differently. So for instance, we talked about cocaine as having this very rapid onset, big increase dopamine then a crash as we know, a certain pattern of kinetics as you describe it. The opioid crisis is is, You know, incredibly serious problem right now, as is methamphetamine, but it sounds like methamphetamine functions a bit like cocaine in in terms of its kinetics.[0:58:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yes.[0:58:36] Andrew Huberman: So an opioid is a very different chemical than cope cocaine. Mhmm. But it sounds like it impacts the dopamine system. Is the dopaminergic activity caused by opioids responsible for the addictive properties Opioids, or do people also like the feeling of being under opioids? I personally hate it coming out of surgery.[0:58:59] Andrew Huberman: Like, they gave me they gave me Vicodin once, and I I hated it. I'd rather have the pain, postoperative pain, than take something like, you know, Vicodin or or a Valium or Fentanyl or anything like that, to me, is just completely aversive. Mhmm. But I realized that there are many millions of people that feel quite differently.[0:59:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's a great question. So I think all the studies both in human beings and preclinical animal models, Yes. Which suggests that the the addictive liability of opioids and And psychostimulants, which are cocaine and methamphetamine, have the common final action of causing massive release of dopamine In this target of the dopamine neurons, the nucleus accumbens, they do it, if we we wanna get a little Scientifically technical here via very different mechanisms. So cocaine and methamphetamine, what The drugs known as psychostimulants, actually bind to a protein in the brain or a molecule in the brain That is responsible for sucking up. It's a vacuum cleaner.[1:00:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: Sucking up the dopamine after it's been released, And cocaine prevents that dopamine from being vacuumed up so the cocaine hangs around longer. Meth not only prevents The dopamine from being vacuumed up, it actually causes the reverse. It actually causes the direct release of dopamine From what we call nerve terminals from the site where dopamine's released, opioids work very differently. They actually primarily, not Solely work where the dopamine neurons live. And it's a little complicated if it's not that critical, but they Indirectly, it increased the activity within the dopamine neurons themselves causing a big massive, Bigger than normal release of dopamine.[1:01:09] Dr. Robert Malenka: So that's one commonality. But anybody who has used these drugs or read about These drugs, the subjective experience of the drugs are dramatically different, and that's because of the actions they're having, Not only in the reward circuitry, but throughout the brain. So and it it's interesting you talked about Vicodin. I've taken Vicodin because I've had several knee surgeries and things. Like you, I didn't like it.[1:01:36] Dr. Robert Malenka: I've I've gotten other opioids for pain relief that Were great. I mean, they took they took away a lot of pain after my ligament repair. And that's a different question that even when you're talking about opioids, all drugs are not are they're not identical. Fentanyl has a much big larger, addictive liability because of its molecular properties and how it's interacting With the opioid system in our brains and the receptors, the actual proteins in the brain that it interacts with, But the subjective experience of opioids, I mean, it's interesting. Some people love it.[1:02:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: That's know, if we go back in history, as you know, there were the, opium dens throughout, Asia. There were wars about opioids, the the the famous opioid wars between China and the United Kingdom. I mean, showing you how powerful, the availability of a substance like an opioid can be. So I'm I'm going off on a tangent. I apologize.[1:02:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: But commonality is dopamine release in the incumbents, but it's a if you remember what a Venn diagram is, All these drugs have some common actions usually on directly or indirectly causing the massive release of dopamine in the incumbents, but then they have their own individual actions. Because, obviously, when you take cocaine or methamphetamine, it's a stimulator. You're you know, people are grinding their teeth. They're hyped up. For most people, opioids are the exact opposite.[1:03:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: You're I mean, in opium dens from the movies I watched and watching Narcos and all those TV shows, you're often You're lying down. You're you're kind of in a almost a dreamlike state, so very different subjective experiences.[1:03:38] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of Salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now salt, magnesium, and potassium are Critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular, to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. And we now know that Even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.[1:04:11] Andrew Huberman: LMNT contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. Typically drink LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes, and while I do any kind of physical training and After physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot. And, certainly, I drink LMNT in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna because that causes quite a lot of If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element. That's l m n t.com/huberman to claim a free LMNT sample pack with your purchase.[1:04:46] Andrew Huberman: Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman. Yeah. I had an experience with, opioid recently, not, voluntarily over The Christmas holiday, we went to visit friends, and before, going to sleep, I wanted some tea. Mhmm. And I asked if they had any non caffeinated tea.[1:05:13] Andrew Huberman: The next morning, I was like, what was that tea? And I felt off in the morning. And I went it was actually a blue lotus Flour tea that is actually illegal in the United States, but it is sold, and it has morphine like, compounds in it. And I am one of those people that's very susceptible, to even low doses of any kind of novel drug.[1:05:33] Dr. Robert Malenka: You know? So some interesting.[1:05:35] Andrew Huberman: Have you[1:05:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: ever taken cough Syrup with dextromethorphan?[1:05:38] Andrew Huberman: No. So I avoid that stuff.[1:05:40] Dr. Robert Malenka: Well, I, you know, I have can. I have a tendency when I get a cold. Like, It gets into my lungs. I cough a lot. And I think this has been reported.[1:05:49] Dr. Robert Malenka: This is my anecdotal experience. I it I'm I'm confirming what you said. Dextrid Methothen is a different sort of opioid, and, actually, some people develop a problem with it. For me, it gives me really bizarre dreams, Really? But it's similar to what you were just saying?[1:06:05] Dr. Robert Malenka: Very unusual story. Different conversation about what makes us dream and what the what are the meaning of dreams. Fascinating. I hope you covered maybe you've covered that.[1:06:14] Andrew Huberman: We have not yet, but we are intending to do a whole series on sleep and dreaming, and we'll we'll definitely get into it.[1:06:20] Dr. Robert Malenka: I started out in sleep research, I have a fondness for it.[1:06:23] Andrew Huberman: Well, drug research and sleep research have a long history of overlap with, Alan Hobson's work on LSD. With Alan Hobson. Okay. By the way, folks, if you're interested in the the relationship between, hallucinations and dreaming, Alan Hobson is a good name to start your, Your rabbit knife rabbit hole.[1:06:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: Brat 19 oh my god. I'm dating myself. 19 oh, 70 I can't remember if it was 76 or 77, I worked with Alan Hopson as an undergraduate.[1:06:50] Andrew Huberman: At Harvard Medical School.[1:06:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: No. As an undergraduate at Harvard. He was at Harvard Medical School. Yeah.[1:06:54] Andrew Huberman: Amazing. I love his writing, and I learned a lot from it. Very He was really ahead of his time.[1:06:58] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yes. He was.[1:06:59] Andrew Huberman: Because, we'll get I was just[1:07:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: nobody would. Anybody who knows me won't believe this, but I back then, I was a very shy, insecure, you know, 20 year old would not[1:07:09] Andrew Huberman: have guessed.[1:07:09] Dr. Robert Malenka: Who oh, I And even in medical school, I I literally was not confident of my opinions at all. I was very shy. Wasn't Thought all of the ideas I had must be obvious, and I should never say them out loud.[1:07:23] Andrew Huberman: Do you mind if I ask, since since you raise this, I I think it's really important. I mean, you you have this Credible, career track record. I you know, you're adored by your colleagues. You're highly respected. You've won just about every reward award there is to win in neuroscience.[1:07:38] Andrew Huberman: So was there something in particular that, like, was it an overnight thing or one day you woke up and thought, you know, I actually believe in myself. If you wouldn't mind sharing that, because I think before we talk get back into some of the the science, I you know, this is science is a human endeavor, and and most people listening are probably not scientists, but think everybody deals with these issues of of of self doubt, and people appear to have varying levels of confidence, but, what what happened?[1:08:05] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's a so thank you for asking. It no. For me, it was a very gradual process, and I'm I'm not As a as an undergraduate, as a medical student, even as a postdoc, yeah, I was very unsure of my Ideas of my intellectual abilities, of whether what I was thinking was really, You know, worthwhile. So it's a very gradual process. I think it the increase in my confidence, I think, began when I was A postdoc, which is a training period after you've received a PhD or an MD where you get additional research training.[1:08:47] Dr. Robert Malenka: And I worked with a guy named Roger Nicolle at UCSF, and Roger was a very for intellectually intense, very forceful Individual, and I got involved in a field where I mean, people a little bit of a tangent. Your your your listeners may think that scientists are these geeky individuals wearing white coats With no passion or emotion and nothing could be further from the truth. The most successful scientists I know are pretty passionate and pretty intense about what they're working on and driven. I mean and this is a gross generalization. So anyhow, during my postdoc, I started getting involved in a topic Where there were vigorous arguments about phenomenology we were studying, so I had to develop A tougher and thicker skin.[1:09:48] Dr. Robert Malenka: I had to be able to argue my side of of The hypotheses we were generating. So I it started developing as a postdoc, and then it slowly evolved as an assistant professor. And for your listeners who don't know, I don't like to admit this, but I'm in my late sixties. I have been running my own lab for almost 40 years, so I have been, so gradually as an assistant professor, I realized, hey. I can do this.[1:10:20] Dr. Robert Malenka: I can do science. I can write papers that my colleagues seem to be interested in. And then gradually, you know, over then the next 10, 20, 30 years, I I gained more and more confidence. I so for me, It was this very gradual, buildup of many different experiences Where I developed some confidence that, you know, not all of my ideas are great. Of course, they're not.[1:10:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: But It's okay to voice my opinion. It's okay to state my ideas and why I believe this and why I don't believe that. So that was my experience.[1:11:03] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for sharing that because I think, you know, people struggle with the that very issue. And, Clearly, showing up again and again over a long period of time is helpful. But as you said, you know, learning to trust one's ideas. Just a brief anecdote. When I was, coming up in neuroscience a few years behind you.[1:11:22] Andrew Huberman: Not[1:11:23] Dr. Robert Malenka: too many years behind this?[1:11:24] Andrew Huberman: Not too not too many. I mean Few decades behind me. But I re recall the incredible number of high profile papers on neuroplasticity and long term potentiation, long term depression. These are terms, related to the modification of synapses, that Rob Malanca and Roger Nicole pioneered a big segment to that work. And I remember your names on papers, and I thought Roger worked for you.[1:11:49] Andrew Huberman: Sorry, Roger. I'd love I'd[1:11:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: love to hear that. I love to hear that.[1:11:53] Andrew Huberman: I was in your impression. He worked for you, And only later did I learn that you were, his postdoc.[1:11:58] Dr. Robert Malenka: So And then and then we collaborated as equals.[1:12:01] Andrew Huberman: Became peers very quick.[1:12:02] Dr. Robert Malenka: Very quickly. Yeah.[1:12:03] Andrew Huberman: So you you've had a[1:12:04] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, Roger, you know, I Roger's wonderful. I I did have the confidence even as a postdoc and, actually, even as a grad student. Even though I was a little insecure About my ideas, I wanted to be treated as an equal. That's the one thing I did have. I never felt that I was working for somebody else.[1:12:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: I always felt that I was working for myself and that we were colleagues, even though my mentors are my had more experience, and I could learn from them. But[1:12:31] Andrew Huberman: I like that that you're working for yourself even though you have mentors. I Yeah. I think there's some there's some real gems in what you just described, so thank you for Sure. Taking the time to do that. Sure.[1:12:41] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to discuss one aspect of reward circuitry that I don't think most people think about. Right? Fairly straightforward nowadays. I I like to think more people know what dopamine is and understand it, thanks to your work and Anna's work and some discussions that Taking place on our podcast, other podcast, but, you know, all too often, we think dopamine, reward, wanting, liking, drugs. Okay.[1:13:04] Andrew Huberman: All of that is great. But what about the truly adaptive stuff? Right? Because it's it's, easy to fall into a discussion around dopamine of, you know, the things that are bad for us. But what I'm thinking about here is social interaction.[1:13:19] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Clearly, we are a social species, And a lot of your work in the last, decade and a half or so[1:13:27] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yep.[1:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Has focused on the Relationship between the reward circuitry, which you beautifully described for us, and social interaction and connection. And where I'm going with this is, ultimately, this has huge implications for autism and autism spectrum disorders. Don't know if nowadays, is it okay? I I you're not supposed to call autism a disease. Is that right?[1:13:50] Andrew Huberman: You hear about neurotypical and neuroatypical, but is but I have friends who have children who are severely autistic[1:13:57] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah.[1:13:57] Andrew Huberman: And, I don't know many parents who would elect to have a severely autistic Kid.[1:14:02] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[1:14:03] Andrew Huberman: And so those people often will talk about it as autism or a child having autism. So first of all, before we get into the social piece, Maybe because I just tabled it, what it how are we supposed to talk about autism nowadays?[1:14:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: I, I I am very interested in The pathophysiology of what the medical profession terms autism spectrum disorder, as you pointed out, The individuals living with an autism spectrum disorder are quite heterogeneous, And it it it it can range from individuals with severe intellectual impairments And quite severe impairments in social interactions, impairments in sensory processing, Impairments in in lots of different aspects of our behaviors that are important, and I think nobody would say Would argue those individuals on the severe spectrum do not have some sort of, in quotes, disorder. The issue we have to be sensitive to is it's it's a heterogeneous disorder like many Brain issues that psychiatrists deal with like depression. We all, like obsessive compulsive disorder like various anxiety disorders, it's always on a continuum and a spectrum. So for autism spectrum disorder, There are individuals who are high functioning, who one could argue have a different Style of interacting socially may have a different way of processing sensory information, but Who have who would prefer not to be viewed as having an illness, but rather would be viewed as having a different Style of living and interaction, and I think we need to respect that.[1:16:02] Dr. Robert Malenka: So the challenge is, again, Not oversimplifying a complex, heterogeneous disorder, And both being respectful of the people who don't wanna be defined as having a neuropsychiatric or brain disorder while equally being of people like your friends with severely impaired children who deserve help, who deserve research, And it's a tough one because, my understanding from to be honest, just reading articles in the lay press and going to websites From organizations that philanthropically support research related to autism, within that community of Individuals who are not researchers, but who are have family members or are themselves Dealing with some degree of autism spectrum disorder, there's disagreements about how to what terminology to use, How to deal with them. And it's complicated. I think we just have to respect everybody. And if you're interacting With individuals, you you you know, I think it's appropriate. What do you prefer?[1:17:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm. I do know, but as a medical professional, There and especially when you're dealing with children, there are children who need help. And I I I we're not doing them a service by saying they don't have an issue that we should be helping them with and working on. So I hope that answers your[1:17:37] Andrew Huberman: question. Beautifully. Yeah. I think it beautifully answers it and encompasses all sides, so that we can move forward. And I think we'll so as we use the term, autism or children or people with autism, That's what we're referring to.[1:17:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: I think people are very sensitive, especially those individuals who are neuroatypical, who Previously might be diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder, but would prefer to not be labeled as having a brain illness. That that's fine. It's kind of once you are an adult, you can make that decision for yourself.[1:18:14] Andrew Huberman: And we certainly have colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere who, at least by my nonclinical assessment, seem to fall somewhere on that spectrum.[1:18:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, again, it's a continuum just like, you know, the experience of depression is in a continuum, but alright.[1:18:27] Andrew Huberman: Right. And as with depression, you wouldn't love a child or an adult any less because they have depression, nor would you love a child or adult any less, because of, expression of some autism symptoms.[1:18:37] Dr. Robert Malenka: I know the point. I people don't you know? And so we we have been we are being trained in the medical profession to be very for you know, and our society is going this way to very careful With the terms we use and the labeling of individuals, so, you you know, I've been taught you can say Individuals living with an autism spectrum disorder, some people don't like using a term of that individual is autistic Because that has some can have some I don't wanna say derogatory meaning, but some labeling kind of. But, You know, sometimes this gets out of control too as we both know.[1:19:18] Andrew Huberman: Well, for sake of fluid conversation, we will do our best, but, we will acknowledge from the outset that we are well meaning but far from perfect in in how we'll handle this. Well put.[1:19:28] Dr. Robert Malenka: Well put.[1:19:28] Andrew Huberman: So in thinking about social interactions and leaving aside anything related to autism for the moment, It appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend time with others of the same species, maybe even with other species like a dog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable. They we were born with the capacity to build them up.[1:19:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[1:19:52] Andrew Huberman: And that social behavior is highly rewarded. Is it rewarded through the dopamine system? And what if any involvement is there of the serotonergic system? And we haven't talked about serotonin yet, but I'd love to Bring up serotonin at this point. Maybe you could educate us a little bit about serotonin because, gosh, if dopamine is fascinating, serotonin is at least as Incredible.[1:20:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Great question. So I I think for me, the easiest way for me to answer it is actually just tell you My research history and how a lab like mine at Stanford that at one point was studying What I what you and I would call fairly hardcore molecular mechanisms of neuroplasticity, how do Connections between nerve cells change and what molecules are changing and Pretty hardcore molecular stuff. How did I end up studying social behaviors in mice, and what I hope we'll end up talking about, Even developing behavioral models of what I will define as empathy in mice. The answer is very simple.[1:21:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: My lab was working on Roles of classic dopamine reward circuitry and how it changes in models of addiction. We haven't talked about depression models of depression because just intuitively, hopefully, your listeners can understand if one component of depression is What we call anhedonia, the inability to experience reward. You know, eating a doughnut is no longer satisfying. Having sex is no longer that Much fun, which is a component of depression. If there's a mechanism in the brain that tells you something is rewarding, By definition, that's not functioning normally in severe depression, so we were doing models of depression to figure out how the dopamine Reward circuitry was changing as were many other labs.[1:21:52] Dr. Robert Malenka: We were studying addiction. Those were the obvious ones. And, mean, it might be entertaining to the to your audience to learn how academic scientists think. I was thinking those are fascinating topics. They're pretty competitive.[1:22:07] Dr. Robert Malenka: Lots of other labs were working on it, and I started thinking what other Experiences might be modifying the reward circuitry. I actually made some attempts to look at feeding behavior, but I don't wanna, mean, we actually never pursued that for a variety of reasons, and that's obviously important because of there is an obesity epidemic in this country, and we can talk about how the reward circuitry and some of the things we've learned from our studies of addiction may Be helpful to understanding obesity. But back to social interaction, I started thinking, well, for most of us, What I call a prosocial nonsexual experience is highly reinforcing. Andrew, you're a pretty social guy. I'm a pretty social guy.[1:22:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: Most of the time, I'd rather go to a movie, a sporting event, a dinner With friends. It's, you know, actually for me, the most meaningful component of my life other than spending time with my children is spending time with my close friends. And I started thinking, well, why is that? Why do I have such a good time Going to a ballgame with my best friend or going out to dinner with another couple, and interacting, It's because, well, it's highly reinforcing, and if it's highly reinforcing, it must involve the reward circuitry. And then I started thinking evolutionarily, it makes a lot of tense because if you are part of a social species, there's a lot of evolutionarily, a lot of Advantages for your survival to be hanging out with other members of your species in a nonaggressive way.[1:23:57] Dr. Robert Malenka: It can increase your likelihood to find a mate and reproduce. It can protect you from predators. I mean, that's why any of your listeners who ever watch, you know, wildlife shows or National Geographic shows, There's a reason all these animals hang out together. It's for protection from predators. So there are all these reasons.[1:24:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: So About whenever it was 13 or 14 years ago, my lab decided to start looking at how the reward circuitry may Play a role in what I am gonna call positive prosocial, nonaggressive interactions. Another word we use is just sociability. And for a variety of reasons back then this is God, this is at least 13 years ago, maybe 15 years ago. A postdoc joined my lab named Gul Dolan. She's now a professor at Johns Hopkins, and she had an interest in oxytocin.[1:25:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: And as your listeners know, Oxytocin is this evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that's very important for parturition, the Having a baby born from milk being produced, and it's gotten a lot of attention as a potential love neuropeptide Tide is something that is released in our brains during a positive social interaction. There's a a well known Researcher in social behavior and bonding research called Larry Young. And he did Some very important, now somewhat classic work studying a species called the vole, in particular, the prairie vole. And prairie voles are a species where they mate for life. It's called pair bonding.[1:25:53] Dr. Robert Malenka: So 1 vole will find another vole. They basically get married. They have Kids, and they're they hang out together for the rest of their life.[1:26:01] Andrew Huberman: No divorce no 50% divorce rate.[1:26:04] Dr. Robert Malenka: 50% divorce rate. And what Larry elegantly showed, in part in early days in collaboration with a guy named Tom Insoll, who is a famous academic psychiatrist, they showed that oxytocin action within the nucleus accumbens, within this reward circuitry, was Required and really important for this monogamous pair bonding. Having said that, There was just a paper that called into question that, but but that's But there's 30 years of research prior[1:26:38] Andrew Huberman: to that, and I'm glad you brought that up because, we'll keep this Contemporary in the that the reality is that that recent paper got a lot of attention. You know[1:26:45] Dr. Robert Malenka: the paper in terms[1:26:46] Andrew Huberman: of the paper? Oxytocin isn't playing as prominent role in pair bonding as people Thought. And yet, folks, that could be true. We we have to be scientific about this and be open minded, but There's, you know, 3 decades of work, that that speaks to the contrary. So I think we wanna be a lit we wanna weigh the evidence.[1:27:04] Andrew Huberman: We want[1:27:04] Dr. Robert Malenka: yeah. Exactly. And, again, the the investigators who presented the work saying oxytocin may not be as important, there are limitations to the manipulations they did, which they would agree with. So I'm just telling you so Guldolin was a postdoc in my lab, and we decide we formulated a project to look at the actions of oxytocin In the nucleus accumbens in mice and the reason we study mice is you they're what are known as a genetic genetically tractable a bowl organism. We have all sorts of really cool and sophisticated tricks we can do to probe Brain circuitry, the actions of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin In ways that we can't do in other species, and I'm gonna get back to dopamine in a second.[1:27:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: And what we found was that oxytocin action in the nucleus accumbens was indeed important For promoting sociability, probably for promoting the reinforcing component of a social interaction, and that surprised us. You know? It was like, wow. It's it's oxytocin seems to be causing Enhancing the release of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens, and that will will I'm perhaps we'll get to this. That led me off on a whole series of experiments trying to figure out how serotonin works, Studying this drug we may talk about called MDMA, which is ecstasy or moly, which actually causes release of serotonin.[1:28:46] Dr. Robert Malenka: So we did that work and that got us working in serotonin. Simultaneously, there were some other papers reporting that dopamine Release in the incumbents. That dopamine is released in the incumbents during a social interaction, a positive nonaggressive social interaction. Truth be told, it may also be released during an aggressive interaction.[1:29:08] Andrew Huberman: Some people like to fight.[1:29:10] Dr. Robert Malenka: Some people like to fight. And The difference here is the dopamine release and its role in social interactions, it's not specific only for social interaction as we have talked about, But nevertheless, that led my lab and other labs to do a series of papers. I'm talking about the field now showing that, And I'm giving you a lot of information here. So how might dopamine release happen during a nonaggressive social interaction? It turns out that oxytocin is not only released in the nucleus accumbens, it's released in the home of the dopamine neurons in the VTA.[1:29:52] Dr. Robert Malenka: So my lab and another lab from Northwestern showed that oxytocin can actually modulate Dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area. So I hope I'm making sense here. I don't wanna get too technical, but it just shows how the you know, We discussed these neuromodulators like dopamine. I just brought in oxytocin. We're gonna talk about serotonin in a second.[1:30:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: Unfortunately, for your listeners, they don't work in isolation. They commune they influence each other in ways That I think it's important for us to understand and elucidate.[1:30:30] Andrew Huberman: That is not too much technical detail, I think it's wonderfully rich with areas for us to discuss, and I'm so very glad that you brought up that neither dopamine nor serotonin nor work in isolation because all too often and, admittedly, sometimes even on my podcast, I'll talk about these things in isolation as a way to try and simplify them a bit, but There's just no way that the brain works that way. You know, for instance, turning on dopamine and turning off serotonin, it's a weighting of of inputs. And I think that serotonin perhaps I should frame it this way. Just as often as dopamine is framed as this reward molecule and pleasure and dopamine hits, All too often, I think, in the popular press, serotonin is discussed and oxytocin too for that matter as this Kind of warm, feel good, everything's mellow, you know, not really associated with a reward and reinforcement. Mhmm.[1:31:24] Andrew Huberman: And, of course, it's not that simple. So When it comes to social interactions, it sounds like oxytocin and serotonin are playing a prominent role[1:31:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[1:31:33] Andrew Huberman: Also in the incumbents. Mhmm. And that dopamine is is activated too.[1:31:38] Dr. Robert Malenka: Do I[1:31:38] Andrew Huberman: have that right? Okay. So, I don't wanna take us too far down the rabbit hole of neural circuit Function, but that to me, makes at least a brief discussion about the nucleus accumbens itself. Yeah. Interesting.[1:31:51] Andrew Huberman: Like okay. So I'm thinking nucleus. I know that means a pile of neurons, an aggregation of neurons. It's talking to this ventral striatum. So we got a bunch of part[1:31:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: of the ventral striatum. It's like it's a subdivision of[1:32:02] Andrew Huberman: Excuse me. Yep. I misspoke. Yep. Yeah.[1:32:04] Andrew Huberman: It's part of the ventral striatum, and it's, and and the neurons there can be active and communicate with other brain areas, but we're talking about a lot of nuance of function.[1:32:13] Dr. Robert Malenka: Oh, man.[1:32:14] Andrew Huberman: So I'm not I'm[1:32:15] Dr. Robert Malenka: smiling. I don't know if your audience is gonna see me smile because it's so I I sometimes go to bed feeling, and it's so Complicated. Oh my god.[1:32:23] Andrew Huberman: It is. And yet and yet could we say that within the nucleus accumbens, there are neurons that are acting as, Accelerators and brakes. Mhmm. I mean, is there a simple analogy that, perhaps while not exhaustive, can still be true. Because that's always the goal on this podcast.[1:32:38] Andrew Huberman: There's no way we can be exhaustive, but we want to be as accurate as possible.[1:32:42] Dr. Robert Malenka: So a very influential hypothesis, which has guided my thinking. And, again, the trick I mean, you know, you have done a wonderful job of communicating complex scientific topics to your podcast audience, and I congratulate you on that. And it's a really it's a really important role, but as you know, It's always more complicated than we want it to be as scientists, especially when you're dealing with brain Activity issues and how the brain mediates all its amazing functions. So historically, we have thought about the Nucleus accumbens and other components of this ventral striatal brain area As primarily being composed to 2 different cell types, and as you pointed out, one being sort of an accelerator, Something that promotes certain behaviors, and then the other cell type somewhat being a break, Saying don't do that behavior. Don't perform that motor action.[1:33:55] Dr. Robert Malenka: And it it is True that there are these different cell types. It is true that they are modulated by these modulators, like dopamine and serotonin, In different ways, and that simplistic hypothesis or we call it, has been very useful in making models about how the incumbents does all its wonderful things. What I'm leading up to is it's it unfortunately, it's a little more complicated. But, yes, it's there are 2 different cell types. And at least for your audience, we can think about dopamine driving the activity of 1, promoting certain behaviors, And inhibiting the activity of the other cell type and being a sort of break on certain behaviors, As long as you and I as scientists appreciate, it's not quite that simple.[1:34:52] Dr. Robert Malenka: Sure. It's a little more complicated.[1:34:54] Andrew Huberman: So using that as a framework To think about social behavior, as you said, you know, prosocial, nonaggressive[1:35:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[1:35:03] Andrew Huberman: Nonsexual interactions Yeah. Involve the choice of a lot of behaviors Yep. But also the suppression of a lot of behaviors. Yep. And, and so maybe you you're starting to sense what I'm doing here.[1:35:13] Andrew Huberman: I'm I I think for people to understand how a single structure like the accumbens could mediate social interaction and reward it, what It sounds like it's doing is rewarding a certain category or and catalog of behavioral options and punishing or at least reducing the probability of the occurrence of other behavioral actions. Because when I go to dinner with friends, if I know them really well[1:35:36] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah.[1:35:37] Andrew Huberman: Might hug them. I might even say something mildly inappropriate. Yeah. And if I know the context to be safe Yeah. Right?[1:35:44] Andrew Huberman: But at a Dinner interview or discussion with Yeah. Somebody, you know, I barely know, I might watch my words a little bit more Yep. For instance.[1:35:52] Dr. Robert Malenka: And I think the incumbents and its associated cert I love the way you just put that probabilities. It's my probability of Having this behavior in a certain context is increased. My the probabilities of not doing certain behaviors, And the I think there's little doubt that this brain area called the nucleus accumbens and all of its associated circuitry Play a very important role in what behaviors you choose to do, pursue, Play a very important role in these making the decision and performing these prosocial, nonaggressive, nonsexual interactions. I actually also think it plays a role in empathy in, leading you there. I wanna have a discussion about that.[1:36:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: Please. Again, there As a mechanistically driven neuroscientist, what is frustrating for me is I I know a lot of the connections it's making and the other brain areas it's communicating with, but I can't give you a coherent Hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens. Yeah. You know? Yeah.[1:37:02] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You're still going.[1:37:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: What I can say is Even at our current level of understanding, it is leading to novel hypotheses that are allowing the you know, you know, if we we bring it back to autism, that are allowing The development of novel, at the at the moment, pharmacologic therapeutics that might be helpful For people who are not having normal prosocial interactions and would like to have them, would like to be able to Funk function in that domain in a more adaptive and productive and meaningful way, and that's the important of the the importance in my view have the kind of mechanistic work my lab and many other labs around the country are doing. Even if we don't have a detailed Understanding of how it's all happening, we can identify drugs and druggable targets Or even behavioral interventions that might actually help people. For for example, suffering from autism spectrum disorder Of the sort that they actually want and need interact need therapeutic help.[1:38:20] Andrew Huberman: I think looking at, the Social connection circuitry, through the lens of autism is gonna be very interesting for us to do. I do have a question about What is being selected for in rewarding social interactions? Because, obviously, we are living in a time where, You know, we don't have to aggregate in groups necessarily to protect ourselves physically.[1:38:42] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah.[1:38:43] Andrew Huberman: It helps in certain ways, in certain circumstances, but, Certainly, to support ourselves and each other emotionally, you know, having people that we can call on when we're not feeling so well Mhmm. That we can look to, for resources and that they can look to us. But when we go out to dinner with friends or we go to a ballgame with friends or we interact with friends, I'm very familiar with of like, well, that felt really good. It just felt good. It gives me energy.[1:39:07] Andrew Huberman: It actually gives me energy to go back and do other things like spend 4 days alone, with a bunch of papers and lectures preparing for a podcast, which I also really enjoy.[1:39:16] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm. But[1:39:18] Andrew Huberman: when I do that, when I go out to dinner with friends or see friends, I'm not thinking about buffering myself against loneliness when I do it. I just like the interaction. So, What sorts of, evolutionary hypotheses can we come up with as to why the human brain is so tuned For these social interactions, why it's rewarded by not just 1, dopamine, but also Serotonin. Serotonin and oxygen. Three Prominent neuromodulatory, chemicals in the brain are devoted at one site in the brain and others that it's connected to, of course, but to making sure that we do this as often as possible without giving up Yeah.[1:39:59] Andrew Huberman: The rest of our lives.[1:40:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: Well, I mean, again, I I think the answer I'm gonna be able to give, I hope it's not trite, and it may be a little bit obvious is and it it it in some ways, it's it's it's Analogous to why drugs of abuse and addiction are also a problem is that The circuitry that is telling us a prosocial positive interaction is so highly reinforcing evolved over, you know, 1000000 of years or 100 of 1000 of years, whatever that that is. And I the only hypothesis I can come up with, and, Andrew, you may be able to come up with better ones is what I alluded to earlier is that it was very adaptive when we were more Primitive organisms, never mind nonhuman primates, but when we were whatever we were to be a social species, for basically, primarily two reasons, for reproductive purposes, It increased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species in a nonaggressive way, and for protection against predators. There may be other reasons. Probably child rearing too. Oh, yeah.[1:41:19] Dr. Robert Malenka: Thank you.[1:41:20] Andrew Huberman: In in your absence, you want Trusted friends that can watch your offspring.[1:41:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: Thank you. Yeah. Very good point. So the circuits, the modulators we use, that evolved over millennia. And as you Pointed out, you know, eventually I mean, depending on the society in which you live, You didn't need those social interactions for protection against predators.[1:41:46] Dr. Robert Malenka: Although, know, if we look at our world now, one can make arguments both ways. If you're in a war zone, is it better to be off by yourself? Is it better to Be with a group of people. But so they the the mechanisms evolved for one purpose, and they don't just disappear Because there's no disadvantage to having this mechanism that tells us that social interaction is reinforcing, And I would still argue there's benefit for reproductive purposes. You can't have kids if you're by yourself All the time.[1:42:20] Dr. Robert Malenka: Well, and[1:42:20] Andrew Huberman: this is[1:42:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: actually think it's impossible Right. At least currently. And you can't find a partner with whom to have kids If you're socially isolated, oh, it makes it much harder. So I hope I'm answering your question. I think And then and then as you pointed out, the you know, for many of us, there's a lot of positive aspects To having friendships and hanging out with your friends, emotional support, emotional buffering.[1:42:49] Dr. Robert Malenka: And feeling connected.[1:42:50] Andrew Huberman: There's something about this notion of feeling connected, I'm, and later, we'll talk about psychedelics, but Yeah. Yeah. This notion of feeling connected, has a lot to do with buffering loneliness[1:42:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: when we are alone.[1:43:00] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The memories and the and the energy, when we are alone. Yeah. The memories and the and the energy, for lack of a better word, that we feel in recalling Social experiences, and anticipating social experiences is really powerful. You you mentioned, that, you know, that people can't have children if they spend all their time alone.[1:43:19] Andrew Huberman: It's actually I realize you're not on social media, and more more power to you, but this is actually a prominent discussion on social media. You know, there's Higher culture of young people, in particular, young men these days who, at least from what I understand in the The research literature about this are socially isolated, spending all their time online, maybe not even on social media, but are spending a lot of time online, video games Hiding in electronic landscapes, digital landscapes, and concern about mental health issues there, etcetera, concern about porn overuse and addiction there, etcetera. But social media itself is an Credible phenomenon to consider in light of everything we're talking about.[1:44:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[1:44:05] Andrew Huberman: I can't say even though I am on The social all social media platforms, and I you know, quite active there. I can't say that I've ever been on social media and experience the kind of delight and thrill and persistent energy, increase that I experience with in person interaction. And yet social media, I have to assume, is capitalizing on some of these same reward mechanisms in, presumably, the nucleus accumbens.[1:44:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yep.[1:44:32] Andrew Huberman: So, are there any data I realize this is a hard experiment to do in mice, maybe impossible. Are there any data that you're aware of that, it shows that social media has a high addictive liability, or do we even need an experiment?[1:44:47] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I'm not sure we need an experiment. I think it clearly does. I agree with the point you're making, although Your your podcast audience probably doesn't know who I am. I am in my late sixties. I grew up Well,[1:45:01] Andrew Huberman: they know who you are now.[1:45:02] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. I grew up before Computers before cell phones. So I still am a believer, perhaps in an old fashioned way, That physical interpersonal reactions are really important. Mhmm. Obviously, there are Advantages to being able to interact over social media, and I I mean, for for all sorts of reasons, there's a lot of Positive and good from that.[1:45:31] Dr. Robert Malenka: But back to your question, can we get addicted? I I can't speak to social media. I can speak, and Anna Lemke, You know, I think can is much more able to eloquently describe the issues around you. I can just talk from my own experience that My cell phone is, and check you know, I this isn't social media, but checking my email messages, checking my texting, My text messages has a for me, has a compulsive addictive quality. It's like a lever press.[1:46:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's like a lever press for a mouse. And it it I and part of that is my own personality. Part of that is the immediate feedback. So You get from a social media post from seeing your name mentioned, getting a message from one of your friends. Sure.[1:46:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: You know, I like getting messages from my friends. It means they're thinking about me. It means I'm part of their world. I have no doubt It's activating my reward circuitry, not nearly to the degree that a hit of cocaine or an opioid would do. So I don't know what else to say about it.[1:46:48] Dr. Robert Malenka: I, I I think as a society, we we have to be aware of these issues, and it's really Complicated how we manage, especially, you know, once you're an adult, you make your own decisions for better or worse. But, know, it's a huge issue, obviously, for anybody who has children or is planning to have children.[1:47:11] Andrew Huberman: And adults on social media. I mean, I see Lots of accounts of of people that are 18 and older who they spend a lot of time on there, and and I'm not necessarily saying that's bad thing. A lot of people have entire careers that exist on social media. It just seems to me that, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter have Capitalized on this hardwired circuitry. App The release of ox I mean, to make it really reductionist, the release of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin By virtue of someone saying something to us, maybe not even a positive thing.[1:47:43] Andrew Huberman: Maybe it's a a a negative thing.[1:47:45] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I[1:47:45] Andrew Huberman: As you said, they're thinking of us. There's something about Being recognized by others, and maybe this is a good seg we're heading towards empathy Yeah. Here, a discussion about empathy.[1:47:54] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I think that's very well put that, you know, It is capitalizing on these more primitive neurobiological mechanisms that evolved For purposes of reproduction and survival, I think that's certainly has to be the case. And I think it's important I mean, thank you for bringing that up for us as a society to be at least aware of this. And it it doesn't mean it's it's like many things. It's not all good. It's not all bad.[1:48:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: It has there are positive uses of social media, I can see. But, you know, Mostly, we read about the the dangers of it. We read about these kids who are socially isolated, to make bad decisions based on what they're seeing with social media. But anyhow, back to the neuro neuroscience. You're absolutely correct.[1:48:45] Dr. Robert Malenka: It's capitalizing on these mechanisms, that evolved for physical interpersonal react interactions Because the our evolution didn't anticipate it.[1:48:58] Andrew Huberman: Right. Just as pornography is is capitalizing on the sexual arousal Absolutely. Reward circuit, Associate rewards[1:49:04] Dr. Robert Malenka: or question about it.[1:49:04] Andrew Huberman: Right. And yet[1:49:05] Dr. Robert Malenka: Just as the gambling industry does. I mean, as you know, the, you know, the the Vegas casinos Have full time people developing algorithms for how frequently should a slot machine pay off? What you know, what's the perfect amount of payoff to keep certain individuals coming back?[1:49:26] Andrew Huberman: So pernicious. Yeah. Someone,[1:49:28] Dr. Robert Malenka: You[1:49:28] Andrew Huberman: could tell I've been spending a lot of time around addicts and former addicts. I've been researching some some things for the podcast. And A gambling addict,[1:49:37] Dr. Robert Malenka: told[1:49:37] Andrew Huberman: me something interesting. They said, you know, the the real stinger with being a gambling addict is that the next time really could Change everything. Sure. Whereas no alcoholic says that, that the next drink could change everything for the better. Or, you know, the the cocaine addict doesn't think, oh, you know, the next line of cocaine could could make all of life better now and forever, whereas the gambling addict actually holds in mind the infinitesimally small Yeah.[1:50:01] Andrew Huberman: And yet, real potential that the next time really could wipe out their debt and prep perhaps wipe out And And yet we know they would lose that 2. Right? Whatever winnings they have.[1:50:11] Dr. Robert Malenka: And casinos are fully aware of this. I have been told by friends who know, they have they they Employ, you know, full time quantitative, you know, for lack of a better term. Well, I I was gonna say computer geek. I don't mean to that the, an an anthropologist or and neuro I would be amazed if they don't have neuroscientists who have expertise in what's called neuroeconomics or behavioral economics. I'm 95% sure that has to be the case.[1:50:45] Andrew Huberman: Well, yeah, I occasionally sit down to the roulette table because I just Yeah. So fast and easy, and not long ago, actually, I had the experience of winning, fairly not not a large sum, but a but a meaningful sum of money. Fun. And I'll tell you, My sole mission at that point was to get up and go back to my room and and not stop at another table. And I confess I pulled one brief Stop.[1:51:06] Andrew Huberman: At another table, played 1 hand and then and lost it, and then just got back to my room as quickly as possible and then left Las Vegas as quickly as Possible. Yeah. Gambling is But they'll probably get me the next time.[1:51:16] Dr. Robert Malenka: So Gambling is a you know? And, again, it it it's all gets back to this reward circuitry and the, Intermittent re intermittent rewards are very, very powerful.[1:51:27] Andrew Huberman: Well and you mentioned earlier that the the reward system is powerfully tuned to remember what were the behaviors that led up the rewarding experience. And and nobody nobody ever won on the at the roulette or craps table or poker table, by getting up and Leaving. Yeah. Yeah. Right?[1:51:41] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. I guess my brain was just thinking, well, how did I win? I won by sitting down and putting chips on the table, Not by going back to my room.[1:51:49] Dr. Robert Malenka: Exactly. Exactly.[1:51:50] Andrew Huberman: And yet I have, you know, there are a number of degrees, and I like to think my prefrontal cortex is working, and yet it was still Challenging in that moment.[1:51:58] Dr. Robert Malenka: Gambling is really inter I mean, yeah, an another human activity that's quite Complicated. It it can be enjoyable, or it can be incredibly damaging. Yeah.[1:52:09] Andrew Huberman: And now people are gonna think I was that gambling addict that I was referred to, but I swear I'm not. Fortunately, I feel very blessed that that's not my addiction. I'd like to talk about empathy and use That is a framework for eventually returning to our discussion of autism. But, you have this perhaps long standing interest, but Recent research interest in empathy. Tell me about this work.[1:52:32] Andrew Huberman: I'm not familiar with it[1:52:33] Dr. Robert Malenka: yet. So I am gonna I'm gonna, I hope it's okay dragging the some work I've done on this drug called MDMA because it is related. So we were working on, in my lab, social behaviors, positive prosocial behaviors, that Stimulated me to start thinking about what are components of a positive prosocial nonaggressive interaction. A a a common key component of that is having some empathy and compassion for The individuals you're hanging out with, and it is a topic I've been interested in for many, many decades. I was once a psychiatrist, And to get on my, whatever the word is, hobby horse, I look at the world today.[1:53:26] Dr. Robert Malenka: I try to be optimistic. Again, I am a child of the sixties seventies. When I look at the world and, I actually just did a trip to Israel to give a series of lectures, and I look at the Israeli Palestinian conflict. What always enters my mind is I've felt this way for decades is What is more important for the survival of the human species than empathy and compassion, than actually Being able to look at another human being even if they look different than you, even if they have a different belief system than you, what is more important than Actually, understanding that 98% of your life is very is is is very similar. You know, it you have some differences in how you look and the beliefs you have, but there's so much in common.[1:54:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: So what's more important than Understanding that when another person is suffering, their suffering is the same as your suffering with, And having compassion for somebody. So I I started thinking, what is more important? And I'm not a politician. As you know, Andrew, I have no social media presence. I figured the only way I might be able to contribute to efforts that might help you, the human species, Enhance empathy and compassion is by studying the neurobiological underpinnings of it.[1:54:53] Dr. Robert Malenka: And I didn't realize I might be able to do that until I started studying sociability or prosocial behaviors in mice. And then I was, able to have a young Woman scientist, and I wanna give her credit, Monique Smith. You might wanna have Monique on your podcast. She's a she's a dynamo. She's now an assistant professor At UCSD, where you once was.[1:55:23] Dr. Robert Malenka: And Monique introduced me to a series of behavioral assays that I like to use that I like to use the phrase, they are measurements. They are behavioral antecedents of empathy. Because In the world of psychologists and people who use the term empathy, it has a lot of different meanings to different people. I'm using it basically to mean one member of a species manifests some Behavior that indicates it is being influenced by the emotional state or what we call the state effective with an a of another member of that species in its immediate environment. In in in for human interactions, I just think of, you know, any of we were talking about friendships.[1:56:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: Any of us who watch a close friend suffer, it's hard. You wanna do anything you can to help them. That's empathy. A mother with their child, a good mother, hopefully. You know, when you have a kid who is sick, there's nothing worse as a Parent, you just wanna take that pain and suffering away.[1:56:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: That's how I'm defining empathy. So it's my belief that, Like any complex human behavior, there are are evolutionary reasons why that has been adaptive and important and maintained. And if it's evolutionarily evolved, there are ways of studying it in more primitive organisms like mice. So I'll tell you some of the behavioral assays we're doing. 1 is and I I get a kick out of this, because it's it's pretty new for me.[1:57:09] Dr. Robert Malenka: So one assay and we we published a paper in a journal called Science about this, Which is if you take 1 mouse and in a ethical way, you put it in pain, you make its hind paw, One of its paws, one of its feet hurt a modest amount, and you take another mouse and you let that, what's known as the bystander mouse, Just hang out with the mouse that's in pain for 1 hour, just 1 hour. The bystander mouse who has experienced no Physical injury whatsoever will manifest behaviors indicating it is now in pain, And it lasts maybe 4 to 20 hours, but think about that. A mouse just hang a mouse that is normal hanging out with another mouse in pain Starts feeling pain itself, and they and the mice are able to see one another happening? And A lot more work needs to be done on it. Monique and her previous colleagues and others, one component of it is probably An olfactory cue or what we call a pheromone So the mouth that's in pain is secreting an odor?[1:58:26] Dr. Robert Malenka: Probably. Probably. Because you can take bedding From mice in pain and expose the bystander mice. So that's one thing, and I had never heard of these behavioral assays. We developed our and this is pretty cool, and then I'll tell you 2 others, and then I'll tell you how it connects to reward circuitry.[1:58:44] Dr. Robert Malenka: We developed a novel assay, which is the social transfer of pain relief. Pain relief is called analgesia, And I thought this was pretty cool. So you take and this is in this paper that was published in Science a year ago. You take 2 mice, And they're both in pain, modest pain. I don't want your listeners to get upset.[1:59:08] Dr. Robert Malenka: We are not hurting these mice too badly, and it is a tricky issue. Is it, you know, is it okay to put a mouse in pain so you can the goal is to develop better treatments for human beings in pain, obviously. So you have 2 mice in modest pain. You give 1 mice mouse morphine, so it's now analgesic. It is no longer experiencing pain.[1:59:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: You take another mouse that's in pain, and you just let it hang out With the mouse that is no longer in pain, and the mouse that is in pain will show behaviors indicating it It is experiencing analgesia. It is no longer in as much pain. Now think about that. And there's actually evidence From human studies that I can't speak to in any comprehensive way where I mean, it's called social buffering of pain. If you are I mean, to be honest, I've been having some neck pain just because I'm an old guy, and I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.[2:00:11] Dr. Robert Malenka: And if I'm by myself, I focus on that pain and it bothers me more. If I'm in a social socially engaged, I I think it's not only that I'm not paying as much attention to the pain, but I think there's actually some relief from what's known as the social buffering of pain. So[2:00:29] Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm no hippie, but I actually think that, all species, including humans, are secreting molecules mainly Odorants that are perhaps even acting directly as as analgesics. And I can make that statement with Without worrying too much that people think I'm completely crazy, because we had, Noam Sobol on the podcast from Wiseman who shared with us, You know, not 1, not 2, but at least a dozen ways in which humans are making molecules, typically odors, and communicating those to one another to powerfully impact their testosterone levels, their vasopressin levels, their immune molecules. Doubt. You know? And of course, Noam works on olfaction, so he's going to be biased toward that system, but that's just one slice of the sensory array.[2:01:19] Andrew Huberman: I mean, what about the The the way that somebody can look at us in a way that that makes us feel good on a normal day, well, when we're in pain, just even the touch to a shoulder can mean a lot. Yeah. I remember going to meetings when I was a Early neuroscientists, and I'd I would probably at that point of of of, you know, not Been the type to just walk up and say hello to you because I wasn't in your field, and you're this luminary and stuff. But but I remember as I started I'm[2:01:43] Dr. Robert Malenka: a good guy,[2:01:43] Andrew Huberman: by the way. You are. Very, very good.[2:01:46] Dr. Robert Malenka: I always say hi to everyone.[2:01:48] Andrew Huberman: I know you are, and that that statement was a reflection on you. I know you are. Reflection on you.[2:01:52] Dr. Robert Malenka: I know.[2:01:52] Andrew Huberman: But as I advanced through my career, what I found was, know, you'd give a talk or something, and someone in your field more senior to you who you respected, would give a nod or something. Those nods mean a lot. Absolutely. Nods could Carry you a long distance. I mean, obviously, we wanna be intrinsically driven to do the work we do, but but the social communication[2:02:10] Dr. Robert Malenka: social species.[2:02:10] Andrew Huberman: I think there's a Whole landscape of things. So what you're describing Yes. Is incredible, but I think makes a ton of sense.[2:02:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yep. So we have the social transfer pain of analgesia. We're working on and there's a little bit of evidence in the literature suggesting this might work, And then I'll talk about reward circuitry and maybe MDMA and is it an empathogen or not and how that might influence therapeutic efforts autism, we're working on behavioral models. We're we're asking the question, will 1 mouse behave To give another mouse a reward, so it's the mouse that's behaving that has to press a bar or nose poke or even experience the shock, will the mouse do that simply to get give one of its buddies a reward? Pure all truth.[2:03:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, yeah, it's pure it's it's what we call the generosity, a generosity assay. In early days, it looks like it might be working. We I don't, and that's a generosity essay. We can also ask the question, will a mouse work so another mouse doesn't get a shock, doesn't get hurt, which is compassion. And I think these things are gonna be working, and whether you wanna call that empathy, I would call that those are behaviors I like to use the term behavioral antecedents of how we define empathy in human beings.[2:03:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: And the connection to reward circuitry and and the little bit of work we have done on this is We presented evidence that these behaviors we call the social transfer of pain, 1 mouse experiencing pain just hanging out with another mouse In pain, who's has that pain relief, it seems to involve one component of the complex brain mechanisms, Seems to involve a part of the brain called the anterocingulate cortex, which human brain imaging studies suggest are is activated during empathic human responses, and the projections of that Area into the nucleus accumbens, that's the connection. And we're interested in whether Neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin may influence these circuitry, these connections That are involved in these, in quotes, empathic behaviors, etcetera, etcetera. And we think drugs can be used as Probes of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms. I hope this is all making sense.[2:04:58] Andrew Huberman: It makes excellent sense and is fascinating. I'm not one to suggest experiments to, colleagues in areas where I don't work, but I I I'm going to anyway. Yeah. Please. One You're a really smart guy,[2:05:10] Dr. Robert Malenka: so I I will value your suggestions.[2:05:13] Andrew Huberman: Well, you know, I love the the motivational backbone to what You're describing here because I agree the world has a lot of issues, and what it could be more important than to increase the amount of empathy and compassion in the world. But one thing that we know inhibits empathy and compassion is one's own challenges and struggles. And so I'm wondering if there's a way to introduce something to this behavioral paradigm such that the working to provide another animal relief from pain. 1 animal working to provide relief of another animal in pain or a Animal working to provide pleasure reward for another animal.[2:05:50] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah.[2:05:51] Andrew Huberman: You know, if it could be scaled with how inconvenient that work is. Right. Like, if I'm very hungry I mean, we're all taught to put our own, oxygen mask on first in some way too so that we don't all die, so to speak. But, you know, I grew up, for instance, with a 1 parent. My mother was the kind of person who would see at that time, there were far fewer homeless people on the street.[2:06:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Maybe they were all institutionalized. I don't know. But if she saw a homeless person on the street of the town we lived on, she would literally pull over, Give them money. Find hotels.[2:06:23] Andrew Huberman: She had homeless people living in hotels all over the town. We lived there. It was crazy. I mean, we couldn't get anywhere. Was the problem is we would never arrive anywhere on time, and that's my excuse for always being late.[2:06:33] Andrew Huberman: I would possibly be enforced for being late. I always run late, and I always run Incredible. Right? Just a very strong sense of of social Fantastic. Connection, that kind of thing.[2:06:42] Andrew Huberman: But in any case, you know, some people are like that. Like, she could not Experience any, even modicum of inconvenience for helping others.[2:06:51] Dr. Robert Malenka: Good stuff.[2:06:52] Andrew Huberman: I think most of us feel like if I'm rushing to catch a flight Yeah. And I see someone who's struggling, I'm probably gonna help them if they're in acute pain or it seems like a dire circumstance, But let's be honest. Yeah. Most people are probably gonna prioritize their own stress and and Priorities, for lack of a better word, when the situation often calls for us to set those aside and and tend to people that are suffering. So if there was a way to introduce the, the inter, probe of the interplay of circuitries that involve, how convenient or inconvenient it is.[2:07:25] Andrew Huberman: Like, if we're well fed, it's Pretty easy to go out and gather and distribute food for others, but if we're hungry, we tend to focus on our own hunger.[2:07:32] Dr. Robert Malenka: I we so first, You know, in full disclosure, even though I'm studying empathy and compassion, I can look in the mirror and say I probably don't Practice it nearly as much as I should. I'm thinking of your example. If I was late for a plane, I'm not sure I would stop and help somebody, and I'm not saying[2:07:51] Andrew Huberman: that depends on the on what sort of suffering.[2:07:53] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Exactly.[2:07:53] Andrew Huberman: I mean, they're hemorrhaging on the side of the road.[2:07:55] Dr. Robert Malenka: Of course. Of course. We all would.[2:07:56] Andrew Huberman: Of course. Entire. Right? You might think, oh goodness. Like, do I have time[2:08:00] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And so I'm not proud of that statement. But back to your question, yes, I think absolutely we can design experiments where After we've established the basic phenomenology, then we can take our subject, animal or mouse, And put it in just certain circumstances.[2:08:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: If it's hungry itself, will it work as hard to give another animal? I mean, It's a good question because I'm not sure what the outcome will be. And one could predict it might work harder because it understands the hunger, in quotes, more I[2:08:34] Andrew Huberman: love that answer.[2:08:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: Could be, Of course, it's not gonna work hard for another animal to get a food reward because it's starving itself, and it needs to take care of itself first. It's a great question. We're also asking questions about, do you have to know your buddy, mouse? Right? Do you is it Are you more likely to behave in a generous or compassionate way if you grew up with that mouse, you know, in the way Our mice grow up in academic environments.[2:09:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: And if it's a stranger, how will you behave? How will you behave if you had a Fight with that mouse previously. Interesting. And what if you had and and it also matters, did you win the fight or did you lose the fight? Right?[2:09:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: You're you know, intuitively, as we probably would all guess, I'm more likely to help somebody I defeated in a fight previously Because I'm the sup you know, in the hierarchy, I'm the dominant one. I'm probably less likely if that person beat me up. So all these are great questions. I think we can study them. I also think there are ways we can study these kinds of interactions in human subjects.[2:09:45] Dr. Robert Malenka: Not that I am gonna do that myself.[2:09:47] Andrew Huberman: But someone at Stanford will.[2:09:48] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Yeah. So I think there's also an opportunity, and I'm happy to discuss how Neuromodulators like, in particular, serotonin, but also perhaps dopamine and oxytocin may influence The brain the circuitry in the brain mechanisms that are mediating what I term empathic behaviors. Let's return to autism.[2:10:09] Andrew Huberman: Right. Does autism involve a lack of empathy? Does autism involve I could imagine, for instance, that there are variations in brain wiring that would make it such that, a kid who then becomes an adult, gets a tremendous amount of reward from, I don't know, math, designing mugs, Any number of activities, but that through some variation in brain wiring, social interaction, spending time with friends is just not as socially rewarding. It just doesn't feel good in the in the moment, doesn't necessarily feel bad, but it's not selected for. And, is there any evidence that that's the case in children who are classified as autistic or having autism?[2:11:08] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I am I wanna be clear. I am not a world expert on pathophysiology of individuals With autism spectrum disorder, I have read some of the literature. I do study mouse models of genetically based The autism spectrum disorder. So the answer is yes. There there have been imaging studies.[2:11:31] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, again, So your audience certain members of your audience don't get mad. We're remember our earlier conversation, we we We made the point that autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous set of behavioral symptoms With wide variation in how these symptoms manifest in each individual. So We cannot make blanket statements that individuals with autism spectra spectrum disorder are this or that. But there are studies, both in human beings and mice, that suggest that the reinforcing component of a social interaction is much less or lacking in our models of autism spectrum spectrum disorder and certain individuals. An important point is, is that just genetically wired?[2:12:30] Dr. Robert Malenka: Was that because in their early Experiences, they weren't able to get the sensory stimuli that tell them this is a reinforcing social experience unknown. At least those are topics that I think are worthy of investigation. Do individuals or mice With autism spectrum disorder, lack or do not have the capacity or the same Experience of empathy, again, a very complex topic in question, and It's very likely for some individuals, the answer is yes, meaning they they they do lack some of the neuromechanisms that allow But that probably doesn't apply to everybody. I would I can say in our mouse models Of social interactions and our mouse models of, in quotes, empathy in these, Our my I might show deficits, and those deficits can be rescued, meaning improved upon, By manipulations of certain neuromodulatory systems, in this case, the serotonin system, by giving drugs, Including a drug called MDMA or ecstasy. So I I hope I'm answering your question.[2:13:56] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I think These are worthwhile subjects for investigation. I think there's a lot of Value in studying them.[2:14:08] Andrew Huberman: Let's go back to serotonin and the nucleus accumbens. We will get into this in a bit more detail when we discuss MDMA, but I've Now spent a lot of time with a recent paper of yours that really parsed[2:14:19] Dr. Robert Malenka: which one? Oh, the MDMA paper?[2:14:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That parsed The[2:14:21] Dr. Robert Malenka: Boris Heifetz one?[2:14:23] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. The door that that parsed The relative roles of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens versus serotonin in the nucleus accumbens by the way, folks, by time this episode comes out, an episode All about MDMA itself and its modes of action will have already, aired, and you can find that. But even if you haven't heard that, You know, MDMA is an amazing molecule because it profoundly increases, dopamine, and that's why the word methamphetamine is actually in Yep. MDMA. Still a surprise to many people to hear that, but it also robustly increases, serotonin transmission.[2:14:59] Andrew Huberman: And what I love about The paper from your lab that explored this is that it at least by my read of the data, it showed very convincingly that It's serotonin released in the nucleus accumbens that's responsible for the prosocial effects of MDMA, whereas oxytocin, this thing we talked about earlier that everyone assumes is bonding molecule, the molecule of love, both in humans now, there's a study in humans, and in the mouse work that you've done Doesn't seem to play as prominent a role in the social, enhancement that MDMA causes. And the reason I'm asking this in the context of is that for a long time, there was excitement about the idea that oxytocin nasal sprays might make Autistic kids more excited about social interactions, more tuned to social interactions. First question is, Is there any evidence that increasing oxytocin in a child or adult with autism makes them somehow more social or desiring more social connections? I'm not aware of any.[2:16:01] Dr. Robert Malenka: I don't think the I think it it is a it is a worthwhile it has been studied. I I don't think we can close the door on the potential therapeutic uses of oxytocin. From the the people I know who are much more expert in this than I am, I think most of the clinical trials have been pretty disappointing with, you know, a lot of hope That intranasal oxytocin would promote more positive prosocial experiences. I don't think the door is Yeah. There may be different ways of administering it administering it.[2:16:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: There may be Ways of making a different type of oxytocin that might be beneficial. I have a colleague at Stanford Who's actually looking at a related neuropeptide called vasopressin, and she's finding some potential benefit from that, And vasopressin and oxytocin are closely related to each other. They can even activate some of the same, What we call receptors in the brain. So I don't think the door is closed on the possibility of oxytocin or related Therapeutic agents having some therapeutic potential. The evidence, as far as I'm aware, is not there yet.[2:17:22] Dr. Robert Malenka: In terms of MDMA, again, complicated story. As you pointed out, MDMA, its its major molecular targets, don't wanna get too technical here, Are the serotonin vacuum cleaner, the the molecule that vacuums up serotonin, and The dopamine vacuum cleaner, the molecule that vacuums up and, Excuse my language, sucks up dopamine when it's released. Because it's an amphetamine derivative, as you point correctly pointed out, it not only prevents these proteins, we call them, these molecules, these vacuum cleaners From vacuuming up the dopamine and serotonin when it's released, it actually causes it how do I don't wanna use the term The the terminals to vomit out dopamine and serotonin.[2:18:23] Andrew Huberman: That's what I say on the Or[2:18:25] Dr. Robert Malenka: or is that am I not talking[2:18:26] Andrew Huberman: about the same? Release, I'm known for when I my solo episodes for when I talk about synaptic Please, I'll, I'll say that they they bomb it out.[2:18:34] Dr. Robert Malenka: So what what amphetamine derivative drug?[2:18:36] Andrew Huberman: Synaptive transmission, so it's almost an insult to[2:18:38] Dr. Robert Malenka: a biologist. What does is it it actually calls what's known as a reverse transport. It actually causes it not only prevents the vacuum cleaners from Sucking up the dopamine and serotonin, it causes it to spew out dopamine and serotonin. So imagine if your vacuum cleaner Started the the pressure in your vacuum cleaner reversed, and all the dirt you collected started being spewed out. Now the one difference for MDMA, And, you know, it's a fascinating topic I hope we have time to talk about is why does MDMA, Qualitatively, for most people, give give human subjects a different experience than cocaine or methane or especially methamphetamine.[2:19:22] Andrew Huberman: Presumably, it's the fact that there's so much serotonin.[2:19:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: Exactly. And so if you actually get in and this is why For your audiences, this is why hardcore molecular science can actually teach us something about Complex human behavioral phenomena such as social interactions and addiction, At least the hypothesis we propose and others in the field, it's not just you know, science is not done in isolation, So I I wanna give credit where creditors do. We did not define the following that MDMA affects the serotonin system More than the dopamine system. So it's not it's not 5050. Maybe it's 7030, 8020, And that's because the molecule itself of MDMA, again, I'm trying not to use language, has a it binds to it Has a higher affinity.[2:20:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: It likes to bind to and influence the serotonin vacuum cleaner more than the dopamine vacuum cleaner. It's still affecting both, But it's not 5050. It's more whatever. 70 70% serotonin, 30% dopamine. And then It does influence oxytocin in very complex ways, which is a further technical discussion.[2:20:46] Dr. Robert Malenka: There was just a nice paper that came out that reported that serotonin release in a hypothalamic structure, Which, again, the hypothalamus, you can explain to your listeners.[2:20:57] Andrew Huberman: A, marble ish size structure above the roof of your mouth responsible for A sex temperature control, feeding and satiety, and a bunch of other things critical, and, yeah.[2:21:08] Dr. Robert Malenka: And it's a home of Neurons that produce oxytocin. So this paper reported that when serotonin is released in the hypothalamus, it activates and causes the release of oxytocin. That's in the hypothalamus. Our work in the reward circuitry suggested oxytocin. So that's Serotonin upstream of oxytocin in the hypothalamus, and that where we were looking in the accumbens, It was the opposite.[2:21:35] Dr. Robert Malenka: Oxytocin caused the release of serotonin. So the point to your listeners is the brain's unfortunately complicated. You you know, we we like it's tractable. We like to come up with general hypotheses and principles, but sometimes the devil's in the details, and we really need to Probe deeper. So back to your question about our previous paper and dopamine and serotonin.[2:21:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: So what we are What we proposed, which is far from nailed down, is that MDMA, because It is an amphetamine derivative. Does influence dopamine release and dopamine the dopamine system. And Some of my colleagues in the MDMA field, who I respect enormously, don't like me to say this, but I'm gonna say it anyhow. Remember earlier in the podcast, we talked about different substances having addictive liabilities. Doesn't mean a substance is automatically addictive.[2:22:36] Dr. Robert Malenka: Doesn't mean it's automatically not. It's a continuum. And I would argue That MDMA does have a some addictive liability because it is an amphetamine derivative.[2:22:49] Andrew Huberman: It feels good.[2:22:50] Dr. Robert Malenka: And it feels good. And so there are individuals that especially, you know, as your listeners may know, MDMA has has gotten a lot of attention Because it's in a therapeutic trial that's looks very promising for as an adjunct to psychotherapy for post traumatic stress disorder, And the the FDA, the part of our government that approves or disapproves the legal distribution of therapeutic drugs May end up approving MDMA for certain uses. The point being is that once it if it gets approved, My personal feeling is that it will have some addictive liability. It also has this very powerful, What you and I might term, Andrew, a prosocial effect. Some people even call it an empathogen.[2:23:42] Dr. Robert Malenka: That's a little controversial. Meaning, it enhances your capacity for empathy to to experience The emotional state of another individual to want to understand that person's experiences and emotional state, and our what we've suggested is that the addictive liability is mostly, although not solely being mediated by its actions on the dopamine system, Whereas its positive, more prosocial effects and perhaps its empathogenic effects are more likely to be mediated By its interactions with the serotonin system in in the in this reward circuitry, and we're actually doing a lot of work to test that hypothesis. We're actually testing MDMA in these behavioral models of empathy in mice. And it looks like our hypothesis is being supported. The other thing just to drive your your listeners crazy about, Sorry, listeners, how complex the brain is.[2:24:47] Dr. Robert Malenka: If you think it's a[2:24:48] Andrew Huberman: Neither you nor I were consulted at the design phase, and so we don't have apologize for the brain's complexity.[2:24:54] Dr. Robert Malenka: Because I don't trust me. As a scientist, I wish I could keep things as simple as possible. That's what good science is. It turns out the serotonin serotonin is produced by neurons in another part of the brain with this wonderful name called the dorsal Chorath A nucleus. And it turns out the serotonin neurons talk to the dopamine neurons The the it's and influence the dopamine neurons.[2:25:20] Dr. Robert Malenka: And, so it's again the point we made earlier in your podcast. Even though It's fun and useful both for your listeners and as scientists to think about these powerful Chemical messengers in isolation, because that's how we can make progress scientifically. It it's how your audience can understand some of the concepts that have been elucidated from brain research over the decades, But they don't work in isolation. They influence each other. They communicate with each other.[2:25:56] Dr. Robert Malenka: We're actually doing studies showing that Serotonin release in the accumbens actually modulates dopamine release, so it gets crazy complicated. But you can still develop simplistic hypotheses, disease, like, as I was saying about MDMA, where, you know, abuse, addictive liability, and some of its reinforcing qualities, Which you just mentioned, MDMA, a lot of people find it fun to take it, is probably mostly via me being mediated via the dopamine system And some of its social effects of and are being mediated by the serotonin system. We're actually doing studies to figure out whether the Forcing component of a social experience requires that dopamine release. Probably does.[2:26:42] Andrew Huberman: What I'm most interested in, really, in the context of MDMA. And we should just mention because we we do, like to mention these caveats. Yes. The ex and I can say this because I participated in a trial with MDMA. It it is a very pleasant experience.[2:26:56] Andrew Huberman: It's certainly not for everybody. It still is a schedule one drug at this moment. Does, so you can go to jail for possessing and, or selling. In fact, there was a big bust recently in Canada and another one in Brussels. A large, balance of MDMA collected, those people are probably gonna go to prison for a long period of time.[2:27:14] Andrew Huberman: So you you do you don't want to take it or possess it. It's illegal. We're talking about clinical trials here, but also, the fentanyl issue. There's a lot of fentanyl[2:27:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: issue. Mention to your listeners.[2:27:26] Andrew Huberman: If we didn't Actually, a lot of people are dying thinking that they're taking 1 drug when they're taking another. So so we are not encouraging the use of these, but I will say that the, subjective experience of MDMA, provided it's done in the Variance of MDMA provided it's done in a the appropriate clinical setting. It's actually MDMA. It doesn't contain other things, dosed correctly, etcetera, is a pleasant one for sure, and my my sense is that, the dopamine release, is reinforcing the Experience that the context that serotonin is providing is a social context.[2:27:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: Right.[2:28:00] Andrew Huberman: And and the word context there becomes important when think about back to the nineties when there were a lot of raves, and people were also, you know, getting, I guess, positive feedback from the interactions actions they were having, dancing all night, partying with friends, etcetera. I mean, I think that, returning to the issue of autism and the role of serotonin[2:28:18] Dr. Robert Malenka: Mhmm.[2:28:18] Andrew Huberman: So In autism, there seems to be less of a, reinforcement pathway for certain kinds of social interactions, in some individuals with autism, and I'm aware that there are some prescription treatments for autism that capitalize on the serotonergic system and dopamine system. So, is it phentermine?[2:28:39] Dr. Robert Malenka: To my knowledge, the only FDA approved Pharmacologic therapeutic for individuals with autism spectrum disorder is actually oh, god. I'm just Blinking. It it's it's not a serotonergic drug. I'm I have to look it up. I I wanna say risperidone for agitation.[2:29:02] Dr. Robert Malenka: There is no drug for, for lack of a better terms, the social deficits. There's no FDA approved drug. If you look at the literature, psychiatrists and individuals with with good intention have tested the utility of traditional serotonergic drugs like Prozac, SSRIs. There are drugs known as SNRIs, drugs that influence serotonin release and another neuromodulator that you know well, Norepinephrine, and at least well done clinical Trials, which in my view as an academic are very important, none of them have showed efficacy. Having said that, there are several companies, and full disclosure here, I am the founder of a small Biotech called Maplight Therapeutics, and I'm not advertising for Maplight.[2:29:59] Dr. Robert Malenka: I'm just doing a full disclosure. It was founded with Carl Deiseroth, who you've had on your podcast, and an entrepreneur in San Francisco named Karoly Nikolic, And we have the phase two trial. Phase two trial means it's a safe drug. We've done all the safety Work, and it's a drug that targets a subtype of receptor for serotonin. Serotonin works on many different I I don't know.[2:30:33] Dr. Robert Malenka: What word can I use other than receptor?[2:30:34] Andrew Huberman: No. Listeners of this podcast probably be familiar with the receptors. There's sort of parking spots For, for molecules. Yes. The the paper you I was referencing earlier from your lab, it talked about Serotonin 1 b receptors being particularly important.[2:30:50] Dr. Robert Malenka: And so and the point being is, you know, I do have an interest in this On can you use the type of discoveries we've made in mice, might it actually have any Relevance to human sub human beings, in particular, those who some of which have some sort of sociability deficits, other companies are pursuing this too. So MDMA itself, there has been I don't know if it's ongoing. There's a well known organization. I don't know if you've ever had anybody from MAPS[2:31:26] Andrew Huberman: Not yet. On this, the[2:31:27] Dr. Robert Malenka: Multidisciplinary Association For Psychedelic Studies, MAPS deserves a lot of credit for being a pioneer in saying in particular with MDMA, Promoting the idea that, you know, this drug deserves rigorous and ethical study. That that's at least my view. In MAPS, which was founded by, individual named Rick Doblin has Deserves enormous credit for their 30 year effort to make it allowed and legal to actually study MDMA. The point I'm making is I know MAPS and perhaps others have done some small trials studying MDMA in individuals, High functioning individuals with some form of social anxiety. I'm saying this because this is Public, there's another company called MindMed, which is one of the publicly traded psychedelic companies, and this is on their website.[2:32:30] Dr. Robert Malenka: Full disclosure, I am on their scientific advisory board. They are gearing up to do a trial Of a I don't wanna get too technical. Of a certain form of MDMA, there are 2 different types of MDMA That they have these horrible names called enantiomers. So the MDMA that is used for clinical trials at maps MDMA is a molecule, and it has mirror images of itself. And one one has the name R MDMA, and one has the name SMDMA.[2:33:06] Dr. Robert Malenka: And they're they're called the enantiomers because they're mirror images of each other. And other labs over the years, not My lab, I deserve no credit for this, have done some studies to suggest that the s enantiomer is the one that has a higher interaction with the dopamine system, and the r enantiomer Has a higher interaction with the serotonin system. Interesting. If if you look at the the literature On autism spectrum disorder in human subjects, there's a bunch of papers suggesting Seratenergic systems are malfunctioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. And if you look reviews I've written or any of my papers, we probably cite some of the reviews.[2:34:03] Andrew Huberman: It's clear that serotonin is playing some role In social interactions, at least in mice and almost certainly in humans as well. It's hard to imagine based on Data from everything from SSRIs to neurotoxic lesions of the human brain, etcetera, that it's not also playing at least a similar role in humans.[2:34:20] Dr. Robert Malenka: And I I fully agree with that. And as we were discussing, there's a there's a modestly extensive clinical literature, meaning literature from human subjects, Suggesting that some aspects of brain systems that utilize serotonin as one of their Signaling molecules, one of their neuromodulatory mechanisms may not be functioning in some of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. So based on that, based on my lab's work on the role of serotonin In modifying reward circuitry, its role role in prosocial behaviors. And the biggest clue, which I think you would agree with, Andrew, Is this drug MDMA I mean, this is why I am not a druggie myself. I am a child of the sixties seventies, So I did, which means I'm 20 years older than you, Andrew.[2:35:17] Dr. Robert Malenka: I did experiment like everybody of my generation with psychoactive of substances in the seventies, so I don't wanna lie about my experiences. I also would say like many neuroscientists, My experiences with psychoactive substances stimulated my interest in neuroscience. How do these substances work? Why when I get the when I was a young kid, the first time I got drunk on beer, why is that happening? But more seriously, I use drugs in my research as powerful probes of brain function With the advantage that and now I'm talking scientist to scientist with you, Andrew, they have molecular targets That we can manipulate in rigorous ways.[2:36:11] Dr. Robert Malenka: We can figure out where in the brain they act using the modern tools of neuroscience, which your audience May not know about I'm saying this to you, conditional knockout mice, rescue experiments. We can do all those fancy stuff, And we can use drugs to study even things as complicated as empathy. And I really do believe that it's why I've been interested in MDMA for decades is there's a clue there. How does a drug That has molecular targets in the dopamine neuromodulatory system, in the serotonin neuromodulatory system, Have such a powerful effect, which is relatively specific on social interactions. It doesn't make you wanna go eat more doughnuts.[2:37:03] Dr. Robert Malenka: It doesn't, I don't know. For me, there's a Clue there. There's something really important from that phenomenological observation in the human experiences that we can learn from.[2:37:18] Andrew Huberman: I completely agree about MDMA, and, you know, we've done a couple podcasts about psilocybin and, by extension, LSD, because even though Yep. There are differences there. Psilocybin and LSD, as far as we understand, largely work through, you know, activation of the serotonin 2 a receptor, broadening of A brain network connectivity. So, again, that's serotonin, serotonin, serotonin Yep. But different receptors, very different Subjective experience.[2:37:45] Andrew Huberman: Mhmm. And I guess perhaps the best way to describe it is that LSD and psilocybin are almost always considered mystical in the in their subjective effects, whereas, MDMA can be an empathogen, an actogen.[2:37:57] Dr. Robert Malenka: Yep.[2:37:58] Andrew Huberman: And so serotonin in Acting to through different receptor systems impacting and creating very different subjective experiences. I also agree. I think MDMA is particularly interesting for the neuroscientist. Perhaps also because, at least to my knowledge, there is no substance in nature, no plant, no mushroom, no ergot, no, any no mold, that creates this increase in dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. MDMA is a synthesized molecule, And so it may be one of the again, highlighting all the safety issues and things we talked about before, it may be one of the great, at least, experimental probes of the brain that humans have developed, and it may be one of the great therapeutic probes, that folks like MAPS have are now doing such Fantastic work on.[2:38:47] Andrew Huberman: So I'm I'm very excited about what's happening with the research on MDMA, and I'm so glad that your laboratory has parsed Some of the relative roles of serotonin, the receptors involved, it since we mentioned serotonin 2 a for psilocybin and LSD, We'd be remiss if we didn't say that that this wonderful paper that we will provide a link to in the show note captions, by the way, folks, that, Rob Malenka here's lab that's focused on the Serotonin 1 b receptor. So even just differences in receptor subtypes leading to profoundly different subjective outcomes. I I find that To be, just one of the most important areas that one could even think about, let alone work on.[2:39:27] Dr. Robert Malenka: Thank you. I appreciate the compliment. I will also say, unlike everything, we're we're finding it's not all about only serotonin in one b, but that's as you know, there are, Again, pointing to the the amazing and powerful complexity of the human brain or the mammalian brain, there are 16 different serotonin parking spots or receptors that are distributed in different brain areas in complex ways. And so that's daunting, but it also offers possibilities for developing very novel therapeutic agents[2:40:06] Andrew Huberman: that agents that that activate or inhibit these in complex ways, hopefully, for therapeutic benefit. So before we conclude, I'm very curious to get your opinion on what you see as the landscape of the work on Psychedelics and MDMA, which isn't really a classic psychedelic, but all these drugs that, as you pointed out during your youth, We're used recreationally and for mind exploration and expansion and are now being probed as potential therapeutics for various, mental health challenges Mhmm. As well as potentially expanding consciousness, empathy, and all all of that. I mean, not getting into the details of, You know, the the legal issues that have to be overcome Mhmm. Not even necessarily talking about the clinical trials or the people doing the work in different laboratories, but just I have to imagine this is must amuse, tickle, surprise you.[2:41:02] Andrew Huberman: I mean, how do you feel about what you're seeing now? Because it is A very exciting time for these compounds.[2:41:08] Dr. Robert Malenka: It tickles me and excites me with the appropriate caution. So I do think drugs are very powerful probes of brain function. I think this Class of drug, which as you correctly pointed out, people use the term psychedelics scientifically when pursuing their, Understanding their therapeutic potential, their mechanism of action, it's more useful to divide them into different categories, the classic hallucinogens, which are LSD and psilocybin, the intact germ pathogens, which is MDMA, Which is really a qualitatively different drug. There are other substances which we, you know, we don't have time to talk about like Ibogaine and Ayahuasca, which are very complex, And peyote, but nevertheless, I am tickled and excited as a child of the sixties seventies, but I am also Not evangelical about their youth use and their therapeutic potential. So as you can imagine what I'm gonna say, I think they should be the subject of rigorous, sophisticated, and most importantly, ethical research.[2:42:24] Dr. Robert Malenka: I I think we could learn a lot about how the brain works and its amazing capabilities. I think we could I think they may, notice I say may, have therapeutic potential, but I do not think They're gonna be miracle cures. And I do worry as somebody who lived through the sixties seventies and watched Because of the leery, the history with Timothy Leary and his colleagues And the political landscape of how they were being used and promoted, I am cautious that These substances need to be studied scientifically and rigorously, and I hope that's the case. And I wanna Caution your audience that not everybody should take these substances. They are not miracle cures.[2:43:30] Dr. Robert Malenka: Provide Unusual and, in quotes, mystical experiences for certain individuals. I am very concerned that there are Individuals out there that will gain access to these substances and have very bad experiences. Because anybody who grew up in the sixties seventies knows all about bad trips. And truth be told, I have had a bad trip or two In the seventies, and I'm glad I did because it made me I have no idea what a suicidal depression feels like, Where you are experiencing such a darkness, such a lack of hope that a rational decision is to end one's life. But and I think the closest I ever came to that experience is a bad trip on LSD.[2:44:23] Dr. Robert Malenka: And I do have Concerns that if you look at the clinical trials that have been done, the well could done, not the anecdotal. I went and saw Some psychedelic therapist that a friend recommended, and it did wonders for me, but the well controlled clinical trials that are being done by certain bio Texts, some academic institutions, they have very strict what are known as inclusionary and criteria about who is allowed to participate in the subject, and they rule out a lot of people. So I don't mean to be overly cautious, but I do worry that if some people take these substances and bad Things happen. It will slow down the excitement that's currently happening, and it will make it more difficult for serious Human subjects researchers, preclinical researchers to study these substances in the way they deserve to be studied. So I I hope that, articulates my viewpoint.[2:45:34] Andrew Huberman: I think it's a it it does, and thank you for that viewpoint. It's an important Counterbalance on a lot of the excitement that we hear about these days. I think the state of Kentucky just recently decided to give $42,000,000 From the opioid lawsuit settlement with, Purdue Pharmaceuticals to the study of Ibogaine. So there's a lot Happening here[2:45:56] Dr. Robert Malenka: No. And I I just to be clear, I think there's no problem with that, and I actually would support that as long as The studies of Ibogaine are done thoughtfully, carefully, and ethically. I see no problem with testing its efficacy in certain, mental illnesses and addiction, And it's act it's actually a topic I know a little bit about, but we'll save that for another time. Right.[2:46:26] Andrew Huberman: Well, First off, I wanna thank you for coming here and sharing your knowledge with all of us. For me, it's been a a real thrill. And I also just wanna thank you for the incredible amount of work that you've done over the years. I know it's still ongoing. You're by no means, retiring.[2:46:43] Dr. Robert Malenka: Who knows? Who knows?[2:46:44] Andrew Huberman: I I certainly hope not, but, I'm sure the listeners have, now in a clear picture of the enormous number of Contributions and areas, you've worked everywhere from, as I mentioned earlier, neuroplasticity at the cellular level, molecular level, addiction, work relating to social cognition and social interactions rather, as it pertains to autism models and now Psychedelics and empathy and on and on and, again, train so many prominent scientists in our field. And to take time out of your schedule to Come sit here with us and share some of that knowledge and stimulate our thinking. And as you mentioned, raise still more questions that need to be resolved, is a real privilege. So thank you ever so much. And, indeed, as you just mentioned, we'd love to have you back again for another conversation.[2:47:31] Dr. Robert Malenka: Say is I wanna thank you for having me. I was a little hesitant or nervous about coming here, and now I wanna come back. So yeah. Yeah. It it that was a blast when I just did with you, and I'd be happy to continue this conversation anytime.[2:47:49] Dr. Robert Malenka: So thank you for your very sophisticated and thoughtful questions. To be continued. Yeah.
