I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode is the 3rd in the 6 episode series on fitness, exercise, and performance. Today's episode is all about endurance and fat loss. That is the specific protocols required to achieve The 4 different kinds of endurance and how to maximize fat loss.[0:00:30] Andrew Huberman: Doctor Andy Galpin, great to be back. Today, we're gonna talk about endurance. And I'm very interested in this conversation because I, like many other people, strive to get a certain amount of Cardiovascular work in each week. Maybe a longish jog, maybe a swim, ride the bike, etcetera. But when I think about the word endurance, the idea that almost immediately comes to mind is about doing something for a long period of time repeatedly.[0:00:58] Andrew Huberman: But but I have a feeling that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation that we call the endurance adaptation. So I'm excited to learn about that. I'm also excited to learn about the fuel systems in the body that allow for endurance and other modes of repeated activity. So in order to kick things off, I'd love for you to Frame the conversation by telling us, what is endurance? And are there indeed a large variety of ways to induce what we call this endurance adaptation.[0:01:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. The where I wanna start actually here is is calling back to some of the things we talked about in our previous conversations, which are really People exercise for three reasons. Number 1, you wanna feel better. Number 2, you wanna look a certain way. And then number 3, you wanna be able to do that for a long time.[0:01:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So you need what the way that we say it in sports is look good, feel good, play good. Right? So I want some sort of functionality to be able to perform a certain way, whatever that is for you. You wanna be able to look a certain way that whatever that matters for you, and then you wanna be able to do that for a long time.[0:01:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So when it comes to endurance, we have a bunch of misnomers here, which is The same thing with the strength training or resistance exercise side, where we wanted to dispel this myth that I lift weights only because I I wanna gain muscle or play a sport. And I wanna do cardio because I wanna lead their loose fat or for long health sake. And just like we smashed that myth from the strength training side, I wanna smash it from the endurance training side. There are so many other reasons that you wanna perform endurance training Regardless of your goal. Right?[0:02:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Whether it is longevity, whether it is performance, or whether it is aesthetics. And so we're gonna I wanna cover all those reasons, exactly what to do, protocols, of course, and why those things are working that way. In general though, the quick answer Is really, endurance comes down to 2 independent factors. Factor number 1 is fatigue management, And then factor number 2 is fueling, and that's all it really comes down to. So all the different types of training are going to reach a limitation, which are either again, Your ability to deal with some sort of fatigue, and that's generally a fatigue signal.[0:03:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: The other 1 is managing some sort of restriction of energy input. And a lot the spoiler here is a lot of the times people think it's a fueling issue and really it's a fatigue management issue Or the opposite. And to have a complete health spectrum, regardless of whether you're a high performance athlete like I typically deal with or general public, You need to be able to do both, manage fatigue as well as understand fuel storage. So that's really what we're gonna get into today.[0:03:30] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. I can't wait. Before we dive in, I'm going to ask you what I often ask people who are expert in their respective fields, which is, is there any non obvious Tool or mechanism or tool and mechanism that can allow people to access better endurance. You know, when I think about training for endurance, again, I think about trying to run longer and longer each week Yeah. Or swim further and further and so on.[0:03:59] Andrew Huberman: But I do wonder whether or not there are other forms of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation that I or most people perhaps don't think of as endurance.[0:04:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. The way I wanna answer this is if we look back and think about How we've answered that question with power and strength, in force production. It is really about how much can you produce maximally once. What you're asking now is, how can I repeat that same quality of performance? If that's the case, Endurance really comes down to your ability to maintain proper mechanics.[0:04:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's going to like, the the biggest way we can increase your endurance exponentially Very quickly, is mechanical, and this is starting with breathing. And so we need to be breathing properly. We need to have proper posture positions, and then we need to be moving well. Efficiency is going to trump force always For Endurance, the other side of the equation is not that. You can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics and still squat well or jump high And be fine because you don't have to suffer those consequences repeatedly.[0:05:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? That's going to drain you over time. So, the quickest way to improve endurance is to improve mechanics, And the mechanical thing I'll go after first is your breathing techniques, your pattern, your entire approach, as well as your posture. And then from there, the third one would be your movement technique.[0:05:24] Andrew Huberman: Is it possible to describe the best way to breathe when doing endurance training, or is it far more complex than that? And if it is far more complex than that, then Certainly, we can get into it during today's episode.[0:05:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. It is both of those. I will give you a quick answer though. A lot of the times you can kinda hit the cheat code, which is nasal breathing. There there's plenty of times when you don't wanna nasal breathe or don't need to nasal breathe, but just again, is that like a one tool that is For the a pretty general answer, if you can do that, a lot of the times that will fix breathing mechanics just by default.[0:05:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: And and we can maybe talk about why that is later, but that would be my Sort of 1 sentence bullet point answer immediately, of how to get in the right position. So second 1 would be simply looking at your posture. Right? So whether you're on a bike or you're, doing a lift or you're running. If you're literally, hunched over and your ribs are touching your femur or getting closer and closer, like, tends to happen on A bike or an aerosol thing for somebody I've seen recently?[0:06:22] Andrew Huberman: This morning, I was on the assault bike, doing a a sprint, and I asked Andy, doctor Galpin, to, critique my form and anything else he wanted to critique so that I could improve. And he did comment on my rather c shaped Posture Correct. Encouraged me to be, be more upright, which I should probably do now as well. And he also cued me to the fact that during a 1 minute sprint, there is something That is quote, unquote magic that happens right about the 42nd mark.[0:06:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:06:49] Andrew Huberman: And I use that as a, as a milestone, to look for. And indeed, Something does happen at the 42nd. It's into a 1 minute sprint where all of a sudden it it does seem to get much easier for reasons I don't understand. Maybe you can tell it that, but it certainly had nothing to do with my posture. My posture needs improvement.[0:07:06] Andrew Huberman: Thank you.[0:07:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well yeah. So, breathing mechanics and breathing strategies, people tend to be over breathing early on, and this is gonna lead to problems later. So having a more strategic breathing pattern, an approach is, again, a very quick solution.[0:07:22] Andrew Huberman: I know that we are going to dive very deep into the mechanisms of energy and metabolism and Endurance Today. But as long as we're having a discussion about these, brief sort of tidbits of How to Improve Endurance. Are there any other ways to improve endurance that are of relatively short time investment Even if they require a lot of, energy[0:07:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. The classic paradigm you're gonna find here is Steady state long duration posed up against what a lot of folks will now call higher intensity interval training specifically. And There's a lot of misconceptions here. The quick answer is you need to be doing both, and there's probably a bunch of stuff in between that you should be practicing. If you honestly wanna maximize those 3 factors we talked about at Beginning, you need to be training across this full spectrum.[0:08:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Just like I told you to train across the full spectrum of your lifting, we wanna be doing the same thing here. So are there independent special factors, that can happen with the shorter time length, higher intensity stuff. Absolutely. There's also magic that happens on the other end of that spectrum. So it's very important, that people don't just choose one side.[0:08:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because what tends to happen is people either go with the, oh, I'm gonna do 30 or 45 minutes of steady state stuff. That's it. Or I'm gonna do the opposite, which I'm gonna leave that stuff on the table, not do it, because I only wanna do high intensity intervals because I can get it done in 5 minutes. So there's magic on both sides of the equation. We wanna get into all that.[0:08:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: But just to answer your question directly, there's a whole bunch of of things you can do, in under 1 minute, that are convenient to do. And there's a a wonderful set of papers, out of a couple laboratories in Canada That that champion this idea that's called exercise snacks. So there's a bunch of there's a series of studies that have been done here that are really interesting, and that they've looked at a couple of things that are noteworthy. One of them is A 22nd bout of all out work, and this is actually done in workers in an office. And so what they had them do is run upstairs.[0:09:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I believe it was about 60 steps is is what it took them. Something along the order of 20 seconds exactly. And they repeated that, about once every 4 hours. So So really, it's you go to work, you get you know, put your coffee and your bag down or whatever. You run up a flight of stairs.[0:09:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: 20 seconds later, then you go right back to work at lunch. And before you go home, you sort of repeat it there. And if you repeat that, that's multiple times a week you're gonna do that. I think they in one of the interventions, it was 3 times a week for 6 weeks. 18 total times You did that.[0:09:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: And what you'll see is, a a noticeable improvement is a statistically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, specifically VO two max, As well as a number of cognitive benefits, work productivity, etcetera. That can happen in as little as 20 seconds. You don't have to go The gym, you don't have to shower. You don't have to do anything like that. Just find the stairs, run up and down them a few times.[0:10:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now you may have noticed, you actually sort of caught me Yesterday, I did that right here. Right? I was just I we had a little bit of a break. I was feeling an energy low. I ran up the stairs 3 or 4 times, felt, a lot better.[0:10:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that can actually also help. They ran another study where they looked at that following a giant high glycemic index meal. And what they saw, and then they took insulin measures and and a whole bunch of, other biological markers associated That you'd wanna be pay attention with the high glycemic index meal. And they looked at those immediately an hour, 3 hours, 6 hours as opposed. And it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve post planned yield, glucose control, insulin, and a whole bunch of other factors, In addition to that so if you are the sort of type who's like, wow, I'm in an office all day, maybe also had a giant, high glycemic index meal, Not the best approach, but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds.[0:11:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's a lot of magic and power And maximal exertion.[0:11:16] Andrew Huberman: If one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work, could they do jumping jacks?[0:11:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely. I mean, you could do anything you really wanted. It's not the mode of exercise that matters here. It is simply the exertion. You just get up as as hard as you can.[0:11:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could do burpees. You could do any number of things. You could sprint down your road, Down the hallway back and forth, the mode is is just, something that was easy for the scientists to control. And x number of steps, people could do it. You're not gonna fall, hurt yourself, things like that.[0:11:50] Andrew Huberman: Just to remind me, it's once every 4 hours, 1 minute of all out seconds. Oh, 20 seconds. Excuse me. Yeah. 20 seconds of essentially all out exertion[0:12:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:12:00] Andrew Huberman: While remaining safe, not going so fast up the stairs or doing jumping jacks so fast.[0:12:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not down the stairs. Up the stairs, please.[0:12:08] Andrew Huberman: Escalators don't count. Well, I suppose they count if they're, you know, if you're if you're moving, if If you're not remaining on the same steps, in fact, in an airport recently, I saw somebody walking against the[0:12:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, there you go.[0:12:22] Andrew Huberman: The conveyor Yeah. While talking on the phone, while waiting for their flight to take off. And I thought it's genius. Right?[0:12:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: It looked[0:12:27] Andrew Huberman: a little awkward. Who cares? Yeah. But it was I have looked awkward[0:12:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: in every airport I've been in for the last 15 years for those exact reasons, doing wild stuff like that.[0:12:36] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well, nothing's more awkward than Not being able to walk to the end of the terminal simply because one isn't familiar with walking that far carrying a couple of suitcases.[0:12:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: There you go.[0:12:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That's the the other fit test. Hi, Andrew. Case carrier Yeah. In the airport.[0:12:49] Andrew Huberman: I love this. So once every 4 hours, 20 seconds. So maybe once when arriving to work, Once 4 hours in and then 4 hours most people probably work somewhere, you know, 8 plus or minus 2 hours.[0:13:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now one thing I actually really wanna make Clear, because your audience is so incredible, they tend to to be really excited about these protocols, and they follow them exactly as written. That's not exactly how science works. So it doesn't necessarily have to be every 4 hours. It doesn't have to be 3 times a day. It doesn't have to be 20 seconds.[0:13:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: They literally built that protocol because it was so they're trying to replicate a real life scenario. Maybe you're in an office building, you're generally there for 8 hours. Let's see if you did one every sort of at the, so if you wanna do it 4 times a week, great. If you can do it only 10 seconds, amazing. Like, you're probably going to get the same benefits.[0:13:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Those are not the details to pay attention to. The detail to pay attention to is every so often, multiple times a day, try to get your heart rate up really quickly. Doesn't require sweating. Doesn't require anything else. There's no warm up associated with it.[0:13:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Again, you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever, and you can PrintUpDump. I do this all the time in my house. When you're you know, have those days when you're on, like, 7 straight hours of Zooms, etcetera, you can get out of 20 seconds. I run to my garage, which is over there. I hop on the the air bike, and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in.[0:14:08] Andrew Huberman: Love it. Yeah. I'm gonna start.[0:14:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Just also you can just put one of those things, which I do also. Just put 1 in your office And hop over right over there. You know, the whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds.[0:14:21] Andrew Huberman: Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from doctor Andy Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is Momentous.[0:14:43] Andrew Huberman: Momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentous for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations.[0:15:05] Andrew Huberman: With single ingredient formulations, You can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, momentous supplements ship internationally, and this is, course, important because we realized that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast, In particular, supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery, You can go to live momentous spelled o u s, so that's live momentous.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor.[0:15:47] Andrew Huberman: Many people are aware that their blood sugar, that is their blood glucose level, is critical for everything from fat loss To muscle gain, to healthy cognition, and indeed, aging of the brain and body. Most people do not know, however, how different foods and different activities including exercise or different temperatured environments impact their blood glucose levels, and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things. I first started using Levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods, exercise, and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night Impact My Blood Glucose Levels, and I've learned a tremendous amount from using Levels. It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat, when best to exercise, How best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep. So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman.[0:16:46] Andrew Huberman: That's levels.link slash Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium, magnesium, and potassium To optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance, most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve cells, neurons in particular, requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present in the correct ratios.[0:17:17] Andrew Huberman: Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize Is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet that is not a lot of processed foods, which, of course, is a good thing, Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. LMNT contains a science backed ratio Of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink element, that's l m n t.com/huberman to get a free LMNT sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drink element, l m n t.com/huberman to claim my free sample pack.[0:18:02] Andrew Huberman: So tell me about endurance. What is endurance? How do I get more endurance, and how does it work?[0:18:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: When we think about endurance, I would like to open up the conversation to Include more things than people generally do when they hear the word endurance. So if we just think about what you typically ask your body to do Or would like to ask your body to do, and we just walk through them, it's gonna be things like this. Number 1, I wanna have energy throughout the day. That's actually a form of endurance. Great.[0:18:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't wanna have these lulls and fatigue, and I wanna feel fantastic as I move throughout my activities of daily living, whatever those may be. Work, Exercise, enjoyment, cog paying attention, focus, all that stuff. Great. That's one thing. Another thing you wanna ask your body to do Is I wanna be able to repeat some small effort in a muscle group and not and and feel great about that.[0:18:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is what we generally call muscular endurance. So this is something like, I wanna be able to walk up those 10 flights of steps and my quads aren't burning at the end of it. Right? Or it even gives me energy. Another thing you'll wanna ask your body to do is to be able to perform a tremendous amount of work for a longer period of time, something in the realm of, you know, 20 to 80 seconds.[0:19:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this could be something like if you're surfing and you've got a paddle extremely hard for a minute to get on on top of a wave, or you wanna you've got you're You're out riding your bike, and you need to be able to get up a hill, and it's a very steep hill. These are gonna take maximal efforts, for some small amount of time, and then you'll get back up there. We tend Call that maximum anaerobic capacity. So that the max amount of work you can perform at a high rate for some amount of seconds to, like, maybe a minute. Past that is your ability to repeat an effort kinda like that for something like 5 to 15 minutes.[0:19:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: And this is the example would be run a mile. Right. Some some interval like that, which is a longer distance. Right? That is gonna be your maximum aerobic capacity.[0:19:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Another thing you're gonna want your body to do is we call sustained position. So this is you wanna be able to sit in your chair at work And have perfect posture for 20, 30, 40 minutes. Right? You wanna be able to stand in line at a grocery store for 15 minutes and not have a breakdown in posture. So you wanna be able to maintain position when you're riding your bike, you're not collapsing, you're doing any of these activities, and you don't get hurt Or lose efficiency simply because you couldn't sustain basic positions.[0:20:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Whatever those shapes and positions need to be. And then the last 1 is A a maximum distance. So you we wanna be able to go for a a longer hike or have just a long day at Disneyland for whatever it needs to be and feel great at the end of it. Right.[0:20:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the goal with all of these things is not can you just do them, but can you do them and then you feel good afterwards? So we're back in a right position where they give you energy, you feel good about it, and it's not just something you had to do and you regretted and you felt awful. So Those are the factors I think about when someone says, I want better endurance is I I wanna walk backwards and say, okay. When you say endurance, what do you mean? And that's generally the things I've come across is If you can handle all of those things, you're gonna feel like you're in fantastic shape.[0:21:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna feel your recovery is going to be excellent, And your physical performance in the gym or in any of the sporting activities you do will be enhanced.[0:21:17] Andrew Huberman: Given what you told us a little bit earlier, that endurance really reflects fatigue and management and energy production. How do each and both of those things relate to Endurance at a mechanistic level. Sure. And, really, what I'm asking is, what is fatigue management, and what is energy production?[0:21:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: In order to do that, it's important that we understand all of those functional capacities that I just talked about. They all have different points of failure. K. So in order to then work backwards and say, well, how do I optimize my performance in all those categories? We need to go through each one and figure out, well, where am I failing?[0:21:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some Some of them are gonna be failing because of fatigue management, and some of them will be failing because of energy production issues. So if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy and how we Handle fatigue, then we're gonna have a better understanding of exactly what to do for each one of these categories if you feel like one of them in particular is, worse for you or lagging behind, or if in general, you just wanna improve all of them. Alright. Now I wanna make a little bit of a 90 degree turn here. I'm gonna do a strategy that I promised, and I wanna ask you a very simple question.[0:22:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: How do you lose weight?[0:22:27] Andrew Huberman: I was taught that The calories in calories out thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything. That is if I'm ingesting Less caloric energy than I burn, then I'm going to lose weight. And if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn, I'll maintain weight. And if I ingest more then I burn, then I'll gain weight.[0:22:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. That is the approach you would take. What I'm asking really is How are you actually physically losing the weight?[0:22:59] Andrew Huberman: So my understanding is that we have different fuel sources in the body. Glycogen, which is stored in muscle and liver. Body fat, which is stored in mainly white adipose tissue and which is subcutaneous and around our organs, intravisceral fat, and that we can also use protein as a fuel. And then As I recall, there's also a phosphocreatine[0:23:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[0:23:22] Andrew Huberman: System. And I think you're going to tell me that each of these systems Is tapped into on different time scales and perhaps according to different levels of exertion. And I'm Certain that what I just said is not exhaustive, but hopefully, it is most or entirely correct.[0:23:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Pretty correct. What's that gotta do with fat loss?[0:23:45] Andrew Huberman: At some point, body fat stores adipose Adipocytes fat cells are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source. And the stimulus for that, I'm Assuming is going to be that other fuel sources are either depleted or that the energy and metabolic systems of the body I don't wanna say decide because they don't have their own consciousness, but our, our flip Signal. Is our signaling in a way that registers that, Body fat would be the optimal fuel source given how long or in and or intensely a given activity has been Performed.[0:24:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. We have some stuff to clean up there, but we're still not really answering the question. How am I actually losing that body fat?[0:24:32] Andrew Huberman: How is it actually leaving the body?[0:24:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[0:24:35] Andrew Huberman: My understanding is that it leaves the body through respiration.[0:24:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Uh-huh. So now we have some interesting things to talk about. How am I actually losing fat via respiration? What the hell does that even mean? How is something that occupied this physical space on the side of me, Leaving my body through my mouth.[0:24:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that is a very clear answer there, right, which I'm I'm sure you're queued up to. When you take a breath in, You're generally breathing in oxygen, o two. There's some other things, but we'll just stick to oxygen. When you exhale, you're breathing out c o two. The difference between those 2 is that carbon molecule.[0:25:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, one of the things that's important to understand here is all of your carbohydrates, Which is those that word itself is a carbon that has been hydrated. So it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule. It is a simple chain of carbons. Your fat molecules are also chains of carbon. All of metabolism really, in terms of energy production, is simply trying to figure out a way To break those carbon bonds, as a result, we get energy from that.[0:25:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: We use that energy to create a molecule called ATP, which is the central source of energy for any living being. Right. That carbon is then floating around in free form, which is bad news internally. So we've got to figure out a way to get that carbon out of our System. So all of energy production, all of fatigue management really comes down to this core issue of how are we handling carbon, And how are we moving it around the body?[0:26:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so what we do is we do the sneaky thing. So another question I like to ask people is why do we breathe?[0:26:07] Andrew Huberman: Well, for two reasons, to bring oxygen into the system and to offload carbon dioxide. But the neural trigger for breathing It's when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level in the set of neurons in the brain stem and elsewhere, Activate the phrenic nerve or the gasp reflex or a combination of things, and we inhale or inhale.[0:26:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. So a reduction of oxygen Gigant intake generally doesn't stimulate ventilation unless you're at altitude, then that sort of changes. Right? In general, it's an elevation in c o two that's gonna stimulate breathing up. The only reason you bring in o two for the most part is to get rid of the c o two.[0:26:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oxygen is not a fuel source. It is not a way and and it works the same with fire, by the way. So you know you have to have oxygen present for a fire to go, and if you squelch oxygen, the fire will go out. Right? That's not half of, how those, like, fire extinguishers work.[0:27:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: But we think then that means oxygen is the fuel. It is not the fuel. It is something entirely different. It is a necessary is a product that is necessary for the metabolism process to actually occur. Alright.[0:27:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we're we're kinda dancing around an idea here, which is this carbon cycle of life. So what happens in plants Is they generally will breathe in the opposite and breathe out the opposite of humans. So a plant will breathe in c 02 and exhale o 2. Alright. This is why we have to have a certain amount of these things and algae and forests and trees and stuff to maintain this o two c o two balance in our atmosphere.[0:27:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: We do the opposite. So we have this wonderful circle of life. We breathe n o two, breathe out c o two. They do the opposite. Well, what happens is because Carbohydrates are long chains of carbon, and fats are as well.[0:27:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Generally, when we think about fats, by the way, it's important to understand that structure a little bit. So if we think about triglycerides, it is a 3 carbon backbone chain of glycerol, so it's 1, 2, 3. And horizontally running off of each one of those Our fatty acid chains. Right? And so we form this structure that looks like an e.[0:28:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Like, the letter e, 3 in the back, and then 3 chains coming off of it. Each of those chains are called fatty acids, and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon. Right? Or a number of carbons strung together.[0:28:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: However many carbons are there determines which type of fatty acid it is. Right? So stearic acid, linoleic acid, like any different number of things. It's also what determines whether or not it's a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated as if, carbon requires a special thing called a double bond. So if there's a double bond across every carbon to carbon, then they're all fully saturated, and you're great.[0:28:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: If there's any of them that are not double bonded, And in fact, an example, if there is one that doesn't have a double bond, that is now called monosaturated. And if there are many, it is called polyunsaturated. So there's pros and cons to all these things. Right. In either case, we're still talking long carbon chains.[0:28:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what a plant will do Is bring in carbon, and then it has this wonderful ability to use energy from the sun called photosynthesis. And it can take those carbons that it inhales And use the energy from the sun to form a bond. Now in our prior discussion when we were, going over hypertrophy, we talked about the energy that was required to go through protein synthesis. That's because forming a new atom, or a new bond between atoms oftentimes takes energy. In these cases, it does.[0:29:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: The same thing happens here. So if a plant does not have oxygen or does not have carbon dioxide in the air, it has no fuel. The basically, think about it is that's what it eats. It needs to get nitrogen from the ground and the soil, just like we need to get nitrogen from our protein. But fuel wise, it needs to get carbon dioxide.[0:29:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then it needs sun To give it energy so it it can actually form that bond. Right? That's what it's getting its fuel from. Alright. So if we think about, a classic, A plant produced the plant that produces either a starch or a fruit.[0:29:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Here's what happens. It inhales that carbon, and then it starts packing it away. Now in a root vegetable, what it does is it stores those things together. And if we store that Thing that we grow fruit at the bottom of it, we tend to call those things starches. Alright?[0:30:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's going to then take the carbon that is packed away in its root and send it up The tree. And it's gonna actually do that by breaking it down into a smaller form of carbohydrate that we tend to often call things like sucrose and glucose. It'll ship that up the tree, it'll go out to the leaves, and it'll convert it into the fruit. And it's gonna eventually transform that stuff into smaller carbon things called fructose. And And if we think about the fruit, or the sugar in fruit, it's often in the form of fructose or sucrose or a combination and sometimes glucose.[0:30:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we have these smaller carbon 6 carbon chains generally in the form of glucose that are being made from this larger storage of, carbohydrates that we call, starch. Right? So it's packed in together. Your body does the exact same thing. So if it's a potato and has a whole bunch of glucose packed away, we call that starch.[0:31:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: If it's in your quadricep and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose away, we now call it glycogen. If it's in your blood as that 6 carbon chain, we call it glucose. If it's in the tree and in the fruit, we call it fructose. Right? Right.[0:31:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Those are different molecules, but that's effectively the same thing happens. So the biology, the chemistry is is almost identical. It just runs in the reverse order. And that's why, again, tubers and potatoes and stuff tend to be starches, and fruits tend to be glucose, fructose, and sucrose. So we have this wonderful circle of light.[0:31:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: The plants can survive on just breathing in the c o two and then getting energy from Nissan, we don't have that ability, at least to my knowledge, to run through photosynthesis. So the only way we can get carbon into our system is to actually ingest carbon, which means we have to eat the starch, the fruit, the animal, some other form of stored Carbon to get that into our system. We then pack that away. We put the carbohydrates, as you mentioned earlier, either on our liver, our blood, or in our muscles. We put the fat generally in adipose tissue.[0:32:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: We'll put a little bit in muscle cells as intramuscular triglycerides, and then the protein we'll use as structure. Right. To do different things. We don't like to use protein as material or a fuel. It's it's better used as structure.[0:32:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: And what we have to do then is if all of a sudden we realize that Storage is getting too much in our body. In other words, we're gaining too much weight. We have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body, and that is metabolism. Right. Anytime we're trying to break a carbon bonds that we can get energy to make ATP, that's gonna release the carbon out of our tissue Into the blood, we have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule to make c o two so we can exhale it and put it back into the atmosphere.[0:33:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a[0:33:00] Andrew Huberman: beautiful description of the circle of life and energy utilization in the human body. I have to ask the question that I'm sure many people are wondering about, which is if indeed we exhale these carbons and As it relates to fat loss, that is the way that we lose fat if we're in a sub caloric state, for instance. Has it ever been explored as to whether Increasing the duration or intensity of exhales can accelerate fat loss. I mean, that's sort of the logical extension of what you described. And here, I'm actually interested, equally in whether or not the answer is yes as well as Whether it could be no.[0:33:45] Andrew Huberman: Because I could imagine if the answer is yes, well, then there's some interesting protocols to emerge from that. But that if it's no, It will reveal to us some important bottlenecks about metabolism and energy utilization.[0:33:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: You ever seen those magicians who, like, show up And, they can tell your mom's name or something like that before you because they can sort of take you down a path. Yeah.[0:34:08] Andrew Huberman: I mean, not to take us down a deep dive tangent, but I once went to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles. And I was one of the people called up front, and a an an incredible magician named, I think his name was Ozzie Mind or something. I think that's right. Had me write my name on a card In a Sharpie pen, I ripped up the card. I ripped it up.[0:34:30] Andrew Huberman: I put it in my pocket. And at the end of the 10 or 15 minute bowed of him doing a bunch of other tricks. He asked me to look in my right shoe, and under my foot in my right shoe was that Card intact.[0:34:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[0:34:47] Andrew Huberman: And it was no longer in my pocket, and I swear in my life I wasn't a, collaborator with it. Yeah. And it to this day, it still Gives me chills because it it but I don't know how magic.[0:34:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Right. Magic. Well, the reason I say that is I've given that little spiel that I just gave you the countless times in my classes. And I would say 99% of the time, as soon as I stop, the very first question is, So can I just, like, do a bunch of exhales and lose fat?[0:35:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Which is wonderful, because I was really hoping you would do that and you rolled right into my trap. You landed perfectly. So I I look like a like a a magician over here.[0:35:24] Andrew Huberman: I feel like I should look in my right shoe right now. No. No. I asked the question because it's the it's the logical extension of what you laid out, but I know biology to be, both, Diabolical Mhmm. And cryptic, but also exquisite in the way that things are arranged, and you don't get something for nothing.[0:35:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: There are no free passes in Theology. Mhmm. That's the saying. No free passes. The answer to your question is yes.[0:35:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: I want a 100% yes. In fact, that is the only way to go about it. You have 2 options. You can ingest less carbon or you can expel more carbon. People always say calories in, calories out.[0:36:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's really carbon in, carbon out. That that's what a calorie is. Right? Calories is the amount of energy we get per breaking a carbon bond. So it's really less in, less more out, less in is Fairly obvious whether that comes in any form.[0:36:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: And by the way, this is exactly why the percentage of your intake coming from fats or carbohydrate, it said, it doesn't really matter that much. If you look at fat loss, clinical trials, you guys may have covered this when Lane was in here. I'm sure, like, this is something he talks about a lot. It doesn't matter. It's irrelevant because it's not about that.[0:36:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's nothing magic in those things. They are different. They have different physiological responses. Everything is different. Right?[0:36:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: No, duh. But in general, it's just simply about carbon intake. Turns out fat has a lot more carbons Per mole than carbohydrates do. So there's more calories per mole in there. So if you the physical amount A fat needs to come in as smaller amount.[0:36:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Physical amount of carbohydrates needs to come in will come in as a larger amount, but you can play any number of Very high carb, low fat. What matters? Total calories. Right? Again, it's not, like, the only thing that matters, but do you know what I'm saying?[0:37:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some percentages in the way can go. Fat loss works fantastic. High fat, low carbohydrate. Why? Why?[0:37:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why do the other things work? Because it's not about that. It's about Total intake of carbon, total exhale. So absolutely can you lose fat by simply exhaling more? In fact, that is exactly what you did this morning.[0:37:28] Andrew Huberman: When I hopped on the Airdyne bike for[0:37:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: 4 weeks anything. Right? The question is, can you think of a scenario in which you could have a bunch of Increased rates of exhalation that helps in fat loss.[0:37:40] Andrew Huberman: Sure. I can think of a lot of things that will stimulate increased rates of exhalation.[0:37:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: One thing could be simply going right? And so the question is, like, can I literally do some breath protocols where I force exhale and lose fat? And the answer is yes. But what happens? What happens if you do hyperventilation training?[0:38:01] Andrew Huberman: Well, my lab studies Cyclic hyperventilation is one of our many, deliberate protocols. Uh-huh. And one of the most prominent things that one observes is that levels of adrenaline Increase very quickly.[0:38:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Extremely quickly.[0:38:15] Andrew Huberman: People feel jittery, anxious, stressed, and unless they are consciously trying to anchor They're thinking about what that means and the benefit set to persisting. Typically, they abort the cyclic hyperventilation protocol really quickly.[0:38:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Within seconds. Right. You will feel tingling, sweating, all kinds of things. You're hyperventilating. Right?[0:38:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: And we could we could talk in nauseam about, how that changes everything from Adrenaline to focus the the whole bunch of things. So unfortunately, a strategy of sitting around, just exhaling more than you inhale, Technically, helps you lose more fat, but it's not going to last very long. So then the question is, well, how do I get into a situation or scenario in which I can Increase my rate of expiration where I'm not gonna pass out. I'm not going and altering hypocapnea and hypercapnia issues. Any idea of a situation in which you would have an enhanced rate of ex explanation without worrying about passing out?[0:39:08] Andrew Huberman: Through a steady state exercise.[0:39:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Or not steady state exercise, lifting weights, intervals, moderate training, repeated, any of these things. They all work equally for fat loss because all they're doing is increasing respiration rate. They're saying increased demand for energy, Increased exhalation. That's the trick here. And when you equate these things to that, they have equal success in fat loss.[0:39:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: It doesn't matter theoretically where you're getting it from. And so when we get into this idea of, well, what are the best training strategies for fat loss? It doesn't matter which one of these tactics you pick as long as you maintain a consistent adherence over time. Because of this exact fact, it doesn't matter if you're burning, quote, unquote, fat in the exercise session or if you're burning carbohydrates in the exercise session. It is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time.[0:40:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: K. Now there's some significant misconceptions there About what I just talked, and I would and I would love to come back and walk through that in more detail. But that's the main take home message here. It won't matter what's coming in, and it won't matter what's coming out because in either case, it is the same rate of oxygen in and c o two out. That's the key metric.[0:40:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: And hopefully, this helps a lot of people have some relief because they're like, man, you're so tied up on what is the exact protocol We're training for optimizing fat loss. What's the exact nutritional intervention I need for fat loss? And then you wonder why all these different diets can work effectively And wonder why all these different training protocols you know, surely, you know somebody who lost a bunch of weight, and the only thing they did is they just started running. There was no advanced program. They just started running, and they ran 5 miles every day.[0:40:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: That works. And then tons of people who tried that and, like, didn't lose anyway. And lots of people who went to, I went to cardio kickboxing class lost weight. Oh, I just started doing intervals on my why why? Mysteriously, do all these things work?[0:41:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: There there you have something has some spidey sense have to has to be going off in your brain. We're like, there has to be something linking these things. And And what's linking it is simply carbon exchange. So put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and inhaling without passing out. The other problem is if you were to simply do a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation would go up.[0:41:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: After that, you would correct and go in the opposite direction. So that's the problem is your net carbon output over the course of the day is not gonna change unless you increase the demand for energy. And that's how you get to that negative state.[0:41:46] Andrew Huberman: Along these lines of exhaling carbons, as the route for fat loss, it makes me wonder whether or not Increasing lung capacity is possible. I'm guessing the answer is yes.[0:41:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[0:41:59] Andrew Huberman: And whether or not increasing lung capacity is a good goal en route to enhancing fat loss. Essentially, what I'm asking is if you can offload more c o two, a k carbons per Exhale. Are you a more efficient fat loss machine?[0:42:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a wonderful thought, and the answer would be no. Not something you worry about because If you were to excel more carbon than actually needed, now we're in a state of inefficiency. You're burning way more energy than needed to do your activity. The heart has a metric called cardiac output. This is in sciences.[0:42:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: We abbreviate this as q For some odd reasons, it's either c o or q. And cardiac output is heart rate multiplied by stroke volume. So it's how many beats per minute you're having as well as how much blood's coming out of it. So cardiac output is actually very specific to energy needs. If you try to work around that, it's just going to adjust itself.[0:42:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what I mean by this is, If you were able to increase your stroke volumes, the amount of blood coming out per pump, you would automatically adjust to reduce your heart rate so that you keep Cardiac output, exact to energetic demands. So you're sort of pushing one end of this of the spectrum, but your body will pull the other one back to keep you at that exact same neutral So, if you look at if you think about, like, cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training, any type of endurance training, A common thing people will understand is resting heart rate. And so what that number is is just how many beats per minute you're having when you're sitting here doing nothing. A very positive adaptation is a lowering of that resting rate over time. As general numbers, what you will hear is people will say things like, A a normal resting heart rate is between 60 to 80 beats per minute.[0:43:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: And, you know, if any of the things I've talked about, with the individuals I work with, I don't work with anybody with disease, just to to clarify that. I don't do anything with disease management treatment, anything. It's always about people who are in a good spot, who wanna optimize or get to the next level, whether this is professional athletes trying to To to peak for physical performance or, the folks in our rapid health optimization program that feel good. Again, it's not disease stuff, and they wanna feel incredible. One of the metrics we're gonna pay attention to is this resting heart rate.[0:44:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: So here's what happens. As you improve your endurance, Your resting heart rate will go down. If I see somebody over 70 beats per minute, unless something's going on, you're not physically fed. Regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote within the normative values, I wanna see everybody sub 60 beats per minute or close. Right?[0:44:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: That is not a difficult thing to really get to for most people. So if you train a lot, regardless of how you train intervals, steady state, Doesn't matter. That resting heart rate will come down. But since energy demands at rest haven't really changed, cardiac output stays the same. So what happens is stroke volume goes up.[0:44:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: So literally, like we trained your quadriceps on the Legosensor machine To get stronger so you can produce more force per contraction, the heart will do the exact same thing. And so as you're able to get more of the blood out of your heart Per pump, the heart realizes I don't need to pump as often. So that's the compensatory adaptation, which is saying, hey, look. I don't need to beat 60 times a minute. I now need to beat 55 times a minute because I'm getting the same amount of blood out per pump, chill.[0:45:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: And this is why your resting heart rate goes down, your resting stroke volume goes up, but your cardiac output is identical. So that's not a good metric of fitness. It's going to stay the same. Cardiac output will only adjust for energetic changes. Right?[0:45:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Energy requirements in the acute moment. Right? How much do I need? Go. Which is gonna be determined by ventilation.[0:45:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? How much air am I bringing in and putting out? That's gonna determine cardiac output, and that's gonna determine where we're at. If you were to do, like, a submaximal exercise test, when you are unfit to when you're fit, or when you're fit to where you're super fit, At Sub Max, you're gonna see the same thing. Cardiacalpa will be identical, and you're like, damn, nothing happened.[0:46:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: What you're not realizing is your heart rate At that same workload is now lower. And that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher. Where it gets people tripped up is at max, Because you may not see a much of a change at max, because you won't really you don't really see an increase in maximum heart rate with fitness. That's not a thing. Right.[0:46:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for fit or unfit or anything like that. Stroke volume will get limited eventually by filling capacity of your heart. It has to have so much time to fill up with blood before it can contract again and squeeze the blood out. And when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute, that just doesn't leave much time to fill. And so it won't really push you past that.[0:46:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, don't worry about trying to increase your maximum heart rate. That's not necessarily a good thing, and it won't really Change. But your cardiac output will because stroke volume will be higher.[0:46:55] Andrew Huberman: But that doesn't necessarily mean that I should avoid training that gets me up toward maximal heart rate. Correct?[0:47:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oh, you should absolutely do it. Let me do it.[0:47:01] Andrew Huberman: Right. That's what that was my assumption. I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic, and an adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.[0:47:20] Andrew Huberman: The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals, and the probiotics are especially important to me. Athletic greens also contains adaptogens, which which are critical for recovering from stress, from exercise, from work, or just general life.

Getting back to energy production and metabolism. So We've got these different modes of moving energy, but making and breaking energy bonds in the body, moving energy into different tissues and out of different tissues, and indeed out of the body through exhalation. How do each of these different modes of Energy utilization relate to different modes of movement and exercise. Yep.[0:48:20] Andrew Huberman: In my mind, I'm starting to draw a bridge between Okay. When I walk for 60 minutes, you know, if I'm talking, I'm breathing a bit more. Maybe I'm burning a little more fat.[0:48:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: After all,[0:48:34] Andrew Huberman: speech is is a, modified exhale.[0:48:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. How come Amazing.[0:48:38] Andrew Huberman: If I'm sprinting, breathing differently. And if I'm, you know, doing a 30 minute moderate, quote, unquote, moderate jog, breathing differently. So you've beautifully illustrated this bridge in energy production utilization and carbon dioxide offload through exhalation. What are some of the specifics about energy utilization According to different modes of exercise and if we could better define modes of exercise or Yep. Types of exercise that trigger specific adaptations, I think this is where the The bridge will move from being a a mere line to a a real structure.[0:49:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Absolutely. I wanna lay one more foundational piece. And then It's going to be much easier to understand the limitations I put on some of these training protocols as well as the lack of limitations. K.[0:49:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's really, really important. The way I wanna start this is we have this this foundation now of of carbon and and basic energy production. That's not to say there is no difference. There is, and that difference is important. But maybe we can answer the question from earlier, which is Actually, it was something you asked me this morning when we were exercising.[0:49:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're like, training fasted. Right? Does training fasted Enhance fat loss. And the logic is sound. If I don't have any fuel, then I should be burning more fat, therefore, I should be losing more it sound it's not true.[0:50:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is this great idea? It's one of these classic things in science and exercise physiology where, like, sounds good. Turns out it's not. It's actually a a pretty gross misunderstanding of metabolism. So it's not to pick on that topic.[0:50:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't really care about that topic, but it is a it's a common question. It also gives me an opportunity to just tell you more about metabolism. So here's what happens. You are breathing in o two and breathing out c o However, the ratio to that is what we call the either r e r, respiratory exchange ratio, or r q, respiratory quotient. And I'm not gonna differentiate those 2.[0:50:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're not the same thing, but we're gonna Pass that for now. As you begin to increase exercise intensity, the percentage of o two to c o two rises in the favor of c o two. So you start breathing out way more c o two than you are breathing in o two. Right? And so if we were to look at that number, you know, what's the relationship?[0:50:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: It goes up. So at rest, most people have a, of a value that we would typically call something like 0.6. K? And that's again the relationship between 0 2 and c o two. Maybe 0.7.[0:51:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you were to go for a walk, that increases slightly Because you're now expiring c o two at a higher rate. So now you've moved up to say 0.8 or something like that. One of the ways that we mark somebody of Achieving an actual VO two max on a test is if that value exceeds 1.1. Now Any of you who are paying attention are thinking, well, wait a minute. How the hell can a ratio between 2 things ever get past 1?[0:51:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, that's because you're getting to a place where you're actually offloading more t o two that is actually necessary. And this is what actually causes and explains a thing that people like to call EPOC, Which is excess exercise post oxygen consumption. This is another way to think about it. The only reason you're breathing is to bring in oxygen and offload c o two. Right.[0:51:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: If I'm no longer exercising, why am I still breathing? In other words, Once you stop the demand or the need for for energy, you should stop ventilating, but you don't. Right. That's because in the case of low intensity exercise, the second you stop, you're right back down to resping ventilation. No problem.[0:52:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because you were able to match the need for energy with the offload of waste 1 to 1 during that exercise. When you start creeping up the intensity, you can't do that. So you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here. So even though you're done exercising, you're still ventilating because you have to pay that back. And pay that back, by that, I specifically mean you have to bring in oxygen because you have a whole bunch of waste that's been accumulating in your tissue that you've got to deal with.[0:52:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I I'll walk you through what that waste is. It's a Particular molecule that a lot of people have heard of but grossly misunderstand. So you gotta be able to handle that. So the reason that you sit there and go And continue to ventilate is because you're now trying to pay back that excess post exercise oxygen debt. That's that oxygen debt we're specifically talking about.[0:53:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. So That being said, as we start cruising up that our queue starts going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, and if we get the 1 year 1 point o, you're you're in a, Like, you're hurting. You're in a you're in a pretty good spot. Alright.[0:53:20] Andrew Huberman: I like that. You're hurting. You're in a pretty good spot.[0:53:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. It's[0:53:23] Andrew Huberman: a a window going to doctor Andy Galpin's mind. Yeah. Now you really wanna be a subject in his, his laboratory studies. Sure. Masochists swarmed to Andy's lab.[0:53:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Absolutely. Alright. So the idea that I will lose more fat By being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat, it seems to make sense, but it's a massive failure to understand The metabolism, it's the exact same explanation to why exercising fasted doesn't matter. So the exercising fasted issue under normal circumstances is irrelevant Because you have plenty of fuel in the system even when you haven't eaten breakfast that morning. Now if you're talking like extended fasting over multiple days, This is a different scenario.[0:54:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: If muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, and blood glucose are at sufficient levels, then you absolutely have enough energy to perform almost Any type of exercise that most people are doing, you know, maybe if you're Rob and you're at mile 20 today, it's a different story. But the vast majority of us have plenty of fuel sitting around, So we're not going to burn more into fat, just because we didn't eat breakfast that morning. So that just doesn't make energetic sense. We have a lot of backup supplies, you're never out. The trick here is this, is there's an there's a concept here we call crossover concept.[0:54:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: So as we are starting to move up exercise intensity, We start burning a higher percentage of our fuel from carbohydrates and a lower percentage of our fuel coming from fat. I'm sleeping. That's the highest percentage of your fuel that will be coming from fat of any activity you could ever do. So if the theory That I'm gonna stay at a lower intensity to burn more fat was true. The optimal fat burning strategy would then be to sleep.[0:55:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, that doesn't make sense. Of course, it doesn't. So why would then going at a slightly elevated rate somehow all of a sudden magically make you lose fat? It It doesn't actually make sense. When you think about that, we were like, oh, yeah.[0:55:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's no way. So it's a percentage trick. It's a difference between absolute and relative. This is what this confusion is. So, yes, as you start doing lower intensity exercise, whether you're fast or not, it's it's irrelevant.[0:55:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: But lower intensity size. A greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat. However, your total fuel expenditure is very low. So that whole total carbon balance is not really being shifted much. As you start exercising at a very high intensity, You actually start getting a higher percentage of your fuel from carbohydrate and a lower percentage from fat.[0:55:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, at rest, About the highest you can get in most people is about 60% of your fuel from fat. As you're sleeping, You might be 70%, but you'll never be in a position ever. No matter what sort of thing you've heard on the Internet, you'll never be in a situation Where fat is your only fuel source. The highest I've probably ever seen is, like, 70%. You should probably be at about that's that's a kind of a good number to to think, honestly but people will who understand a little bit about metabolism to be dangerous, but not enough.[0:56:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: We'll we'll throw out these terms like fat adapted. And fat adapted is a real thing, but it is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes. Right? It is this idea thinking, like, I can get to a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning. Maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not the same thing at all.[0:56:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. That's the confusion. So if you enhance fat oxidation in exercise, that does not enhance fat loss Per se. Right? So this is a lot of the confusion that's happening.[0:57:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So as we start moving up, we can never get in a position where we're using Fat only as a fuel. Again, at best, you're at 70% fat, 30% carbohydrate. For a lot of reasons, we probably just don't have time to get into today. However, the opposite is possible.[0:57:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: When you get into true high intensity exercise, you'll be basically 100% carbohydrate and 0% fat. Alright. That is is very possible. That in fact is 1 point o. That's what our cue.[0:57:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: 1.1 is actually because your ventilation got so high, you actually exceeded that number Even though you're at a 100% carbohydrate, this is what people came up the idea then. It's like, woah, I don't wanna burn carbs. I wanna lose fat. So my response to that is always like, okay, great. So it makes sense burning fat, losing fat.[0:57:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Burning carbs is losing what then? Like, you think your liver shrunk? Like, wait a minute. What did you lose then? Where did it come from?[0:57:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's all coming as carbon. Don't worry about where it came from for your fuel. It just has to come out as carbon. Right? There are differences in exercise efficiency for Performance with our professional athletes, of course.[0:58:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: But if the only goal here is fat loss, it doesn't matter where you get it from. The last bridge we have to connect here is like, wait a minute. If I only burned carbohydrate, how did I actually lose that fat? There was there was that Love handle sitting on the side of me, how did that come out of me if I never burned that from my fuel? What you're failing to understand is there's a balance game that happens And so if you were to do a bunch of high intensity exercise training and you burned only muscle glycogen and blood glucose and maybe even you did it for so long, you burned some Liver glycogen.[0:58:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: The body understands that it is expelled a lot of energy from that side of the equation. It's going to do a couple of things. Now it's very difficult to go through this fancy situation where you convert carbohydrates into fat and back and forth. Like, that's actually, like, fairly hard. What's easier to do is something you said earlier is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source.[0:59:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: So in that scenario, Where you're down really low in your carbohydrate carbohydrate stores. Any carbohydrates you bring in are going to go to storage. And since your net energy expenditure is something that your body regulates a lot, any fat that you then bring in is going to be utilized as a fuel source because it knows it doesn't need anymore. That is in excess. So that's how you actually use fat as a fuel because you've burned down carbohydrate storages.[0:59:35] Andrew Huberman: As I'm hearing this, a couple of things come to mind. First of all, thank you for that incredibly important description of what is otherwise a very Confusing landscape for most people. One of the key points I took away, and I just wanna say from the outset, this is not exhaustive by any stretch, Is that burning fat does not equal losing fat from the body? Correct. And then burning fat has to be divided into burning of body fat stores, and we need to distinguish that from burning of dietary fat that is brought in.[1:00:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[1:00:09] Andrew Huberman: Oftentimes, people don't disambiguate those. Correct. Right? And I'm also understanding that reducing one's body carbohydrate stores, muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, etcetera, Occurs during high intensity exercise. Yep.[1:00:25] Andrew Huberman: There's other ways, but that is one very efficient way to tap into those stores, which makes me wonder Again, this is one of these things that doesn't lead to a protocol makes me wonder whether or not doing high intensity let's say, weight training for 45 to 60 minutes, 75 minutes of strength training, power training, hypertrophy training, which we've covered in an episode about those topics, and then doing some steady state cardiovascular exercise. Is there any benefit to that arrangement that would, quote, unquote, enhance body fat loss from the body, to be very specific now. Because unlike the idea that training fasted would shift the bias towards fat loss, which it doesn't, you've told us, Under those conditions, muscle glycogen and maybe even liver glycogen is going to be depleted. Put simply, can I enhance body fat loss by doing some cardio after a bout of weight training?[1:01:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you equate for total energy expenditure, it won't matter. Now that you did bring up a very important point that I wanna clarify. If you look at the exercise modalities that we laid out in our previous, conversations. We talked about 9 different adaptations. 1 was skill and then speed, power, strength, Hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity, aerobic capacity, and long duration endurance.[1:01:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now speed, Power and skill development have almost no benefit for phallos because remember, those are low weight, A lot of rest and low volume. They're not really really going to be helpful. You can make a little bit of a case for strength, A little bit. But the total energy expenditure for strength training, even if it's an hour, if it's truly strength training, it's fairly low.[1:02:17] Andrew Huberman: Because the repetitions are in the 1 to 3 range[1:02:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's exactly it's not up for total work. So if you're trying to develop a protocol that sort of optimizes fat loss, What you wanna do, you were close. In my opinion, is do a combination of something in the hypertrophy slash muscular endurance Strength training realm.[1:02:36] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So, 6 to 30 repetitions[1:02:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: Something like that.[1:02:41] Andrew Huberman: Resistance training.[1:02:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great.[1:02:42] Andrew Huberman: Deplete muscle glycogen, maybe even a bit of liver glycogen.[1:02:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe a little bit depending on if you're doing it for a long time, but probably not a noticeable amount.[1:02:49] Andrew Huberman: Okay. So an hour of of, hypertrophy type training.[1:02:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: If if you're training hard with low rest intervals and you really did an hour, you would for sure get there. But most people don't. Because that's[1:02:58] Andrew Huberman: the reason why crave Large bowls of oatmeal and rice after I do weight training. Yeah. Replenish muscle glycogen.[1:03:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. Right? Then You maybe do a little bit of very high intensity, maximum heart rate well over revealed to max, hard as you can for 20, 30, 45, 60 seconds, something like that with some recovery. A lot of recovery and repeated, And that's going to do a great job of replenishing muscle glycogen. Right?[1:03:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you do that long enough, you'll get the liver. But again, most people don't because it's really, really hard To go that hard[1:03:31] Andrew Huberman: So liver is sort of last last resort.[1:03:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Basic mechanics here, which which we'll actually get into is is our, like, 3rd segment here is, energy production comes from local exercising muscle, first and foremost, from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate stores. And so again and we store it in most. We call it glycogen. Right?[1:03:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's just your first sign of light on defense. If you need glucose outside of that, you're gonna start pulling it from the blood. But one of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything, blood pH, blood glucose, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations. Like, it really does not wanna mess with those things at all. It will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized.[1:04:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? You generally, because you need all those things for your brain to work, And your brain will stop working. Right? If you lose blood pressure, it won't go up there. PH changes.[1:04:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can't run metabolism. Electrolytes change. You can't think. And glucose is a primary fuel source for the brain. It's Gonna be a problem.[1:04:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So if that number starts to come down because you're grabbing glucose out of the blood, your liver is gonna then kick in. It's gonna break down its glycogen to put Glucose in the blood to keep the blood number the level. In fact, one of the things you'll see is blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise. They don't fall.[1:04:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: They, in fact, they rise, as a anticipatory state. If you train a lot, your blood crystal start going up before you start moving. It knows it's coming. Right? So you you can play that game.[1:04:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can rob Peter to pay Paul for a long time until your liver runs out. And that's what actually is a bonk in terms of, like, long duration endurance stuff. You're talking many, many, many miles, several hours. Typically, we say, oh, it's gotta be over 2 hours, before your liver starts to become a real problem or it has to be tremendously intense. Because of those reasons, you have to burn through just a lot of energy before your liver starts to get into a problem.[1:05:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can continue to train when your muscle glycogen levels are low. In fact, people say glycogen depletion in muscle, but it's it's generally a misnomer. You are going to have tremendous signals of fatigue when that number gets lower than 75%. So people think that, like, their muscles are getting heavy. You you're probably still 75% full.[1:05:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: A lot of folks will co quit around the 50%. The highest I've ever seen is, like, 95% true depletion, and that's an extremely high level cross country skiers and, like, they're deltoid. It's very, very low. Some very talented runners will get fairly low in their quads, But the vast majority of folks, by the time you're 50% depleted, you're gonna quit. It's going to be really, really challenging.[1:05:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're never really going to get that low. It's like a bit of a protective mechanism. Right? But when your liver gets low, you're gonna be shut down. And that's the case of if you ever been to, like, a marathon and you've seen people run, like, 25 and a half miles, And then they just like bonk.[1:06:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: They go into, like, baby deers walking stands and then they collapse. And you're like, how are you mentally weak? Like, you ran 26 miles and you can't run the last point. It ain't mentally weak. It is if your liver is done, it's gonna stop you because there's no more backup reserves.[1:06:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Muscle, you can get away with. You could push through it. Liver will not let you go any farther.[1:06:23] Andrew Huberman: I find this fascinating because it makes me wonder whether or not the liver being depleted sends a neural signal to the brain Oh, absolutely. Or the brain must register Some signal, like, I would like to be alive tomorrow. Thank you. Whatever is happening right now, stopping is going to be safer than continuing.[1:06:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:06:43] Andrew Huberman: And so that stop signal, is is one that I think a lot of people, including myself, are are intrigued by because we always think that it's, related to willpower.[1:06:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[1:06:52] Andrew Huberman: But The brain needs to preserve itself. And as the master computer, I mean, there are ways to go into kind of automaton type, you know, not thinking, just doing type, behavior.[1:07:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have override switches. Right? And you can play those cards, and you can get better at learning and be being less sensitive To that switch, that's exactly what happened when you first start training. Right? You start to realize like, oh, my gosh, I'm super tired.[1:07:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then you realize really quick, like, I'm I'm totally fine here. And this is like the Pick pick pick your person who's made sayings like this, but it's like you're really only 10% depleted or 30% or 40% or something We're all[1:07:27] Andrew Huberman: operating Send them[1:07:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: what[1:07:28] Andrew Huberman: we could do.[1:07:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Of course. Any of those things are true because it is like a little bit of an override. You've just gotten very sensitive to being a small percentage depleted, and you've learned, okay, I'm tired. And there is a long way to go past that. But once you get past that and and you flip that override switch a lot, you just you're going to break quickly Because you have to basically learn to ignore that signal, and problems can happen really quickly after that.[1:07:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that's even experienced Endurance athletes, if you hit that level, it's like you're going to be hitting the concrete next. And that's, you know, potentially a problem.[1:08:01] Andrew Huberman: I I wanna make sure I understand a concept that you referred to earlier correctly because I have a feeling that I don't. And that's this issue of How the body accesses body fat stores Mhmm. When in a subcoloric state, and I'm doing mainly glycogen burning exercise.[1:08:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:08:24] Andrew Huberman: What I heard you say, and please correct me where I'm undoubtedly wrong. What I heard you say was that, okay, I go into the gym and I start lifting weights. I'm burning muscle glycogen, mostly local to the muscles that I'm using, and then I start pulling glycogen from the bloodstream. Maybe there's some Body fat stores that are mobilized, probably not dipping into my liver glycogen. Okay.[1:08:54] Andrew Huberman: I complete the workout. Maybe I even hop up on the Airdyne bike and do a little sprint. Yep. I go for a jog. Maybe, I eat immediately afterward.[1:09:02] Andrew Huberman: Maybe I don't eat for a few hours afterwards. But across the day, I ingest fewer calories than I burn. Is it the case that body fat Is mobilized in order to replace the glycogen that my subcaloric intake Was insufficient to provide? In other words, because I didn't eat enough to fill the glycogen stores, am I using body fat converted into glycogen to fill those stores.[1:09:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[1:09:36] Andrew Huberman: And if so, is that a case where I'm no longer exhaling Carbons, in order to burn body fat, but rather I'm repurposing body fat into muscle. Have I turned fat into muscle in that case?[1:09:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I'm I'm really glad, You asked this because I did a very poor job on that last point talking about earlier. I'm realizing playing back in my head because that's that's so many really good questions. You cannot Turn fat into muscle.[1:10:01] Andrew Huberman: Can you turn muscle into fat? No. I'm so glad you said that because when I was in college[1:10:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[1:10:07] Andrew Huberman: Our, I don't wanna out that person. The physiology teacher seemed to think still at that point that One could, lift weights, get muscular, but then it would eventually turn into body fat. That that I that myth is, I think, largely been dispelled.[1:10:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: I heard that so many times, as a kid, I heard it so many times in college. I heard it so I heard it so many times in our, undergraduate students From other faculty and and such. So, no. Like, they are not the same structures. They are very different.[1:10:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Let me let me take you out on answering this better. You're really, really, really close. So yeah. If you were to do that type of exercise where you've burned a lot of most local glycogen, How is it I'm losing stored fat? Right.[1:10:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's really the crux of the question. And it doesn't even actually matter if you then went ahead and ingested extra, Carbohydrates or fat post exercise, that's not really a thing. You hit on a couple of key things. Number 1, this is all under the assumption that total caloric intake is still low. Right?[1:11:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have[1:11:11] Andrew Huberman: to total need.[1:11:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Below total need. Right. Okay. I also wanna flag Calories in, calories out is not the only thing that matters. This is a very complex thing.[1:11:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Calories in is incredibly The complicated calories out is even more complicated. Okay? So we just maybe another series we can spend on that alone. So don't don't go nuts about that. You have to be hypocaloric one way or the other.[1:11:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you burn a bunch of myosyl glycogen and you are hypercholic, You're still going to add fat. If you burn amounts of muscle glycogen and you're hypocaloric, you're going to lose fat. Right? Think about it this way. You're in a negative calorie state.[1:11:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Where are those calories going to come from? Are you gonna reduce your muscle glycogen storages permanently? No. No. Are you gonna reduce your glycogen storage in your liver?[1:12:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. You wanna reduce blood glucose? No. No way. Right?[1:12:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: So where is that extra energy coming from? It's coming from your storage fat. It is your backup reserve energy system. The way that I wanna like this years. People tend to think about it as like carbohydrates versus fat.[1:12:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's not it's it's more like a chain, more like a bicycle where there's a front Gear and a back gear. You turn 1 gear, it turns the other one. These are complimentary systems. They are not and or systems. Right?[1:12:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're you're turning 1. And when we go through carbohydrate metabolism, maybe here in a second, you'll understand why you have to have an anaerobic and anaerobic component There is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen. That has to happen. The only way To engage in fat metabolism is aerobic and oxygen. There's no anaerobic component to it.[1:12:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a fundamental difference there. So The your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible. It is the primary fuel source for a reason. Your fat is not meant to be flexible. It is meant to be unlimited.[1:13:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's the basic point. So you want flexibility over here and an unlimited capacity over there. Now I'm safeguarded against Any energetic need. K? I need to run up a hill for safety.[1:13:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Cool. Carbohydrates are there. I need to then run for 17 hours. Cool. Fat is there.[1:13:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: We want both of these systems. You wanna be able to have great energy throughout the day. You want a slow drip coming from fat. You don't want up and down, up and down. Feel great.[1:13:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Up and down. Awesome. You wanna be able to think very quickly and get hyper focused. Boom. Carbohydrates ramp right up.[1:13:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Get it into the brain, get thinking better, get thinking clearly fast. So we want all these, not just for exercise purposes for but for activities of daily living, we want an optimal system I'm here. And when people use the terms like fat adapted, they're generally hijacking that, and they're thinking it used to be a thing we said all the time in, like, All of my undergraduate classes for years, and that idea of metabolic flexibility is using optimal fuel sources and optimal types, not maximizing fat usage. The the people have co opted that term, a metabolic flexibility to be like, oh, yeah.[1:14:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Therefore, learn how to maximize fat burning. That's not what that term means. That term means Maximizing your ability to use whatever fuel is optimal in that time. Now I'll grant you most people aren't fantastic at using fat as a fuel source Relative to the other direction, but nonetheless, the the the gold standard here should be maximizing both.[1:14:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Finally answering your question. If I were to To burn a bunch of muscle glycogen, how am I losing that fat? Well, the fuel you're ingesting in that hypochloric state is going to say, hey, look. We have a lot of muscle glycogen we have to replenish.[1:14:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So any carbohydrate that comes in needs to be biased towards storage. It's gotta go into those tissue. Any fat that comes in or doesn't even come in, but any fat that we're using for fuel needs to be utilized for activity. And that's where the caloric expenditure from fat comes in. So you're basically saying your general physiology, The energy for that starts coming from fat, and the energy that's coming in from carbohydrate needs to be simply stored.[1:15:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so what you see is your respiratory quotient changes. Right. The RER is going is going off. And so in the exercise moment, it shot way up for carbohydrates and shot way down for fat. As the compensatory response, it goes the other direction because your body is saying we are low on carbohydrates.[1:15:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Don't use them for fuel Unless we absolutely has to. Right? So use them for storage. Get our fuel from the fat side of the equation. And so what you're generally going to say is, like, Oh, I'm burning more fat just sitting around after things like that.[1:15:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that's not even taking into the equation the epoch Part, which is like it's it's not actually as large as people think it is. It's fairly small, but it is it adds up sort of over time. So, does that explain a little bit better about how you lose fat when you actually only burn carbs for exercise?[1:16:05] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. You explained it beautifully. You talked about EPOC, the post exercise oxygen consumption Yeah. Not being that significant in terms of energy utilization. Even though today we're talking about endurance and different forms of endurance, I do have to ask whether or not people consider the elevation in Basal metabolism that occurs when there's more muscle around Yeah.[1:16:31] Andrew Huberman: Because muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue. You know, if is there a straightforward ish equation? You know, if one adds 1 pound of of Mhmm. Lean muscle tissue to their body. Even if it's distributed across multiple muscle groups, does that equate to, a caloric need of x number of calories per day.[1:16:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:16:53] Andrew Huberman: And is that because of the muscle protein synthesis needs of that muscle or it's Glycogen Storage needs or both.[1:17:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you don't have enough muscle, you start to have problems with fat losses. It's difficult challenge. If you have enough muscle, and you're just trying to get extremely large. If you fear FFMI is 24 and you're 15% body fat, adding more muscle is not really gonna play a lot in the equation, and here's why. Muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat, but fat is not inert.[1:17:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So fat is still going to burn a a small number of calories. Muscle burns more, but it's not nearly what people think it is. I'm a muscle guy. I'm a muscle physiologist. I would love to Get people to have more muscle for any excuse I can.[1:17:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not honest to say that though. You're talking about when I was in Undergraduate, we would say numbers like 50 kcals per day per pound is what you can look at. Right? So if you put on a a pound of muscle spread across the body, Your basal metabolic rate would go up by around 50 calories, per day. I think that number is grossly exaggerated.[1:17:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's probably a tenth of that. Six to 10 calories? Maybe. It's it's hard to know exactly what that number is, but the more recent estimates are are are something like that. So now on one hand, you could say, oh my gosh, that is not even meaningful.[1:18:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: The other hand, you could say that's super meaningful. It just depends on time domain you wanna Put that out. Right? So if you were to put on 5 pounds of muscle and your basal metabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories a day, well, over the course of a 1000 days, Like, that actually adds up. So you you could slice this any way you want.[1:18:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now maybe that number is somewhere in between. I don't really know. It's not a field I pay that much attention to candidly, Because it's it's not a metric, kinda like epoch, where it's like, we used to really harp on it, And now it's sort of like, wow, maybe we exaggerated that, like, honestly, just a bit. But to me, it doesn't change the equation much because if you Don't have enough muscle. As I described, there are other consequences that are gonna make fat loss hard.[1:18:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so you need to have sufficient muscle. If the additional caloric expenditure is the carrot, great. If it's something else, I don't really care. There's just enough evidence that you need to have it, Or I should say there's enough evidence that it will really help you in your path. Maybe a few calories here or there is not really that thing, especially if you Understand.[1:19:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: A normal food item, anything you pick is going to be probably a couple of 100 calories. One bad food choice a day will out kick almost any amount of coverage you got on a adding muscle mass to you. So, like, You're you're really stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime. If you're worried about how many calories you're getting from adding muscle, fat loss is gonna be about regulating that carbon intake above and beyond Anything else.[1:19:41] Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.

One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA test out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy.[1:20:17] Andrew Huberman: They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also What sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you? If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit InsideTracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's InsideTracker.com/ a Huberman to get 20% off. So I've heard about this concept of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few times. Frankly, you're the 1st person who's ever explained it to me in a clear and concise way.[1:20:53] Andrew Huberman: How do I know if I am metabolically flexible? And how do I increase my metabolic flexibility?[1:21:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. There's no specific standard, which is Actually a good thing. Right? And so if you have a level of specificity that you want or need metabolically, Then you don't actually want to be in this middle ground. An example would be if you are a performing in a type of or an athlete who performs in a sport that is glycoly dominated.[1:21:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't want to be optimally Metabolically flexible. You don't wanna be super, quote, unquote, fat adapted. You wanna be biased towards the energy you're going to use. The same could be true for the other end of the spectrum. So in those particular cases, It's not optimal to be equally effective because there are no free passes in physiology.[1:21:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Your Energy producing systems will up regulate or down regulate accordingly. So you will actually limit your ability To say maximally utilize carbohydrates as a fuel if you're trying to up regulate your ability to use fat as a fuel. And so this is like there's a saturation point. Outside of that spectrum, most people would just say, hey.[1:22:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Like, I wanna feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things. How do you know? Couple of things. There's a lot of biological markers you can take. There's also just some some practical takes.[1:22:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now none of these markers by themselves are any sign. What you wanna do is probably a couple of them, And then say, okay. This is maybe a clue. So, again, it's really important to emphasize, not a single one of these tests that I'm about to walk you through Automatically means you can't use fat as a fuel or the other case, which is maybe you're poor at using carbohydrate as a fuel. So disclaimers aside, we'll we'll get into a couple of them.[1:22:41] Andrew Huberman: So should we think about these as informative and useful, but not diagnostic?[1:22:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Exactly. We would call this data inspired or data led and not data driven. Right. K. Cool.[1:22:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: So number 1, you wanna think about just Overall functionality, do you have a reasonable regulation of your energy throughout the day? Now many things could be going into this, which is why these are not specific diagnostics. But, as a basic measure, we talked about blood glucose levels. You know, a lot of people will say, again, you want that to be something like between 80 90, milligrams per deciliter is a blood glucose level. And and if you can go look at the the cutoff points For what determines to be prediabetic and type 2 diabetic, etcetera.[1:23:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: What I can actually recommend, this is there's a little bit of science here actually that I'll talk you through. Lot of this is my personal preference. I generally want people to be at 85 or lower, and that's because of a couple of things. Number 1, there's actually some papers that showed any, every single point increase above 85 Increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by about 6%. Okay.[1:23:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. So technically, while maybe 90 or 95 or even up to a 100 are, you know, In the quote, unquote normative values, that's one clue. Again, it's not definitive by itself. It doesn't mean anything. You need to really pay attention to what increasing by 6% actually means, but it's a data point where I'm looking at.[1:24:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: If I actually then see symptomology and we run you through maybe some questionnaires, ask how you're feeling throughout the day, and we see uncontrolled energy bouts. So you're lot of energy, then you get really, really tired Ariden. Swings. Okay. Another data point.[1:24:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. And we may patch a few of these things together. That may give me some clues. That being said, Again, this a lot of this rhetoric is used to then scare people off of carbohydrates, and that is I wanna be as clear as possible. That is not not truly, The only thing people should care about, right, it can be a thing that can also be unrelated.[1:24:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: There are reasons you could have blood glucose concentrations at this level Are energy swings that are unrelated to carbohydrate ingestion at all. Alright. So one test you can either run-in addition to that, if you're gonna get blood glucose measured, you can look at some markers we talked about earlier, Richard, AST and ALT. We talked about, how you can kinda look at that, AST to ALT ratio before, you can actually do the inverse, which is look at ALT and AST. The the kind of normative value there you're gonna look at is like 0.8.[1:25:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually like to see it lower than that. And that alone is is been actually associated with blood glucose dysregulation. And so If you see multiple of the science again, we're looking for patterns and patterns and patterns in both, in our case, biomarkers, Symptomology and performance. And now you're if if all 3 of those things are lining up, you you may have an issue. So performance wise, A couple of little tests you can run.[1:25:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Ideally, you have some sort of standard workout you do. Oh, and hopefully, it's it's pretty objective. So in other words, like, I run the same 15 minute loop every morning for my cardio. Oh, okay. Great.[1:25:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: How long does it take you to run that loop? Like, You could pick whatever distance. It doesn't really matter. What's your heart rate during that thing, and then what's your perceived exertion? Now you should be able to do that fasted with very little drop in performance.[1:26:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you can do that, then that tells me you're fairly good at using, fat as a fuel source. If, however, the one day you go to do your standard workout and you feel awful Fasting, that may be another clue that perhaps you're not very good at dialing in, that system. If your recovery afterwards, in terms of heart rate recovery, it's very long. It may be another clue that you have a poor utilization of fat as a fuel source. The inverse can also be true.[1:26:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if I give you something in the neighborhood of, like, 50 or so grams of carbohydrate, And 30 minutes later, your face is falling off the table. That's a good sign that you're in the opposite. You're actually very, very, very poor utilizing carbohydrate as Fuel. And the reason I bring that up is, that is equally a problem. We send we we hear people a lot make comments, like, man, I have to stay away from carbs.[1:26:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: I Crash really hard if I do them. That has a what that actually means is you're very poor at utilizing carbohydrates as fuel. You're getting a your your, your sensitivity is way off. We should be able to have carbohydrate at a reasonable dosage, 50 grams, And not fall asleep 30 minutes later or or have to run to caffeine. So, that is a sign in our opinion.[1:27:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is, Again, now just my practical brain telling you is, that's a sign of of dysfunction. We we should be able to have Plenty of carbohydrates through the day if we choose to, if we want to for any reason. Now, of course, if you were to throw a 150 or 200 grams of carbohydrate in your belly, you You you're probably gonna take a little bit of an energy hit after that, but we should be able to have a reasonable dosage and not, you know, have to fall asleep afterwards.[1:27:48] Andrew Huberman: What is one way that people can enhance their utilization of carbohydrates, for exercise? The reason I ask is I think I fall into Category.[1:27:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:27:59] Andrew Huberman: I do consume some complex carbohydrates and fruit post resistance training.[1:28:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm. And that[1:28:06] Andrew Huberman: tends to be when I'm hungriest for them. But, typically, unless I'm I've just done some resistance training, I keep most of my daytime meals relatively low carbohydrate. And then in the evening, I prefer slightly less protein and more carbohydrate Because it has this effect of, sedating me a little bit[1:28:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[1:28:25] Andrew Huberman: And I sleep well. And I know this runs against what everyone was taught, which is to not eat carbohydrates late in the day. No. No. No.[1:28:32] Andrew Huberman: But I like it because then I tend to wake up in the morning with, at least as far as I can tell, my glycogen stores Not necessarily topped off, but but certainly filled. Yep. And I'm able to train fasted in the morning, and my favorite pre workout is, consists of water and caffeine and electrolytes and maybe some supplementation as well, but, I love training fasted.[1:28:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: So there's actually a number of things. One little sneaky thing you threw in there is actually the use of caffeine. So that's another sign. If if you have to have caffeine to do your fasted training, that's generally another sign you're not very good at using fuel.[1:29:07] Andrew Huberman: So I use caffeine prior to resistance training workouts. Yep. Generally, I don't need it for any kind of cardiovascular training.[1:29:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. And and when I say that, it doesn't mean it's bad. It's just like another clue that's like, okay, you should be able to do this Without having to have caffeine to execute it. Now using caffeine to get a better result is is sort of different as an decade. We actually use, a lot of high carbohydrate meals at the end of the day.[1:29:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: A lot of the times for our athletes who are cutting weight Or trying to reduce waste. So it is a fantastic way, to handle a lot of things. And that idea that if you eat carbs late at night, that'll increase fast. So, like, that all is So old and so well destroyed scientifically that that that's not a concern. There's just so much data showing.[1:29:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, that there's so much data on, Like, eating timing is is, generally poorly understood about when you can eat and what you can eat. Eating in the morning, versus eating at night, like, a a lot of what we've heard in there is stopping. Maybe we just save that for sort of another day because we're gonna get really far down. That's what we can[1:30:14] Andrew Huberman: talk about.[1:30:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: But, Yes.[1:30:15] Andrew Huberman: I think our plan is to cover that in an episode on nutrition[1:30:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great.[1:30:19] Andrew Huberman: Which is in this series. The, the only thing that I would add to it is, you know, when you hear about ingesting carbohydrate late at night, I should just say that, at least in my case, I'm eating A majority of my carbohydrate, unless I trained Yep. Resistance trained early in the day, in which case I I post resistance training, in the last meal of the day, but for me, that's not really late at night. That last meal is somewhere between 6:30 and 7:30 PM.[1:30:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's 3 or so hours or something like that before the[1:30:48] Andrew Huberman: sleep around 10:10:30 or so.[1:30:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Yeah.[1:30:50] Andrew Huberman: So it's not, you know, midnight, bowls of pasta. I've I've done that too. But, but, typically, it's not. So I think that, people will be very interested, myself included, in How meal timing relates to all of this, but, yeah, let's[1:31:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So how do you improve fat utilization? How do you improve carbohydrate utilization? Let's let's hammer both out really quickly. Enhancing fat, utilization is as simple as doing a little bit of work in a Either pre fan ingested state. So anytime you ingest a nutrient prior to training, you're going to bias towards that nutrient.[1:31:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. Which is almost what we were talking about earlier. So if you wanna guarantee you burn more fat, eat more fat prior to workout. Now you're not going to lose fat. But what you're what you're effectively signaling is we have an overabundance of this fuel, preferentially target this full fuel.[1:31:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now the downside is that may actually hinder your performance. That's typically only a concern for people at a very high level. So if you're relying more upon that, your top end is going to come down a little bit. And so you wouldn't wanna use that strategy prior to race If it is a carbohydrate dependent race. Alright.[1:32:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, we actually see long term adaptations that would suggest, so the enzymes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism will down regulate. And so you get worse at that. So not not a great strategy there. Carbohydrate be the opposite. Right?[1:32:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you have carbohydrate prior to exercise, you're gonna bias more towards So a handful of things you can do. If your total caloric intake is, simply Managed, that's gonna take care a lot of these problems. An appropriate eating strategy, so the types of food, the combinations of food, All those things are going to make your post carbohydrate ingestion bunk. A lot of those things can go away. So there's a little bit of physiology that has to be, corrected for.[1:32:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: So it's a little bit in one hand, you can go very deep here. Right? So The real answer of how we would do this is if we see a scenario like that, we're gonna do a whole set of analyses. We're gonna go full labs. Right?[1:33:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: Probably extensive Blood panel, urine, saliva, stool even, and we're going to figure out where is that glucose dysregulation coming from. So a lot of people think like, oh, it's a metabolism issue. It might be. And also might just be a flag that something else is happening in the body. So we're gonna actually work backwards a lot to try to figure out exactly Why that's occurring?[1:33:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: It may be as simple as, oh, you're eating a lot of your carbohydrates without any fiber or protein. And we know that that's important because those will actually blunt the gloop the glycemic index, like, the rise in blood glucose. So it could be a simple thing of just like, oh, your combination of food is doing it. It's not the total amount. It may be something again more endogenous to the actual system.[1:33:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: It it could be, a heart rate issue. It it could be a breathing issue. It could be a number of things. So the way to get better at it is to simply train it, and Specificity is king here. So if you wanna get better at, managing your blood glucose throughout the day So you're not feeling those things.[1:34:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It could be a field issue, but it could be a number of other things. And it's just hard to go into all of them with within our time constraint. So the practical tool that I would say here is if you wanna get better at managing energy throughout the day, make sure that, Number 1, your protein is stabilized. Making sure number 2, you're ingesting your food in the right combinations ideally with some fiber And or some protein or both. That alone will help stabilize a lot of the problems.[1:34:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then you need to train at a high intensity. You wanna get better at using Carbohydrates are the fuel. Train at a higher intensity and have carbohydrates right before the workout. We'll do that a lot if, if our if if we see folks who are I I kinda walk you through the test of identifying if you're not very good at using fat as a fuel. The test for Not being good at using carbohydrate as a fuel is both that eating, that is, I talked about, as well as performance.[1:34:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're a very, very, very slow starter, it's just like really hard to Going, that generally indicates you might be in a situation where you're not very good at using carbohydrates as fuel. So we're going to practice that. We're going to have a pre carbohydrate pre exercise carbohydrate meal. Then we're gonna do higher intensity stuff. Not the point of making you sick and digestive issues, all that stuff, but we wanna get better Using carbohydrates as a fuel faster.[1:35:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you wanna get better at doing the opposite, then you do that opposite strategy. Either, again, using the fat prior to the workout knowing Your peak performance is gonna go down a little bit, but you're you're investing in adaptation. Right? So it's not about that workout. It's about what's gonna happen 6, 8, 10 weeks from now.[1:35:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Investment is what you wanna think about it, or you could bring in some fasted training. And so I wanna really make sure I clarify when we were talking about earlier, I'm not at all against fasted training. It's not it works. It just isn't required for fat loss. It isn't required For fat adaptation, it is a great option though if you want.[1:35:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: What I was hoping to do with that conversation, and maybe I didn't articulate that well, is To not restrict people, but is to open you up. And at least you have a lot of options. If you like to do fasted cardio, amazing. It is great. If you hate it, you don't have to.[1:36:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can reach the same performance goals, the same physique goals without ever doing it. If you love long duration steady state stuff, it is great. If you hate it, There are other options, higher intensity stuff. Again, if we're just talking about fat loss. So I hope now that that's a little clearer in terms of the The same thing with nutrition.[1:36:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you like higher carb, great. If you like lower these are all great. You have options, and you don't have to fret so much over, Oh my gosh. I have to do this thing a certain way, and I absolutely hate it. You don't have to worry about it.[1:36:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Hit those concepts, and you'll be fine.[1:36:42] Andrew Huberman: A few minutes ago, you mentioned that if we ingest a given macronutrient, like fat, then the body will preferentially use that fuel source. If you You ingest carbohydrate, we'll use that fuel source. Is it always the case that the body uses the ingested Macronutrient prior to using glycogen.[1:37:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: I have[1:37:03] Andrew Huberman: to imagine it's using both. I mean, if I were to have some carbohydrate Before, doing any kind of training, the muscles still burn glycogen. Right? Or do they have some way to register the amount of circulating carbohydrate that would allow or available carbohydrate in the form of foodstuffs[1:37:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: mhmm.[1:37:22] Andrew Huberman: That would allow them to not tap into their own muscle fiber stores with glycogen.[1:37:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. So the way we derive energy, for exercise or basic maintenance. A A little bit about cellular physiology. So you've got a couple of organelle and structures that we need to pay attention to. The first one is the nucleus.[1:37:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's whole gene DNA. The second one is the mitochondria. And then everything outside of that, you've got all these other organelle that do a bunch of things like ribosomes or protein synthesis, etcetera, etcetera. Alright. Now When you wanna produce energy for exercise, anytime you hear the word anaerobic, you automatically Understand we are meaning without oxygen.[1:38:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. Great. That all happens in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is that space That is not the mitochondria, not the nucleus. So it's the space in between everything else.[1:38:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is like jelly like substance that sounds there. So anaerobic metabolism happens there. Every single aerobic metabolic process happens in the mitochondria. Alright. Why is that important?[1:38:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: If I go to create cellular energy and I need it the fastest possible, I'm going to go for phosphocreatine Because it is stored directly in the cytoplasm, the stoichiometry is 1 to 1 there, which means for every mole of phosphocreatine I burn, I can create 1 ATP. It's 1 to 1. It is incredibly fast, but it is very limited because think about it. How much of that could I possibly store in the small size of the cell? That's it.[1:38:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: If I need energy past that point, now I'll start using muscle glycogen because that is also stored In the cytoplasm, so it is right there. The stoichiometry is not one to 1. It's a little bit higher, probably like 4 to 1. So for every molecule of Glyco Junior burn, you're going to get something like 4 ish, like some small number of ATP out of that, which is great. But again, you're running into a storage Problem.[1:39:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: How much can I possibly store inside a muscle cell? It is very, very fast, much more effective than phosphocreatine, but so there. If I then want to metabolize any form of fat or if I wanna complete the metabolization Of carbohydrates, I have to start transferring into the mitochondria. Now I start getting whole hosts of ATP, if you were to fully run Through this thing, which I'll talk about in a second, called the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle. You'll get now something like 28 or 30 or 35, kinda depending, ATP Per.[1:39:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the energetic output is much higher. K. So here's exactly what happens, and I'm gonna walk you through this in the Form of carbohydrate, and then I'll come backwards and go through, fat. So remember, carbohydrate, It is 1 carbon molecule that has been hydrated. So it is 1 to 1.[1:40:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the actual, chemistry here, it is c h two o. One carbon, 2 h one o. Glucose is a 6 carbon chain. So the chemistry here is c 6 H12 O6. Six carbons, 6 waters.[1:40:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Very simple. That's a carbohydrate. Alright. So you can imagine if you're watching on the video here, you'll you'll see my fingers going out. So I'll try to make sure I explain it to you all just listening in an easy fashion.[1:40:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: So You've got this chain of 6 carbons as in front of you. And the very first step to metabolism is you snap that thing in half. Right? So you break into 2 separate 3 carbon chains. Alright.[1:40:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now in doing that, you got a little bit of energy because you broke that 1 bond, but not a tremendous amount. This is called glycolysis. So lysis being the split, you know, glyc being glyc, you split glycogen up. Got a little bit of energy of that. Alright.[1:41:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: You formed this 3 carb carbon chain called pyruvate or pyruvic acid. Okay? There's differences there, but don't don't kill me. General audience, friends. Alright?[1:41:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: I gotta I gotta give this communicate this to everybody. So you got a little bit of that. Now you can't do much past that besides rip one more Carbon off of each of those 3 carbon chains. So I've got 2, 3 carbon chains. I'd be careful how I do this with my fingers, so I don't flip you off here in a second.[1:41:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: But I burn 1 more off of each. I get a little bit of energy, and now that little 2 carbon chain I have 2 2 carbon chains. Those are called Acetyl CoA. Alright. Amazing.[1:41:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: I have now completed anaerobic glycolysis. I've got really nothing left I can do here. I made a little bit of ATP. Now wait a minute. I have now freed 2 carbons.[1:41:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because remember I started with 6, I split apart, but I didn't I had 2, 3 carbon chains. I burned 1 each. I've got 2 free floating carbons. I have to now do something with them. My body will not let me go through that part that last process unless I've got a plan for that free carbon because I can't break it in half.[1:42:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm. Amazing. Here's what's going to happen. If I have those 3 carbon molecules and I don't have anywhere I can put that carbon, You're not going to go through that process. It's going to stop it.[1:42:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna start building up pyruvate. Now at the same time, you're breaking ATP for fuel. That's called ATP hydrolysis. Right? You have water that comes in.[1:42:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: You You have adenosine and 3 phosphates, that's why it's called ATP, adenosine triphosphate 1, 2, 3. You break one of those phosphates off. There you go. There's your energy. So now you have a free for floating inorganic phosphate and an adenosine diphosphate, so 2 over there.[1:42:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Amazing. That Actually results because you use water for it, results in a free floating hydrogen ion. K. Just have to trust me. Hydrogen h two o.[1:43:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Any idea what a free floating hydrogen is?[1:43:08] Andrew Huberman: It's gonna[1:43:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's acid.[1:43:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It says I was gonna say it's gonna increase acidity. That's what it says. For anyone that's ever measured pH, what you're really measuring is the the the amount of hydrogen.[1:43:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Potential hydrogen. That's what pH is. Right? 100%. There's 2 definitions of pH, but you get it.[1:43:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's one of the 2.[1:43:23] Andrew Huberman: So is this, are you gonna tell me this is related to the the the burn?[1:43:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're gonna get close. Right. So I've got a bunch of free floating. You got the phosphates, which are actually problem too, probably more of a problem than people realize, And that hydrogen. What are you going to do with that hydrogen?[1:43:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, one thing you can do is actually ship it over to pyruvate and bond it there. We have a special name for that little molecule when you have pyruvate and you have a hydrogen attached to it. Do you know what it's called?[1:43:53] Andrew Huberman: Hydrogen peroxide?[1:43:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Lactate. Lactite, lactic acid, this is that whole system. Right? Again, I'm skipping some steps, making a little bit of mistakes here, intentionally folks, just to make this assume. So what happens when you start running a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis?[1:44:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: You start seeing massive rises in lactate. Cool.[1:44:13] Andrew Huberman: Not lactic acid. Right. Right?[1:44:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's why we see associations between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue. But the lactate's actually not causing the fatigue. The lactate is actually sparing you from having a bunch of free floating Mhmm. Acid. It also Can be then used directly back in the muscle because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen and you can take that hydrogen back off of it, you've now turned it right back into Hey, Ruvent.[1:44:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can run it through this whole cycle as fuel that I'm about to do. You can actually actually ship it out of the exercising muscle and ship it into a non exercising muscle, And then go backwards and make glucose.[1:44:51] Andrew Huberman: What actually liberates hydrogen from from lactate? Like, chemically? Yeah. So what what liberates, what well, what are the stimuli that can take hydrogen off the pyruvate?[1:45:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Oh, yeah.[1:45:03] Andrew Huberman: And and then, in other words, to reduce lactate and Free up that hydrogen.[1:45:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Oxygen availability. So in fact, one of the major places that you ship hydrogen to or one of the major places that you ship lactate to is your heart. Because this is what we call, like, the ultimate slow twitch fiber, and it is has a ton of freely available mitochondria, which have a ton of access To oxygen, so it can actually then go to it, form water. The h g o can be used to form water, and now we have a place to store the hydrogen. Got it.[1:45:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. Cool. So as a result of anaerobic glycolysis, we have made a little bit of ATP. We've created a lot of waste, and we don't have anywhere to to go with these end products. So When you do anything of a higher intensity and it says, I need energy fast, you're gonna go to this system first.[1:45:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Right past ATP Because it is the fastest place to get energy, but you're not gonna get much of it and you gotta deal with the waste products. Boom. Right back to the beginning of our conversation, Endurance is about 2 things, energy production and waste management. And we're right we're fatigue buffering.[1:46:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is it. Right? How well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen, right, drop in pH? And how and then what are you gonna do with these products? If you want to Fully metabolize a carbohydrate.[1:46:23] Dr. Andy Galpin: You then have to take some do something with those pyruvates or those Acetyl CoAs. What you're going to do if oxygen is available, You will take those things and ship them into the mitochondria. They have to go through some cell walls and some other things like that, but they're going to get inside there. Once they're in there, that 2 carbon acetyl CoA runs through this entire cycle that we call the Krebs cycle. That's this really interesting place.[1:46:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's where, b six and, NMN, people are like, that's where that whole stuff starts to kick in. All your b vitamins basically run that entire circle, and you're gonna start off the top. You have a bunch of fun stuff going on. But as a part of that circle, you're gonna pull off some some of the hydrogen ions, you're gonna send these to what's called the electron transport chain. That's where you're gonna get a ton of ATP out of.[1:47:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: And as a result, about halfway through the turn, you're gonna pull off 1 carbon. And about halfway through the other almost the other way to the finish, you're gonna pull off the 2nd carbon. So you're gonna take the 2nd Acetyl CoA, Run that entire thing same through as well. And so what we did is we started off with a 6 carbon glucose chain. We split it in half.[1:47:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: We call those pyruvate. Made a little bit of energy because we broke that 1 bond of those 2 carbons that are in the middle. Cool. Those 2 3 carbon molecules, we pulled 1 carbon off of each. We brought In we sorry.[1:47:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: We moved those into the mitochondria. We brought 1 off. We took a breath, brought in some oxygen, bonded that. Brett took out 2 c l two exhales. We ran the Acetyl CoA through the Krebs cycle.[1:47:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: 1, 2 carbons per turn coming out of c o two. So we had 6 carbons total when we started and we exited with 0 carbons. Now we have fully metabolized a molecule of carbohydrate. That required an anaerobic start and an aerobic finish. If you don't have a lot of mitochondria, Large mitochondria, high functioning mitochondria, you're going to limit your anaerobic performance because you're going to get they're gonna run that door full very, very quickly.[1:48:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can't go past it because hydrogen will build up way too fast, and one of the things that we know is both temperature and pH Run enzyme function. So they're going to stop. You won't even be able to run through, in fact, that ATP hydrolysis phase. Even if I gave you a whole infinite supply of ATP, if I put enough acid in there, it would stop working because the ATPase enzyme needed to split, it won't be able to run In a highly acidic environment or a hot environment.[1:48:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. At some point, perhaps today, perhaps in the future discussion, but still not too far from now. We could talk about the role of temperature, in the Oh, yeah. In pyruvate from in terms of its regulation of muscle contraction. But I wanna make sure I understood something Correctly, you mentioned these these, 2 parallel fuel systems.[1:49:07] Andrew Huberman: Right? 1 is essentially anaerobic. Right? And the other is aerobic. You said that if we can't pull enough, If we can't break enough bonds, then we limit our anaerobic capacity.[1:49:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[1:49:23] Andrew Huberman: I would have thought given that, The mitochondria are the site for, essentially, for aerobic metabolism Yeah. That we would be limiting our aerobic capacity as well. Perhaps you could just clarify for me Yeah. How these 2 things are divided, or is there not a clean division? Is it not an either way?[1:49:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: No. In fact, again, I I think it's better to think of these things rather as Two separate parallel things as one big cycle. They're 1 gear turning the next. Being compromised in 1 will compromise the other.[1:49:52] Andrew Huberman: That, I should say reminds me of what you said earlier, which is this the bicycle gear Yes. Analogy. That works, great. So if you if you short circuit 1, basically, The the chain can't move. That's Yeah.[1:50:04] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. Okay. So, so indeed, they they are running in parallel, but they are, interdependent.[1:50:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Well, they're actually not even running in parallel because they're actually formulating to the same endpoint. Right? Which is like, if if you're going to come from the anaerobic glycolysis Drought or you're gonna come from the fat route, which I'll talk about in a second. They're both going to be limited in the mitochondria.[1:50:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: So when that thing's full, it doesn't matter. You can't run either system. Right. So it is more of like a again, if you're running the bike gears, it doesn't really matter if the back one's larger or smaller. Because if either one is limited, you're because they're running on the same system.[1:50:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can you can you can sneak a little bit here and there, but but not much.[1:50:45] Andrew Huberman: You also really nicely highlighted how Lactate, this thing that we think of as a a limiting factor. It's like the burn. It gets in the way, and it's the thing we need to Stop and buffer and all all sorts of things. Sure. It's actually really a fuel.[1:51:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a it's a tremendously effective fuel. Is a is a strongly preferred fuel, actually. The this is interesting. This is a very classic case of association, correlation versus causation. Right.[1:51:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the the original actually like, there's a really cool history on lactate, but it was originally found, I think in Germany. Pardon my history There, some somewhere in Europe and hunted stags. So one of the things is they sort of realize is like if we if we if we harvested a stag in In a rest of state when it didn't know we were there versus if we chased it and it was ran down, that these lactate concentrations were significantly higher in in the latter situation. Therefore, lactate started immediately getting this association between high fatigue points, and it is easy to measure. If you're to do any sort of lactate test, Any sort of metabolic test you will see as fatigue increases, lactate will also increase.[1:51:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: The assumption there was then, oh my gosh, It's the cause. Now we know, like, again, it's not the thing. It it's in large part trying to buffer The negative consequences of ATP hydrolysis and and some other things. So it is certainly playing a part in that role, but it is not the core driver. It's also why you don't need to worry about doing things to quote unquote, Reduce lactate in the muscle after exercise or to clear lactate or any of those things.[1:52:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: You may still wanna do those activities, but not for that reason. Lactate's fine. You're actually gonna use it in, again, the neighboring exercise, muscle fibers in the same muscle. Another muscle, So you can send it actually to the, to the liver, and it can actually go through gluconeogenesis, and it can actually replenish liver glycogen. Just does that feel source or you can send it harder, any number of sources.[1:52:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can also just go to put it in circulation, put it back in the muscle, and once enough oxygen is there, You can just kick it right back into either glucose or glycogen. It's totally fine. So it is obviously clear though, Once that number gets very, very high, other things are going to be happening that are be causing a lot of hurt. And this is your managing waste. Right.[1:53:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's really an issue of managing, what am I gonna do with all this extra carbon? What am I gonna do with all this extra inorganic phosphate and and some other nasty byproducts? But that's the thing you have to deal with.[1:53:14] Andrew Huberman: I'd love for you to teach me how different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising. For example, if I do a very short bout of exercise Yep. Typically, that's correlated with a higher intensity output. I mean, I suppose I could jog for 1 minute, but here I'm thinking about sprinting for 1 minute or less. Which fuels are used?[1:53:38] Andrew Huberman: Is that mainly driven by fat stores, by carbohydrate stores? Is it driven by dietary fat, preferentially, or carbohydrate[1:53:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[1:53:47] Andrew Huberman: That I've ingested if indeed I've ingested those, or protein for that matter. And then as we transition to exercise that goes a little bit longer, You know, anywhere from, you know, 3 to 5 minutes, how do those ratios change? And as we transition to longer duration, what What most people think of as endurance exercise, but long duration output of, you know, 20 minutes or more leading all the way up to a full marathon. How does that change the ratio of fuel sources that are used? And I'd be particularly interested in distinguishing between Carbohydrate, fat, and protein that's ingested, so coming from food sources, or carbohydrate, fat, and protein that are coming from Storage sites within the body.[1:54:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great. Let's start at 0 seconds and run all the way through marathon, and we'll we'll flag the distinctions where they start changing. As soon as you want us to create muscle contraction and power, the very first source of energy is phosphocreatine. That's gonna power you for 0 to maybe, Say 8 to 15 20 seconds of maximal exertion.[1:54:52] Andrew Huberman: And that's in coming from the muscle fibers themselves.[1:54:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. That is actually stored in the what's called the cytoplasm. So this is a little area space In the muscle fiber, that's sort of like in this jelly like substance. And it's nice because 1 molecule of phosphocreatine Creatine gives you 1 molecule of ATP. So it's not a big energy output, but it's very fast because it is stored right there in the local exercising muscle.[1:55:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right now, if you need energy past that point, say, you know, 10 or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes, This is now you're gonna have to transition because you're gonna burn through that phosphocreatine that's gonna be out. You're gonna have to move to now carbohydrate metabolism. This is what we call anaerobic glycolysis. So there's 2 phases of glycolysis. Now glycolysis itself means glucose burning.[1:55:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright? So this means we're using carbohydrate as a fuel source. So initially, when we start off this cascade, which is gonna take us again for a a couple of minutes, carbohydrate utilization comes 1st from the exercising muscle, so it's very similar to phosphocreatine that way. If you start running low on it, you can actually start pulling blood glucose. And if blood glucose gets low, you'll have to start getting glycogen from the liver to keep that up, and we've sort of covered that conversation.[1:56:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Alright. So a little bit of chemistry here. Just give me a little bit of of room here. So now remember a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that has been hydrated. So 1 carbon attached to 1 water.[1:56:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: And remember, water is h two o. Most of the time when we're talking about glucose, it is in a 6 carbon chain. So 6 carbons attached to 6 water molecules. Alright. Great.[1:56:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: When I go to split this up through anaerobic glycolysis, it works a little bit like this. So you got this six Carbon chain. The first step is to snap that thing in half. You're gonna make 2, 3 carbon chains. Now we broke 1 bond on right there.[1:56:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we got a little bit of energy, but not a tremendous amount. At the end of anaerobic glycolysis, you're gonna net something like 3 or 4 ATP.[1:56:51] Andrew Huberman: So more than you get from the fossil creatures Triples[1:56:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: or quadruple. Yeah. But still not very much. There's another major downside that's coming in a second to this system. The upside is it's fast.[1:57:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now, one actually, one adaptation we get to training in this style is you'll increase your ability to store Glycogen in your muscle, which is great. Right? We can actually biopsy you and measure the amount that you store, and a training adaptation is awesome. So you're able to Sustain the system longer. So perhaps 90 seconds into your interval training, you hit a fatigue point, and now you maybe you can extend that to a 100 or 115 seconds simply because you're storing more glycogen in the muscle before we have to and then go into the blood and get it, in the form of glucose.[1:57:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that's great. So we've got this 6 carbon molecule, and we split this in half. We got that little bit of ATP. And now we're in this little tricky position Because this 3 carbon molecule is what we call pyruvate, pyruvic acid. And again, chemistry folks, I'm skipping some steps.[1:57:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'm gonna intentionally make some mistakes here. Making sure the entire world listening, regardless of where they come in, can can follow me here. Okay? So don't burn me on the details. Right.[1:58:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: You've got this pyruvate. The problem is you can no longer do anything with that. Glycolysis is over. You've gotta make a choice. Right?[1:58:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: In order to make something out of those 3 carbon molecules, you've got to ship them to the mitochondria. As you said, that is the only place of aerobic metabolism. Right. We cannot do aerobic metabolism anywhere else until we enter the mitochondria. So anytime we cross that barrier, we know we've automatically switched from anaerobic to aerobic.[1:58:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, here's the problem. If you were to take 1 more carbon off that 3 carbon pyruvate, you have to now do something with that carbon waste. K. So before when we split the 6 carbon chain, we didn't actually leave any carbons free floating. We just split a 2 molecule in half.[1:58:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: When we go to split from pyruvate and make it into this 2 carbon molecule called Acetyl CoA or Acetyl CoA, now we've got a free floating carbon. We have to have a strategy for that because that's going to increase acidity level. Any enzyme in our body that works to create fuel is very pH sensitive. Alright. So if this thing if pH gets off either high or low, these enzymes can't work.[1:59:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: And that's really, really important because even if I were to give you a direct injection of ATP, Remember, that's that energy currency. That's the only way we can actually form energy. And I guess, remember to clarify, anytime we're using Phosphacretine or glucose or fat, which we'll get to a second, we're not actually getting energy for exercise by breaking those down. We're getting energy that we can use to then make ATP. We break that ATP down.[1:59:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's what's actually powering muscle contraction. You can go back to our previous So we'll walk you through the detail of the muscle contraction, but that's what we're after. Okay? So in the case of pyruvate, If we split that off, we have got to deal with that. And the only way and the best way we can deal with that is oxygen.[1:59:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: Remember, we're gonna breathe in o two. That o two is gonna combine with that free floating carbon, make c o two. We're gonna exhale that thing out. That's our waste management strategy. But That has to happen in the mitochondria.[2:00:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Remember, if we're using oxygen, it has to be in the mitochondria. So if we have the ability To ship pyruvate into the mitochondria, we're golden. But what happens if we don't? Why do we not? Well, if we don't have enough mitochondria or our mitochondria are too small or they're too far away or We don't have sufficient oxygen availability.[2:00:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why don't we have sufficient oxygen availability? Because we created the pyruvate too fast. And the demand in the mitochondria is exceeded by the buildup of pyruvate. And so now we're having this giant backlog, and this thing fills up fast. We have a couple of strategies here.[2:00:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, when you're going through ATP and you're splitting, it's called ATP hydrolysis. In Oh, I'm doing that. Remember, ATP is adenosine molecule, and then the t part is triphosphate, 123, which means you have 3 phosphates attached At the end, when you break that phosphate off, that's where you get your energy. So now you have an inorganic phosphate and an ADP, Adenosine Diphosphate 2. That process requires water.[2:01:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's called hydrolysis. As a result of that, you then have a free floating hydrogen. And as you well know, that is acid. Right? That's potential hydrogen.[2:01:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's what that means. And so you've increased the acidity in the muscle by breaking up all this ATP. And so, uh-oh, we're we're building up acid. We are building up pyruvate. We don't have nowhere to go with it, And we can't cleave off a carbon because now we're just gonna exacerbate the acid increase.[2:01:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So what we can do is we can take those hydrogens that we're building up and store them on the pyruvate. A pyruvate that's holding an extra acid has a special name, and we call that lactate. Alright. So that's why we see this buildup of lactate. So one of the downsides of anaerobic glycolysis is an incredibly high rate of waste Production.[2:02:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now lactate is not the cause of fatigue. In fact, if you think a little bit more carefully about what I just said, it's actually Stopping you. It's what we call a acid buffer. You can actually use it for a bunch of other things. You can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber in the same muscle that's not working.[2:02:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: You You can ship it to the liver. You can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places, and then you can actually just work backwards. So if you ship it to, for example, the heart, and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free, You can bring in the oxygen, attach it to that hydrogen, make water, and now you're right back to pyruvate. You put 2 pyruvate back together, and now you just make glucose. So you can actually store it in the liver.[2:02:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is a process called gluconeogenesis, to this fancy thing called the Cori cycle, which is what the The the the proper cycle here is so you can use it as a very potent fuel source. In fact, a lactate is a tremendously valuable fuel source, I'm not only for exercise, but for cognition and and a bunch of other things. So lactate in fact, this is why, if you've seen the research about pre, exam testing exercise, you'll see a noticeable increase in exam scores if you do a 20 minute amount of exercise prior To take the exam, it's largely in part probably because of things like elevations and lactate.[2:03:16] Andrew Huberman: How intense Of exercise, would be most beneficial?[2:03:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: I don't know that exact answer. I just know that, generally, any form of exercise is good. But if you were to reach a a reasonably high heart rate, you're probably gonna see in fact, there's an acute and chronic adaptation here. So folks at exercise have better memory Memory retention scores and exams, etcetera, but then also doing it prior to that exam. Make sure you recovered and rested back down a strip, but you'll generally perform better.[2:03:43] Andrew Huberman: Previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast who's the who's a psychology professor and neuroscientist and also dean of College of Arts and Sciences at New York University, NYU. Wendy Suzuki is, religious about daily morning exercise. Yeah. Specifically for this purpose of enhancing learning and memory and has a lot of really beautiful data I consider one of the real pioneers in this space. So if people wanna learn more, they can look to that episode or Wendy's work.[2:04:12] Andrew Huberman: We can provide a link to a couple of the papers. But This is fantastic and that it's incredibly clear. I think for the first time, I'm understanding what what lactate is really doing. Yeah. And it's dispelling a lot of myths that I think, I and a lot of other people, arrived to the discussion about lactate with.[2:04:33] Andrew Huberman: What happens when The bout of exercise extends longer.[2:04:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Amazing. So if we wanna continue past that point, We have to have some sort of strategy to get through it. Right? We're stuck. We're we're out of gas.[2:04:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: We have to then ship it to the mitochondria. And now we're gonna enter what's called aerobic GlycolFest. And this is gonna take us anywhere from, again, say that 90 seconds of all out work up to really 20, 30 minutes. In fact, it really will take us to Unlimited. If you look at a highly competitive marathon runner, even those that are running, say, your 2 hour marathon, those folks are burning up to 80% carbohydrate.[2:05:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: It it is a it it it is not a fat burning thing, and the reason is fat metabolism is way too slow. It provides a lot of energy, but it is incredibly slow. If you're trying to run a 4 and a half or so minute mile repeated 26 times, you have to be moving fast.[2:05:27] Andrew Huberman: Are they ingesting carbohydrate as a fuel source during the race.[2:05:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Unless you're on the team you don't know, they won't really tell you these are sort of trade secrets. It would be, I would say, fairly rare to not have something. Right? There's a bunch of different strategies. If you're gonna go really long, Like some of these, like cycling, where the races will be several hours, then you actually might go to some fat As fuel sources, I I know a lot of cyclists are using ketones and things like that now.[2:05:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: But traditionally, most endurance folks are gonna buy us heavily towards carbohydrate. Now in one respect, you're not going to run out of carbohydrates until you're many hours in. These folks are are unique case, but the average individual who who's doing an hour, hour and a half cardio even, you're not going to be limited by your carbohydrate stores. You're gonna be just fine. You're gonna be limited by some other things, which will maybe sort of break down here in a second, but you're gonna be fine there.[2:06:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: A lot of those folks will take Carbohydrate though at very specific intervals. You wanna you do wanna be careful though of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates Prior to your exercise spell, we have actually have this little thing that's called the insulin glucose double whammy. And what that means is when you ingest carbohydrates, immediately your blood glucose goes up, and that's depending on the type of carbohydrate and things Like that. Well, the same thing happens with exercise. And so what happens is insulin wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood.[2:06:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: At the same time, muscle wants to start pulling glucose out of Blood. And so we have this giant bolus of carbohydrate come in, and then all of a sudden, our blood sugar crashes. And so if If you're going to be doing so your your first half marathon or something like that, and you're in those giant corrals where there's, like, you know, 100 people waiting to go and you're standing there for 45 minutes, You may or may not wanna slug down, like, 3 or 4 bananas and a bagel and and and honey and thing like, you probably don't need that. Now not everyone experiences this double whammy, but it has been shown in the literature to happen to some people. So you wanna just be a little bit careful.[2:07:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: An easy way to combat that is just practice exactly what you're going to do in your race and your training. That's, like, the simplest advice ever, but you'd be stunned how many people Do things, during the race that they've actually never done in training.[2:07:45] Andrew Huberman: I suggest people do exactly what you describe also for any kind of cognitive testing. Of course. Before a big exam is not the time to discover whether or not you can handle twice as much espresso or take a nootropic for the 1st time or No. Or change anything. I mean, if if indeed the the score on that exam is is meaningful to you.[2:08:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Keep keep things regular.[2:08:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So to to recap what we've done here is we started off In the cytoplasm with this glucose molecule that has 6 carbons. We took that thing. We split it in half. We call that thing anaerobic glycolysis. We made a little bit of energy, But not much.[2:08:18] Dr. Andy Galpin: We take those 3 carbon molecules. We ship them into the mitochondria. We take each one of those. We clean off 1 carbon each. Those carbons, we take a breath in, we attach them to oxygen, we exhale them, get rid of that energy.[2:08:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: We are now fully into aerobic glycolysis. Each one of those 2 carbon molecules we run through the Krebs cycle, each round of the Krebs cycle burns 1, 2 carbons. So we go 1, 2, 12. And now we've gone from 6 carbon molecule all the way down to 0. We used the hydrogens that we pulled off of that Krebs cycle run to go to the electron transport chain.[2:08:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: From there, we made a whole bunch of ATP, and so we have now fully metabolized 1 molecule of carbohydrate, And the end product of all of it is simply ATP, water, and c o two. Beautiful.[2:09:05] Andrew Huberman: And leads me to the conclusion that most everything is really about utilization of carbons and exhaling c o two. Is that how I should think about bookending what you just described?[2:09:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is why we started off the conversation with the circle of life. This is really a carbon game. This is why we call, chemistry with carbon organic chemistry. Right? That's what this whole thing is about.[2:09:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Any living being has to run through metabolism. It's all a carbon game. Any living being has to use ATP. This is all just a big fancy game of how do I make ATP and handle the waste. Remember, Endurance is all about waste management, Fatigue resistance, the same thing, and energy production.[2:09:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: We're playing a game here. The whole game, Bring in energy. Use it. Mitigate waste products.[2:10:00] Andrew Huberman: So in thinking about aerobic exercise or long duration exercise, In this case, anything longer than 5 minutes for that matter, 5 minutes all the way up to Yeah. An ultramarathon. The breathing associated with endurance exercise, the heart beating, which, of course, is associated with the breathing and vice versa, It's really all about bringing oxygen into the system that then allows those carbons to be used and within the mitochondria specifically, and then carbon dioxide to be exhaled as we work through the carbons of the sort of, beads on a Drink. Is that right?[2:10:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Unless you're moving incredibly fast for a very long time, and we're talking probably north of 90 minutes, Endurance is really not a game of making sure I have enough fuel. It is simply managing the waste production. And that's exactly what you described. You need to bring in the oxygen so you can handle the carbon that's building up as a result of both the anaerobic anaerobic glycolysis. That's our game here.[2:11:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: If we start talking about endurance events longer than that, now we do have to start worrying about running out of muscle glycogen, Running out of liver glycogen, etcetera, or if we are at that 2 hour mark or so and we're moving very, very, very fast. But anything south of that is just managing carbon buildup, and we do that best through oxygen utilization or Getting more efficient and having a higher capacity for our anaerobic side. So we can do that by having either more glycogen in our muscle So that lasts longer or building better acid buffering systems. And there's a whole line of supplementation that are specifically acid buffers, There's a whole line of training. There's a whole line of breathing to manage this that.[2:11:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: So we have a lot of strategies where we can maximize endurance. All we have to do Let's go back to the earlier part of our talk, which is figure out what's the actual limiting step and then train according to that. Or do your strategy, your nutrition, your supplementation that defeats that limiting factor. For an example, If you're trying to maximize your performance in this 22nd maximal burst and your strategy for that was to make sure your muscle glycogen Saturated. It's probably not gonna help a ton because you're not going to be limited by total fuel.[2:12:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're going to be limited by your ability to buffer acid. However, storing more glycogen in your muscle in preparation for a marathon is a tremendously effective strategy, because that will become a limiting factor. So what we can do actually next if you'd like is we can just walk through these and look at the individual limitations where the failure point happens, And that, in fact, will outline your strategy for improving them.[2:12:49] Andrew Huberman: So you taught us about carbohydrate utilization as a fuel source. What about fat And what about protein? Great.[2:12:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: I'll start with protein because it's easy. It is generally, at best, going to represent 10% of your energy output. Now that will grow over time in terms of if you did a several hour out of exercise. When you started doing it, you might be using 5% of your energy from protein and then that micro to 10 or so. And that happens because you You start running low on muscle glycogen.[2:13:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: You start running low on liver glycogen. You start then having to pull in energy from another place. So, like, As those numbers go down, you'll see an increased uptick of energy from fat as well as protein. Having said that, It's not a tremendous fuel source. It is only aerobic, so it has to be oxidized.[2:13:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Those are the same thing. When I say oxidized, you use oxygen To burn something to to make a feel. So it's not a significant contributor to energy in that regard, and unless you're talking ultra marathons or longer, and it is also not something that can enhance performance. And so we don't really need to talk much more about it than that. In terms of fat as a fuel source, now here's the fundamental difference.[2:14:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: While carbohydrate starts anaerobically And finishes aerobically in the mitochondria. You're using mostly the carbohydrate in the exercising muscle tissue. Eventually, you can pull from Blood, and then you can pull from the liver. With fat, you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle, intramuscular triglycerides. But the overwhelming majority of fuel you get From fat comes systemically.[2:14:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so now we have a fundamental because we actually literally have a time problem. I can get energy from carbohydrates faster because it is directly there. If I go to pull it from fat, I've gotta pull it from the rest of the body, Which is why somebody who loses fat loses it from their entire body despite the fact that they may be only exercising A couple of parts. So think about a runner, someone who lost a lot of fat running. You don't see them just lose fat in their legs.[2:15:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It comes from their face, and their neck, and everywhere. Why? Because what you're going to do is pull fat from the entire system. You're going to break it down through a process called lipolysis, Which just means you break it down from the stored form. You put it in the blood as that glycerol backbone, which is that 3 carbon backbone In the individual fatty acids, it's gonna float through the blood.[2:15:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a 7 step system here, but we'll skip it for now. It's gonna have to get then uptake in end of the muscle. In the muscle then it has to get taken up and run into the mitochondria. Now that backbone, that 3 carbon glycerol backbone It's actually gonna function almost exactly like the 3 carbon pyruvate. Just get it in the mitochondria, clear off 1 carbon, run it as acetyl CoA, bada bing bada boom.[2:15:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Exact Same thing, super easy to metabolize, small enough to go through the mitochondrial membrane. The fatty acid chains become a problem. So if you have a chain that's longer, than our 8 or so carbons, it has to actually go through a special transporter on the cell wall to get in, And that's going to be limited by a thing called carnitine. And you're probably familiar with that as a supplement. You may have talked about it.[2:16:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a lot of places that make it. That's gonna be a limiting factor. If it is a smaller, what we call a short chain or even a medium chain triglyceride, which a lot of folks have heard of MCT, That's what we're talking about. That can actually go directly through because it's small enough to pass through, and you can use it immediately as an energy source. In either case, The way that you finally metabolize a fatty acid is a process where you would go through and cut off 2 carbons at a time.[2:16:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Why would you cut off 2? Because you're trying to make that 2 carbon acetyl co a, so you can run through that Krebs cycle again. Because you're cutting off 2 carbons at a time, We have a special name for that oxidation process. It's called beta oxidation. That's exactly why we call it beta oxidation.[2:16:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Two carbons in, you cut it off to make that Acetyl CoA. So you can notice the oxidation pathway, the electron transport pathway is identical, Whether you're talking about the carbohydrates or the fat, in fact, it doesn't even matter. More to our point, if we're talking about simply fat loss, It really just is about running that electron transport chain. Whether it came from a carbohydrate original source Ori fat original source, it ends up in the mitochondria as basically the exact same thing. It then ends The end of metabolism has the same thing.[2:17:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Remember, the final endpoint of carbohydrate metabolism is water, ATP, NCO 2. Do you wanna guess the final endpoint of fat metabolism? It's water, ATP, and CO 2. So practical applications here. If you want to maximize fat loss, what type of training is best?[2:17:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: It really doesn't matter. If you enjoy longer steady state stuff, fantastic. If you enjoy intervals, amazing. If you would like to do a combination, That's my personal preference. That's great too.[2:18:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: You have a ton of options. Pick what you think is a combination of challenging, Not all exercise should be easy, but you will actually enjoy somewhat or you're willing to accept. And anything that you absolutely hate, don't do it. Sometimes it's very, very, very difficult to do high intensity training. You have to really be interested in doing it.[2:18:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: If not, it ends up turning into, like, Moderate intensity training. You sorta just check the box, and it doesn't work that well if you're just checking the box. So if you're like, man, mentally, I don't have it in me today To get to a high heart rate and and throw up and all that stuff, cool. But you can just use some moderate steady state stuff, well, that's a win. Great.[2:18:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're like, oh my gosh. More than 10 straight minutes, and I'm so bored. And you're all maybe you're also like, I don't have 45 minutes. I gotta get this done in 8 minutes. Great.[2:18:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Go do some high intensity earballs. Either option will be equally effective.[2:18:58] Andrew Huberman: As you mentioned earlier, Exercise is useful for aesthetic changes, functionality, and for longevity. But when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss, I do have to ask this question. I often hear from people that they prefer one type of exercise Size versus another for sake of fat loss because certain forms of exercise make them very hungry. I'm wondering whether or not there's any relationship between the intensity or type of exercise and the, hunger stimulus. Now I don't have this problem because, basically, Everything makes me hungry.[2:19:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:19:36] Andrew Huberman: And yet I'm also okay fasting for part of the day. Yeah. I'm one of those pseudo intermittent fasters. Talk about what I mean by that. I just happen to eat between 11 AM and 8 PM naturally.[2:19:48] Andrew Huberman: I I'm not religious about it, but, but I don't do it for any other reason except that that tends to be when I'm hungry and exercise outside of that, in the morning, typically. In any case, is there a way that people can determine what type of exercise might be better or worse for them based on its appetite Stimulating or inhibiting effects because I also hear that, you know, some people will go for a long run, and then they are, quote, unquote, not hungry for several hours afterwards. Does that have anything to do with which fuels are being utilized during different forms of exercise?[2:20:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's actually a really good question. I don't know the The mechanisms that could explain that answer. What I can tell you is you hear the same comment for physical activity. In other words, people say, Man, if I do this type of training, then I just am exhausted, and I lay around the rest of the day. So my total caloric expenditure is actually compromised as an aggregate Because I'm down.[2:20:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: The data would suggest in general that doesn't happen. So most of the time, we don't see reduction in physical activity, with either high intensity or steady state training, in fact, you generally see, equal if not increased, what's called need. So it's the non exercising part of your day, in addition to the basal metabolic rate. So physical activity wise, you don't send to be a prop. Now, hunger is a little bit of a different thing.[2:21:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: The answer here is I don't think we have time to actually do justice on this, so perhaps best to to not get into this one.[2:21:13] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Why don't we punt this Down the road to our discussion about nutrition, specifically, and and we've backed it. So we'll earmark it for that. Meanwhile, it sounds like if One is thinking purely in terms of, burning calories[2:21:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[2:21:28] Andrew Huberman: And getting the health benefits of exercise to create a caloric deficit, To create fat loss, it doesn't matter whether or not they burn those calories using a form of exercise that relies predominantly on carbohydrate, fat, or protein. Correct?[2:21:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not that it doesn't matter. It's that either one will work. Because when we say things like that, it's it doesn't mean they're actually identical. There are some slight differences and maybe those differences are important for some people and not others. I ought to say is either one is a viable strategy.[2:21:57] Andrew Huberman: Great. What about protein as a fuel?[2:22:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: As an actual feel so here let me give you an analogy. Imagine that you are you were with me a few weeks ago in Southern Montana, and we're out, In the wilderness for a week. Okay? And it's cold out there, and you needed to make a fire. And if I said, look, you can pick any of these things.[2:22:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: There are some There's some wood over there. We brought some newspaper, and then we brought a match, and we need to create a fire. We're gonna use that fire to energy and heat up. Okay. I said great.[2:22:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: The very 1st place you would probably start to make that fire is the match. You light the match, and any match, hey, it's gonna light immediately, but it's probably gonna last 5 to 20 seconds, I don't know, before it burns out. That's phosphocreatine. Real fast. Real burns out.[2:22:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you were smart, you would take that match and then light the newspaper on fire. Right? Now if you were to burn a whole newspaper, it is more energy Then you get to the match, but you still you know, I don't know. What's it gonna take? A few minutes?[2:22:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Some number of minutes before an entire newspaper burns up? Yeah. 5. I don't know. Right?[2:23:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Depends on Yeah. Which type of newspaper it is, I guess. Right? Amazing. That's carbohydrate.[2:23:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? If you are really smart, you would use that So then light a piece of wood on fire. And a wood, if you've been in the wilderness, it could last hours, days. It's really quite unlimited. Your phosphocreatine storage Is very limited, small.[2:23:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Glycogen is a lot higher because you can store it in muscle, you can store it in other places. So you got more, but not a lot. Fat is unlimited. The average person, if you're around, let's say, 70 kilos, up 170 pounds or so, and you're moderately lean, maybe 15% body fat, nothing crazy. You probably have enough stored fat to create enough energy to to survive for more than 30 days.[2:23:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. This would literally be if you ingested 0 calories, you have enough fuel in your stored fat to keep you alive for certainly 30 days. You wouldn't feel good and all those things. But energetically, basically, fat will never ever be your limiting factor to performance. So when we start talking about what limits my performance in these areas, you can just wipe fat off the list.[2:24:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: It will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance. You simply have Way too much. The only problem with fat is it's just too slow. I've gotta mobilize it. I've gotta get in the blood, move it, that whole thing.[2:24:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Too slow. So if I wanna go faster, I will never be able to fully utilize fat, which is why we talked about earlier. You'll never see a situation in which somebody is a 100% burning fat as a fuel and no percent carbohydrate. It's always going to be too slow. Highest you'll get maybe 70 so%.[2:24:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Protein in this equation is none of that. Now you may notice How do you make paper?[2:24:50] Andrew Huberman: It's fibrous. You combine it with water that you it gets pressed. It gets compressed. Yep.[2:24:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. It's made from wood. How do you make a match? It's made from wood. What's carbohydrate?[2:25:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: A chain of carbon. What's fat? A chain of carbon. These are similar molecules. Right?[2:25:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're meant to give you pros and cons. It's very difficult to just light a log on fire without A lot of work you'd have to burn, burn, burn, burn, burn. So these are complementary systems that are really close to the same thing. Protein is none of those things. Protein is more like a piece of metal.[2:25:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're out in the woods with me and we were trying to make a fire and you're like, hey, look. I found some old, railroad over there. Let's throw that on there. I would probably look at you like you're ace now technically, can you melt metal? Sure.[2:25:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: But you're gonna burn a lot of energy to try to get a little bit back out of the middle, and now you've also cost yourself a very, very valuable structure. So protein is a fuel source for exercise or metabolism. It's just an incredibly poor choice. Your body will do it. Again, maybe 5 to 10%, But you now you're burning a very valuable supply in a situation in which you don't know where there's ever gonna be anymore.[2:26:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Remember, protein is fairly transient. If you're not very good at storing it, you can store a ton of carbohydrate and an unlimited, literally, amount of fat. So you just really need to disregard thinking about protein as a fuel source. Your body does not wanna do it. You are not good at it.[2:26:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can go through a process of gluconeogenesis from protein, make glucose from it. It's just very poor. You're not gonna get much Out of the exchange and you've burned your supply of metal, which is gonna be very difficult. High commodity in the woods or the wilderness to have something like metal.[2:26:39] Andrew Huberman: For people that consume very low carbohydrate or zero carbohydrate diets, are they pulling more energy from muscle, so which I imagine is a conversion of amino acids into ready carbon chains.[2:26:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. I mean, in this particular case, once you've reached, a certain level of adaptation. You've just gotten extremely good at generating glucose from other fashions. Right? So you can bias heavily Towards fat adaptation.[2:27:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: The downside is, and we've seen this born in literature, you're going to perform slower. So if If you don't care about maximizing performance, especially over something where it is a maximal effort for a few minutes or something, then maybe you're not concerned. And and that's absolutely great, especially for people just don't Then, hey, jeez. Very little concern here. But if you're interested in your performance and you're wondering why you're just, like, slugging it down, well, what you've done is you've down regulated the ability, Literally, the enzymes responsible for that entire anaerobic glycolysis portion, they get down regulated, which means there's not as much around anymore.[2:27:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so you get really bad and slow at using carbohydrates as a fuel source. So it's a very poor strategy for people on an anaerobic based sport or who like that type of And if you don't care, no problem. If you don't exercise at all, then you really have no problem there, which is actually why A high fat, low carbohydrate nutrition strategy for people who don't do much physical activity is probably, like, very well, it's very effective. It it is a really good strategy for weight management, for energy stabilization throughout the day, and the research would very much support that.[2:28:11] Andrew Huberman: In my observation, I would agree. I've tried low carbohydrate diets of severely limiting or completely eliminating carbohydrate. And After about 2 or 3 days, I feel pretty lousy, but mostly because I want to train very intensely Right. In the gym. In addition to doing longer runs, I tend to do all of those things across the week.[2:28:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:28:32] Andrew Huberman: But I've also observed and, in fact, know Several people that love the very low carbohydrate, a k keto ketogenic type diet. They're not doing ketogenic diets for mental health reasons per se. But indeed, those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of long endurance, but low intensity long endurance. These are the, I walk to get my exercise types, and they do indeed walk a lot. And some of them manage to, control their weight very readily and Like that diet for that reason.[2:29:04] Andrew Huberman: When we had Lane Norton on the podcast, he, pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight, you have to Trick something either[2:29:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Of course.[2:29:11] Andrew Huberman: Time or, macronutrients, etcetera, to arrive at that, sub caloric threshold. Get below the the sub maintenance threshold.[2:29:20] Dr. Andy Galpin: I guess one of the things I wanna point out is this should be received as, again, not a this is better or worse. This is just you now have a ton of options. So whatever personal preference, other factors, you get to craft this strategy of performance, aesthetics, And health based on your personal preferences.[2:29:40] Andrew Huberman: At this point, I'd like to go back to our classic list of 9 Adaptations that exercise can induce. The first 4, of course, being largely largely unrelated to today's conversation, but that were covered In the episode that we did on strength, speed, and hypertrophy. So just to remind people, the 9 adaptations Our number 1 skill and technique, 2, speed, 3, power, which is speed times force, 4, strength, and 5, hypertrophy. Today, we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance, followed by anaerobic capacity, followed by Maximal aerobic output and finishing at number 9 with long duration exercise. So If we could start with muscular endurance, this would be, number 6 on the list of 9 adaptations.[2:30:37] Andrew Huberman: Muscular endurance. How do I build muscular endurance? Why should I build muscular endurance? And just to remind me, what fuel sources are predominating when I'm training for muscular endurance. Great.[2:30:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: So remember, muscular endurance is something that's going to be generally in a local muscle. It is not a cardiovascular or systemic issue, and it tends to be something in the neighborhood of, say, 5 to maybe even up to 50 repetitions. So this is the classic example we give here is how many push ups can you do in a row? Most people are gonna land somewhere in that range I just said. How many sit ups can you do in a minute?[2:31:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: How many pull ups? How long can you hang on a bar, as a dead hang? Things like that. That's muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is not a mile run or a marathon or anything like that.[2:31:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, how long can I stand without breaking posture? This is muscular endurance.[2:31:32] Andrew Huberman: A plank? A wall sit?[2:31:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. Yes. Love all these things. Okay? Now the reason I took you on that big long metabolism journey is so I could help you understand exactly how to Train this factor or any of these factors with a more comprehensive understanding of what's happening.[2:31:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Meaning, thinking back to the metabolism, If I'm gonna ask my triceps to do 50 push ups in a row, what's going to be my limiting factor? Am I gonna run out of fat? No chance. Am I going to run out of glycogen? No chance.[2:32:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's way too Few of repetitions. You have a lot left there. So what's gonna be the thing that stops me from getting 51 repetitions? Either you're gonna have too high of a pH rise, so too much acid buildup, or you're gonna have a problem clearing the waste. So really, this is two factors, dealing with acid buildup and getting acid out of the muscle tissue and into circulation, because you have Plenty of ability to handle that small amount of acid buildup in your entire body.[2:32:41] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's just you can't handle it in that tiny spot. Now I picked the tricep for a very specific reason. You're gonna deal with more pain when you use a large muscle group like your quads or your glutes than you are with a small muscle group. For example, Nobody ever threw up after arm day, but a lot of people throw up after leg day. Why is that?[2:33:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: Look at the total amount of waste that you're dumping in your system when you have quadrupled or ten x the muscle size. Small muscle groups are only really going to be challenged in that local area. Large ones will dump so much waste into the system that you'll wanna avoid that as quickly as possible, and that's one of the reasons why you throw up after hard exercise. Great. So The reason[2:33:25] Andrew Huberman: I'm laughing because I don't think I've ever thrown up, from a weight training session, and so it's making me wonder if I've ever trained that hard. I've Received, or obtained the progress that I've wanted to do generally over time, not every week, every workout, every month. But certainly over The 30 plus years that I've been weight training, I've achieved the the results I've wanted. I have, however, vomited after a long run When I didn't hydrate well[2:33:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: what?[2:33:53] Andrew Huberman: Or if I drink too much water.[2:33:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. Oh, sure. Too much water. Yeah. You'll you'll get that out quick.[2:33:57] Andrew Huberman: Right. I just, wanna be clear because I think some people are getting the picture that if they're not vomiting at their head after their leg workout, that they're not training according to, your standards. And, again, by the way, doctor Andy Galpin runs experiments in his lab. He's recruiting subjects all the time.[2:34:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Also known as my graduate students.[2:34:15] Andrew Huberman: That's right.[2:34:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[2:34:15] Andrew Huberman: In any event, sorry to interrupt, but I felt it was a necessary interruption. So muscular endurance, there's plenty of fuel.[2:34:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Plenty of fuel. You manage acid buildup, and you also need to get that fuel out of you. That's gonna be a capitalization issue. So the way that we can think about this is capillaries surround your muscle, and the whole point of them is so that blood can come into them. They hit this capitalization That actually slows the diffusion rate of blood down, and so you can exchange nutrients in and get waste products out, And then we get things back in circulation.[2:34:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the more of those you have, the better you are at dispersing any of these waste product Build up whether it's c o two or the acid. So the adaptation you're looking for here is an increase in capitalization, potentially a slight increase in mitochondria, But the time is too fast. Right? So we're gonna be able to need to do these 50 repetitions in, say, under a minute or something like that. So getting the mobilization into the mitochondria, getting fuel that way, too slow.[2:35:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's not really gonna get our performance here. So what are strategies to increase ACID buffering ability and then capitalization. So on the capitalization side, you simply need to train At that ability. So you go close to failure and practice that often. That alone will increase increase blood flow to that local area, which will Kate, take you through your process of increasing capitalization.[2:35:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Easy peasy, specificity. Alright. So I have you there.[2:35:42] Andrew Huberman: Just to briefly interrupt, I find it remarkable, although not surprising given how amazing the human body is, that simply by Doing some movement repeat, like a wall sit or a, or push ups or dips for that matter repeatedly over and over and over until you reach that Failure point[2:36:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[2:36:03] Andrew Huberman: Or that quaking point in the case of a wall set, that provides a stimulus for more capillaries to be built into the system. Literally, the the production or the, the trafficking of endothelial cells which make up the capillaries and Exactly. Allow, basically, more little pipes to feed the system with oxygen and remove waste products.[2:36:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct? Irrigation. Right? Imagine you had a giant field, and you had field, and you had 2 big pipes running down the outside. Well, in fact, if you wanna make sure water gets evenly dispersed across the entire field, you'll have a bunch of offshooting little pipes.[2:36:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: And the more of those you have, the more coverage you get.[2:36:39] Andrew Huberman: Do we know what the the specific signal is that Says, hey. I failed at this. We need more capillaries.[2:36:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually don't know what that is. I could I would speculate it's a combination of, acidity as well as carbon dioxide and probably some nitric oxide stuff happening there, but I actually don't know.[2:36:58] Andrew Huberman: I'm guessing nobody knows for sure because we still don't know, for instance, what the exact signal is for hypertrophy. It's kind of an amazing situation. We know the requirements for getting the result we want Yeah. But we still don't know what the specific signal is. Yeah.[2:37:11] Andrew Huberman: In any event, what I'm hearing is building more capillaries is great for enhancing muscular endurance. And the way to get more capillaries into those muscles is to train for muscular endurance by getting Close to failure or to some point where you simply can't continue for whatever reason, could you give us an example of what a reasonable training protocol might be in terms of, the classic Galpin list now of exercise choice, maybe a few, options Mhmm. Order, Volume and frequency.[2:37:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. What[2:37:45] Andrew Huberman: should we be doing? How often should we be doing it? And, you know, for instance, should I do waltzes to failure then push ups to failure? Given that this is a local process, I'm guessing that if I do push ups to failure, I'm not gonna increase the number of capillaries in my legs very much.[2:38:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct. So you nailed it. Exercise choice is high precision here. So pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing and Movement pattern you want. High precision.[2:38:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is the thing. If you wanna get better at a plank, hold a plank. You're gonna do more push ups, do more push ups. You can do some other stuff that's complimentary, But, really, this is a high precision game. Do the exact same thing for exercise choice.[2:38:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: Very simple there.[2:38:25] Andrew Huberman: Okay. In terms of exercise order, I suppose this dovetails with volume. Yeah. Can I combine, training let's say, wall sits for my quads and, you know, nearby muscle groups, and then do push ups to failure, and then also do some sort of, pulling exercise to failure?[2:38:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Absolutely. Again, pick the exercises you want, the moving patterns you wanna do, and do them. The order almost doesn't matter with the one caveat. With larger muscle groups, particularly, again, multiple leg activities, that will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue.[2:38:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so if you, I guess, theoretically wanted to maximize your push up number and you did a whole bunch of, say, split squats, and you just did those and and you you, you know, did lunges for a mile or something like that. You might actually slightly compromise. You might not, But you might slightly compromise your ability to do as many pull ups in a row or hold a bend over a row or something like that. So if you really cared about that level, then you maybe wanna do the one that's most important first. In general, my recommendation, though, is to do the bigger muscle group first.[2:39:29] Andrew Huberman: How many sets and How often should one perform training for Muscular Endurance and when?[2:39:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now the lovely part here is we've moved down the spectrum past Hypertrophy. You don't need a lot of load here. In fact, the load only needs to be at or slightly above what you wanna move. So if you wanna get better at moving 50% of your one rep max, you don't really need to train much more than 50, maybe 55 or 60% of your on our max. Because if you go higher than that, the repetition count's going to fall, and you're no longer going to be training muscular endurance.[2:40:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you just need to stay right around that number that you wanna work on. So again, if the target is doing more pull ups and assuming That you have the strength to do it. You check that box. You simply need to practice the repetition range that you wanna be in. That's all it takes.[2:40:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can repeat that a number of times. But because, remember, the volume is fairly low, the load is very, very low, You can actually repeat these quite frequently. So you won't get extremely sore from muscular endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy straining Because the load is very, very light. So you can do these more frequently if you would like.[2:40:44] Andrew Huberman: More frequently such as?[2:40:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could do it 3 or 4 times a week easy if you would like. You don't necessarily need to. 3 days a week per muscle group is probably fine here. If you wanted to do more sets On a given day and do less days, that would be fine. So if you wanna do 2 days a week and you say wanted to do let's say you could do 25 push ups, And the goal is to get to 30 push ups, just as an example.[2:41:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: You might say, okay, I'm gonna do sets of 17, and I'm gonna do 3 sets of that. I'm I'm a do that 3 days a week. That's gonna build up quite a bit. Or you could say, look, I'm gonna do a set basically to failure. I'm gonna recover and do 1 or 2 sets that say 80%, and I'll do that twice a week.[2:41:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's gonna push the pace pretty well. You're gonna have a lot gains from that.[2:41:33] Andrew Huberman: And, again, this is not about hypertrophy. This is about muscular endurance.[2:41:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[2:41:37] Andrew Huberman: So I do wanna emphasize, and, again, please correct me if I'm, talking out of line here. Do wanna emphasize that because we mentioned pull ups. You know, if you can't get 25 pull ups, then and you're doing 10, you're training for hypertrophy. You're not training for muscular endurance per se.[2:41:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a big crossover So anytime we're talking past, like, 15 reps, we're technically in hypertrophy and muscular endurance.[2:42:04] Andrew Huberman: Got it.[2:42:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: So here's a common mistake. I don't wanna get bulky, so I'm I'm gonna go lighter and do more reps.[2:42:11] Andrew Huberman: And then people grow.[2:42:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: And then you landed still right in the middle of hypertrophy range.[2:42:15] Andrew Huberman: Right.[2:42:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, like, for people who are like, oh my gosh. Like, every time I lift weights, I blow up, I go lighter, I do more reps, and I you're still right in the hypertrophy zone.[2:42:22] Andrew Huberman: They'd actually be much better off training very, very heavy[2:42:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: in in[2:42:26] Andrew Huberman: the 1 to 3 rep range. Bingo. They get really strong, and they wouldn't grow much.[2:42:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Exactly. Mhmm.[2:42:31] Andrew Huberman: So tell me if this is a reasonable protocol for What I'm gonna call the typical person in my mind, the typical person is somebody who hopefully is doing resistance training, hitting that 10 sets Per muscle group per week minimum[2:42:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[2:42:46] Andrew Huberman: To maintain or build strength and hypertrophy, but is also doing some long duration training that we'll talk about in a little bit. Maybe throwing in, high intensity workout here or there, some sprints, maybe some Plymetrics, some skill based training. They're doing a bunch of different things Yep. To be all what I would call all around fit. Yeah.[2:43:08] Andrew Huberman: They're not training for any specific event or trying to maximize any one of the 9 adaptations to the exclusion of the others. That person decide, okay, after, they do their longer run, they're gonna do, max Tie a plank to max duration. They're gonna do a wall sit to max duration, and they're gonna do push ups to max duration. And then also do that same workout Before they do their high intensity interval training, some other point during the week, and then maybe even do it, again, on their, so called rest day. Just a real quick 5 minutes of Sure.[2:43:46] Andrew Huberman: And in doing so, build more capillaries into the relevant muscle groups and Build Their Muscular Endurance Yep. Without eating into their overall recovery too much.[2:43:55] Dr. Andy Galpin: Too much. Yeah. So again, the nice part about this is they don't hammer you Too much. You're not gonna get tremendously sore if you keep the load light. The only switch I'd make there is I would probably do them after your interval rather than before, so you can make sure you keep quality there, and you're not compromised by a local muscular endurance when you're actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue With something like a higher intensity, interval training.[2:44:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: So that would work fantastic. The only other variable we haven't hit on here is progression, And this is very simple. Try to add a rep or 2 per week. That's really all you have to go after. So if you're up to 22 this week, try to hit 23 next week.[2:44:31] Andrew Huberman: We're for wall sits and planks that would meet at at time.[2:44:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Time. Yep. And if and if you run into a wall there, just Like the same concepts we talked about with strength and hypertrophy. Back it down to more like in the 80 or 85% range and accumulate a lot more practice. That's gonna help a lot with capitalization, as well as asset buffering.[2:44:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're gonna continue to give yourself signals for up regulation, of the processes needed for that. And And it's not always pushing you to the end failure just like we don't wanna always go to failure with strength. We don't wanna always go to failure with high intensity intervals either. Same thing would be happening here.[2:45:07] Andrew Huberman: What about anaerobic capacity? How should people train for anaerobic capacity? What exactly are they training for? Meaning, what is the structural or seller adaptation or adaptations that are occurring that allow for increases in anaerobic capacity, and why are increases in anaerobic capacity good for us Even if we're a, quote, unquote, endurance athlete or we are a recreational app exerciser who is not interested in building more muscle speed or things that I typically associate with anaerobic capacity.[2:45:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So this is really, really fun. Remember, anaerobic capacity is the total amount of work you can do for something like seconds to a few minutes. And this is Extremely high levels of fatigue. The highest you're really going to see.[2:45:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: And by fatigue here, I mean, acid buildup byproducts. Not fatigue as in, like, mentally, I don't wanna do this Anymore. So if we just think about the energetics for a second. I'm gonna do, say, let let's take a really easy example of people have done that Thing where you, you'll go to the track, and you sprint the straightaways, and you walk the corners. Yeah.[2:46:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Remember that sort of thing?[2:46:16] Andrew Huberman: Yeah.[2:46:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Tabattas. 30 on, 30 off. Things like this. Like, this is what we're talking about, in this kind of anaerobic capacity area. Now Here's what's gonna happen.[2:46:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Is fat going to be your limiting? No. We are we've already made that clear. Right? What about carbohydrates?[2:46:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Well, if it's a single bout or a 2 or 3 bouts, probably not. But if you're doing this for a long time, say you're gonna go 30 on, 30 off for 20 rounds, You may actually start reaching a point of running out of micro muscle of glycogen. In any of those cases though, you're going to be running into an acid problem. If you were to continue to do this multiple repetitions in addition to running low on muscle glycogen, you're also gonna start running into oxygen transportation problems. Because you're building up a lot of bioproducts, you gotta continue.[2:47:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: You will actually cruise into aerobic glycolysis. This is exactly why, the community that I have worked a lot with, professional fighters. Very high level boxers, world champions, UFC fighters. It is a 5 minute round that you're going to do 5 times. This is for world championship fights.[2:47:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: You get 1 minute break in between. So imagine going, like, 30 on, 30 off for 5 minutes, Getting a 1 minute break and doing that 5 times. Even though the individual bouts are 30 seconds long, the entire thing lasts So long, it is primarily aerobic. You have to have both capacities. You gotta get really high anaerobic.[2:47:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: You also have to have a lot of aerobic going on. You are you going to start running into limitations because of heart rate, stroke volume, and then even potentially ventilation. The need for oxygen to be able to come in and clear the carbon dioxide totally out of the system becomes a problem because not only are you having so much build up for such a long time. You're also using multiple muscle groups. So now this is a very important distinction.[2:48:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Muscular endurance tends to be localized. Now this is not. Alright. If you're doing any intervals, you're on an assault bike, you're sprinting up a hill, you're grappling with somebody, you have a lot of muscles being involved, which means all of that waste is being dumped into the central You have to clear and I'm by clear, I now mean not out of the muscle. I mean, out of the body.[2:48:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: So your ability to bring in and utilize oxygen is going to be a major limitation Do you have ability to handle this stuff? So what do you do? Well, specificity wins. Practice the exact thing you're talking about. So if you wanna get better at sprinting the straightaways and walk in the corners, do that.[2:48:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can't always do it though. You're gonna run into limitations. So this is when backing off to a lower intensity is gonna give you a lot of benefits. We know very clearly if you wanna improve cardiovascular Clear fitness. High intensity, moderate intensity, and low intensity are effective, and you actually probably wanna do a little bit of all of them.[2:49:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is why none of our fighters would ever just do high intensity training. There's going to be some moderate. We tend to call this like cardiac output training. You can think of this as, like, anywhere between zone 2 to zone 4 if you like zones. I don't use them personally.[2:49:23] Andrew Huberman: So I'm just going to Intentionally interrupt you because this issue of zones has come up a few times, and I wanna make sure everybody's on the same page. You also mentioned that you don't necessarily favor the zone nomenclature. Yeah. But for those not familiar, Zone 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way up to 5 is a kind of, back of the envelope, type verbiage For some people and is more precisely followed by for other people. Meaning, for me, zone 1 is Simply walking, easy walking.[2:49:59] Andrew Huberman: Zone 2 would be for anybody the pace or intensity of exercise As that one could perform while still maintaining a conversation, but just barely. Meaning, if you were to push any harder, Then it would be difficult to hold that conversation. Then you'd be in zone 3. And then zone 3, 4, 5, as I understand them, are a little bit vague. But maybe you could give us a sense of the breathing patterns associated with each of the zones so that people could, map to those, when we discuss zone 1 through 5.[2:50:35] Andrew Huberman: And as I say all this, I Certainly, tip my hat to all of those people out there who like to measure percent of maximum heart rate.[2:50:44] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:50:44] Andrew Huberman: They like to use heart rate monitors. They're using any number of different devices. I sometimes use those devices, but in general, I tend not to, and I use my breathing as a rough guide of which zone I'm in. So before we go back to specific protocols for anaerobic capacity Yeah. Tell me how you think about zone 1 through 5, and how people might be able to assess whether or not they are in zone 1, 2, 3, or 4 or 5.[2:51:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. So zone 5 is that absolute top thing, and we can flag ourselves there. I liked how you flagged 1 and 2. The distinction between 3, 4, and 5, I'm I'm less concerned with Either, we will do some heart rate stuff, but not to identify what zone we're in. The fact is the distinction between those zones is basically just made up.[2:51:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. That not that it's fake, but that there's no, like, rationale there.[2:51:33] Andrew Huberman: It's a little bit like perceived effort in weightlifting. You know, are you at a 100% output or 70%? You you know when you're at 0, and you know when you're at a 100 in that moment. But the difference between 60 and 70 is anybody's guess.[2:51:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. So we use or the relevance. Right? So why does it matter if I'm at 60 or 70? Is Is there actually a difference?[2:51:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's not. Right? Doug, that doesn't really matter in that regard. If you're a very highly trained, particularly cyclist, Things like that then and you can control a lot of circumstances. Those things start to make a lot more sense.[2:52:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: But when you're in an open environment like the athletes I deal with, it's just not gonna It's not gonna matter that much. So, the way that I approach this is and I will use this word intentionally stolen Directly from Brian McKenzie and his company ShiftAdapt. They use what's called a gear system, and I absolutely love it. It's what we've been using for a long time. So with Brian, with your permission, I'm gonna take it right now.[2:52:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Thank you, Brian. You gave me the permission to tell.[2:52:29] Andrew Huberman: You, Brian. Brian's a good friend of of, of ours. And I do think the the breathing gear system is a Terrific way to think about the zones and to get a good sense of what zone 1 happens to be in. Yeah.[2:52:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. So, the first gear is your ability to simply breathe in and out through your nose at a set cadence. So basically, Regardless of how hard you're working, can you restrict your breathing to like a 2 to 3 second inhale, and then a 2 to 3 second exhale? And this is really clever actually because a lot of folks will jump immediately into an over breathing strategy, you'll be ventilating more than you need, which actually sends that RER up higher than it needs to be, which kicks you higher into carbohydrate utilization. If you're supposed to be in quote unquote zone 1, you're trying to be efficient, not fast.[2:53:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So using more carbohydrates than you need is not beneficial here. You're walking for the day. You're out on a longer hike. You're you're enjoying the day. You shouldn't be trying to ramp up carbohydrate metabolism.[2:53:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: It should be efficient.[2:53:35] Andrew Huberman: And so this would be getting into an argument with somebody while on a long walk. You feel exhausted afterwards. You've been over breathing.[2:53:42] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Totally. Right? Okay. Yeah.[2:53:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you should be able to breathe at a specific cadence, and generally, people are, doing that more frequently than they than they need. Right? Zone 2, rather, gear 2 is inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate you needed to be, but still nasal only. So it is a force. Right.[2:54:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Whatever you need to do, but your mouth is closed the entire time. You shifted higher up, you're burning more and more carbohydrate as a fuel source. But you're still able to control that and restrict it through nasal breathing. Now gear 3 and 4, which is our final ones, there's no gear 5. Gear, 3 and 4 is like a subtle distinction.[2:54:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: I actually don't even care about the difference there. I basically use gear 1, 2, and then that's 4. But you're basically talking about either a nose To mouth strategy or a straight up mouth mouth.[2:54:32] Andrew Huberman: Right? So breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth.[2:54:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you can control it that way you can do the opposite, actually. Right? Can you breathe in And out through your nose, but the classic one people do is into the nose, out through the mouth. Again, I really don't care about this distinction. I basically jumped from 2 to 4.[2:54:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Brian may do it differently. I don't actually know. 4 is just mouth mouth. Right? And this is the case in most sporting applications.[2:54:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna be breathing Because the nose is restricted. Right? There's only so much space. And as we talked about earlier, the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or c o two exhalation, if you're restricting that, this is gonna be problematic. So in your actual competition, please go to the mouth If you need to.[2:55:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? We practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible, but that's going to eventually happen. When you're doing your high intervals, and you're really going as hard as you can. You're gonna have to go to your mouth unless you're an absolute freakazoid, and you could say in your nose, but that's not gonna happen. Right?[2:55:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most people can't get Past, say, 70 or 80%, while breathing through your nose. I know some people can get higher, but that's the general distinction. So We pay much more attention to those particular gears than we do heart rate zones.[2:55:43] Andrew Huberman: And zone 5 would be just pure mouth breathing all out running for your life?[2:55:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: The gear system's just 1 to 4. There's no 5th gear.[2:55:50] Andrew Huberman: Got[2:55:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: it. So the gear 4 would again be mouth mouth. Breathing as much in as you can, breathing as much as you can out.[2:55:55] Andrew Huberman: Got it. And I I appreciate your description of of the gear system and how it, roughly relates to the zones we've been talking about. I also, am reminded if anyone wants to experience the relationship between breathing and the offloading of carbon dioxide and your ability to exert effort in anything, Thank, a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play when we walk or jog and talk is he'll say, let's just hold our breath now until we hit that piling or at, lifeguard stand on the beach, and within seconds, you actually can start to panic. Absolutely. Becomes very hard to coordinate your action after a little while.[2:56:34] Andrew Huberman: Again, be really careful with this, but but it will teach you in a moment in a very real world way how How important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide because you're Yeah. Probably not running out of oxygen at those lower intensities.[2:56:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: No question.[2:56:46] Andrew Huberman: You're simply building up carbon dioxide, and that gasp reflex is screaming to go off, and you're actively suppressing it.[2:56:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. So the interesting test here is your c o two tolerance. On Ryan's website, you can go directly there. You can There's a video to how to run this test, and then you can put in your numbers, and it'll tell you sort of exactly what to do as a result of it. But the c o two tolerance test is a test of exactly What you just mentioned.[2:57:09] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you should be fairly tolerant. In other words, nonreactive. You can be responsive, but nonreactive Two elevations in c o two. So you should see them and feel them, but you should be choosing how you respond rather than an inert reaction. There are interesting data looking at things like out of the blue panic attacks.[2:57:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can actually notice those in blood via rises in c o two up to 45 minutes Prior to the event app happening. So there are signals happening in your body, that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to. The more in tune you can get with that, The better your life is gonna be, and even if we're specifically just talking about exercise performance. So it's okay for c o two to rise. It's going to rise.[2:57:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a Byproduct of anaerobic anaerobic metabolism, it's a byproduct of carbohydrate and fat metabolism as we've established. It's going to get there. You're going to feel that. However, if you immediately go into a panic because of a small increase in c o two, this is a prop.[2:58:10] Andrew Huberman: So So returning to anaerobic capacity. This morning, we were training not together. I couldn't keep up with your workout, but I, but in the same, general space. And I did my once a week maximum heart rate, 1 minute sprint on the assault bike. Sometimes I'll do more minutes, meaning I will do a 1 minute, then take some rest, and do another minute after some rest.[2:58:32] Andrew Huberman: But I decided to do that 1 minute with you there so I could learn from you. And indeed, I have to assume that that was largely within the anaerobic capacity, realm. The first 30 seconds or so were manageable. We're getting more and more painful.[2:58:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[2:58:48] Andrew Huberman: There was a quit signal going off in my head. You said There's real magic that occurs around 2nd 40 and, indeed, somewhere around 2nd 40. For whatever reason, it seemed easier. But at the 1 minute mark, I was happy to stop because I was really at, at least, what fell to me, 100% output. Yeah.[2:59:04] Andrew Huberman: Is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity? Keeping in mind what you said before, which is that specificity or precision as you've raised it, is important. That is If I want to train, anaerobic capacity for sprinting, I probably should have been sprinting. Cycling, I was I was on the assault bike, and so on. How many of those 1 minute all out sprints or 30 second all out sprints on the on the bike Could and should 1 perform per workout and per week.[2:59:35] Andrew Huberman: So marching through exercise choice.[2:59:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Let's do it.[2:59:39] Andrew Huberman: Order, volume, frequency, and progression. Yep. Choice of exercises, train for what you want to improve. Is that right?[2:59:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Not necessarily. So in this particular case, if you have a specific goal, yes, of course, do it. Exercise choice. A couple of things you wanna Look for you wanna pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with. Because you're going to forget your brain very quickly here because you're gonna go into our pain cave cave.[3:00:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you're not comfortable running, don't go run here. You're never gonna get to the spot when you need to get to it. If you're not comfortable or if every time you you go on a rower, your low back hurts the next day, Don't do it. If you're not comfortable using kettlebell swing it's like you get the point. Don't do an exercise you're not comfortable with.[3:00:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: You also secondarily wanna be careful and cautious of Heavy eccentric loads. Because you're gonna be doing a lot of repetitions at a high intensity. So this is why I love an assault bike. This is why a rower is great. Swimming is amazing.[3:00:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: Running uphill, generally more favorable than running on, normal ground, especially if you're not runner. Don't run downhill. That's a lot of eccentric load. I don't love things like box jumps here. Right?[3:00:50] Dr. Andy Galpin: Because, again, a lot of eccentric loading. If Suppose you can jump up, land on the box, step down, but now you're you're again, you're too many things are going in your mind. I don't wanna slip and fall. I wanna smash my shin on the box. What happens if I too many variables.[3:01:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Pick something that is safer where you can really focus on your breathing and your posture and the performance. Alright. Alright. So that's exercise choice. And then within that, if there's some specific thing you wanna get better at, go ahead.[3:01:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: Do it.[3:01:15] Andrew Huberman: Okay. How many different Movement, meaning should I do the assault bike and then, some form of safe executable, overhead pressing? It it's a little hard it's a little harder to imagine, anaerobic capacity for the upper body unless you have access to a skier or one of these, What are those things called? The climber machines?[3:01:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. The VersaClimber.[3:01:39] Andrew Huberman: The VersaClimber. That's the one. The VersaClimber. You You can tell how often I do that one.[3:01:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's a great x So Great[3:01:47] Andrew Huberman: piece of exercise equipment. Yeah. So we're thinking how many how many how How many exercises and in what order? Is it going to be 2 or 3 exercises since you're involving a lot of muscle groups typically?[3:01:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's a really distinction. Generally, these are going to be total body movements. So you can do something like a ski or if you wanna really isolate your upper body. Great. Love that.[3:02:06] Dr. Andy Galpin: You can do lower body isolation like cycling. Right. We have everybody's not involved. You can use weights here. You can do some barbell movements and and stuff like that.[3:02:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: They're just not my favorite choices for most people. Too many complexity things going on. So, I generally am going to pick total body movements, pushing a sled, Dragging a sled, sprinting uphill, swimming, these things like that are are gonna be good.[3:02:31] Andrew Huberman: I'm seeing now why the Assault Bike is such a powerful tool because you're using your arms with some degree of resistance, but not a lot of eccentric load plus legs, some resistance, not a lot of eccentric load, and yet one can go, quote unquote all out for 30 or 60 seconds.[3:02:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. And that and the consequences of a technical breakdown are minimal. You're it's more like you're gonna actually have a worse performance rather than an injury rate. So there there's just a wonderful invention, be because of that. Where Other things, the consequences, like, say, if you're going to be doing a barbell or kettlebell activity, the consequences of making a technical mistake, You might actually get an acute injury right there.[3:03:08] Dr. Andy Galpin: So they're just a little bit higher in the risk scale.[3:03:11] Andrew Huberman: How many sets or sometimes referred to as repeats? Yep. So how many 30 to 62nd all out sprints? Again, doesn't have to be running sprinting, but all out effort would be the better way to phrase it. Should I perform, let's say, per week[3:03:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right.[3:03:28] Andrew Huberman: And then Decide whether or not we can divide those up across multiple workouts or whether or not it's better to do them in the same workout.[3:03:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. If you're staying with the same exercise for all of your workouts, That's a little bit different answer than if you're if you're modifying them. So say you're gonna do this 3 times a week, and you're gonna do, an air bike one day, You can do some hill sprints another day, and then you could do some swimming another day.[3:03:49] Andrew Huberman: For sake of example, I'm going to say, same movement Because I think most people are going to be most comfortable with 1 or 2 types of movements Yeah. Unless they are really coordinated or an excellent athlete. I think most people can probably find a hill that they could run up[3:04:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[3:04:05] Andrew Huberman: And, an aerodyne or assault bike, a rower, things things of that sort.[3:04:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. You're gonna have a pro and a con here. So the pro of doing less sets As you can actually train much closer to truly 100%. The downside is volume's low. K.[3:04:24] Dr. Andy Galpin: So a major mistake people make here is they'll do something like, I'll do 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, and I'll do that for 40 rounds. You're not really actually going that hard in those 20 seconds. So a key in fact, if you look at the literature and all the buzz and all the positive benefits Of high intensity interval training. That assumes you are actually hitting very close to 100%. If you're sliding down into, like, again, moderate training stuff, you start to actually be in a spot where you're not getting the total high end stuff, but you're not doing it long enough to get the low end stuff either.[3:05:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: And so you end up in this, like, You burn some calories. You probably still enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and little bit of capitalization, but you didn't really justify only doing 3 rounds. That's where the problem comes in. So in terms of a couple of protocols I'll give you, how many sets per week, it's it's really hard to give a number unlike the The strength training stuff where it was easy to kinda land some stuff on. A typical thing you'll see is, like, a minimum dose tends to be something like 4 rounds per day 3 times per week.[3:05:29] Andrew Huberman: Wow. Wow. That's a lot. So my once a week all out effort of sprinting on the Assault bike, the so called Aerodyne bike, For 60 seconds, 1 to 3 rounds of that might be doing something useful for me, but I should probably be doing that 2 or 3 times a week.[3:05:52] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're gonna get to a max heart rate, I generally like to say give me a minimum of 1 day a week. 2 is better.[3:05:58] Andrew Huberman: Days per week, how many rounds? Whatever[3:06:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: it takes you to get to that maximum heart rate. Right? So in your case, you did 1 minute. Okay. Good.[3:06:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're gonna extend past a minute or 2, 1 round might be enough. So for example, if you wanna just do something where I'm gonna run a mile As fast as I can, that's all you need to do for the day. You don't need to do multiple you can do mile repeats if you'd like, but that is really, really challenging. I know we've extended the time duration But I wanted to go there to to show you the time domain matters here. If you're doing something like a 22nd burst, you're going to need more rounds.[3:06:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you're doing something longer like multiple minutes, you don't need as many rounds to get there. So, in addition, If you're really reaching past this, 90 seconds of of hell window, It's just gonna do a lot more damage to the system. Not damaging than bad, but as in there's a lot to recover here. So we need more recovery time from that. A 22nd burst Doesn't really challenge you.[3:07:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: It challenges you in that 20 seconds shift, but you'll be recovered and fine. A 3 minute thing is gonna hurt, and it's gonna hurt for many, many, many minutes after that. You're going to still see maybe some performance decrements the next day depending on what your recovery stuff looks like. So, a couple of things to pay play with would be something like this. If you wanna try, like, a classic 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off protocol, the literature will show, like, a minimum of 4 rounds of that probably 3 days a week.[3:07:27] Andrew Huberman: So 30 seconds It's all out. 30 seconds rest is 1 round. Repeat that 4 times at least once a week.[3:07:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: At least. 2 would be better.[3:07:36] Andrew Huberman: Great.[3:07:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right. If you wanna go something a lot longer than that, you might be able to get away with 1. But generally, 2 days a week of this is better. If you start actually pushing past, like, 3 to 4 days a week up to 5 or 6, you may actually be causing some problems. There's just a little bit of excess Fatigue that's gonna happen there that you you maybe wanna stay away from.[3:07:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: In fact, you you can see a lot of endocrinological problems and some other sleep issues and some other things kick in. And we'll talk about more of those things just later. But, that's the number to get with. If you wanna try something more like a 22nd burst, I actually would recommend giving yourself more rest. So you you can actually do a higher rest Then work ratio.[3:08:19] Dr. Andy Galpin: Most people tend to think of this as doing like 1 to 1, 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off or lower. I love doing like 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off. The quality of that 20 seconds becomes extraordinarily high, and it's also possible to now get, like, 6 to 8 rounds.[3:08:35] Andrew Huberman: So as I'm hearing this, I'm going to wager a, an offer, to you. And if you say okay, then to to those listening. Based on what you're telling me about the relationship between intensity and quality and the need for Sufficient duration of this anaerobic work.[3:08:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah.[3:08:55] Andrew Huberman: How is 5 to 6 minutes per week of all out work?[3:08:59] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's pretty good.[3:09:00] Andrew Huberman: So what that means for me is I would do 3 all out 1 minute sprints On 1 workout separated by a minute or 2.[3:09:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[3:09:12] Andrew Huberman: Maybe more. And I would do that 2 or 3 times per week, just trying to hit that 5 or 6 minute per week threshold.[3:09:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. Actually, I think, one of the, Marty Gabala is a scientist, a Canadian, guy. Amazing work. He's done a lot of the the research on high intensity animal stuff. Right?[3:09:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: And I think The number he actually threw out there, and some of his original research was comparing 6 total minutes of work to upwards of, like, a 180 minutes of work throughout, the the entire week. And I'm and one of the classic studies was looking at VO two max improvements, and he saw equal if not greater improvements in VO two max with that. So I think, actually, the name of his book might be, like, this 6 minute workout or something. And then so you'd, like, may have nailed that directly on the head.[3:09:59] Andrew Huberman: Purely by luck. But actually, by[3:10:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: may be wrong on the numbers. We should probably fact check that. But[3:10:03] Andrew Huberman: Will and also by inference from what you were saying, you know, if you're gonna do this 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off, and you're doing more rounds We're 1 minute all out. So the way I'm going to think about this, if it's okay with you, is for 5 to 6 minutes a week, I am sprinting Yep. For my life.[3:10:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct.[3:10:22] Andrew Huberman: But I'm sprinting for my life with good form in whatever movement I happen to be doing. And I can do all of that in 1 workout, but I'm separating out bouts of 20 seconds all the way up to 1 minute[3:10:36] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[3:10:37] Andrew Huberman: Buy the necessary rest in order to recover my breathing, get back to pure nasal breathing, maybe zone 1, zone 2.[3:10:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Totally. And[3:10:44] Andrew Huberman: then hit it again. If you're gonna do[3:10:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: the 1 minute thing like you do, I actually generally encourage 1 to 3 minutes of rest before you do the next round, and probably up to 4 to 6 rounds. That would be your 6 minute number there. Now the caveat there is we don't worry about heart rate recovery. We worry about exactly what you mentioned, which is nasal only recovery. Once you can get back to that, Give yourself another 30 seconds or so, and then you're ready to go for round 2.[3:11:08] Andrew Huberman: This is where it gets fun because I can imagine challenging myself to get on the Assault Bike for one Minute of kind of warm up, very low intensity each morning[3:11:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Mhmm.[3:11:17] Andrew Huberman: And then sprint for a minute and then head off into my daily routine. No. Okay. That[3:11:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: if you're going to do that, though, you need to give me 3 minutes of nasal only breathing before you go back to work. We need to download it now.[3:11:31] Andrew Huberman: And there are people in my life that would love for me to engage in more nasal breathing because it'll have me speaking less. So no problem. Chances are I'm going to use The, 2 or 3 workouts per week of 1 minute all out. Maybe I'll try the shorter protocol.[3:11:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: Can I give you one fun protocol to try here?[3:11:48] Andrew Huberman: Please.[3:11:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if you have a you can use this on any equipment. But I learned this from another mutual friend, Kenny Kane. This is a great little it's a little test. Little a little game you can play with yourself. And the only way to play this game is you're going to lose, which is really, really lovely.[3:12:04] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you can do this at any You can do this for any duration of time, but 2 minutes is a good number. K. So you have to do this in somewhere where you can know distance. So this could be running, cycling, the the air bike is what I use. The first 2 minutes, you're going to Cover as much distance as you can possibly cover in 2 minutes, and you're going to note that.[3:12:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: So let's say you covered 400 meters. Right. Okay, great. You're going to rest for 2 minutes. Amazing.[3:12:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: That next round, you're now going to go for distance. So you're gonna cover the exact same amount of distance you covered in round 1, which in this example was 400 meters. And it doesn't matter how long it takes you. It may take you 2 minutes and 5 seconds, 2 minutes and 10 seconds because you're a little bit fatigued from round 1. Round 3, you're gonna now come back and do that exact same time domain That you did on round 2.[3:13:01] Dr. Andy Galpin: So if it took you 2 minutes and 5 seconds in round 2, now round 3 is going to last 2 minutes and 5 seconds. And you wanna see if you can cover a greater distance, 405 meters, 410 meters, and then you did in round 1. And the beauty of this little protocol, 6 minutes total of work. Right? But if you Slack in one of the rounds, you just make the next round harder.[3:13:25] Andrew Huberman: Is there any rest between rounds?[3:13:27] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. 2 minutes.[3:13:28] Andrew Huberman: Always 2 minutes rest.[3:13:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: You don't have to, but this would be my recommendation.[3:13:32] Andrew Huberman: Kenny Kane came up with this?[3:13:34] Dr. Andy Galpin: I I don't know if he came up with it. He taught me this thing.[3:13:36] Andrew Huberman: We both know Kenny, and he's an incredibly nice an incredibly skilled trainer. I'm gonna call it the sugarcane.[3:13:43] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. It's so[3:13:43] Andrew Huberman: great because it sounds really painful.[3:13:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: And if you go out too hard in round 1, You're in such big trouble round 2. But if you go too easy in round 1, you're going to get absolutely obliterated in round 3. So it's it's like a wonderful thing, and you can pick that number as a standardization and then just try to improve that a little bit per week. So progression is the last Part of this whole thing that we haven't got to yet before we move on, and and the way you wanna progress all of these things is you can time stamp again How much work you can do and then just try to do a slightly higher amount of work, 5% or so every week. Or you can add around, Which is a really nice way.[3:14:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: So, in the in the research, studies that have been done, they're gonna do things like week 1, you'll do 3 rounds. Week 2, you'll do 4 rounds. Week 3, you'll go 5 rounds. You'll, like, add a round until you get up to say 6 or 7 or 8 rounds At the end of the protocol. So that's a really nice way to go about it, or you can cap the rounds and just try to get more work done in that same amount of time.[3:14:44] Andrew Huberman: Meaning go more intensely.[3:14:46] Dr. Andy Galpin: Correct. Get, you know, get further distance in your 30 seconds or your 45 seconds or whatever. I wanna encourage people To go as low as 20 seconds, that's gonna allow you to go very, very, very fast. That's gonna actually challenge that phosphocreatine piece a little bit. I wanna encourage people to also go as high as 90 seconds.[3:15:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: So the the honest way, the way that I will do it, not that it's about me, but just as an example of something you could do, I do something in the 15 to 22nd burst range, and I will generally hedge towards a 2 to 1 Rest to work ratio. So I'm probably gonna rest 40 to 60 seconds. That's true to that's to make sure that 22nd burst is extremely high quality. Cool. I'm also gonna do something in the 30 to 52nd range.[3:15:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: K? I might go 1 to 1 work rest ratio. The quality of those 30 seconds is gonna come down, but the acid buffering is gonna be extraordinarily challenged. I also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range. So again, 30 seconds on, maybe 2 minutes off.[3:15:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Now I won't be able to be I won't be working on my ability to handle, the waste product build up there, But I'll be working on my ability to produce more force over that time, which is another skill set. And then all the way up to say what you do, a minute, 70 seconds, and you can go 1 to 1 there Or up to 3 to 1. You're gonna be working on a little bit of this different thing, but that's exactly how we hit both sides of this equation. Working on dealing with waste as well as Actually working on bringing in nutrients and getting that system a little bit more effective. So, you could set that up across your week, and just it could be something like Day 1 is that 22nd burst window.[3:16:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Day 2 is that maybe 62nd window. And then day 3 is maybe 1 all out effort, And we're done there.[3:16:40] Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about the specific protocols and adaptations related to maximum aerobic output or Maximum aerobic capacity is that sometimes called.[3:16:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure. Now we're moving past, like, that couple of minute range into, like, the, You know, 5 to 15 minute range, but at a maximum intensity. So what's the highest you can go from there? We're not talking about our last category of long duration here. Well, the beautiful part is we've already explained a lot of it because it's very similar to what we just talked about with anaerobic capacity.[3:17:12] Dr. Andy Galpin: It is primarily going to be a problem I'm dealing with waste products, especially at the end. It's not enough total distance to be running out of muscle glycogen, though it may start to creep down a little bit. Fat's not gonna be an issue, but certainly more oxygen transportation is gonna be an issue. So we're just hedging a little bit more towards that side of the equation. Towards the end of that workout, no doubt about it, clearing out waste products is gonna be a huge issue.[3:17:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: But really, oxygen demand delivery is starting to take more of a prominent role because we have had more time To clear the waste. And if we're not good at that, we're gonna be failing earlier than we need. So the training for that needs to be a little bit At that exact thing. So a classic thing here is a 1 mile test. Right?[3:18:02] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is gonna last for most people somewhere between 5 10 minutes. You're sort of right in this window. If you just wanna practice that once a week, we're done here. Right? Exercise choice, Same thing we talked about.[3:18:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? Pick an exercise you're comfortable with that you can actually do, and you could progressively increase in terms of the intensity. You're not gonna be you're gonna have to stop and change your exercise. You're not gonna have to move around. It's like a circuit isn't great here because you gotta put One implement down, pick up another one.[3:18:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: You wanna be doing something where there is literally not a second of off switch. So similar exercise choice principles we just covered. If you're gonna become a real savage and you wanna do repeats here, you can. Endurance folks will do that a lot. 1 mile repeats, 800 meter repeats, things like that, or I'm not sure what the swimming distance equivalents would be, but swimmers, we do this constantly.[3:18:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: But you don't need to. This is really hard. It's pretty hard in the system. It's very good for you. 1 to twice a week of hitting this, I think you'd be in a really, really good spot.[3:19:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Frequency, we sort of just covered. We have covered exercise choice. Volume, we just sort of nailed. And intensity is basically running you up To the top there. Now, because you can only do that so often, you wanna add in another 40 or so percent of your time being lower intensity Support work for that.[3:19:22] Dr. Andy Galpin: So this is something probably less than 85% of your heart rate, but higher than quote unquote zone 2. You gotta be working here. This is not I could have a conversation pace. This is higher than that. It's in between conversation pace and the pace I need to be at to run my fastest mile I've ever done.[3:19:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's that middle ground, and you need to train that so that you can continue to work on capitalization, auction transportation, But you're not burning down the house getting all the way up to a 100 100 plus percent of your VO two max.[3:19:51] Andrew Huberman: Could I use a, accrued Version of this where I say, okay. I'm going to exercise for 10 minutes. I'm gonna go as fast as I safely can. And every week, I'm gonna measure how far I travel Yep. Easy.[3:20:10] Andrew Huberman: In that 10 minutes.[3:20:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Love it.[3:20:13] Andrew Huberman: Probably not on the same day that I'm doing the anaerobic capacity work.[3:20:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: Probably not.[3:20:18] Andrew Huberman: If you were okay to do After a strength training or hypertrophy workout, as long as I didn't train legs You could.[3:20:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's probably gonna compromise recovery is the way so I would if you're gonna do a session like this, I would probably do it on its own day. Unless you wanted to do something like speed or power, Then you could roll right into this and have no problem. Maybe a strength day, hypertrophy day. I'm not sure, you would do there because, Again, especially if you did any sort of lower body exercise, you're gonna be compromised here. But remember, these tend to be full body movements.[3:20:57] Dr. Andy Galpin: So even if you did arms that day, your arms are gonna be compromised. And you don't wanna fail this because of local muscular failure.[3:21:04] Andrew Huberman: Alright. So now I've got my work cut out for me. I'm gonna be doing 5 to 6 minutes per week of all out work divided into 60 20 or 62nd bouts with sufficient rest, and I'm going to give myself 10 minutes a week of in my case, it'll probably be running as fast as I can. Yep. Because I do enjoy running, and I can do it safely, maybe uphill and see how far I go.[3:21:28] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep. If you wanna combine the 2 so So if you're just saying, hey, I'm bought in, Andy. Like, I wanna do both of these things. They are similar, but they have independent benefits. I'm convinced.[3:21:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: How would I build these into the same week? Maybe do 1 of each. That still gets you at, quote unquote, 2 days per week where you're gonna hit a high maximum heart rate. So we already checked that box up. So one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one, and the other one can simply be a 5 to 15 minute maximum work, and you're done.[3:21:59] Andrew Huberman: Long duration endurance exercise, the stereotypical endurance exercise. Sure. How far, how long, how fast, or how slow should, rather, should I go? And Here, I'm gonna venture that exercise choice is one that we could click off even at this point in the discussion because, obviously, it's gotta be something that I can do for a long while without getting injured. Overuse injuries.[3:22:30] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's a little bit of novelty we can actually throw in here. So one of the things I love to do For long duration endurance for people who don't love running, cycling, or swimming is you can do a really cool workout, any number of things where you can put a little circuit together. As long as there's not a lot of downtime between 1 circuit to the next time, you can actually do something as simple as, like, maybe you're gonna do farmer's caries. And you'll do that for, say, 3 minutes, and you'll set those down, and you'll you'll go straight into a plank for a minute. And you'll pick that up, and you go straight into maybe body weight squats For 2 minutes, then you go straight into another exercise and you suit you can sort of rotate things around.[3:23:11] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe you can do even some, like, shadow boxing stuff Or some jump rope. You can do different gymnastics movements and body weight movements, and you can run that thing through, and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished And not feel like you're doing, oh my gosh, this mind numbing type of training, if it feels like that to you. Another way you can do that to actually even simplify it even more, we've done this at Kenny Kane's gym plenty of times where you just maybe even pick 3 machines. So you're gonna go, I'm gonna go 10 minutes on the rower, then I'm gonna go 10 minutes on the treadmill, then I'm gonna go 10 minutes on the bike. You can actually knock a a 30 minute, quote unquote, steady state session out in and not feel those problems if those things happen.[3:23:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you can actually have a lot of fun there. We will do, a lot of times with our fighters, we'll do things like put a very low load. I'm talking sub 50% of your max On a barbell, and you're gonna squat, and you're gonna do, you know, maybe a minute. You're gonna put that down, and then you're gonna go over and do 50% of a bench press. You're gonna put that down.[3:24:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna go over and do 50% of, of a crab walk. And then and you're gonna go over and do another one. And you can actually run through this entire thing. You don't hit that many reps in any individual movement. The load is very, very light, and you can keep heart rate busy at a steady state And do 15 or 20 or 30 different exercises.[3:24:29] Dr. Andy Galpin: And it's actually, like, fairly fun and engaging, to do. And it's a little bit more specific than trying to get A 275 pound NFL player to run for 30 minutes, which is not gonna be good. So[3:24:41] Andrew Huberman: I'm just chuckling because I love to run outdoors, and I've enjoyed runs on all my travels. And Yeah. I find it to be a great way to see different places. And I like moving through space, but There are weather conditions and times when that's not an option. So what you described is a terrific alternative.[3:24:59] Andrew Huberman: I have to assume that the specific adaptation That's occurring here is related to the fat burning system. And, again, that doesn't necessarily mean fat loss Correct. Overall, but fat burning system. And yet I do have a question, which is can you build enhanced microcapillary systems into the muscles, by doing this long duration cardio.[3:25:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yeah. Absolutely, Ken. In fact, depending on which paper you, like more than the other papers, you may even Find evidence that this is a superior method than anything else. So steady state endurance is very important. I used to not like it as much.[3:25:40] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's just so much evidence now that suggests it's probably a really good thing for basically everybody. Maybe for some individuals, It's not in all year of their training, but if if you're not a high level athlete or have a very specific goal that's right in front of you, It's probably best to do at least 20 minutes as a minimum, maybe 30 minutes of some steady state exercise once a week For basically any training goal, outside of, again, a couple of really specific scenarios that are happening. The other thing that kinda kicks in here that we haven't really talked about is now we're actually reaching a position where fatigue of the intercostal starts to play. So diaphragmatic fatigue starts to run-in an occasion. So we forget, generally, breathing is a contraction to open up the lungs to change Pressure so the air will flow in, and then the exhalation is passive.[3:26:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? It's just a muscle's been stretched. It goes back to its resting. When you get to a maximum heart rate, inhalation Can an exhalation become active? So you're squeezing as hard as you can to open up, and you're squeezing to contract to blow air out.[3:26:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're going to get fatigued, That system. Right? Over time, you have contracted, contracted, open up. If that system starts to get fatigue, you start running into failure here. So you need to practice that, and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion.[3:27:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: There's all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs, and when we say that, that's what we're really talking about. The musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue. So that's the only other little component I wanted to throw in here. If we're not talking about asset buffering, which in this particular case is not a problem anymore, the time domain is long and slower. So we have plenty Time to use fat as a fuel.[3:27:26] Dr. Andy Galpin: We also have plenty of time to use anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis and clear out waste products. So we don't really see pH being a problem With this type of exercise, you may start running low on liver glycogen if you're going a very long time. Muscle glycogen may start getting low, But not really these were huge issues. You're gonna run into maybe a little bit of a stroke volume issue, but an intensity is not high enough to become a problem. You're more likely lead a breakdown posturally or breathing mechanics than really anything else, unless again, that duration really gets generally past 2 hours For most people.[3:28:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: So those are the things that are going to limit us. So how do we improve it? What do we train? We went through the exercise choices. You also need to make sure you're training Your intercostals, we need to be training our diaphragm in some fashion.[3:28:13] Dr. Andy Galpin: Again, it can be the exercise itself, can be your normal training. The thing you need to be careful of here, and this is actually true for all the things we just talked about. When we think about fatigue and we think about failure of endurance, we Really need to pay attention to technical breakdown. That is always the marker we look for. So when we when we go through our stuff with our athletes And they quote unquote fail or they finish?[3:28:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: That's generally because we saw a massive technical breakdown. You're done. Like, you're over there. Not always the case during all your round of training, but this is something to really pay attention to. So if you're on that bike and you're 40 seconds in and all of a sudden posture starts crunching over, I may stop the test.[3:28:53] Dr. Andy Galpin: I may stop the training. It's like, no. What we decided failure was is when you lost your technique To some sufficient level. So you wanna pay attention to that too because that's gonna determine your ability to perform well as well as maintain efficiency, which is a really big problem[3:29:10] Andrew Huberman: Tell me if the protocol I'm about to describe would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate. Sixty to a 120 minutes of long duration work per week. So one way to accomplish that that I often use is to head out for a weight vested hike. It's not a heavy weight vest. It's maybe I think it's 8 or 10 pounds.[3:29:38] Andrew Huberman: It's one of these thinner ones. And if people don't have access to that, you can bringing a backpack with some items in it. I mean, it can be a simple exercise.[3:29:45] Dr. Andy Galpin: External load. It can just be your body. That's[3:29:47] Andrew Huberman: fine. Great. And and do some hiking at a At a fast enough clip that I'm breathing harder than I would be if I just kinda shuffled along. Yeah. I might stop here or there, drink some water.[3:29:58] Andrew Huberman: No big deal. But I I can carry on a conversation if I need to. So it's zone 2 ish, but probably pushing a little bit harder than that for that duration.[3:30:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yep.[3:30:08] Andrew Huberman: Not a lot of, deep soreness occurring after this. Maybe a little bit of achiness and some stabilization muscles that were used that Yeah. May not be used too much, especially if I've been sitting a lot during the week. Kind of reminds me of how much I've been sitting. Yep.[3:30:21] Andrew Huberman: But doing that all in 1 long afternoon, typically on a weekend or doing 2 shorter sessions throughout the week, maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes, and then working up the progression to longer Longer duration. Seems like that would be something that most people, should be able to do Yep. And that it would weave in well with Any resistance training or the, anaerobic and aerobic output capacity work that we talked about just a moment ago?[3:30:51] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. That's A fine version to do it if you wanna go shorter and bring up the intensity a little bit. So you wanna keep it more to the 30 to 60 minute range And go, you know, closer into the I can't have a conversation right now, but again, I'm not at a blistering heart rate. Then you could probably get that same thing done in a Smaller time window, if that was a consideration. So if you wanted to blend all 3 of these together, you have a lot of wiggle room.[3:31:17] Dr. Andy Galpin: Right? So you could do something like Order. If we're talking about this type of training, you could do this first, and then finish with either one of the higher intensity stuff we talked So it could be roped into the same thing. It could be its own independent day. Could be your sort of active recovery day.[3:31:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: It tends to be fairly restorative for as you alluded to a little bit there. So it's not that big a deal to do this on your quote unquote off day. If you're those if you're that type of person who, like, even on your off day, you have to do something physical, this is fine. Right? If you wanted to do it on a lifting day, especially if it's a power or strength day, it's probably fine.[3:31:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: If you wanted to do it before the workout or after, either way, You're probably okay. Probably best do it after if the primary goal is one of the strength training adaptations. If it's not, if this is a primary goal, do it first. Amazing. If you wanted to do it in the combination with the other interval stuff, you could do it fine there.[3:32:14] Dr. Andy Galpin: You could do it before Or you could do it afterwards. I actually have no problem doing it afterwards because that in effect, especially if you say nasal only During this training, we'll help the down regulation go. And so you could finish that fairly well down regulated actually. So it's kinda like a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up, Go really, really hard and then give it a nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down. And by the time you finish, maybe even on a 3 minute[3:32:46] Andrew Huberman: Walk. Nice slow nasal breathing.[3:32:49] Dr. Andy Galpin: 4 second inhale. Four second and a half. Maybe 5. So you can play with the numbers a little bit. Then maybe you don't even need to do the down regulation breathing out for you.[3:32:58] Dr. Andy Galpin: You'll be in a good spot. You wouldn't wanna do this before. Do your intervals, finish your intervals, throw up, lay on the ground, sweat all over the gym floor, get up and go back to work. That's probably not our best strategy.[3:33:10] Andrew Huberman: As people are hearing this all, they may be thinking, wow. This is a lot of work to do, but I've been keeping track of the math here. So I'm sure some Some of you out there are as well. And we're really talking about 10 minutes of the of running or sprinting on the bike or rower Once a week, we're talking about 6 minutes or so of the much higher intensity, but short bouts divided into rounds of 20 to 20 seconds to a minute with with rest in between, and then some longer duration workout of 30 minutes minimum, but maybe as much as an hour, even 2 hours, which in total doesn't really equate to that much time, especially if one can access these things right out their front door or at home, and as we pointed out, you don't need any specialized equipment to do that. Oh, and I forgot the, muscular endurance.[3:33:59] Andrew Huberman: I I Yeah. I wasn't trying to cheat there. There's some muscular endurance thrown in as well. So that brings me to a a question, which is, If I'm doing my training for muscular endurance each week for anaerobic capacity and for maximum aerobic output and long duration, And given that all of that, it's gonna take roughly 2 hours for the typical person total for the entire week, which I would argue is going to give you back so much life literally. In terms of longevity, you're literally gonna earn back years of your life[3:34:31] Dr. Andy Galpin: Productivity, you name it.[3:34:33] Andrew Huberman: Offsetting all sorts of, Metabolic issues and, enhancing your sleep and and improving mood. I mean, there's so much data so much data pointing to all those positive benefits. If I do all of these things and I'm fairly consistent about them, am I going to be metabolically flexible? Am I going to have a well developed fat burning, carbohydrate burning system? And will I be, essentially fit?[3:35:03] Andrew Huberman: I mean, this is not leaving aside issues of strength and hypertrophy, which were covered in in the previous episode, Will I be fit? I mean, to my mind, the ability to, you know, sprint very fast if one needs to, the ability to go longer duration if one needs to, and the ability to do something in between as well as, you know, hold a box overhead if necessary, while installing a shelf or something like that. Mhmm.[3:35:25] Dr. Andy Galpin: These[3:35:25] Andrew Huberman: are the realities of life, and to me represent real functional world fitness. If that's the case, is there anything that we would wanna add to this program, or would you consider that a fairly comprehensive and complete endurance training system.[3:35:38] Dr. Andy Galpin: If we remember the target, which is I wanna have energy, I wanna look a certain way, And you wanna be able to do that for the duration of your life for a very long life. This style of training where you incorporate all of those areas of endurance Gives you all of the necessary adaptations one would need to execute all of those things. Remember, Fat loss or weight management is not best done with any individual style of protocol. So if you do a little bit of all 3 of these, you've Check that fat loss box. You don't need to go out and do anything separate for it.[3:36:16] Dr. Andy Galpin: You've done all the things then to cover aesthetics From that side of the equation. Right? You've done the things to both enhance mitochondria, to enhance blood flow, Increase oxygenation and manage fatigue and waste development. Boom. Energy's there.[3:36:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Fatigue is there. I'm not gonna get tired or have to quit or stop or sit down doing any of these activities I want. At the same time, if you look at the literature on mortality, One of the strongest predictors of how long you're going to live is your v o two max. So we've set up a scenario in which you're going to hit all 3 of those primary goals by doing a EmeraGoals, by doing a combination of this training, you're not going to miss any plausible adaptation from endurance training, and you should be set for regardless I'm your[3:37:04] Andrew Huberman: goal. Incredible. And as I understand, totally compatible with strength and hypertrophy training, Provided that your goal is to also be strong and also selectively hypertrophy or generally hypertrophy your muscles or maintain your muscles. For many people that are listening to this, I'm guessing that they have an interest in building more endurance. But not just the ability to go further, but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed, and to do it with better form, and to Breathe better and to feel better before, during, and after.[3:37:41] Andrew Huberman: For those folks, maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of Endurance. And does so in a way that informs how, for instance, the higher intensity short duration sprints would Be expected to improve their longer duration work, and how perhaps their longer duration work, can progress If they are careful to include, some planks and some wall sets and and things of that sort, I asked this question specifically because I have to believe that while there probably are some folks out there that are looking to just maximize their plank from week to week to week, Typically, it seems that people fall into these categories of either wanting to get stronger and get bigger muscles to varying degrees or to get better at endurance or To get better at everything overall, right now, I'd really like to just focus on what you think is a nice contour of a program for the person that wants to get better at endurance, but do it with more speed, more stability, and just feel like a strong endurance runner, cycler, swimmer, or whatever happened to be their endurance event.[3:38:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great. So let's just give an example. Maybe you wanna run your first half marathon, something like that. K?[3:38:54] Dr. Andy Galpin: Maybe done a couple times before, but you just wanna get better at that time. I would probably put somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70% of your, you know, mileage in the moderate intensity zone. K. So you need to accumulate mileage, and you need to be able to handle what we call the tissue tolerance. So in this case, your feet need to be able to handle 13 miles of pounding.[3:39:15] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. It doesn't matter how much high heart rate training you do or your fat deliverability. None of that matters if your feet are blown up by mile 8. Okay. So in addition, we talked about how even training in that 70 to 85% heart rate zone is quite effective At oxygen delivery, fat utilization, capitalization, etcetera.[3:39:37] Dr. Andy Galpin: So you're going to get a lot of direct endurance benefits from that work. You're also going to be working on what's honestly going to be one of your limiting factors, which is that tissue tolerance and that pounding. K? In addition, you need to be efficient with your technique, and you need a lot of repetitions for motor skill development. So you wanna spend most of your time there.[3:39:56] Dr. Andy Galpin: It's easy to recover from. It's not extremely, demanding and challenging. Awesome. That leaves you with another 30 or 40% of training. I would spend 10% of that in that, like, 22nd burst area.[3:40:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: You're gonna drive up fatigue Extremely high, and you gotta really maximize your ability to recover from, waste production. Alright. Great. I would spend the remaining amount of time either on a little bit of actually maximum speed stuff that could actually be in a 22nd burst, if you're really trying to go as fast as you can At the beginning of that exercise. And then the rest of it, I would spend in that other zone, which is more of, like, the five It's at 15 minutes, but you're probably gonna wanna repeat those.[3:40:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: And this is when things like 800 meter run, rest for double the time, And then repeat that 2 or 3 times. You actually need that in this scenario because you're gonna need to be able to be running for 2 most people are gonna do a half marathon in maybe 2 hours or so, something like that. And so you want a little bit of what we call repeated endurance. Right? So be able to handle that higher heart rate, Come back down.[3:41:03] Dr. Andy Galpin: Do it again. At the same time, that's actually how you bump your mileage up. So instead of having this do more of these long duration distance runs, You can still get maybe 5 or 6 miles done in a day if you're gonna do a 1 mile repeat or whatever number you're looking at. So For a lot of people, that's kind of how I would structure it. That's honestly is very similar to what we laid out in the previous conversation, which is Getting this idea that more than 50% should be basically practice.[3:41:33] Dr. Andy Galpin: A little bit of work at the very top end of the spectrum, but not too Too much, and then a little bit of work at the other end, and you should be in a good spot. A major mistake one would make here is only doing the long duration steady state stuff and just sort of saying, I'm gonna run 5 miles this this week and then do 6 miles next week and seven a set. It might work for you. It's I think we have enough evidence at this point both In the scientific realm as well as most of the coaches, I think in this space would agree with me is that's a suboptimal strategy. So it could work, but we can do better.[3:42:03] Andrew Huberman: In terms of the structure of a program like this, I realize that those structures vary tremendously. Different coaches and different books and different programs are gonna say, oh, you should run Monday through Friday day with weekends off or every other day. But in terms of this 70%, 30% divide where 70% is going toward the specific event, You know, doing the kind of work that you're going to do during the specific event that you're most interested in cultivating or improving Sure. And the remaining thirty percent coming from other sorts of, of supporting, work. How should one think about distributing that other 30%, should it be all geared towards maximizing recovery for the 70%.[3:42:42] Andrew Huberman: Or in other words, could I do all that 30% work On one day[3:42:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: I probably would split it into 2 days. That's the reality of it. So if you're thinking, man, coach wants me to train 6 days a week. My schedule is tight. I can pull off 4 to 5.[3:43:00] Dr. Andy Galpin: Okay. Great. What I might say is 2 of those days are just your your tempo. Right? Right.[3:43:05] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is what, like, a runner would call this. Like, tempo training, kind of in that space. Right?[3:43:09] Andrew Huberman: Remind us what tempo training is just for the[3:43:10] Dr. Andy Galpin: I see this, like, 60 to 80% effort range where you're, like, running at Probably the same stride length and and rate that you're gonna run your race at, maybe a little bit lower, but something similar. You're practicing skill, you're accruing mileage, and And you're getting a little you're getting work, Anne. For sure, work. But it's not absolutely the fastest you can sprint, and it's also not conversation.[3:43:32] Andrew Huberman: So this would be the, what Before, we refer to as the 10 minutes of of fast running or 10 minutes of fast rowing.[3:43:39] Dr. Andy Galpin: This is lower intensity than that. Got it. This is, This is work accumulation. Got it. This is practice stuff.[3:43:47] Dr. Andy Galpin: Then one of the days a week, I would probably enter in That 22nd, 32nd burst for a little bit of speed there. And then one of the other days is when I would do that true high intensity as hard as I can for Hitting a VO two max, something like that. So that's probably how I'd break it up if I had, like, 4 days a week. If you had 5, you can maybe add in another day where you do more of that, volume accumulation practice work. But that's that's a pretty good split.[3:44:15] Andrew Huberman: Well, this is the point in the episode where I say, Thank you ever so much. You provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting, clear information that's also actionable. I do feel as if I far better understand endurance in its many forms. And even the seller underpinnings of that and even subseller underpinnings of What endurance adaptations are and how to foster those through specific protocols, things that not only I can do tomorrow, but that I will do tomorrow. And where I hit my pain points, I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering.[3:44:51] Andrew Huberman: When my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can Calmly move along just through nasal breathing. I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering. I think you also highlight something that is vitally important, and I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today, which is that It really doesn't matter how one seeks out to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met even while Certain forms of exercise tap into fat stores more than others.[3:45:21] Dr. Andy Galpin: Sure.[3:45:21] Andrew Huberman: And you beautifully illustrated the relationship between energy utilization and breathing and the fact that we literally exhale fat to to some extent.[3:45:32] Dr. Andy Galpin: Of course.[3:45:33] Andrew Huberman: So once again, thank you. Thank you, and thank you. I know I'm not alone in, recognizing this information as incredibly interesting and and actionable. And indeed, I do plan to put it into action as I hope, many of our listeners will as well.[3:45:48] Dr. Andy Galpin: Yet again, the pleasure is actually all mine, and, I actually really appreciate the fact that you let me go So far in the metabolism, my PhD is in human bioenergetics. So anytime I can go many hours In the metabolism, I get very excited, and I don't typically get that leash, in this format. So I appreciate that. I know you understand your audience will love that, hopefully.[3:46:10] Andrew Huberman: Oh, they'll they'll love it, and I think that they'll especially love it because they understand that if one can Wrap their head around even just a small fraction of the mechanisms that underlie a given protocol. It gives both tremendous depth and meaning to that protocol and makes it so much more flexible both for people that can really think about what's happening as they're engaging in a given protocol and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results.[3:46:35] Dr. Andy Galpin: Great. We've been on a bit of a journey here. We've covered a lot of ground with speed development and strength and hypertrophy, and now we walk Through, you know, probably several hours here of of Endurance, what I would love to do next is to just give you a more straightforward, Not as much background, not as much metabolism, none of the mechanisms, right into protocols for someone who says, Look, I wanna hit those marks you keep talking about. I wanna look good. I wanna feel good, and I wanna do that across my lifespan.[3:47:07] Dr. Andy Galpin: How would I build all these things into a protocol that actually covers maybe the entire year, and how would I would be able to repeat that year after year. So I almost have this evergreen sustainable year long periodization structure that covers all the noes I need to if I want Everything we've talked about in these 9 adaptations in this short series. So I would love to do that in our next conversation.[3:47:33] Andrew Huberman: If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
