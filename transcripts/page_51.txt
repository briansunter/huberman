I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is doctor David Buss. Doctor Buss is a professor of psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and he is one of the founding members and luminaries in the field of evolutionary psychology. Doctor Buss's laboratory is responsible for understanding the strategies that humans use to select mates in the short and long term, and he is an expert in sex differences in mating strategy.[0:00:39] Andrew Huberman: His laboratory has explored, for instance, Why women cheat on their spouses or their long term partners as well as why men tend to cheat on their spouses and long term partners. He's also explored a number of things related to the courtship dance that we call dating and securing a mate, including The use of deception related to proclamations of love or promises of finances or sexual activity. Doctor Buss's laboratory has also evaluated how Status is assessed, meaning how we evaluate our own worth and our potential as a mate and who is, Let's just say within range of a potential mate, both in the short and long term. For instance, today, we talk about how people don't just make direct assessments of their own and other people's value as a potential mate, but also using the assessments of others to indirectly determine whether or not they stand a chance or not in securing somebody as a short or long term mate. His laboratory has also focused on some of the complicated and varied emotions related to mating love and relationships, such as lust and jealousy.[0:01:46] Andrew Huberman: And he's extensively explored something called mate poaching or the various strategies that men and women use to make that the person that they want to be with or the person they are with is not with anyone else or seeking anyone else, and indeed that other people Don't seek their mate. Doctor Buss's work also relates to how biological influences such as ovulation or time within the menstrual influences mate selection or tendency to have sex or not with a potential short or long term mate. And more recent work from doctor Buss's laboratory focuses on the darker aspects of mating and sexual behavior in humans, including Stalking and sexual violence. Today, we discuss all those topics. We also discuss some of the strategies that humans can use To make healthy mate selection choices and for those that are already in committed relationships, to ensure healthy progression of those committed relationships.[0:02:41] Andrew Huberman: In addition to publishing dozens of landmark scientific studies, doctor Buss has authored many important books. A few of those include The Evolution of Desire and Why Women Have Sex. And his most recent book is the one that I'm reading now, which is called When Men Behave Badly, The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception, Harassment, and Assault, and it's an absolutely fascinating read. It has endorsements from doctor Robert Sapolsky, professor at Stanford, who's been on this podcast as a guest before, as well as Steven Pinker and Jonathan Haidt who wrote The Coddling of the American Mind. It's a really important book, I believe, and one that doesn't just get into the darker Aspects of human mating behavior and violence, but also strategies that people can take to ensure healthy mating behavior and relationships.[0:03:30] Andrew Huberman: There's so much rumor, speculation, and outright fabrication of ideas about why humans select particular mates in the short and long term, What men and women do differently and so on. What I love about doctor Buss's work is that it's grounded in laboratory studies that are highly quantitative using rigorous statistics. And so throughout today's discussion, you'll notice that I'm wrapped with attention trying to extract as much information as I can from doctor Buss about the real science of human mate selection and mating strategy. I'm certain that everyone will take away extremely valuable knowledge they can use in existing or future relationships from this discussion with doctor Buss. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.[0:04:16] Andrew Huberman: It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our 1st sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are Absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that the cells and connections of our brain and visual system have to with an enormous number of challenges in order to see clearly.[0:04:44] Andrew Huberman: For instance, when you go from a brightly lit environment to a dimmer environment or into a shadow, your visual system has to adjust. The problem with a lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses out there is that they don't work well with those adjustments. Roca has overcome those challenges, and as a consequence, no matter what environment you're in, you see with crystal clarity. Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are also terrific because they are extremely lightweight, so you don't even notice that they're on your face. And they can be worn when working or for school or just walking about, but also when running or cycling.[0:05:15] Andrew Huberman: And indeed, if you get sweaty, they won't slip off your face. That's a terrific feature, but they can be worn to do Anything. I wear readers at night and sometimes when I drive at night. And a wonderful thing about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that unlike a lot of other performance Glasses out there that make people look like cyborgs or make it look like you're definitely off to exercise. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses have a range of terrific aesthetics that you could wear anywhere.[0:05:42] Andrew Huberman: If you'd like to try ROKA Eyeglasses, you can go to roka.com.

Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.[0:06:08] Andrew Huberman: I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that strongly impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed from a quality blood test. And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can get additional information about how your body and your nervous system work, your immune system in ways that can inform better health choices. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there is that you don't any information about what to do with the data that you get. InsideTracker solves that problem. They have a very easy to use dashboard.[0:06:41] Andrew Huberman: So when you get your numbers back, It can direct you towards specific nutrition, supplementation, or lifestyle changes that you can make in order to bring the numbers for given Hormones, metabolic factors, immune factors into the range that's ideal for you.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's supported by 25 peer reviewed published studies and benefits from over 600,005 star reviews.[0:07:18] Andrew Huberman: There is now a plethora of scientific data pointing to the fact that a regular meditation practice is immensely beneficial for Reducing anxiety, improving sleep, improving focus, many, many other aspects of mental and physical health. The challenge many people have, however, is maintaining a regular meditation practice, and indeed, I am one of those people. I've been meditating on and off for about 30 years, And I confess a lot of times, it's more off than on. Until a few years ago when I started using the Headspace app, and then I found it very easy, and I continue to find it to maintain a daily meditation practice, and that's because Headspace has many meditations to select from. So even if I only have 5 minutes or 15 minutes, I'm able to do a meditation.[0:07:59] Andrew Huberman: I really enjoy those meditations, and I always see the benefits of those meditations. In fact, if I just miss a couple of days, I start to notice that I'm not doing as well As when I'm meditating regularly, the Headspace app makes it exceedingly easy to meditate regularly. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/ Special offer. And if you do that, you'll get a free 1 month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation. That's the best offer they have right now.[0:08:24] Andrew Huberman: So, again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer today. And now my conversation with doctor David Buss. David, delighted to be here. I've, followed your work for a number of years, and I'm excited to ask you a number of questions about These super interesting topics about how people select mates, how, they lie, cheat, and, but also behave well in the this dance that we call make choice.[0:08:53] Dr. David Buss: Yes. Yeah. Fortunately, there are there are, well behaving humans in the in the mix here.[0:08:58] Andrew Huberman: Good to know. Just to start off, perhaps you could just orient us a little bit, about mate Choice. You know, some of the primary criteria that studies show men and women use in order to select mates, Both, should we call them transient mates as well as, lifetime mates.[0:09:22] Dr. David Buss: Right. Well, that's a critical distinction because what people look For in a long term committed mateship like a marriage partner or a long term romantic relationship is different from what people look for in a in a hookup or casual sex or 1 night stand or even a brief affair. So, so that's actually critical. Wonder if we could maybe just back up a second and just talk a little bit about the theoretical framework for understanding mate choice. Sure.[0:09:49] Dr. David Buss: So, it basically stems from Darwin's theory of sexual selection. And most people, when they think about evolution, they think about, cliches like survival of the fittest or nature red in tooth and claw. And Darwin noticed that there were phenomena that couldn't be explained by the so called survival selection. Things like the brilliant plumage of peacocks, sex differences like in, you know, stags, for example, have these massive antlers and the females of the species do not. And so he came up with a theory of sexual selection, which deals not with the evolution of characteristics due to their survival advantage, But rather due to their mating advantage.[0:10:30] Dr. David Buss: And he identified 2 causal processes by which mating advantage could occur. 1 is introsexual competition with the stereotype being 2 stags locking horns in combat, With the victor gaining sexual access to the female loser ambling off with a broken antler and dejected and low self esteem and Needing psychotherapy perhaps or or mate mate mate, value improvement therapy. And the logic was whatever qualities led to success in these same sex battles, those qualities get passed on in greater numbers. And so you see evolution, which has changed over time an increase in frequency of the characteristics associated with winning these, what Darwin called contest competition. And we know that the logic of that is more general now and involves things like in our species competing for position and status hierarchies.[0:11:24] Dr. David Buss: So, anyway, so intersexual competition is 1. But the 2nd most relevant to your question about mate choice is Preferential mate choice. That was the 2nd causal pathway, and the logic there is that if members of one sex Agree with one another. If there's some consensus about the qualities that are desired, then those of the opposite sex who possess the desired qualities or embody those desired qualities. They have a mating advantage.[0:11:52] Dr. David Buss: They get chosen. They get preferred. Those lacking desired qualities get banished, shunned, ignored, or in the modern environment become incels. And so the logic there is very Simple, but also very powerful, and that is that, whatever qualities are desired consensually desired, if there's some heritable basis to those, Then those increase in frequency over time. And so and in in the human case, these 2, causal processes of sexual selection are related to each other in that the preferences of the make preferences of 1 sex Basically, set the ground rules for competition in the opposite sex.[0:12:34] Dr. David Buss: So if, for example, hypothetically, women, preferred to mate with men who were able and willing to devote resources to them, then that would create competition among men to Claw their way, you know, and beat out other men in resource acquisition and then displaying that their willingness to commit that to a particular woman. And same with women, though. And this one of the interesting things about humans is that we have mutual mate choice, which is not true in all species. So and that is that it's not just a matter of, you know, you selecting someone to be your mate. They have to reciprocally select you.[0:13:13] Dr. David Buss: And so with mutual mate mate choice, we have both preferences, mate preferences that women have Anne made preferences that men have, and consequently competition among men for access to the most desirable women In competition among women for access to the most desirable man. So that's sort of a little bit of theoretical backdrop. So you asked, well, what are the qualities that men and women desire? And maybe we'll start with, long term mating and then shift to short term mating. And long term mating is is interesting In and of itself, in that it's very rare in the mammalian world.[0:13:56] Dr. David Buss: So there are more than 5,000 species of primates Of which, I'm sorry, more than 5,000 species of mammals of which we are 1. But, the percentage of mammals that have anything resembling, Like a pair bonded long term mating strategy, it's about 3 to 5%. It's extremely rare. And even our closest primate relatives, the chimpanzees, they don't have a long term mating strategy. They don't have anything resembling pair bonded mating.[0:14:25] Dr. David Buss: In in the chimps, the females come into estrus. Almost all the sexual activity occurs during the esterase phase. After that, males and females basically ignore each other, for the most part with some some exceptions. But with humans, you have the evolution of long term pair bonding, attachment, heavy, Male investment in offspring, a relatively concealed population. And so and so these are kind of unique aspects the human mating system.[0:14:55] Dr. David Buss: So, so to get to your question, so what what are the qualities? So the the the the best The the most large scale study that's been done is a study that I did a while back of 37 different cultures, and it's now been replicated by other researchers. But, Basically, what we found is 3 clusters of things. We found qualities that both men and women wanted in a long term mate. We found some qualities that were sex differentiated, where women preferred them more than men or men preferred them more than women.[0:15:29] Dr. David Buss: And then we found some attributes that were highly variable across cultures in whether people found these as Desirable or indispensable or irrelevant in a mate. And so I could give examples of each of these if that[0:15:44] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. That would be great. I I'd love to know, what some of the common themes were across these cultures in terms of what what's being sex maiden sexually selected for.[0:15:54] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. So so some of the things that were so if you talk about universal desire, so things that men and women share, there are things like intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction, and love, which is really kind of heartwarming because some people think that, love is a a recent Western invention by some European poets, but it turns out it's not true. You go to the Klangshan in Botswana, and they describe Pretty much the same experience as a falling on love as as we do, and even describe the distinction between this kind of infatuation stage of love and the Attachment phase where, you know, you you can't maintain this frenzy of infatuation and obsession for very long, 6 weeks, maybe 6 months at most. Otherwise, you can get nothing else done in your life. And[0:16:50] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Those are those dopamine circuits Firing at high frequency. Yes.[0:16:55] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. So so, so mutual attraction love, a good health, Dependability, emotional stability. Although there's a bit of a sex difference there with women preferring it a bit more than men. And and so, basically and and the and these may seem obvious. So no one wants a stupid, mean, Ugly disease ridden mate.[0:17:20] Dr. David Buss: And so perhaps obvious, but, but no one knew this in advance of the 37 culture study. So these were some universal preferences. So you go to the Zulu tribe in South Africa or, you know, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil or, Portugal or Oslo, or anywhere in the world, and these are qualities that people universally desire in long term mates. Sex differences. So sex differences basically fell into 2 clusters.[0:17:53] Dr. David Buss: So women more than men prioritized Good earning capacity, slightly older age, and the qualities associated with resource acquisition. So the these are things like a man's social status. Does he have drive? Is he ambitious? Does he have a good long term resource trajectory is one way that I like to phrase it, because women often they don't look at necessarily, the resources that a guy possesses at this moment, but what is his trajectory?[0:18:30] Andrew Huberman: And so Just sorry to interrupt, but may I ask, is there anything known about the commonalities of how that is assessed. You know, is it, you know, he's rolling out of bed early and, Running 8 miles, he's showing proficiency in school. He handles himself well socially at parties, isn't drinking too much, but knows when, You know? I mean, obviously, they're integrating multiple cues. The brain is a complex place, but it, is there any information about What those variables are, across cultures?[0:19:04] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Well, I think that, one of the things that we do know across cultures is that women attend to the Attention structure. So, the attention structure is a key determinant of status. So those people who are high in status are those to whom the most people Pay the most attention.[0:19:26] Andrew Huberman: So the attention of others to them, not how well a a given potential mate pay can focus and pay attention necessarily. Yes.[0:19:33] Dr. David Buss: Uh-huh. Exactly. And But but, but women look. I mean, you know, is the guy even in the modern environment, is the guy spending 8 hours a day playing video games, eating Cheetos and drinking beer, or is he devoting effort to his professional development? So hard work, Ambition, does he have clear goals, or is he in an existential crisis not knowing what he's gonna do with his life?[0:20:02] Dr. David Buss: So those are some of the qualities that that that people look for. And, also, women use, what's called in literature, make choice copying. And this is related in part to the attention structure that is guys who have, past the filters of multiple women, those are, like, Preapproved. Preapproved, man. So we've done studies where you just take a guy, photograph him alone, versus Take the same guy, put an attractive woman next to him, or put 2 women next to him, and women judge exactly the same guy to be much more attractive If there is if there are he's paired with women, then if then then if he's not.[0:20:47] Dr. David Buss: And so and some guys exploit this in the modern world by ring women to go with them on dates and so forth. Oh, this is my my sister, a former girlfriend, or whatever. So, but but but but you're correct in in in that women use multiple cues to assess these things, and they change over time. You know? So, you know, in in the modern environment, even things like the attention structure, Does this guy have a 1,000,000 Twitter Twitter followers or 3 Twitter followers?[0:21:23] Dr. David Buss: So, that is an index of the attention structure and, hence, The status of the guy within the broader community. So and and from an evolutionary perspective, it's reasonable that women would prioritize These qualities, because of the tremendous asymmetry in our reproductive biology, namely that fertilization occurs internally within women, Not within men. Women bear the the burdens of the 9 month pregnancy, which is metabolically expensive, as well as Creating opportunity costs in terms of mobility and and solving other tasks that people need to solve in the course of their lives. And so, one way to phrase that is that the costs of making a bad mate choice are much heavier for women When it comes to sexual behavior, certainly, because, it, and the the benefits correspondingly of making a wise made choice are higher for women in the sexual context. But as I said, we have mutual mate choice in our species.[0:22:28] Dr. David Buss: And so What do men value more than women? Physical attractiveness.[0:22:34] Andrew Huberman: They rank that as a more important criteria than do women about men? Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Consistently across cultures.[0:22:42] Dr. David Buss: Consistently. And it's not that women are are are, indifferent to it. So women do pay attention to a guy's physical appearance, his his fitness, and so forth. And guys are actually off base in Thinking that women prefer more muscular men than they actually do. So, like, in muscle magazines, these men with bulging Biceps and so forth, women don't find that especially very, but they do prioritize fit men, a good shoulder to hip ratio, and other qualities of physical appearance, As well as things like, cues to health.[0:23:17] Dr. David Buss: So in physical so physical appearance provides a wealth of information about A person's health status, but also provides for men a wealth of information about a woman's fertility, her reproductive value. Now not that men think about that consciously. I mean, you men don't walk down the street and see a woman and say, oh, I find her Attractive because I think she must be very fertile. Maybe a few weird people do that, but most men just it's like, they just find those cues attractive. And the cues are cues associated with youth and health because we know that youth is a very powerful cue to fertility and reproductive value.[0:23:57] Dr. David Buss: So men prioritize physical appearance. And in in the field of psychology, it used to well, I was taught when I was an undergraduate That you can't judge a book by its cover, that physical attractiveness was infinitely arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable, and and it's simply not true. We know now based on the last 20 years of scientific, studies that the cues that Men find attractive women are not at all arbitrary. There is some variation across cultures, like in relative plumpness versus thinness, but things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, a a low waist to hip ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, all these are qualities that are associated with youth and health And, hence, have have evolved to be part of our standards of attractiveness. And so and so it's not just that men are these superficial creatures who Evaluate women on the basis of appearance, there's there's an underlying logic to why they do so.[0:25:06] Dr. David Buss: And as I said, relative youth, this This age thing is one of the largest sex differences that you find in long term age selection with women preferring somewhat older men and Men preferring somewhat younger women.[0:25:19] Andrew Huberman: Is there a consistent age gap, through, to relate to that statement?[0:25:24] Dr. David Buss: Yes. There is. So the Age gap, though, depends on the age of the man. So, so we can document this. So in my studies, what we found is that men preferred women who were about 3 to 4 years younger than they were on average, and I'll qualify this in a second.[0:25:44] Dr. David Buss: Women preferred guys who are about and a half to four and a half years older than than they were. So there was a sex difference going in the opposite direction. But As men get older, they prefer women who are increasingly younger than they are. So one way to gauge this so there there Actual marriage statistics, and then there are expressed preferences, and both sexes kind of converge. So If you look at, you know, 1st marriage, 2nd marriage, 3rd marriage, as if people get divorced and remarried, Average age gap is, in America anyway, is 3 years at first marriage with the guys being older, 5 years at 2nd marriage and 8 years at 3rd marriage.[0:26:31] Dr. David Buss: So that is as men are getting older and getting The divorce and remarrying, they they are marrying women who are increasingly younger than they are. In terms of preferences, it's also expressed in preferences. So It doesn't go down. So so like a say, a 25 year old man would say prefer a woman who's 20 or in her early twenties. 35 year old man might prefer a woman who's in her late twenties or early thirties.[0:27:00] Dr. David Buss: 50 year old man might prefer a woman who's, say, 35 to 38. So so the the preferences do Go up, but the gap gets increasingly larger. And the reason that you don't see things like, why aren't men preferring women? So peak Fertility in humans is around age 24, 25. And so you you say, well, why aren't the 60 year old men Prioritizing 25 year old women.[0:27:28] Dr. David Buss: Well, as I mentioned, we have a it's a reciprocal mutual mate choice Phenomenon She[0:27:35] Andrew Huberman: constrains the equation.[0:27:36] Dr. David Buss: Well, she she constrains it, but also, marriage and long term mating are, things other than reproductive unions in the modern environment. That is there, you know, we we you're supposed to do things as a couple. And if you get too large an age gap, then essentially you're in different cultures. You know, you, you know, you grow up with different songs and and And and if the cultural gap gets too large, you don't understand each other. So so so there are constraints on that.[0:28:07] Dr. David Buss: But if you look at Context where there are no constraints of that sort. So historically, kings, emperors, despots, etcetera. And I'll give one more modern example. They basically prefer young, Fertile, attractive females. And if they have harems, they stock the harems with those and then circulate them out when they're 30 and so forth.[0:28:33] Dr. David Buss: And so So if you look at at marriage systems that are unconstrained, then the preferences are more likely to be revealed. Or Within cultures, that is if you look at men who are in a position to get what they want. So as Mick Jagger noted, you can't always get what you want, but you try sometimes, you're what you need.[0:28:54] Andrew Huberman: I hear that it that most of the time, he got what he needed. Right.[0:28:56] Dr. David Buss: Right. He he got what he wanted. Right. Yeah. And maybe what he needed, but he he was in a position.[0:29:03] Dr. David Buss: I don't know if he still is. He's in his seventies now. But he was in a position as was, let's say, Rod Stewart, to take another example, or Leonardo DiCaprio. If you were a male who's in a position where there are thousands of women potentially available to you and you can have your pick, Then you see that clearer expression for younger females. So there was a chart that was floating around the Internet of the The girlfriends of Leonardo Leonardo DiCaprio as he got older you know, so he's getting older and older, and the graph of the age of the his girlfriends, it basically stayed the same.[0:29:40] Dr. David Buss: It was in the early early twenties or so. He values consistency. He values consistency. But So, so so anyway, the the data converge on that. So these are universal sex differences in, long term mate selection.[0:29:57] Dr. David Buss: So now when we shift to oh, oh, and I should mention cultural variability, because that's a critical thing. Because there is in my 37 culture study, What I found was the preference for virginity that has no prior sexual experience, that was the most variable, desire across cultures. So you had cultures like, at the time of the study, China. It was basically indispensable that a partner be a virgin. And then at the other end, you have Sweden where Sweden Swedes typically place Close to 0 value on it, and some even find it undesirable.[0:30:37] Dr. David Buss: Like, you're weird if you're a virgin. And so you they have this whole spectrum.[0:30:42] Andrew Huberman: This is, virginity in the female, or is this also this is not in in China, was it preference that the male and the female be reversed?[0:30:49] Dr. David Buss: Okay. Yeah.[0:30:50] Andrew Huberman: It's a mutual makes A selection Yeah.[0:30:51] Dr. David Buss: It was a preference for both sexes.[0:30:53] Andrew Huberman: Interesting.[0:30:54] Dr. David Buss: But it's a good question because where there was a sex difference, it was always in the direction of Males preferring virginity more than females. And we've gone back to China. So I still do research in China among other places, and we've gone back and retested modern urban populations. And the importance of virginity has gone down In China, especially in the urban areas, and the sex difference that didn't exist before has now emerged where males value up more than females. I think part of it was in previous times, you hit you hit ceiling effects, you know, where both sexes say, yeah.[0:31:33] Dr. David Buss: It's it's absolutely important to To be a virgin. So so there's cultural variation and cultural change over time in some of these qualities. But the sex differences that I described have remained invariant over the years. So since my 37 culture study, This has been replicated in in at least a couple other dozen different cultures, and, and we've gone back to some of the cultures. So I mean, so we've gone back to China, Brazil, and India, to look at cultural changes over time.[0:32:08] Dr. David Buss: And and there have been, You know, in some cases, dramatic cultural changes over time, but the sex differences that I described are invariant. They haven't changed a bit.[0:32:19] Andrew Huberman: I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about, truth telling and deception, because some of the measures that you're describing, age, for instance, one can potentially lie about. Right? I'm guessing that there are people who do that on online profiles and whatnot. From what I understand, people also lie about height and other features on online profiles, but some of them are much harder to hide. Right?[0:32:45] Andrew Huberman: Eventually, the truth comes out about some, if not all of these things. So if you would, Could you tell us about how men and women, leverage deception versus truth telling and communicating some of the things around mate choice Selection.[0:33:03] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Well, so the basically, the both men and women do deceive. So we have, The modern cultural invention of online dating, which, you know, was literally used 10 years ago and virtually absent 20 years ago, and people do lie, but they lie in predictable ways. They lie in ways that attempt to embody The make preferences of the person they're trying to attract. And so men do lie.[0:33:34] Dr. David Buss: They deceive about their Income, their status, so they exaggerate their income by about 20%. They they, they add They tack on about 2 inches to their height. So if they're 5 10, they round up to 6 feet. So they don't like, if they're Five ten, they don't say that they're gigantic, but they they kind of round it up in the more desirable direction. Women tend to deceive about weight.[0:34:00] Dr. David Buss: So they tend to shave about 15 pounds off of their reported weight, and both sexes post photos that are not Truly representative of what they actually look like. So they might post photos of, themselves when they were younger, or there are even advice, Tips on how to create the best selfie of the best angle that will maximally, you know, Enhance what you look like.[0:34:29] Andrew Huberman: Or or just doctoring of photos, I'm guessing. Oh, yeah.[0:34:32] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. Photoshop me. Absolutely. And and and one of the things, about it, now you say like, well, do people find out?[0:34:40] Dr. David Buss: Of course, people people do find out. I mean, I could just give you one story about a colleague of mine who was doing is a male who's doing Internet dating, and he picked only women who self describe as sevens on the one to 7 on attractiveness. So the most attractive so as self reported. And so and so I went out with this 1 woman, and she was missing her front teeth. And he he said, well, call me picky, but missing her front teeth, and she thinks she's, like, at the top of her drag was, He was a little, disappointed about that.[0:35:13] Dr. David Buss: And women, of course, are disappointed. They they meet a guy who they think is this physically fit, You know, athletic guy, and he comes up. He's, you know, £300 and overweight. So people people do find out. And And so and there are some Internet dating sites have, kind of vetting of the accuracy of something.[0:35:36] Dr. David Buss: So some things you can look up through public records. And does this guy have a criminal record, for example? Is he is he on a, you know, a sexual, offender's website? So so there's some things you can verify, but what I tell people is you you really have to meet the person and interact. You know, because the be be in part because of the deception, but also because what happens with Internet dating is that the the photograph Tends to overwhelm all the other cues, and all the other cues are written statements.[0:36:12] Dr. David Buss: And we weren't really evolved to process written statements, But we were evolved to respond to physical cues, but And men tend to attend to the visual cues much more than women. So women in their mate selection, They have olfactory cues to what does the guy sound like, his vocal qualities, that's, Auditory cues, but olfactory cues, what does he smell like? And so women have a more acute sense of smell than men do. And, and so if the guy doesn't smell right, even if he embodies all the other qualities women want, that's a deal breaker. And and so I encourage people just, you know, stop with the 100 text back and forth or messaging and Meet a person for a cup of coffee and interact, and then you'll, you know, you'll get a more accurate beat on the person.[0:37:09] Dr. David Buss: And then, of course, some qualities you can't assess even with a with a half hour interaction. You could tell a lot, but things like emotional stability are things that have to be assessed over time. And so one of the things that I advise people to do, And I'm not in the advice giving business, but people ask me all the time. If they find out what I study, they say, well, I got this problem. Can you give me advice?[0:37:34] Dr. David Buss: But But one of the things to assess things like emotional stability, which is absolutely critical in long term mating, is to do something like go on a trip together, Take take a vacation, where you're even in a unfamiliar environment where you're you have to cope with things that you're not familiar with and, as opposed to, an environment where it's very predictable and and so you you get a greater exposure because one of the One of the hallmarks of emotional instability is, how they respond to stress. So emotionally unstable people tend to have a long latency to return to baseline after a stressful event. And so this is the sort of information you can't get on a coffee date. You know? You can only get by assessing it over time.[0:38:26] Andrew Huberman: Somebody whose laboratory studies stress and tools to combat stress, I'd that's great. It's yet more incentive for people to develop, self regulatory mechanisms, for themselves. I'm guessing many of the, features of deception in this context, were present long before Internet dating. And so is it it's somewhat dark to think about, but is, is deception built in to this Dance that we call mate selection, and has it been built in for a long time? Or is this, or is this something that you think has emerged More as people, are approaching each other through these electronic, web based mediums.[0:39:07] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. I I mean, some forms of deception have been there, for a long time over human evolutionary history. So one form of deception which we haven't mentioned is Deception about whether you're interested in a long term committed relationship or a short term hookup. And so there's deception about that, especially on the part of men. So men who are interested like on Tinder, it has been reported, although Tinder denies this, there's been reported that something like 30% of the men on Tinder are Either married or in long term committed relationships, and they're looking for something on the side.[0:39:44] Dr. David Buss: But, the, in terms of successfully attracting a mate, the over display that, hey. I'm interested in just short term hookah, I'm interested in sex, so I wanna have sex right now. Let's just go back to my apartment. These are very ineffective tactics. And so effective tactics for men are often displaying cues to long term interest.[0:40:08] Dr. David Buss: And so And, of course, that's effective for a woman who's seeking a long term interest. And so and so that's a deception. So we find in our studies of that men tend to exaggerate the depths of their feelings for a woman, exaggerate How similar they are and how aligned they are in their values and religious orientations and political values and so forth. And so and and and so I think there's deception around that, and I think that's probably an evolutionarily A recurrent form of deception that women have defenses against, by the way. But I think that modern Internet dating Opens the door for certain types of deception that were, at at a minimum, were difficult to accomplish ancestrally.[0:40:56] Dr. David Buss: So, like, things like photoshopping, you know, you know, wasn't available back then. Plus, we evolved on the context of small group living where You not only had your own personal observations of someone's qualities, you had also the your your relatives, your friends, allies, The social reputation that someone had. And this is these are all critical sources of information that are Less available in modern environments because, you know, people migrate, they move from place to place, they can Close down 1 Internet profile and put up another, or they could have 6 going simultaneously. So there so the modern environment opens Up the door for forms of deception that weren't available or weren't available to the same degree, ancestrally.[0:41:52] Andrew Huberman: I see. Very interesting. Would you mind touching on some of the the features that, are selected for in terms of, sex sexual partner choice. We talked a little bit about, mate choice. But, in terms of sexual partner choice, are there is there are there any good studies exploring what people are selecting for, or is it, That they are both just in a state of of, pure hypothalamic drive, you know, a neuroscientist after all.[0:42:23] Dr. David Buss: Yeah.[0:42:24] Andrew Huberman: And, and therefore, it's hard to recreate it in the laboratory.[0:42:27] Dr. David Buss: Well well, no. No. We we do know something about that, and we know, something about how the preferences for a Sex partner differ from preference for long term mate. There is overlap, of course, but, one thing is, physical appearance. So physical appearance for women is important in long term mating, not as important as it is for men, but it becomes more important in short term mating.[0:42:54] Dr. David Buss: And so is the guy good looking? So those physical attributes are more important for women. They are they remain important for men, physical appearance, in short term mating, but with the Footnote that men are willing to drop their standards in short term mating, if it's low commitment, low risk, just Sex, you know, without entangling commitments. Women are more likely to prioritize, what I call bad boy qualities. So guys who are Very self confident, guys who are, strut, guys who are a little arrogant, guys who are risk taking, Guys who defy conventions, women are more attracted to those guys in short term mating than long term mating.[0:43:53] Dr. David Buss: And whereas in long term mating, they go more for the good dad qualities. Is this guy dependable? Is he gonna be a good father to my children? And then also, in short term, mating women use that mate copying heuristic. That is, if there are thousands of other women who find them attractive, women find them attractive.[0:44:16] Dr. David Buss: And so that's why you have the groupie phenomenon. So so with the rock Stars, for example. There are thousands of screaming women, all of whom wanna sleep with this famous rock star, and they use that as information. They find If you took, like, a still photo of some of these rock stars and asked women how attractive the guy is versus Tell him he's a famous rock star and showed the thousands of women screaming, at him. The they judge him entirely differently in terms of his, Attractiveness.[0:44:48] Dr. David Buss: So so or even and and this is this is an important point That women's attraction to men is more context specific and varies more across contexts than Men's attraction to women. And so I'll give you just an example of that. This is a a female colleague of mine went to a conference, an academic conference, and she Found the organizer of this conference to be really attractive and and and then saw him 6 months later and Wondered, well, what was I thinking? He doesn't seem very attractive at all. And what it was is, when he was the organizer, he was at the center of the attention structure.[0:45:26] Dr. David Buss: You know, he he was the guy up on stage directing everybody, and everyone was attending to him. And then when he was just a normal presenter at a conference, he wasn't didn't command the attention structure like he did in that when he was the organizer. And so this is just an illustration of how, circumstance dependent women's attract made attraction is for guys. It depends on, you know, His his status, the number of, women that are attracted to him, the attention structure, is he how how he interacts with a puppy Or or a baby, if he's ignoring a baby in distress or positively interacting with a young child, all these things were whereas for men, it it almost doesn't matter. You know, context is more irrelevant.[0:46:15] Dr. David Buss: They're honing in on The specific psychophysical cues that the woman is displaying and context be damned.[0:46:23] Andrew Huberman: Very interesting. Let's talk about infidelity, in committed relationships. What are some of the consistent, findings around, reasons for and maybe even, long term consequences of Infidelity for men and women. And and Yeah. This could be marriage or or long term partnership or Yeah.[0:46:47] Andrew Huberman: You know, infidelity of any kind, I suppose.[0:46:49] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. So well I'm guessing[0:46:50] Andrew Huberman: it does happen.[0:46:51] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well well,[0:46:52] Andrew Huberman: that's How frequent is it?[0:46:54] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. That's that's the interesting thing. Well well, How frequent it is is difficult to gauge because, it's the the one of the forms of human conduct that people like to keep secret. So so if you go back, now, say, 70 years to the classic Kinsey studies, the questions about infidelity were the questions that most people refused to answer and when the question was brought up, caused more people to drop out of the study. And so that kind of tells you something that I mean, what what do people conceal?[0:47:28] Dr. David Buss: You know, infidelity, incest, murder. You know, there is a small A handful of things that people universally wanna conceal, and infidelity is one of them. So but people do it. And so Kinsey estimated 26 Percent of married women committed an infidelity at some point during their marriage in about 50% of men. Other studies have given lower figures.[0:47:51] Dr. David Buss: And so the the the exact figures bounce around depending on, you know, anonymity provided and how comfortable they are with the interviewer and so forth. But[0:48:01] Andrew Huberman: And by infidelity, does that mean intercourse with somebody else?[0:48:04] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah.[0:48:04] Andrew Huberman: So we're not talking about quote, unquote emotional affairs. We're talking about[0:48:08] Dr. David Buss: This we're just[0:48:09] Andrew Huberman: sex Sex with somebody other than their committed partner Yes. Unbeknownst to their partner. Right.[0:48:13] Dr. David Buss: Right. And there are other forms of infidelity which we could get into, including emotional infidelity and financial infidelity. But here, we're just talking about, for the moment, sexual infidelity. And the interesting thing about sexual infidelity is that the sexes really differ fundamentally in the motives for committing infidelity. So for men, the primary motive and these are on average sex differences.[0:48:43] Dr. David Buss: So whenever I talk about sex, I'm talking about on average sex differences because There's overlap in the distributions and and, but so these are generalizations of which there are exceptions. So, so for men, it's it's mainly a matter of sexual variety. So about 70% of the men, it's The opportunity presented itself. I was out of town, and I had this opportunity. So low risk, low cost, pursuit of sexual variety, sexual novelty is a key motivation for men.[0:49:16] Dr. David Buss: Sorry to interrupt.[0:49:17] Andrew Huberman: I just want so 70% of men that cheat, That's the, primary, cause, or is it that 70% of men do cheat?[0:49:26] Dr. David Buss: No. No. No. No. 70 of the men who cheat, 70%.[0:49:29] Dr. David Buss: Thank you for that clarification. Of the men who do cheat 70%, cite that as the key motive. The key reason why they come in in an infidel.[0:49:39] Andrew Huberman: Sort of like why mountain climbers climb mountains because they're there.[0:49:41] Dr. David Buss: Right. Right. Because they're there if they well, you know, the comedian, I think it was[0:49:50] Andrew Huberman: and Or or how, how available their password on their phone is to their partner.[0:49:55] Dr. David Buss: Right. Right. Yeah. So but and that's an exaggeration. But but but if you look at women, this just desire for pure novelty, sexual variety is much less of a a motive.[0:50:11] Dr. David Buss: But women who have affairs cite that they're unhappy with their primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, or sexually unhappy and typically both. And this may seem like totally obvious that well, of course, people, if they're unhappy in the relationship, are more likely to stray, But in fact, it's not true for men. So if you compare men who are happy with their marriage and men who are not happy with their marriage, there's no difference in their infidelity rates. And I think it goes down to that issue of, you know, motive for seeking variety. So now why do women do it?[0:50:50] Dr. David Buss: Because it's it's a risky endeavor. She risks her long term mate or losing long term mate. It's risky in terms of reputational damage For both sexes. So it's a risky thing. Why do women do it?[0:51:05] Dr. David Buss: And there are 2 competing hypotheses, at least 2, but there are 2 primary competing hypotheses in the evolutionary literature. 1 is called the dual mating strategy hypothesis, where Women are seeking to get resources and investment from 1 guy and good genes from another guy. So in prince and in principle, that that can that can work. And I initially this isn't wasn't hypothesis original with me. This is, Steve Gangistead, Randy Thornhill, and some others of, Marty Hazleton, a former student of mine, have advocated this dual mating strategy hypothesis.[0:51:41] Dr. David Buss: And, originally, I was, In endorsed it because the data seemed to support it. We can get into which data seemed to support it. But over time, I became more and more dubious about this hypothesis and instead have advocated what I call the mate switching hypothesis. And so if you look at, a whole host of information around why women have affairs, It's not compatible with the dual mating strategy hypothesis. So and is compatible with the mate switching.[0:52:14] Dr. David Buss: That is women who are looking to, either divest themselves from an existing mateship, or, trade up in the mating market to a mate who's more compatible with them or higher in mate value or simply see whether they're Sufficiently desirable so that it eases the transition into the mating pool or keep keeping a mate as a potential backup Mate what I call mate insurance. If you have car insurance, if something bad happens to your car, house house house insurance, We also have made insurance, you know, keeping someone 1 woman said, men are like soup. You always wanna have 1 on the back burner. So Interesting. Whether that that's the best, analogy or not, I'm not sure, but, but it kind of captures something about about why.[0:53:08] Dr. David Buss: So So, well, what evidence am I talking about? Well, for one thing, women who have affairs, and this is about 70% of them,[0:53:16] Andrew Huberman: They So many again, sorry. Just I wanna make sure people[0:53:18] Dr. David Buss: Of the women of the women who have it affairs. Women who have it fear. So let's say ballpark Kinsey was, Let's say roughly right, 25, 26% of women will have affairs. Let's just assume that he's right. And we don't know exactly.[0:53:33] Dr. David Buss: But of the women who do have affairs, about 70% say they have fallen in love with their affair partner. They become deeply emotionally involved with their affair partner. And to me, if you're just trying to get good genes from a guy, That is the last thing you wanna do is fall in love with them or get emotionally involved, but it's very compatible if you wanna switch mates. And so the, so that's sort of, that's that's one piece of evidence that suggests that women, the the the mate switching function of infidelity is a more likely explanation. Now these 2 are not inherently incompatible hypotheses.[0:54:15] Dr. David Buss: In other words, It's possible that some women do pursue a dual mating strategy hypothesis, but there's other evidence That suggests so for example, what are the actual rates of genetic cuckoldry? Well, in the modern environment anyway, They're pretty low. It turns out they're like 2 to 3%.[0:54:34] Andrew Huberman: Could you just explain for the audience what genetic culture is?[0:54:37] Dr. David Buss: So this is where where The woman where where the man believes he is the genetic father of a child, but it turns out he's not. Might be the mailman or the next door neighbor or the guy She's having an affair with. So, mistaken paternity, and genetic cockle tree is just one way to Capture[0:54:59] Andrew Huberman: Named after the cuckoo bird. Right?[0:55:01] Dr. David Buss: Named after the cuckoo bird.[0:55:02] Andrew Huberman: Yes. Who sneaks its eggs into the nest of the other, rolls, Destroys the the future offspring of the Right. Bird and then basically offloads all the work onto another Right. Father.[0:55:13] Dr. David Buss: Parasitizes, yeah, the parental investment of, different bird species. So, So so anyway, so I think that and there's other sources of evidence that I think point so so one of the sources of evidence that Initially seemed to support the dual mating strategy hypothesis was ovulation shifts. So in other words, it looked like from the early studies that when women are ovulating, these are among non pill taking women, non women not on hormonal contraceptives, that they experienced a preference shift toward more men who were masculine and symmetrical, which were hypothesized Markers for good genes, and and there's an explanation for that. But it turns out the effects of ovulation on women's mate preferences are Far weaker than than the initial studies looked like. And in fact, some larger scale studies have failed to replicate them entirely.[0:56:13] Dr. David Buss: And so it's, that was one of the key source of evidence, these ovulation shifts that women were going after the genes because It's only when she's ovulating and she can get pregnant by having sex with another man that it would make sense for her to have sex with another man. And there was even some early evidence that women were timing their affairs, timing sex with their affair partners to coincide with when they were ovulating. But but as I said, some of these subsequent studies have failed to replicate these early findings calling into question the dual mating strategy Notion. And so so I think I've I've shifted my views on this, and and now endorse, the mate switching hypothesis says a more likely explanation for why most women have affairs. The way you describe this, makes me wonder if When of the[0:57:08] Andrew Huberman: women that have affairs, do those affairs tend to be more long lasting than the affairs that men have? Because the way you described it is, Men are, seizing an opportunity to sort of a carpe diem type approach to infidelity, and women, potentially, on average, are, capitalizing on something that is longer term. Now, of course, if they're doing this, around ovulation, then it would constrain the amount of times they would need to see or sex with the the the, this other person that they're not married to. But, is there any evidence that women have more ongoing affairs than men men have Trans more transient affairs.[0:57:44] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. There there is. And so if you look at people who have affairs, there's a sex difference there So that women tend to have affairs with 1 person and become emotionally involved with that 1 person over time. Men tend to who have affairs Tend to have affairs with a larger number of affair partners, and so which then by definition can't be long ass.[0:58:07] Dr. David Buss: You can't have Long term affairs with 6 different partners.[0:58:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Unless he's, juggling multiple, phone accounts or[0:58:14] Dr. David Buss: something. Right. Right. Right. And some men try to do that, but, I think it's a could be very taxing.[0:58:21] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Well and and in this day and age, it's, it's Easier to meet more people by virtue of online communications, but it's also easier to get caught, meaning it's harder to conceal, interactions, everything's in the cloud anyway. A good friend of mine who's, former very high level in special operations said, Anything that's not in your head and only in your head is available for others to[0:58:45] Dr. David Buss: Yes.[0:58:45] Andrew Huberman: To find should they want it.[0:58:46] Dr. David Buss: Yeah.[0:58:46] Andrew Huberman: I think that's and I think that's largely true.[0:58:49] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. And and yeah. So, and fun information, text messages, and people are very good at hacking into their partners' funds, computers. And then also there are video cameras everywhere. So so, sneaking off to this, a quiet restaurant, I mean, there are probably 8 video cameras that Can record you walking in and out of that restaurant.[0:59:11] Andrew Huberman: Everything can be found. Yes. I'm certain of that. You mentioned emotional affairs and Financial infidelity as well. Yes.[0:59:20] Andrew Huberman: I I had a girlfriend once who, as a early date discussion, said, not that I get the impression that, you are, but I want to be very clear. She said that you are not emotionally, Physically or financially tied to any other women. And I thought it was very interesting that now you bring up a financial infidelity. She's, quite happily partnered now and, not with me, but, but it's interesting. It's the 1st time I heard anyone spell it out that way as a list, almost like specific aims in a grant.[0:59:52] Andrew Huberman: What is emotional infidelity? What is financial infidelity? Yeah.[0:59:55] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Well, this is a very smart woman to tap[0:59:58] Andrew Huberman: into all 3. NDG is.[1:00:00] Dr. David Buss: So, and I assumed you you were you gave honest responses to all of those 3 questions.[1:00:05] Andrew Huberman: As I recall, I did. But as we now know, that they're, well, you can ask her at some point.[1:00:10] Dr. David Buss: Right. Right. Okay. You are informed. And there is self deception in the service of deception that is another issue.[1:00:17] Dr. David Buss: So Emotional infidelity is basically, exactly what it sounds like. It's it's falling in love with someone else, becoming psychologically close to someone else, Sharing intimate, or private information with someone else. That's what I mean by emotional infidelity. And, one of the hallmarks of this study done by a former student of mine, Barry Cooley, is very clever, I thought. He Analyze there used to be this reality TV show called Cheaters where they would hire detectives, and They would when the detective would, like, say, follow someone to a hotel room, they'd call up the partner and, say, your husband just walked into the hotel room, with someone else, do you would you like to come down to the hotel and confront him?[1:01:04] Dr. David Buss: And certain percentage of people would confront. And what he analyzed so he analyzed all these episodes of this show called Cheaters, and what he examined was the verbal interrogations when people confronted their partners. And when men confronted their partners, the first question they wanna know is, did you fuck him? Women, their first question was, do you love her? And so this kind of captures that difference between the sexual infidelity and emotional infidelity, also kind of captures another sex difference when it comes to sexual jealousy, you know, where men tend to be more focused on The sexual components of the infidelity because those are what, compromise his paternity He has certainty that he's actual actually the genetic father of whatever, offspring ensue.[1:01:58] Dr. David Buss: Whereas, Love is a cue to, do you love her? That's a cue that he's gonna leave you, the woman, for Another woman, is a cue that to the long term loss of that investment and commitment from that partner. And so and so the sexes seem to differ, in which, aspects of the infidelity with women more Attuned to more upset by the emotional infidelity, meant more by the sexual infidelity. Now financial infidelity has been explored much less, but In in in my new book, When Men Behave Badly, I have a section on financial infidelity where I summarize all the research that has been done. And I was kind of flabbergasted by the percentage of people who do things like have credit cards that their spouse doesn't know about, Keep secret bank accounts, have the credit card bills mailed to their office rather than their home, have, Basically, resources and expenditures of pooled resources that they keep from their partner, and both sexes do it.[1:03:06] Dr. David Buss: And and the percentages vary, from study to study, but they range from, like, 30 to 60% of all people who are Keeping financial information from their from their spouse in one way or another could be the woman's out buying designer purses or designer handbags. It could be the guys out, going to strip clubs or taking his affair partner to, restaurants and doesn't want those charges to show up on, you know, a jointly held credit card. So financial infidelity is critical. And then even things like diverting pooled resources to one set of genetic relatives versus another set is another thing that people Tend to keep secret. So there are forms of financial infidelity, as well.[1:03:56] Dr. David Buss: So, yeah, infidelity, You're absolutely it's a great question because it shouldn't be confined to sexual infidelity, which is what most people think about, but also emotional and financial. Interestingly, if you ask people, what do you mean what what is infidelity, in a marriage? Men tend to say, well, it's obvious as she has had sex with someone else. That's infidelity. Whereas women are more likely to have a broader definition of infidelity.[1:04:27] Dr. David Buss: They will cite things like emotional infidelity, financial infidelity As part of the definition, whereas men have that more narrow definition. Interesting.[1:04:36] Andrew Huberman: I have a a good friend who's a, couple's Counselor, a clinical psychologist, and, she told me something interesting that relates to this, which is that, in cases of infidelity, oftentimes, the Some of the arguments, between couples boil down to whether or not contraception was used or not. That becomes a a key Feature, and she always, thought that that was, you know, home homing in on a a detail, which, of course, is an important detail as it relates to both, Paternity issues and pregnancy, but also disease. Right? But, as we're talking about all this, it it makes it, makes me think that, this may have deeper evolutionary roots in our, fur further down in the brain as we say in Yeah.[1:05:19] Dr. David Buss: Neuroscience literature. And and, Yeah. And, I mean, using a condom versus not using a condom, not using as a more intimate act In a way, you are literally physically more intimate with someone else, than if you do use a condom. So, you know, but whether it's, whether evolutionary roots to this, I I don't know. I mean, condoms are probably Relatively recent and, or at least a widespread use of them are relatively recent in, evolutionary time, so I doubt we have specifically for them.[1:05:53] Andrew Huberman: No. And presumably before condoms that and one can only speculate because as we say, with when it comes to, behavior, There's rarely a fossil record, but sometimes there is. It would be, the withdrawal method of of contraception, which a good friend of mine who studies, whose laboratory works on reproductive biology says the reason, that's a poor choice of contraception is because it was designed not to[1:06:15] Dr. David Buss: work. Yes.[1:06:17] Andrew Huberman: So note note to those of, trying to avoid unwanted pregnancy. So we talked a little bit about status in terms of what Men and women are selecting for, for different types of relationships. Is there anything else about status that that you find particularly interesting and, You know, what men are finding attractive besides these, you know, waist to hip ratios and, Quality of potential mothers, and so forth. Are there any kind of hidden gems in the literature around this that I might not have heard of? Well yeah.[1:06:53] Andrew Huberman: So, you mean among, you know, things like sex differences and what leads to high status? Or or For instance, or what, or perhaps things that, are surprising in terms of what people are selecting for. Do people even know what they're selecting for? This is or is this all subconscious? Any and all of the those topics are of interest to me.[1:07:15] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. So, well, to take them in reverse order, You know, I think a lot of it is conscious, but some of it is certainly unconscious, where there are elements, which are totally unconscious. So, I mentioned 1 earlier where a man looks at a woman. He's not he's aware that he's attracted to her and attracted to her physical appearance, but he might not be aware of why. You know, we didn't evolve to be aware of why.[1:07:40] Dr. David Buss: Just like with food preferences, we we find certain things delectable and other things, nauseating. We we don't understand the adaptive logic of why our food preferences exist and why we have them. The same is true of mating. You know? And so, men find women with with a low waist tip ratio attractive, but they might not the the they almost rarely rarely will they know, oh, low waste waist ratio is actually associated with higher fertility, Lower endocrinological problems, lower age, etcetera.[1:08:20] Dr. David Buss: So So we we're sometimes aware of what we want, but we are unaware of why we want it. Uh-huh. So, so I think there are unconscious elements that The whole topic of status and what leads to high status on low status is a topic I'm currently investigating. Published a couple scientific articles on it. And, so but maybe we'll hold off on that for a a future discussion, but but it inter it intersects I'll mention 1, It intersects with mating in in interesting ways, and that higher status gives people the ability To choose from a wider pool of potential mates than they would if they have low status.[1:09:05] Dr. David Buss: And so one of the reasons that people strive for status is because they have access to more desirable mates. Conversely, having desirable mates endows you with higher status. And so if you have if you're a male, you have a very, Attractive, woman on your arm that leads to high status. And so there's a reciprocal link between status and mating in that way. And there have been studies where you You say say they pose a, kind of a unattractive guy, older unattractive guy and a stunningly beautiful woman, As as a girlfriend, and they say, well, what what what what's this guy all about?[1:09:46] Dr. David Buss: And they say, oh, he must be very high in status. He must be very wealthy. He must, Have a lot going for them, you know, whereas the reverse, people don't make the same, attributions. And so, and so there is an interesting reciprocal link between status and mating success, where mating success leads to high status, and high status leads to more mating[1:10:10] Andrew Huberman: Sass. So over and over again, there are these instances that you describe where the assessment of potential mate sexual or long term partnership Or, being made in the contents of of good statistical practices, looking at the choices of others as a readout of your own choices. I keep this seems to be a theme that this is not being made in a very narrow context, but paying attention to what other people are paying attention to seems to come up again and again. Slightly off center from that, but still paying attention to what other people are paying attention to. What's known about jealousy In men versus women, and, how frequent it is, how intense it is, and what people do with that jealousy.[1:10:52] Andrew Huberman: I mean, we hear Or I've heard at some point that, a large fraction of homicides are the the consequence of jealous lovers. That's the darkest angle of all this, but, in evolutionary psychology context, what is jealousy? Does it relate to paternity issues only? What can you tell us about[1:11:14] Dr. David Buss: jealousy? So well, answer is a great set of questions. And and when I first started Studying jealousy, I reviewed all the prior publications on jealousy. And at that time, jealousy was regarded as, A sign of immaturity, a sign of insecurity, a sign of a neurosis or Pathology or in some cases, delusion. And what I argued, is, and do argue is that jealousy see is an evolved emotion that serves several adaptive functions.[1:11:51] Dr. David Buss: Okay? One of which you mentioned is is a paternity certainty function. But, but to to back up a second, basically, once you have the evolution of long term mating, long term pair bonds, you're talking about, From a male perspective, investing a tremendous amount of resources in a woman and her children over years or decades, even with Boomerang Kids now, it may even go more than 2 decades. Boomerang Kids. Yeah.[1:12:19] Dr. David Buss: Kids kids who leave home and then come back and Live at home because they happens? Because they oh, yeah. Oh, that happens.[1:12:25] Andrew Huberman: Children, so I I[1:12:26] Dr. David Buss: I don't know. No. It's a big thing.[1:12:28] Andrew Huberman: But if I do, I'll just expect that they'll come back at some point.[1:12:31] Dr. David Buss: I'll come back because they they can't find a job or they find it cheaper to live at the parents' house or whatever.[1:12:37] Andrew Huberman: Oh, goodness. I can't think of anything worse. I mean, I love my parents, but[1:12:41] Dr. David Buss: I know. I know. I get it. I can't imagine, but, but it happens. And it's happening more and more in given the current economic situation.[1:12:49] Dr. David Buss: Okay. But So, once you have long term mating, you need a, a defense to prevent or preserve the investment that you've made and are making in long term mateship. And so jealousy serves this, mate guarding function, if you will, or mate retention function. So in other words, one way of phrasing this is that We know that there there are affairs. We know that people break up.[1:13:16] Dr. David Buss: They get divorced. But people have adaptations To wanna hold on to their mates. Okay? And that's what jealousy is important about. And so jealousy gets activated when there are threats To that romantic relationship, there are other forms of jealousy like sibling jealousy and so forth, but we're focusing on mating jealousy, in this context.[1:13:38] Dr. David Buss: So, now what's interesting is that the threats to an ongoing valued romantic relationship come from many sources. So it could be you detect cues to your partner's infidelity, or Cues, of a a lack of of an emotional distance between you and your partner. You you say I love you to your partner, And your partner says, oh, I wonder how the how the Knicks are doing this scoring season or whatever. If you get an unreciprocated I love you as A bad cube.[1:14:11] Andrew Huberman: Or a half or some people are so tuned to this. If there's a half millisecond delay Right. They can detect delays and responses.[1:14:18] Dr. David Buss: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Delays in responses. But even things like so that's one set of cues.[1:14:25] Dr. David Buss: But then there's another set of interested mate poachers. So, you know, if you're mated to someone who's desirable, which many people are, other people still desire them. And so sometimes try to poach them or We're them away from you for a short term sexual encounter or for a longer term relationship. And so we have to be so jealousy motivates People to be attentive to potential mate poachers in their environment. But even more subtle things like, mate value discrepancies Can trigger jealousy.[1:14:58] Dr. David Buss: So even if there are no mate poachers and no accused infidelity, if, A mate value discrepancy opens up in a relationship. So in the American system, like you're a 6 or an 8 or a 10, and people generally pair off based on similarity and mate value.[1:15:15] Andrew Huberman: So That tends to happen. Sixes end up with sixes. Sevens end up with sixes. Plus or minus 1. Yeah.[1:15:20] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. Right?[1:15:30] Dr. David Buss: Colloquially, people say things like, he's not good enough for you, you know, or I think you you could do better, to people who implicitly have a notion of relative mate value and discrepancies therein. Hey. But discrepancies can Open up where none previously existed. So you get fired from a job all of a sudden, you know, and most people are Very understanding and forgiving about that if it's not too long. But you go 6 months, 8 months, people start Having problems or if someone's career takes off.[1:16:03] Dr. David Buss: Let's say a woman becomes a famous singer or actress or or or Amanda's, career takes off. All of a sudden, there's a mate value discrepancy where you have access to a larger pool of potential mates and higher mate value potential mates. So So people are attentive to mate value discrepancies, and so jealousy can get activated even if there are no immediate threats to a relationship. But the the mate value discrepancy is a threat that looms on the horizon of the relationship because we know statistically, The higher mate value person is more likely to have an affair and is more likely to dump the other person and trade up in the mating market.[1:16:46] Andrew Huberman: And and when people find new partners for long term relationships, do they tend to trade up?[1:16:52] Dr. David Buss: On average, yes, if the if the discrepancy is sufficiently large. So so there are costs associated with breaking up, you know, divorcing, example, I mean, is it emotionally, financially? It's a costly thing. And so if you have, Like a half a point mate value discrepancy, you're not gonna see a lot of breakups. But, you know, if you have larger mate value discrepancies, that's gonna augur More for trading up in the mating market.[1:17:22] Dr. David Buss: So but so then then you get into So what jealousy is, it's an emotion that gets activated by these circumstances. And then what people do about it depends on What their options are, and people do things that I, in my published scientific work, I say range from vigilance to violence. So there's whole spectrum of things. In fact, I've identified 19 different tactics that people use To deal with problems once they get jealous, and one is increased vigilance. And the other is[1:17:56] Andrew Huberman: Vigilance for the behavior of the mate.[1:17:59] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Visuals for the behavior of the maid, and and that can include, stalking, following, hacking into iPhones or or computers, Monitoring the behavior of mate poachers, looking at eye contact between other men and your partner. There's a whole suite of things that, you know, is involved in in vigilance. Stream, and we can talk about things in between, but the other extreme is violence. And so in my new book, When Men Behave Badly, have a whole chapter on intimate partner violence, and this is, what I argue, and this is really unfortunate.[1:18:39] Dr. David Buss: And I I'm not endorsing. It's illegal. It's bad. Don't do it. But people engage in intimate partner violence.[1:18:47] Dr. David Buss: In America, something like 28 to 30% of all people who are married will experience intimate partner violence in their in their relationships. So it's not a trivial percentage.[1:18:59] Andrew Huberman: And that violence is between the 2 partners?[1:19:01] Dr. David Buss: Between the 2 partners. Yes. There's also violence that gets directed to our potential mate poachers, but that's that's a somewhat separate Issue. Okay. But one of the things that is functional about the violence is that it tends to reduce Perceived mate value discrepancies.[1:19:20] Dr. David Buss: So in other words, I say it's a guys tend to engage in the violence more than women do, although some argue that there's more Equality in the violence, but, at a minimum, men tend to do more damage when they do the violence.[1:19:34] Andrew Huberman: And and when you're talking about violence, is this ever emotional violence? I mean Yeah.[1:19:38] Dr. David Buss: There there's that as well. And in fact, the 2 tend to be correlated. So in my studies of married couples, Verbal violence is a good predictor of physical violence happening as well. So one thing that'll happen, just to Give a concrete example. Guys will start insulting their partner's appearance.[1:19:57] Dr. David Buss: You're you're really looking ugly today. Your your thighs are heavy. You're, You know, you know, not looking very good, so they try to denigrate the woman's appearance, which is a key component of woman's mate value.[1:20:08] Andrew Huberman: So they're trying to Adjust more closely the mate value discrepancy.[1:20:12] Dr. David Buss: They're trying to reduce her perceived self perceived mate value. So if if, let's say, he's a 6, she's an 8, and he can convince her that she's actually only a 6, then she's gonna be more likely to stay with them. Very diabolical. It's terribly diabolical. But the fact is women don't feel good about themselves, when they get beaten up, by their partner.[1:20:39] Dr. David Buss: In fact, In in the cases where it leaves physical evidence, you know, women wear sunglasses or turtlenecks or cover up the The the bruises is is is it literally does lower the mate value of the woman by, injuring her physical appearance.[1:20:55] Andrew Huberman: And getting her to conceal herself, stay home[1:20:57] Dr. David Buss: Yeah.[1:20:58] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Etcetera. Yeah. She's taking her out of the the, literally, reducing her visibility.[1:21:03] Dr. David Buss: Right. And and that's actually one of the predictors of violence is if he starts doing things other than violence, like cutting off her Relationships with her friends and her family trying to sequester her, and prevent her from getting exposed to potential other Other other partners. And so it it is, very diabolical, but I think important to understand, you know, the the potential functionality, of the of intimate partner violence.[1:21:32] Andrew Huberman: So What about a sorry to interrupt again, but I'm just so curious. So oftentimes, my audience will say, Yeah. Interrupt too often, but I wanna make sure that I don't miss an opportunity to ask you about the intimate partner violence in the other direction, female to male, where, Stereotypically speaking, the the opportunity for physical violence is still there, but the the idea in mind is that, it would be more of a psychological nature. Although, I think there is evidence that that some women beat their husbands. Yeah.[1:21:59] Andrew Huberman: But it I'm guessing it's not as frequent, or am I[1:22:03] Dr. David Buss: Well well, different studies. So it depends on whether you just simply count up acts, or whether you look at the damage that's done. K. And and as I mentioned, men tend to do more physical damage. So there are shelters for battered women all over the country.[1:22:19] Dr. David Buss: As far as I know, there's one for battered men. Now it may be, and this is partly true, that men, are more ashamed if they get beaten by their partner, clocked with a frying pan. And, it's possible, and there's evidence that police don't take it as seriously. So there's 1 case that I report in my book where a guy, called the police, and his wife had clocked him with something. And, police shows up, and he says, if she so much as broke a fingernail in this altercation, they'll charge you and not her.[1:22:53] Dr. David Buss: And so there's a there is a a police bias, a potential police bias in this. And so may be underreporting of women beating up men as a consequence. K. But The motivations are often different. So one is that male sexual jealousy will trigger him to attack His partner, and then she will use physical violence to defend herself.[1:23:23] Dr. David Buss: So she might pick up an, Frying pan or, you know, or or or a weapon of some sort to defend herself. And so the motivation is his sexual jealousy on his part, but self defense on her part. And so that accounts for some unknown percentage of the cases. And in some cases, it is Women who were outraged when they discover their partner has been having sex with someone else, and then fidelity, of a sexual, financial, or emotional nature. And so there is some female to male violence that absolutely occurs.[1:23:58] Dr. David Buss: But the the Reduction of a perceived mate value discrepancy is a key function from male perspective. Now, again, not that he thinks about this. He's just angry and wants to hurt her. Okay? K.[1:24:12] Dr. David Buss: But but here here's one other thing that is really interesting about The intimate partner violence, and that's the specificity of it depending on circumstances. And, namely, when the woman gets pregnant, She's more vulnerable to physical violence. And when the man suspects that he's not the father of that pregnancy, He's more likely to direct the violence toward blows to her abdomen. K? It's that's that's specific.[1:24:42] Dr. David Buss: And so in that case, the function is is hypothesized function is to terminate the pregnancy by a rival male, as opposed to deterring the woman from committing an infidelity or from leaving the relationship entirely. So that's why one function of indium or part of violence is is just sequestering the woman and keeping her all to himself. So it it's both to prevent infidelity and to prevent defection.[1:25:10] Andrew Huberman: I have a a friend, who Wife told me, that if she if he cheats, I'll kill him. That's what she said. But it's actually just much easier to keep him very, very busy. And, and that statement now leaps To mind because, of what you're describing, that there are many tactics by which people can engage this effort to reduce the mate value discrepancy, not all of which They're overtly violent. Yeah.[1:25:41] Andrew Huberman: But some are but all of which are designed to constrain their behavior.[1:25:45] Dr. David Buss: Right. Right. Yeah. These were so these would fall under what I would call mate retention tactics. And only 1 or 2 of which, fall under the violence category.[1:25:56] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. There are even, yeah, within partner psychological manipulations about these things. So there are psychological manipulations about Perceived mate value, you know, no one else would want you. You know, you're you're Yeah. Loser, there's denigration of partner within the relationship, even feigning anger to make the partner feel guilty about, Say looking at someone else.[1:26:25] Dr. David Buss: So, so there's all all kinds of, internecine warfare that goes on within relationships to Manipulate perceptions of these thing. This is I'm creating a much too jaded view of romance and love, I think.[1:26:38] Andrew Huberman: Oh, no. I we we will get the the the happy endings and and I mean, there are certainly many happy relationships out there. I oh, you know, as a neuroscientist, I hear about this and and the, immediacy of of, how people, you know, fall into a a pattern of jealousy or a A pattern of cheating and not always, but and and I it just speaks to a brain circuitry that's evolved to protect something. And, I'm sure this statement is, not exhaustive, but I think it's accurate to say that every species, but, especially humans, wants to make More of itself and protect its young. But these issues of paternity and, resource allocation, I mean, I think they're vital.[1:27:19] Andrew Huberman: And, you know, I look forward to a day where Evolutionary psychology and neuroscience are, can merge at the level of of underlying mechanism, but I I don't think it's, dark. I think it's just the the way we're wired At some level. Speaking of dark, could you tell us about the dark triad?[1:27:36] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. So the dark triad so we've been talking about Sex differences on average, but they're critical within sex, individual differences. And the dark triad is one of the most important ones. The dark triad consists of 3 personality characteristics. So narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.[1:27:56] Dr. David Buss: Hallmarks of narcissism are things like grandiosity. Person thinks that they're more intelligent, more Attractive, more dazzling, more charming than they actually are. I think they're the greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, with narcissism, you also get a Sense of entitlement. So they feel entitled to a larger share of the pie, whether that be the financial pie, the status pie, or the sexual I, Machiavellianism, is high scores tend to pursue an exploitative social strategy.[1:28:33] Dr. David Buss: So they might feign cooperation, but then cheat, you know, on subsequent moves. They view other people as Plans to be manipulated for their own instrumental gains. And then psychopathy, one of the hallmarks of psychopathy is a a lack of empathy. So most people have a normal empathy circuit where if a child falls down and gets hurt, we feel compassion for the harm that that Person is undergoing or if a a puppy gets, hit by a car or whatever, we feel compassion. Psychopaths don't.[1:29:08] Dr. David Buss: Though that is those high on this it's a dimensional thing. It's not a categorical, thing. So those high on psychopathy, basically, lack empathy. And so if you combine these qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, and machin machinvanism, You you have, well, some very bad dudes. And I say bad dudes because men tend to score higher in these things than women, Especially on the psychopathy dimension.[1:29:36] Dr. David Buss: So when you talk about clinical levels of psychopathy, it's estimated to be something like 1% of women and about 4% of of men. So men, are much higher on that. So Why is this important? Well, it's important in the mating context because, those who are high on dark triad traits tend to be Uh-uh. Sexual deceivers, for 1.[1:30:02] Dr. David Buss: So they're very often very charming, very good at seducing women and then abandoning them, Sometimes with, after fleecing them or or draining their bank account, they're very good at, at the art of seduction, they are also tend to be sexual harassers, Serial sexual harassers and sexual coercers. So when it comes to forms of sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend to be perpetrators of this. And so like most men, I think, would be, find it ethically abhorrent to sexually harass a woman in the workplace. Dark triad guys, in part, maybe they feel entitled To it. And and and in part, they do.[1:30:52] Dr. David Buss: I mean, in some cases that I report in the book, there are like literal descriptions where the guys are writing in these journals. Oh, I knew she was Attracted to me. You know, that's why she she met me in the, Xerox room just when I was there because she wanted to admire my bulging biceps or Whatever.[1:31:10] Andrew Huberman: It's all about them.[1:31:11] Dr. David Buss: They yeah. And they they they and this gets into a bias that I talk about, which is the the male sexual misperception bias, Where woman smiles at a man, man thinks, oh, she's she wants my body. She's attracted to me. And women are thinking, oh, I'm just being friendly. I'm being Polite or professional, but these guys, high dark tri guys, are more susceptible to the, sexual over perception bias, and they literally believe that the woman is attracted to them and sending them Signals green light, to sexually approach.[1:31:47] Dr. David Buss: And so if you combine dark dark triad traits with The dispositional pursuit of a short term mating strategy, that's an especially deadly combination. That's when you get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. So these these are very bad dudes, also, predictors of intimate partner violence.[1:32:07] Andrew Huberman: What what Approximate frequency in the male population are these, have all 3 of the dark triad traits, and I realized that they're on a continuum Yeah. That's what that's that's why you can't say it.[1:32:18] Dr. David Buss: Because they are on a continuum, and it's sort of arbitrary where you where you draw the line. But but I think it's a It's a minority of men. It's a subset of men who commit the vast majority of these acts of sexual violence. And that's why It's not like if you if you look at victims of sexual violence, they're more numerous than the traitors of sexual violence because the perpetrators tend to be serial offenders, so to speak. 1 guy in the workplace harassing 15 different women.[1:32:49] Dr. David Buss: 1 guy sexually coercing, you know, multiple women. So that's why you have, like, in well known cases in the news like Harvey Weinstein, You know, probably over a 100 different women, Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, some of these, more famous cases, these are A large number of victims, but pretty much souls, you know, perpetrators. And and there's no question that these guys, Like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein were definitely high on dark triad traits. Mhmm.[1:33:24] Andrew Huberman: You mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe we could just talk about, some of the Less known features about stalking. I I think I once heard you give a lecture where you said that, one of the scariest things about stalking is that sometimes it works.[1:33:42] Dr. David Buss: Yes. Yeah. So well, stalking, has multiple motivations. But one of the most frequent motivations is a mating motivation where either the, there's a breakup and the woman dumps the guy and the guy doesn't Wanna get dumped. He wants to maintain a relationship with her.[1:34:04] Dr. David Buss: And I should say that in when it comes to criminal stalking, there's a huge sex difference. About 80% of Stalkers tend to be men, about 20% women. So there's so there are women stalkers, but they're, you know, about a fourth the number compared to to men. So the motivation of the guys tends to be either an attempt to get back together with the woman, Either sexually or in a relationship or and or to interfere with her future Mating prospects. And it works in in some of the time in two senses.[1:34:44] Dr. David Buss: One is It does interfere with her attempts to remade. So, in fact, it scares off some guys. So, like, you Show up and pick up a woman at her apartment for a date, and her her ex is sitting out there glaring at you.[1:35:00] Andrew Huberman: Or, and I, I'm actually familiar with the circumstance where early in a relationship, somebody mentions that an ex has made, veiled threats about surveillance, for instance.[1:35:11] Dr. David Buss: Yes.[1:35:12] Andrew Huberman: I've I've actually had that happen several times in my dating history where someone would say, You know, you start opening up about previous relationships a little bit as it's appropriate, and someone says, yeah. You know, he mentioned that he was gonna, You know, send someone around to, you know, to surveil me, you know, that kind of thing, which is a very interesting, factoid to pick up in, But I heard it enough times, and people I know have reported hearing this enough times that I I'm guessing that that's Probably more frequent than people actually trailing people in cars and things of that sort. But planting that it's like the psychological seed of surveillance is is a form of of harassment in some sense.[1:35:52] Dr. David Buss: Yes. Absolutely. I think that you're right. I mean, there's that planting the psychological seeds, but then also with surveillance, some surveyors remain hidden, so you don't know necessarily.[1:36:04] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I confess. In this case, it did not act as a deterrent for continuing the relationship.[1:36:09] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. But[1:36:09] Andrew Huberman: that's, but that's another story. So, so how often do women respond I have to put this in quotes, for those that are listening, air quotes, end quotes, positively to stock. I mean, how often does it work to, resecure the partner After they've been broken away.[1:36:27] Dr. David Buss: So in our in our studies, it's a minority of cases that it works to, reestablish. I think something like 15% of the time that it works either to temporarily reestablish a sexual relationship or lure the woman back in For a more permanent relationship. So most of the time, it doesn't work. But, 1 woman in our study said, The guy, every time she went out with another guy, he would threaten the other guy. And she said after about 6 months, There were no other guys.[1:37:02] Dr. David Buss: He basically scared off all the other guys, and so she went back to him because there were no other guys around.[1:37:07] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I I Experienced this when, I was in college. I lived in a small town, very population dense, Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. And there was a couple where every time, this woman would date someone, he'd basically beat up whoever the new suitor was. And pretty soon, no one would go near them.[1:37:25] Andrew Huberman: They got is the kind of Sid and Nancy couple. And indeed it worked. It worked in the sense that, no one dared go near her, and they ended up together. So I so I've I've seen real life examples of this.[1:37:38] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. So so it happens, but but it is it is, in general, not a not a successful[1:37:44] Andrew Huberman: Oh, no. And it's not what I'm suggesting. I was just shocked to learn that because we hear stalking, and we we have this, there's one very extreme image of it. But the underlying motivations, I think, are Or, reveal something about, mating dynamics.[1:37:57] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. And and I think that the circumstances are often a mate value discrepancy where The guy realizes correctly that he will be unable to replace her with a mate of equivalent mate value, or or in some cases, any mate. You know, it's like, well, she she was with me once. Maybe she'll I can get her back with me again. So, so the psychology is very understandable, but, but it tends it tends not to work because I And another thing we found, we did a study of 2,500 victims of stalking.[1:38:34] Dr. David Buss: This is with Josh Dumply, a former student of mine who's now a professor in the criminology department. And what we found is there were large sex differ large differences between the stalker and the victim of the stalker, where Where the stalker tends to be much lower in mate value, than the victim. And so, basically, the it's typically the woman who realizes She can do a lot better on the mating market, and the guy realizes, I am never gonna be able to replace her, with a with a woman of equivalent mate value. And so I'm gonna use this last ditch desperate measure to try to get her back, And occasionally, it works.[1:39:16] Andrew Huberman: I'm thinking more about this mate, mate value, Thing, this this this number, this metric, the 8, 10, 6, whatever it is, and mate value discrepancy playing such a Strong role in all in all these dynamics. I should have asked this earlier, but what is the impact on, mate value, perceived or real, of a woman having already had children. You know, for instance, they're, friends of mine who are married and divorced, who have children, will often post pictures of themselves with their children in their online profiles because it shows a A strong sense of paternal instinct, you know, there's the puppy thing, people with dogs or puppies that Demonstrating care a a capacity to care and and for caretaking. In women, the the the opposite is also true. Women with children showed capacity.[1:40:11] Andrew Huberman: It it Demonstrates fertility, at least at at one point, perhaps still, fertility that's still present. Does it Positively, negatively, or neutrally impact a woman to already have children when seeking a another mate, regardless of whether She was married or had the the children out of wedlock.[1:40:29] Dr. David Buss: As a general rule, it decreases her mate value because kids with another mate are viewed as a cost, Not not a benefit. And there are cost on multiple dimensions, one of which, they're gonna be a cost to the guy, because he's gonna have to invest resources, time, attention, so forth, but also a portion of her Effort and resources are gonna be devoted toward kids who are not genetically related to him, and which is one reason why stepfamilies, There's often a lot of conflict within stepfamilies, very explicable from an evolutionary perspective. In just so in general, it's a cost, not a benefit. Sometimes it can be a benefit, though. So and I I know one case where a woman got divorced.[1:41:12] Dr. David Buss: She had 2 kids, and she ended up successfully mating with a guy who was also divorced And had primary custody of his 2 kids. And so there was a compatibility there. But as a general rule, it will decrease a woman's And the man's mate value to have kids, especially kids who are financially who are young and financially dependent. But What happens is, let's say the woman would be an 8 without kids. A guy who's a 6 might be able to attract her, and might feel lucky, to attract her because there's no way he would have been able to attract her under other conditions.[1:41:52] Dr. David Buss: But, that's why the display of effort investing in her kids is often a mating tactic. He's showing, okay. I'm willing to invest in In kids, I'm willing to sacrifice, and so they, in essence, become equivalent in mate value, as a result of that. But, will she be able to attract on average, you know, other eights? Less likely.[1:42:16] Dr. David Buss: But the same is true of guys. And this is why the the the the reason that affects women more than men is because more custody tends to go With women, that is the kids women tend to have greater custody, and women tend to invest more in the kids, throughout their lives. Now there are other things like alimony and child support payments and so forth, but, All all the women I've talked to I had a talk to 1 on 1 on 1 with many women about this. They view a guy with kids As a cost, not a benefit. Unless the kids are old enough and they've left home and are no fine no longer financially dependent.[1:42:55] Andrew Huberman: And everything you just described, is consistent with the with what you said earlier, which is that with subsequent marriages or as men get older, the tendency is to, seek mates that are progressively younger.[1:43:08] Dr. David Buss: Right.[1:43:08] Andrew Huberman: Right? Because there's a higher, lower probability they'll already have children If they're if they're much younger.[1:43:14] Dr. David Buss: Right. Right. And they're and and if the guy is successful, if he has status and resources and has other qualities associated with higher mate Then he will remain attractive to younger women.[1:43:26] Andrew Huberman: I realize it's not your specific area of expertise, but these days, there's a lot of discussion about how Early childhood attachment to parents influences make choice later on, this, kind of general categorization of avoidant and Anxious and anxious avoidant and all this kind of thing. And, again, putting my hat on as a neuroscientist, I think, you know, it It makes sense that the neural circuits for for attachment, in childhood would be somehow, Partially or in whole, repurposed for other forms of attachment. We don't just tend to say, okay. That brain circuitry was for when I was a kid, and now I'm an adult, and so I'll develop this new attachment I'm guessing it evolves and and whatnot. But, is there anything interesting about, that About childhood attachment strategies vis a vis stability of long term partner choice, or is that too big of a leap for us to make here?[1:44:21] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Well, I mean, I can offer some sort of informed speculation about it. And and as you point, it's not my my area of expertise, but I know A little bit about it. And, I mean, I think that, you know, secure attachment style, if both partners have a secure attachment style, that's conducive to a long term mateship. Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend to with intimacy and also higher probability of infidelity, and, anxious attachment style, I I don't know.[1:44:57] Dr. David Buss: Can, create problems of its own, you know, in the overly clingy, dependent, you know, absorbing, what what I call high relationship load. So, you know, there's, like, mutation load, which we all have certain number of mutations. There's, you know, parasite load. There's also what I call relationship load. So what is the baggage that someone brings to the relationship?[1:45:19] Dr. David Buss: And then[1:45:20] Andrew Huberman: Probably correlated with the Frequency of demand of immediate text message responses. Right. Well, I think the the frequency of demand like, the the latent the Expected low latency of text message responses Yes. Plays out, consistently in relationships. You know, early on, there's a very low expectation of response, and then as people get attached, Depending on their level of anxiety, if they don't hear back from somebody really quickly, where the mind goes is a is a very interesting aspect.[1:45:46] Andrew Huberman: You know? Or do you become suspicious? Do you become anxious? Can you stabilize your own internal milieu, or do you or do you need to see the dot dot dot that's coming back? I'd love to see a study on that at some point.[1:45:57] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. No. That's a good one. And and I my intuition suggests that your prediction about that would would pan out.[1:46:03] Dr. David Buss: It would be the the insecure that would really be, you know, getting upset if there were if there were not that immediate response to the text.[1:46:11] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I have a friend, a female friend who, deliberately, quote, unquote, using her language, trains her, potential partners to be comfortable with a variable response latency. But then I asked her if she's comfortable With a variable response late, and she said, absolutely not. So, there's an asymmetry. Yeah.[1:46:31] Andrew Huberman: At least in that case. This is almost certainly a more rare circumstance, but, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about unconventional relationships. These days, I don't think it's just by virtue of living in California. You hear more and more about, monogamish As opposed to monogamous, and various forms of polyamory that may Yeah. Or may not include the amory part.[1:47:00] Andrew Huberman: Per you know, passes in permission, based on, season, circumstance, and, prior infidelities. Like, Okay. Somebody had a mishap early on. You know, you have one, pass, so to speak. Or Right.[1:47:15] Andrew Huberman: And you hear this kind of language getting thrown around. And Yeah. And it's intriguing to me because it it seems like an an effort to, bypass some of the more, If you will, hardwired or at least culturally hardwired aspects of mate choice and sexual partner choice. Yeah. You know, acknowledging jealousy, but confronting it by allowing your partner to be with somebody else, for instance.[1:47:39] Andrew Huberman: I I confess I have friends who have Conventional relationships. I have friends with conventional relationships. Any thoughts on the polyamory? Or[1:47:48] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. I do have a couple thoughts on it. I haven't studied it Extensively, but, I think that the way I would phrase it is that there's an attempt to overcome, certain evolved features of our mating psychology, but often in the service of other aspects of our mating psychology. So what I mean by that is this.[1:48:13] Dr. David Buss: So talk about polyamory. First of all, there's a sex difference, on an on average, that is men are more likely to want to initiate a polyamorous relationship than women. There are lots of exceptions, and I actually know of, at least 1 exception. Personally, friends friends of mine who are in a polyamorous relationship. But The motivation for men is that evolved desire for sexual variety.[1:48:38] Dr. David Buss: So, you know, it gives him access to Wider variety of sex partners, which is part of our evolved sexual psychology, especially for men. Women, One motivation now women also have a desire for sexual variety. On average, tends not to be as great as that of men, but also have it. But some women Agree to a polyamorous relationship as a mate retention tactic. That is, this guy, In order to keep him, she has to agree to the relationship.[1:49:10] Dr. David Buss: And so and so the motivations for engaging in polyamory are somewhat Sex differentiated.[1:49:16] Andrew Huberman: On average.[1:49:17] Dr. David Buss: On average. On average. There is lots of exceptions. So now when it comes to sexual jealousy, There is this recognition that there and in my the way that I would frame it, there's this evolved emotion where we, it triggers sexual jealousy, seeing your partner having sex We're imagining your partner having sex or be falling in love with someone else. And but interestingly and there haven't been studies on this, but I know of this one Polyamorous couple where they reported to me, both of them reported to me.[1:49:46] Dr. David Buss: She said she doesn't But it doesn't bother her at all if her husband, they're married, has sex with other women. She they allow it. I think it's like every Thursday night or whatever. They have the Different couples have different rules. But one time she saw him walking down the street hand in hand affectionately with a former girlfriend, And she got extremely jealous.[1:50:08] Dr. David Buss: So because it signaled an emotional connection. So the sexual didn't bother her, the emotional did. She happened to be bisexual, and she, and her partner said that he it really upset him when she slept with other men, But it was fine if she slept with other woman women.[1:50:26] Andrew Huberman: I think that's a fairly common thing that I'd among the men that I know that are in polyamorous relationships that Yeah. That's a fairly common statement.[1:50:33] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. And so he kept trying to in the the these internecine, manipulations trying to encourage her to sleep with other women, But not with men. And in her case, encouraging him not to get emotionally involved with other women, but the sex was okay. So I think that, You know, I think that in the modern environment, you know, we we have a very rich and complicated evolved mating psychology. And what we're doing in these Novel forms are semi novel because these things have a pretty deep history themselves, that we we're we're attempting to maximize some of our evolved desires while men while keeping quiescent other evolved Aspects of our sexual psychology like jealousy.[1:51:21] Dr. David Buss: So satisfying our desire for sexual variety, but keeping jealousy at bay. And different couples do it in different ways. So as you as you alluded to. So I know 1 couple where live in Los Angeles, and the woman From the woman said, she gives her husband permission to have an affair, sleep with other women as long as it's outside of the city limits of LA. You know?[1:51:42] Dr. David Buss: And this other couple, it's has to be Thursday night. You know? And so different people have different names.[1:51:48] Andrew Huberman: Constraints on but the constraints are are are Specific and somewhat arbitrary to the relationship.[1:51:54] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. They're specific. And and and often in polyamorous relations, people Talk it out and and come to an agreement on what is acceptable and what's out of bounds. So, but but in a way, I mean, it it in a way, it's just, You know, we can't change our evolved sexual psychology, I don't think.[1:52:14] Dr. David Buss: What we can do is we can activate certain elements of it and keep others Quiescent. And, and and that and that's all good in a in a way we we do in the modern environment. So even to take it outside of polyamory, Pornography. K. Widely consumed Internet pornography.[1:52:33] Dr. David Buss: What what does that do? Well, there's a big sex Different there. Men tend to consume it a lot more than women. The forms of the pornography are are different. But in a way, the pornography, what it does is it Parasitized men's evolved desire for sexual variety so they can, in some in some sense, Psychologically experienced sexual does the variety of different women sexually without actually doing it by just looking at their computer screen.[1:53:01] Dr. David Buss: And so in a way, what you get another way of phrasing that is that we create modern novel cultural inventions in ways that Satisfy our evolved desires and our evolved sexual desires. Yeah. It's interesting[1:53:17] Andrew Huberman: with the, Kind of explosion of of online pornography. I have a colleague at Stanford, in psychiatry, Anna Lemke, who studies the dopamine system. And, she mentioned 2 things of interest. 1 is that, not only is there a tremendous variety of of, experiences that are available to people to view in pornography, but the The intensity is also quite high. So much so that at least for young people who are observing a lot of pornography, it's Possible, and there are studies looking at this now, that their brain circuits become wired to observing sexual acts as opposed to being engaged in them, which can be extremely problematic.[1:53:52] Dr. David Buss: Yeah.[1:53:53] Andrew Huberman: So it's a it's a sharp blade, so to speak. This pornography thing isn't what it once was, and it's evolving quickly. Very interesting. So how should one frame all this? So I I imagine a number of people listening are in relationships or or Would would hope to be in a relationship.[1:54:15] Andrew Huberman: You know, in terms of understanding what we are selecting for consciously or subconsciously, it seems like there are common themes. It's, people want to feel, attractive and attracted. People want to make sure that there's stability of the relationship. So when we hear about security, oftentimes, I think of this kind of warm oxytocin, serotonin, Like thing, but but this mate value thing seems so powerful in all this, assessing mate value. So How objective are people about assessing their own, value in terms of finding, securing, And over time, maintaining a relationship, securing is dynamic because people age at different rates.[1:54:59] Dr. David Buss: Right.[1:55:01] Andrew Huberman: Is there a, an objective metric of this stuff? I guess you get a lot of statistics about somebody's image, And you find come up with a vow an average value based on the population. But how should people assess themselves? Because it seems like one of the features that would be very powerful For leading to happiness, of good partner selection that's stable, where you one doesn't have to resort to these Machiavellian or Diabolical or any of these other strategies would be to be very honest with oneself. And, how does one do that?[1:55:36] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Great questions. And and I don't think that the science has all all the answers. So, a couple things. So one is that I think people are generally pretty good at self assessing mate value, and even, self esteem has been hypothesized to be 1 internal monitoring device that tracks Made value.[1:56:01] Dr. David Buss: So when we get a promotion at work or we get a rise in status, we feel an elevated sense of self esteem. We get fired. We get rejected. We get Ostracize, our self esteem plummets. So, so our self evaluation, I think, does track mate value to some extent.[1:56:19] Dr. David Buss: There are people who overestimate their mate value. People high on narcissism are particular in particular, and some people underestimate their mate value. Another important element is that there's consensual mate value. So that is if you asked a group of a 100 people, you know, fair amount of consensus that this person's an 8, that person's a 6. K?[1:56:42] Dr. David Buss: But there are also individual differences in mate value. So one example is I know a woman Who's a professor, and she places a high premium on guys who are deeply steeped in Russian literature, Which she is so that she can have in-depth conversations about Russian literature.[1:57:01] Andrew Huberman: Note to young men, learn Russian literature.[1:57:03] Dr. David Buss: Well well well but this is High and it's a dimension of mate value that's important for her, but probably not important for a lot of other people. And so Whereas other people, let's say, might be let's say you're into football or, or some sport, then, and another partner thinks sports are stupid, you know, then that's you know, someone who's also into sports is gonna be higher in mate value for you. There are these individual differences in components of mate which is good, because that means if everyone were going after the same People, and there was total consensus on mate value, then there would be a lot of, mateless people and a lot of problems in the world And a lot of dissatisfied people. So so, both are important. The consensual aspects and the Individually different differentiated components of of may value.[1:57:58] Dr. David Buss: But, in terms of Accuracy of assessment, it it's there are no no good measures scientifically to to do this because it's it's Sufficiently complicated. So I mentioned you know, we've mentioned maybe maybe a dozen different components of mate value. A physical attractiveness, kindness, emotional stability, health status, etcetera. And, and and these aren't the only ones. So, I teach a course On psychology of human mating, and I asked the people it's a large course, couple 100 people.[1:58:32] Dr. David Buss: Tell me, what do women want in a mate? And so I started with the blackboard. This is back in the old days when there was a blackboard, a piece of chalk. They say, I want a mate who has a good sense of humor. Sorry.[1:58:42] Dr. David Buss: Sense of humor. Intelligent. Right? You know, kind. And so I go through this, and I go through 5 blackboards, and then I run out of space Over what women want.[1:58:51] Dr. David Buss: Now I do the same for men, and men kinda run out of the space ever about a blackboard and a half. But but what that tells me is that These qualities are large in number and complicated in nature. So you say you want a guy who's nice and generous, They say, yeah. So like a guy who at the end of every month takes his whole paycheck and gives it to the the wino, homeless person. Well, no.[1:59:14] Dr. David Buss: Not that generous. You know, generous toward me, but not toward everyone else. Nice in general, but not so nice that they're getting exploited. So Or or even you know? Now there's something you you can't be too healthy.[1:59:29] Dr. David Buss: So if you put it, that's unidimensional. But you want a guy women want a guy who's confident, but not Too confident. You know? Because too confident will mean he's either arrogant, narcissistic, or not sufficiently manipulable. So I'm a so so anyway, so my point is that because there's so many different components of mate value and that they vary in, amount.[1:59:54] Dr. David Buss: So it's not just listing the qualities and summing them up. They vary in amount. It's a very complicated endeavor to assess accurately. But I think people have a good intuitive sense of people's relative mate value, especially if you've You're in a group and you've been able to interact with them for a long time. And one indication is, again, that attention structure.[2:00:17] Dr. David Buss: How many other people really wanna mate with this person? That's a good cue that they're high in mate value. Nobody wants to mate with you than the cue that you're low in mate value.[2:00:28] Andrew Huberman: Reminds me of the time when, one is trying to decide who to ask to the prom. You know, there's a there's a complicated assessment based on Who one would like to go with, whether or not you're already partnered, who would say yes, who would say no, because there's a there's a risk in rejection too. Because that, if I'm Guessing correctly would would could lower one's own perceived mate Yeah.[2:00:50] Dr. David Buss: Getting rejected.[2:00:51] Andrew Huberman: Right. Frequency of rejections[2:01:03] Dr. David Buss: mating anxiety, that is they they don't approach women because they risk getting shot down.[2:01:10] Andrew Huberman: They're trying to maintain that Number, in the by reducing the amount of data. Right.[2:01:16] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Very interesting. But it's but it it's it's, It backfires in the modern environment. So so there's a famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, who had mating anxiety, and he assigned himself the task of Approaching, asking like, I can't remember what the number was, but let's say, 50 women out on dates. He lived in New York City, so it was either a lot of women.[2:01:37] Andrew Huberman: He could just Stillman, they were streamed past. Yeah.[2:01:39] Dr. David Buss: And, and he assigned to, like, ask 50 women on a date, you know, every every week. And he said after 2 weeks, his mating anxiety disappeared because most of them said, buzz off creep. But he decided, oh, actually, getting rejected didn't cause my world to Collapse, and it actually was okay. And so he kind of inured himself to this rejection. And so, it ended up, ended up doing quite well on his mating life.[2:02:05] Andrew Huberman: Another point for cognitive behavioral desensitization.[2:02:07] Dr. David Buss: Yes. Exactly.[2:02:08] Andrew Huberman: He ran the experiment. Just a couple more questions. Earlier, you mentioned self deception based deception, and or something of that sort. Self deception, that people aren't always trying to convince somebody else of something that secretly they know isn't true, but that they deceive themselves. Yeah.[2:02:27] Andrew Huberman: Could you embellish on that a little bit?[2:02:28] Dr. David Buss: So well, this is actually the this hypothesis is, the famous evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers first advanced this hypothesis in The preface, 1976 to Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene, and and he subsequently written, written more about it, both in scientific article and in a more popular book. But the idea is that if, the core idea is that successful deception is facilitated by self deception. So if you really believe that in x, Then you're gonna be a more successful salesman to convince other people of x. So if you believe you're, let's say, a tenant made value, you truly believe it, Even if you're not, I'm gonna have a more successful time convincing you that that I am as well. And so the hypothesis is basically that people self deceive In order to, increase the effectiveness of of actual deception.[2:03:27] Dr. David Buss: K? But I think that there are people who are are are so so in one other dimension I'll mention too is that as that animals often take each at our own word for things. So if we're self confident, people assume that we must have the goods to back up that self confidence. If we're a quivering massive insecurity, people believe, well, we don't have the goods to back up anything. You know?[2:03:54] Dr. David Buss: And so people use Other people's displays of their self confidence as a cue to to their goods. And it's, in general, pretty reliable cue, but then there Overestimates and underestimates as we've talked about, like, with narcissism. Mhmm.[2:04:10] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. We see this with the job candidates. You know, you you You are taught to look very carefully at the application and consider all aspects, but, ultimately, you consider that also in light of, you know, how Firmly, someone believes in the vision of what they're trying to bring to the profession.[2:04:27] Dr. David Buss: Yeah.[2:04:27] Andrew Huberman: And, and that's a, I think, a largely a subconscious Process and being aware of it can be helpful. But, yeah, when somebody's confident, you tend to think that they're gonna get where they say they're gonna go. And it and it acts as a bit of a Of a heuristics for not needing the impulse is that one then doesn't need to go vet all the information quite as carefully. But if, I guess if one is aware of it, then, you know, to to dig deeper in, to because it seems like there's a lot of deception going on. Yeah.[2:04:54] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well and And, you know, and and something we talked about earlier, people high on psychopathy, are very good at, at deception, I don't know whether they are good at self deception or whether they're just really good deceivers. You know?[2:05:12] Dr. David Buss: So, But they can be very effective. And, out in California, you know, you you live out in California. I'm sure you've seen your fair share of, cases like that.[2:05:23] Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I think, into across today's discussion and the various examples popped to mind of of seeing These features in in humans, it's so interesting. I I find the work that you do incredibly interesting. I think this field of evolutionary psychology is Fascinating, and and, I hope, I'll get I said it before, but I'll say it again. I feel like neuroscience and evolutionary psychology are are nudging towards one another.[2:05:48] Andrew Huberman: Absolutely. Only a matter of time before, they merge in in some, formal way. I mean, there is the work, for instance, on polygamous is monogamous prairie voles and levels of vasopressin, but it's a big leap to go from vasopressin in a prairie vole. No disrespect to that beautiful work, but to humans and say, oh, vasopressin inhalers are going to make you monogamous or something. I think that's, I probably got the direction of the effect but you you get the point.[2:06:12] Dr. David Buss: Yeah. No. I think you're absolutely right. And and I think it it will happen. I think it's starting to happen, and it and it will happen because, Getting at the neuroscience is getting at the underlying mechanisms that are driving the process.[2:06:23] Dr. David Buss: So, you know, what an evolutionary perspective brings to bear is is Evolve function, and ultimate explanation, the selective forces that created adaptations, the functions of those adaptations, And the neuroscience brings, well, what is the underlying machinery that these mechanisms are instantiated in?[2:06:43] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. It would be wonderful to collaborate someday. Maybe we'll do a Brain imaging study on jealousy or something in, I don't know, and throw it. You're you're the psychologist. You would come up with a beautiful experimental design.[2:06:56] Andrew Huberman: I'm certain that people are going to want to learn more about your work. Certainly, we will give them links to your social media and other sites. You've written a tremendous number of really interesting books. Tell us about your most recent book and maybe some of the others that if people are interested in these topics, and they wanna learn more that they could, explore. Sure.[2:07:16] Dr. David Buss: Okay. So well, my most recent book is is Called, when men behave badly, the hidden roots of sexual deception, harassment, and assault. And that book deals with conflict between the sexes, Sexual conflict. And so it deals with them, both in what what what or, what I call mating market Conflicts, some of the topics we've been talking about, deception in Internet dating and things like that. Second is conflict that occurs within mating relationships Of the sort that we've been talking about as well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping with conflict Within a relationship and I actually have some suggestions for strategies for coping with conflict within a relationship, Coping in the after dealing with the aftermath of breakups.[2:08:05] Dr. David Buss: So often there's an asymmetry. 1 person wants to break up, the other doesn't. So I talk about coping in the aftermath. And then I also talk in this book, when men behave badly about some of the darker sides of human mating, like Intimate partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion. So that's what that book's about.[2:08:26] Dr. David Buss: And I think it, You know, it's gotten well reviewed, and people find it very useful in understanding what is otherwise a lot of baffling phenomena. You know, why do men and women seem at odds with each other in so many domains? Why do some of these recurrent forms of sexual conflict occur? So that's what that book's about. My previous book, so my my first book, which I've had the good fortune to be able to revise a couple times, deals more broadly with human mating strategies.[2:08:57] Dr. David Buss: It's called the evolution of desire strategies of human mating It gives people a broad overview of what people want in a mate, tactics of attraction, tactics of mate retention, and so forth throughout the whole mating process, serial mating, causes of divorce, and so forth. And then, even more broadly, I have a textbook called Evolutionary Psychology, The New Science of the Mind, which, is in its 6th edition Right now and this is the most widely used textbook in evolutionary psychology around, North America and Europe, and and and Actually, it's been translated even into Arabic and other countries. So that deals somewhat with mating, but also deals with survival problems are evolved fears and phobias, issues about kin and family, extended family, friendships, Social hierarchies, status hierarchies, warfare, and other topics. So the evolutionary psychology textbook is the broadest Book and then maybe the 2nd broadest is the evolution of desire strategies of human mind, mating. And then for those interested in Conflict Between the Sex is the latest book, When Men Behave Badly.[2:10:15] Andrew Huberman: Fantastic. I love your work. I I'm so grateful for the clarity and depth and rigor with which you do it, and you and you convey it to us. I know, I speak for many people when I I just wanna say thank you. This is a tremendously informative conversation.[2:10:32] Dr. David Buss: Thank you. It's been a delight to talk with you, and I hope we do engage in that, research collaboration of merging neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.[2:10:41] Andrew Huberman: Let's do it. Alright. Great. Thank you, David. Thank Thank you.[2:10:44] Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor David Buss.
