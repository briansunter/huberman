# The Science and Practice of Movement: A Conversation with Ido Portal

## Introduction

Movement is a fundamental aspect of human life, intricately tied to our nervous system. Nobel Prize winner Sherrington once said, "Movement is the final common path," highlighting the extensive role of the nervous system in generating a wide variety of movements. In this essay, we delve into the science and practice of movement through a conversation with Ido Portal, a world-renowned expert in movement.

## The Essence of Movement

Ido Portal defies formal definition, being both a practitioner and an intellectual of movement. He has studied various forms of martial arts, dance, gymnastics, and sports, and has trained top athletes like Conor McGregor. Portal emphasizes that movement is not just about physical activity but encompasses the movement of emotions, thoughts, and interactions in daily life.

### Movement vs. Movements

Portal distinguishes between "movement" with a capital M and "movements." Movements are the specific actions we perform, while movement is the broader concept that includes the content and context of these actions. He likens it to a cup of water, where the cup represents the movements and the water represents the essence of movement.

### The Body-Mind Connection

Portal asserts that we are not just a brain with a body but a body with a brain. This holistic view emphasizes the interconnectedness of our physical and mental states. Movement, in this context, serves as a bridge between the two, influencing and being influenced by both.

## The Practice of Movement

### Entry Points and Containers

Portal suggests that a movement practice can start from various entry points, such as the spine, the pelvis, or even playfulness. The key is to choose containers (specific movements) and fill them with meaningful content. This approach allows for a dynamic and evolving practice.

### The Role of Education

Education is crucial in a movement practice. It brings awareness to the fact that we live in a body that is constantly in motion. This awareness extends to our emotions and thoughts, helping us understand that everything is in flux.

### The Importance of Play

Playfulness is a significant aspect of movement. Portal encourages exploring different ways of moving, whether it's through walking in crowded streets without touching anyone or using everyday objects like a piece of floor or a wall for practice. This exploration helps keep the practice dynamic and engaging.

## Movement and Neuroscience

### The Premotor System

The premotor system in our brain is constantly generating potential movements, which are then executed by the motor system. This dynamic interplay allows for a wide range of movements and adaptations. Portal's practices often involve exploring these potential movements to enhance neuroplasticity.

### The Role of Vision

Vision plays a crucial role in movement. Portal discusses the importance of using both focused and panoramic vision in a movement practice. Focused vision helps with specific tasks, while panoramic vision enhances overall awareness and reaction times.

## Cultural and Social Aspects of Movement

### Movement Culture

Portal emphasizes the importance of engaging in movement practices with others. This dynamic interaction adds unpredictability and richness to the practice. He also highlights the value of touch and proximity, which are often neglected in modern society.

### The Impact of Specialization

Specialization in a particular sport or movement can lead to imbalances and limitations. Portal advocates for a more generalist approach, exploring a wide range of movements to enhance overall adaptability and resilience.

## Practical Applications

### Incorporating Movement into Daily Life

Portal suggests threading movement throughout the day rather than confining it to a specific time. This can be as simple as paying attention to how you get out of bed or incorporating dynamic movements into your existing exercise routine.

### The Value of Discomfort

Discomfort is a necessary part of growth in a movement practice. Portal encourages embracing challenges and failures as they are essential for learning and adaptation.

## Conclusion

Ido Portal's approach to movement is both profound and practical. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of the body and mind, the importance of play, and the value of discomfort, he offers a holistic and dynamic way to engage with movement. This practice not only enhances physical capabilities but also enriches emotional and mental well-being.
