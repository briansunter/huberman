# Tools for Setting & Achieving Goals: Insights from Dr. Emily Balcetis

## Introduction

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosted Dr. Emily Balcetis, a professor of psychology at New York University. Dr. Balcetis's research focuses on motivation, goal setting, and tools for successful goal completion. This essay delves into the key insights from their discussion, exploring how vision and perception influence our ability to set and achieve goals.

## The Intersection of Vision and Motivation

Dr. Huberman, a vision scientist, was particularly intrigued by Dr. Balcetis's work on how visualizing problems can predict success in overcoming challenges. Dr. Balcetis's book, "Clear, Closer, Better: How Successful People See the World," explores how the way we visualize goals—whether as distant or near, steep or shallow—affects our energy and motivation levels.

### Visualizing Goals

Dr. Balcetis's research reveals that how we visualize a problem or goal significantly impacts our approach to achieving it. For instance, visualizing a goal as closer or more attainable can increase our energy and motivation. This visualization dictates whether we perceive a task as overwhelming or manageable, influencing our ability to push towards immediate milestones rather than feeling the need to tackle the entire task at once.

## Practical Tools for Goal Setting

Dr. Balcetis shared numerous practical tools grounded in peer-reviewed science that can be applied to various goals, including educational, career, and relationship goals. By the end of the discussion, listeners were equipped with strategies to better set and achieve their goals.

### The Role of Visual Attention

One of the key strategies discussed was the concept of narrowed visual attention. Dr. Balcetis's research with elite athletes, such as sprinters, revealed that they often adopt a narrowed focus of attention, almost like a spotlight on a target. This strategy helps them maintain focus and achieve better performance. This narrowed focus can be taught to non-athletes as well, helping them exercise more efficiently and with less perceived effort.

### Experimental Evidence

In one study, participants were asked to perform a moderately challenging exercise while adopting either a narrowed focus of attention or a more expansive, natural focus. Those with a narrowed focus moved 27% faster and reported 17% less perceived effort. This demonstrates that visual strategies can significantly impact physical performance and perceived difficulty.

## Broader Applications of Visual Strategies

While the initial research focused on physical exercise, Dr. Balcetis emphasized that these visual strategies could be applied to various types of goals, including cognitive and professional objectives.

### Cognitive Goals

For cognitive goals, such as reading more or learning a new skill, visual tools can be equally effective. For instance, using apps that highlight text or track progress can help maintain focus and motivation. Dr. Balcetis shared her personal experience of learning to play the drums, where she used an app to track her practice sessions and emotions, providing a visual representation of her progress.

### Overcoming Psychological Barriers

Dr. Balcetis also discussed how visual strategies could help individuals with psychological barriers, such as depression or anxiety. Research shows that individuals with these conditions often focus on negative aspects of their environment, reinforcing their worldview. By consciously directing attention to positive or neutral stimuli, individuals can break this cycle and improve their mental well-being.

## Conclusion

Dr. Emily Balcetis's research provides valuable insights into how visual strategies can enhance motivation and goal achievement. By understanding and manipulating our visual attention, we can make tasks seem more manageable, increase our energy levels, and improve our overall performance. These tools are not only applicable to physical exercise but can also be adapted for cognitive and professional goals, offering a versatile approach to personal development.
