# How to Use Music to Boost Motivation, Mood & Improve Learning

## Introduction

Music is a profound neurological phenomenon that activates nearly every part of our brain. While most of us perceive music as an external experience, it intricately involves our brain and body, making us part of the instrument that creates and perceives music. This essay explores how music influences our brain, mood, motivation, and learning, supported by scientific studies and practical insights.

## Music and Brain Activation

### Neurological Engagement

When we listen to music, it activates a vast array of neural circuits. This activation is not limited to auditory processing but extends to emotional, social, and historical contexts. Music engages our brain in ways that help create and perceive it, involving the firing of neurons and neuroensembles.

### Emotional and Social Anchoring

Music anchors us to specific times and people in our history, evoking emotions and memories. Studies have shown that different types of music activate various neural circuits, creating distinct brain and bodily states. This activation can be leveraged for emotional processing, shifting emotions, enhancing learning, and improving brain plasticity.

## Music and Emotional Processing

### Sadness and Music

A common question is whether listening to sad music helps process feelings of sadness or exacerbates them. Studies indicate that music can indeed help process emotions. For instance, listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more can help individuals move through feelings of sadness.

### Happy Music

Conversely, music with a faster cadence (140-150 beats per minute or faster) tends to evoke happiness. This type of music, even with nonsensical lyrics, can significantly shift one's mood to a happier state. The threshold for this effect is around nine minutes of listening.

## Music and Motivation

### Premotor and Motor Circuits

Listening to music activates premotor and motor circuits in the brain, which are responsible for initiating movement. This activation predisposes us to move, making music a potent tool for increasing motivation. For instance, listening to faster music before a workout can enhance motivation and performance.

### Practical Application

To leverage music for motivation, listen to faster music (140-150 beats per minute) for 10-15 minutes before engaging in physical or cognitive tasks. This practice can shift your state of mind and body from a lack of motivation to a heightened state of readiness.

## Music and Learning

### Cognitive Performance

Studies have shown that people perform best on cognitive tasks in silence. However, if music is to be used, instrumental music is preferable to music with lyrics. Lyrics can compete with the semantic processing required for learning, thereby impeding cognitive performance.

### Binaural Beats and White Noise

Listening to 40 Hz binaural beats, white noise, or brown noise can enhance concentration and focus. These auditory stimuli can be beneficial for cognitive tasks, providing a better alternative to music with lyrics.

## Music and Physiological Effects

### Heart Rate Variability

Listening to music for 10-30 minutes daily can improve heart rate variability, a key indicator of cardiovascular health. This effect is mediated through changes in breathing patterns, which in turn influence heart rate.

### Anxiety Reduction

A specific song, "Weightless" by Marconi Union, has been shown to reduce anxiety by up to 65% with just three minutes of listening. This reduction is comparable to the effects of commonly prescribed benzodiazepines.

## Music and Neuroplasticity

### Learning Instruments

Learning to play an instrument, especially at a young age, enhances brain connectivity and facilitates other forms of learning. This increased connectivity persists into adulthood, making musical training a gateway to neuroplasticity.

### Listening to Novel Music

Even for those who do not play instruments, listening to novel forms of music for 30-60 minutes a few times a week can expand brain connectivity and improve learning capabilities.

## Conclusion

Music is a powerful tool that can significantly impact our brain, emotions, motivation, and learning. By understanding and leveraging the neurological effects of music, we can enhance various aspects of our lives. Whether through listening or playing, music offers a unique and profound way to engage with our brain's full potential.
