# How to Succeed at Hard Conversations: Insights from Chris Voss

## Introduction

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosted Chris Voss, a former FBI lead crisis negotiator and author of the best-selling book "Never Split the Difference." Voss shared his extensive expertise in negotiation, offering valuable insights into handling difficult conversations in various contexts, including business, relationships, and high-stakes situations.

## The Art of Negotiation

### Understanding the Mindset

Voss emphasized the importance of understanding the mindset when entering a negotiation. He highlighted the need to determine whether a deal is possible or if it's a bad deal that should be avoided. He stressed that it's not a sin to walk away from a deal quickly if it's not beneficial. Voss also mentioned the significance of diagnosing the other party's intentions early on, whether they are trustworthy or cutthroat.

### The Role of Emotions

Voss discussed the critical role of emotions in negotiations. He advised paying attention to both one's own emotions and those of the other party. Emotions can significantly impact the accuracy of information processing and the perception of being heard. He also touched on the importance of physical and mental stamina, as negotiations can span days, weeks, or even years.

### Deception Detection

Voss shared techniques for detecting deception, such as asking specific probe questions. He emphasized the importance of understanding the negotiation process and how to carry out negotiations effectively to serve both parties' interests.

## Practical Tools for Negotiation

### The Late-Night FM DJ Voice

Voss introduced the concept of the "late-night FM DJ voice," a calm and soothing tone that can help de-escalate heated discussions. This voice not only calms the other party but also helps the negotiator maintain composure. Huberman added that neuroscience supports the effectiveness of low-frequency sounds in calming the brain.

### Hypothesis Testing

Voss advocated for hypothesis testing in negotiations, similar to the scientific method. By making educated guesses about the other party's perspective and seeking confirmation or correction, negotiators can gather valuable information and build rapport. This approach accelerates the conversation and fosters collaboration.

### The Power of Generosity

Voss highlighted the importance of generosity in establishing rapport and trust. He shared examples of successful negotiators who lead with generosity, offering value without expecting anything in return. This approach can create long-term, mutually beneficial relationships.

## Handling High-Stakes Negotiations

### Case Studies

Voss recounted several high-stakes negotiations from his FBI career, including a case involving a young man named Jeff Schelling, who was kidnapped by a terrorist group. Through strategic stalling and leveraging the bad guys' internal conflicts, Schelling was eventually released. Voss also shared a more tragic case where multiple hostages were killed due to a lack of collaboration and communication among the involved parties.

### Specificity in Threats

Voss explained the importance of specificity in threats. Vague threats are often less credible, while specific threats with clear details indicate a higher likelihood of follow-through. Understanding this distinction can help negotiators assess the seriousness of the situation and respond appropriately.

### The Role of Empathy

Voss emphasized the power of empathy in negotiations. By demonstrating an understanding of the other party's perspective, negotiators can build trust and facilitate cooperation. He clarified that empathy does not require agreement or sympathy but simply acknowledging the other party's feelings and viewpoints.

## Practical Applications

### Benevolent Negotiations

Voss discussed how to approach benevolent negotiations, such as planning a trip with friends or discussing finances in a relationship. He advised starting with a hypothesis about the other party's preferences and seeking confirmation or correction. This approach fosters collaboration and helps identify the best possible outcome for all parties involved.

### Handling Breakups

When it comes to ending relationships, Voss recommended being direct and honest while allowing the other party to brace themselves for the bad news. He suggested warning them that bad news is coming and then delivering it promptly to minimize prolonged pain.

### Dealing with Aggressors

In situations involving aggressive parties, Voss advised using passive-aggressive techniques to wear them down. By asking how and what questions, negotiators can exhaust the aggressor and gain the upper hand without direct confrontation.

## Conclusion

Chris Voss's insights into negotiation offer valuable tools for handling difficult conversations in various contexts. From understanding the role of emotions and detecting deception to employing empathy and hypothesis testing, Voss's strategies can help individuals navigate negotiations more effectively. By practicing these techniques and maintaining a mindset of generosity and collaboration, negotiators can achieve better outcomes for themselves and others.
