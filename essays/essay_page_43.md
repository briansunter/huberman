# Using Temperature for Performance, Brain & Body Health

## Introduction

In this essay, we explore the fascinating insights shared by Dr. Craig Heller, a professor of biology and neurosciences at Stanford, on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Dr. Heller's research spans thermal regulation, Down syndrome, and circadian rhythms. This discussion focuses on thermal regulationâ€”how the body heats and cools itself to maintain homeostasis, which is crucial for neuron health, organ function, and overall performance in both athletics and mental tasks.

## Thermal Regulation and Performance

### Core Body Temperature Control

Dr. Heller emphasizes that controlling core body temperature is one of the most powerful ways to optimize mental and physical performance, regardless of the environment. He dispels common myths, such as the idea that putting a cold pack on your head or neck is the best way to cool down quickly. In fact, this can be counterproductive and lead to hyperthermia.

### Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Activity

The benefits of thermal regulation differ between aerobic and anaerobic activities. For aerobic activities, pre-cooling the body can increase the capacity to absorb excess heat, thereby enhancing performance. For anaerobic activities, such as weightlifting, the temperature of specific muscles rises quickly, and cooling these muscles can prevent overheating and muscle failure.

## Mechanisms of Heat Transfer

### Specialized Vascular Compartments

Humans and other mammals have specialized blood vessels in the palms, soles, and upper face that act as natural portals for heat loss. These areas are underlain by arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs), which shunt blood directly from arteries to veins, bypassing capillaries. This mechanism allows for efficient heat transfer.

### Practical Applications

Dr. Heller's research has led to the development of a cooling device known as the "cool mitt," which leverages these natural heat loss portals. This device has shown remarkable results in enhancing performance and reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). For instance, athletes using the cool mitt have been able to significantly increase their work volume and performance.

## Case Studies and Experiments

### Greg Clark's Dips

One notable example is Greg Clark, a former NFL player, who doubled his total work volume in dips by using the cool mitt. Over a month, he tripled the number of dips he could perform, demonstrating the profound impact of proper cooling.

### Endurance Studies

In controlled experiments, subjects walking on a treadmill in a hot environment were able to double their endurance when using the cool mitt. This highlights the potential for thermal regulation to enhance endurance performance.

## Practical Advice for Cooling

### Homegrown Solutions

While the cool mitt is not yet widely available, there are practical ways to leverage the principles of thermal regulation. For instance, using a frozen juice can or cold packs on the palms can provide some benefits. However, it's crucial to avoid vasoconstriction, which can seal in heat.

### Cooling for Recovery

Cooling can also aid in recovery. For example, placing cold packs on the glabrous skin (palms, soles, and upper face) can cool the body twice as fast as traditional methods like placing cold packs in the armpits or groin.

## Heating and Hypothermia

### Warming Up

Warming up is essential for increasing flexibility and preparing the body for exercise. However, the primary goal is not just to raise temperature but to ensure the muscles and joints are ready for activity.

### Treating Hypothermia

In cases of hypothermia, such as post-surgery or cold exposure, warming the glabrous skin can be more effective than traditional methods. For instance, using warm pads on the feet can help raise core temperature more efficiently.

## Sleep and Temperature

### Sleep Hygiene

Good sleep hygiene is crucial for quality sleep. This includes maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bedtime, and creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine. Temperature also plays a significant role; a cooler environment can facilitate better sleep by making it easier to thermoregulate.

### Practical Tips

Sleeping in a cool room allows for passive regulation of body temperature. Exposing the glabrous skin by sticking out hands or feet can help maintain comfort throughout the night.

## Conclusion

Dr. Craig Heller's insights into thermal regulation offer valuable strategies for enhancing performance, recovery, and overall health. By understanding and leveraging the body's natural mechanisms for heat transfer, individuals can optimize their physical and mental capabilities. Whether through advanced technologies like the cool mitt or simple homegrown solutions, the principles of thermal regulation provide powerful tools for improving human performance.
