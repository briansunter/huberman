# Using Hypnosis to Enhance Health & Performance

## Introduction

Dr. David Spiegel, the Associate Chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, is a leading expert in the field of clinical hypnosis. His work bridges the gap between mind and body, focusing on the clinical applications of hypnosis to improve symptoms of stress, chronic anxiety, chronic pain, and various psychiatric illnesses, including cancer outcomes. This essay explores the insights shared by Dr. Spiegel on the Huberman Lab Podcast, hosted by Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

## Understanding Hypnosis

### Definition and Misconceptions

Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention, akin to looking through the telephoto lens of a camera. It involves seeing with great detail but devoid of context. This state is often misunderstood due to its portrayal in stage hypnosis, where individuals are made to perform actions they wouldn't normally do. In contrast, clinical hypnosis involves changing the brain state to make beneficial adjustments in the brain and body.

### Clinical Applications

Dr. Spiegel's research has shown that hypnosis can improve symptoms of stress, chronic anxiety, chronic pain, and various psychiatric illnesses. It has also been shown to enhance neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. Clinical hypnosis is vastly different from stage hypnosis and involves using the brain state as a portal to make beneficial adjustments in biology and psychology.

## Hypnotizability

### Assessing Hypnotizability

Not everyone can be hypnotized to the same degree. Dr. Spiegel has developed a simple test to determine whether an individual has a high, medium, or low degree of hypnotizability. This test is crucial for tailoring hypnosis treatments to individual needs.

### Factors Influencing Hypnotizability

Hypnotizability is relatively stable over a person's lifetime, with the peak period being the latency years in childhood. By the early twenties, an individual's hypnotizability becomes fixed. Approximately one-third of adults are not hypnotizable, two-thirds are moderately hypnotizable, and about 15% are highly hypnotizable.

## Clinical Applications of Hypnosis

### Stress Reduction

Hypnosis is highly effective in stress reduction. It helps dissociate somatic reactions from psychological reactions, allowing individuals to control their physical response to stress. This control can significantly improve their overall well-being.

### Pain Management

Hypnosis has been shown to be effective in managing pain. In a study involving patients undergoing arterial cut-downs, those who used self-hypnosis reported an 80% reduction in pain and used half the amount of opioids compared to those who received standard care.

### Sleep Improvement

Hypnosis can also help improve sleep. Many individuals have reported better sleep quality and the ability to fall back asleep using self-hypnosis techniques.

### Phobias and Trauma

Hypnosis can be used to treat phobias and trauma by allowing individuals to confront and reprocess their traumatic experiences. This approach helps them gain control over their reactions and reduces the impact of the trauma on their lives.

## Mechanisms of Hypnosis

### Brain Activity

Research has shown that hypnosis involves turning down activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC), which is part of the salience network. This reduction in activity makes individuals less likely to be distracted. Additionally, there is increased functional connectivity between the DACC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is part of the executive control network. This coordination allows individuals to carry out plans without being distracted by other possibilities.

### Neurochemical Changes

Hypnosis has been associated with increased GABA activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is similar to the effects of benzodiazepines. This neurochemical change helps reduce anxiety and enhances the hypnotic experience.

## Practical Applications and Tools

### Reveri App

Dr. Spiegel has developed the Reveri app, which provides guided self-hypnosis sessions for various issues, including stress, pain, and sleep. The app is based on clinical studies and research conducted in Dr. Spiegel's lab at Stanford. It offers both short and long sessions, allowing users to integrate self-hypnosis into their daily lives.

### Clinical Hypnosis

For those seeking clinical hypnosis, it is essential to work with licensed and trained professionals in psychiatry, psychology, medicine, or dentistry. Professional organizations such as the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis and the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis provide referral services for finding qualified clinicians.

## Conclusion

Hypnosis is a powerful tool for enhancing health and performance. Dr. David Spiegel's research and clinical work have demonstrated its effectiveness in treating various conditions, including stress, pain, and trauma. By understanding the mechanisms of hypnosis and utilizing tools like the Reveri app, individuals can harness the benefits of this unique brain state to improve their overall well-being.
