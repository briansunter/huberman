# Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia: Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects

## Introduction

In this journal club episode, Dr. Peter Attia and I, Andrew Huberman, delve into two fascinating papers. The first paper, presented by Dr. Attia, examines the role of Metformin in longevity, while the second paper, which I present, explores the power of belief effects on drug efficacy. This essay will summarize and analyze the key points from our discussion, providing insights into the potential implications of these findings.

## Metformin and Longevity

### Background on Metformin

Metformin is a drug that has been used for over 50 years, primarily as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Its primary mechanism involves inhibiting complex I of the mitochondria, which in turn reduces hepatic glucose output. This mechanism is crucial for managing blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. However, the potential role of Metformin in promoting longevity has garnered significant interest, particularly following a 2014 study by Bannister et al.

### The Bannister Study

The Bannister study analyzed a UK registry of patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with Metformin. The study found that these patients had a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality over 2.8 years compared to matched controls without diabetes. This surprising result suggested that Metformin might have benefits beyond glucose regulation, potentially acting as a geroprotective agent.

### Reassessment by Keyes et al.

Dr. Attia presented a more recent study by Keyes et al., which aimed to reassess the evidence from the Bannister study. This study used a larger sample size from a Danish health registry and included a novel approach by analyzing discordant twins (one with diabetes and one without). The study found that patients with diabetes on Metformin had a higher mortality rate compared to non-diabetic controls, even after adjusting for various confounders.

#### Key Findings

1. **Crude Mortality Rates**: The crude mortality rate for diabetic patients on Metformin was significantly higher than for non-diabetic controls.
2. **Hazard Ratios**: The hazard ratios indicated a 48% increased risk of mortality for diabetic patients on Metformin compared to non-diabetic controls.
3. **Informative Censoring**: The study also examined the impact of informative censoring, finding that it did not significantly alter the results.

### Implications

The Keyes study challenges the notion that Metformin has geroprotective effects in non-diabetic individuals. While Metformin remains a valuable drug for managing type 2 diabetes, its role in promoting longevity in non-diabetic individuals remains uncertain. The upcoming TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin) may provide more definitive answers.

## The Power of Belief Effects

### Background on Belief Effects

Belief effects differ from placebo effects in that they involve a more nuanced understanding of how our beliefs about a drug can influence its efficacy. Dr. Ali Crum's work has shown that beliefs about stress, food, and exercise can significantly impact physiological outcomes.

### The Study on Nicotine and Belief

The second paper we discussed explores how beliefs about the dose of nicotine in a vape pen affect brain activation and cognitive performance. Participants were given a vape pen with a low dose of nicotine but were told it contained either a low, medium, or high dose. They then performed a task designed to engage specific brain areas, including the thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

#### Key Findings

1. **Subjective Experience**: Participants' subjective experience of the nicotine dose matched what they were told, despite all receiving the same low dose.
2. **Thalamus Activation**: The activation of the thalamus scaled with the believed dose of nicotine.
3. **Thalamus to Prefrontal Cortex Pathway**: The connectivity between the thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex also scaled with the believed dose.

### Implications

This study highlights the profound impact of belief on physiological responses. The findings suggest that our beliefs about the efficacy and dosage of a drug can significantly influence its actual effects on the brain. This has broad implications for how we approach treatments for various conditions, including ADHD, hypertension, and even smoking cessation.

## Conclusion

The discussions in this journal club episode underscore the complexity of drug efficacy and the significant role of belief effects. While Metformin's role in promoting longevity remains uncertain, the power of belief in modulating drug effects opens new avenues for enhancing treatment outcomes. Future research, including the TAME trial and further studies on belief effects, will be crucial in advancing our understanding of these phenomena.
