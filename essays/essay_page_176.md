# Thoughts on Longevity Supplements and How to Improve Memory

## Introduction

In this essay, we will explore various longevity supplements, including resveratrol, NR, NMN, and others, and discuss their potential effects on lifespan and overall health. Additionally, we will delve into strategies for improving memory and cognitive function. The insights provided are based on current scientific understanding and personal experiences.

## Resveratrol and Longevity

Resveratrol has garnered significant attention for its purported ability to extend lifespan. Initially, it was believed that resveratrol could impact cellular pathways to prolong the life of individual cells and, by extension, the entire organism. This led to a surge in popularity for resveratrol supplements and grape seed extracts, which contain resveratrol.

However, as of 2023, the consensus in the scientific community is that resveratrol does not significantly extend lifespan. While it may have some positive effects on cellular function, there is little direct evidence supporting its role in increasing human lifespan. Despite this, resveratrol and grape seed extract may still offer other health benefits, such as improved vascular function and blood flow.

### Personal Use of Grape Seed Extract

I personally take 400 to 800 milligrams of grape seed extract daily, primarily for its vascular benefits. However, I do not consider it a top-tier supplement for longevity. It is part of a broader supplementation strategy aimed at overall health rather than lifespan extension.

## NAD Pathways and Longevity

In recent years, there has been growing interest in NAD-related pathways for increasing longevity. NAD is crucial for cellular energetics and mitochondrial function. Supplements like NR (Nicotinamide Riboside) and NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) are considered precursors to NAD and have been explored for their potential to boost NAD levels in cells.

### Personal Experience with NR and NMN

I take 500 milligrams of NR and 1 to 2 grams of sublingual NMN daily. My goal is to increase NAD levels, which I find enhances my mental and physical energy throughout the day. However, I do not take these supplements with the expectation of extending my lifespan, as the evidence for this is not yet conclusive.

### NAD Infusions

NAD infusions are another method to increase NAD levels. I have tried NAD infusions twice, particularly when feeling run down post-illness. While the infusions were uncomfortable, they significantly improved my energy levels and overall well-being. However, due to their cost and discomfort, I do not plan to use them frequently.

## Other Longevity Supplements

### Metformin and Berberine

Metformin and its alternative, berberine, are often discussed in the context of longevity due to their effects on blood glucose and the mTOR pathway. However, I do not take either of these supplements. Berberine gives me headaches, likely due to its blood glucose-lowering effects. Additionally, current evidence does not strongly support the use of metformin for lifespan extension.

### Rapamycin

Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, is another compound under investigation for its potential to extend lifespan. While there is promising research, particularly in animal models, I do not currently take rapamycin due to its side effect profile and the lack of conclusive human data.

## The Importance of Foundational Health Practices

While supplements can play a role in health optimization, they should not replace foundational health practices. Quality sleep, regular exercise, proper nutrition, stress management, and healthy social connections are crucial for overall well-being and longevity. These practices have a more substantial and well-documented impact on health metrics related to lifespan than any supplement currently available.

### Exercise Recommendations

For optimal health, a combination of cardiovascular exercise and resistance training is recommended. Aim for 180 to 220 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week, along with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training to maintain muscle mass and nerve-to-muscle connectivity.

## Conclusion

In summary, while certain supplements like resveratrol, NR, NMN, and others may offer health benefits, their impact on lifespan extension remains uncertain. Prioritizing foundational health practices such as sleep, exercise, nutrition, and stress management is essential for overall well-being and longevity. Supplements should be considered as an adjunct to, rather than a replacement for, these fundamental practices.
