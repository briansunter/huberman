# The Neuroscience of Breathing: Insights from Dr. Jack Feldman

## Introduction

Breathing is a fundamental aspect of life, essential not only for oxygenating our brain and body but also for maintaining organ health and function. Dr. Jack Feldman, a distinguished professor of neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, has pioneered research in the neuroscience of breathing. His work has uncovered the intricate brain mechanisms that control breathing patterns and their profound impact on mental and physical health.

## The Mechanics and Neuroscience of Breathing

### Basic Mechanics

Breathing involves the rhythmic flow of air into and out of the lungs, driven primarily by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. The diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located below the lungs, contracts to pull air into the lungs, expanding the thoracic cavity. The intercostal muscles, situated between the ribs, assist by lifting the rib cage. This process is essential for oxygen intake and carbon dioxide expulsion, maintaining the body's acid-base balance.

### Brain Centers Controlling Breathing

Dr. Feldman's research identified two critical brain centers responsible for breathing patterns: the preBötzinger complex and the retrotrapezoid nucleus. The preBötzinger complex, located in the brainstem, generates the rhythmic breathing pattern by sending signals to the motor neurons controlling the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. This region is crucial for initiating each breath.

The retrotrapezoid nucleus, also in the brainstem, plays a significant role in active expiration, particularly during high metabolic demands such as exercise. This region becomes active to drive the muscles involved in exhalation, ensuring efficient air expulsion from the lungs.

## Physiological Sighs and Their Importance

### Frequency and Function

Physiological sighs occur approximately every five minutes, a frequency often underestimated by those unfamiliar with the science. These deep breaths are crucial for maintaining lung health by preventing the collapse of alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs. Alveoli are fluid-lined, and their collapse can be mitigated by the increased pressure from a deep breath, which pops them open.

### Discovery and Mechanism

Dr. Feldman's lab discovered that the preBötzinger complex is involved in generating these sighs. Experiments showed that introducing bombesin, a peptide released during stress, into the preBötzinger complex significantly increased sigh frequency. Conversely, ablating the neurons responsive to bombesin in this region reduced sighing, leading to deteriorated lung function and overall health.

## Emotional and Cognitive Impacts of Breathing

### Bidirectional Relationship

Breathing patterns are influenced by emotional states, and conversely, deliberate changes in breathing can alter emotional and cognitive states. For instance, stimulating the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotion, can change breathing patterns. Conversely, volitional control of breathing, such as during breathwork practices, can impact brain states and emotional regulation.

### Locked-In Syndrome

Patients with locked-in syndrome, who lose volitional control of most muscles due to brainstem damage, still exhibit changes in breathing patterns in response to emotional stimuli, such as laughter. This indicates that emotional control of breathing operates through different neural pathways than volitional control.

### Research by Kevin Yackel

Kevin Yackel's research, in collaboration with Dr. Feldman, identified neurons in the preBötzinger complex that project to the locus coeruleus, a brain region involved in arousal and stress. Ablating these neurons resulted in calmer behavior and altered EEG patterns, demonstrating a direct link between breathing and brain state.

## Practical Applications and Breathwork

### Breathwork Practices

Dr. Feldman advocates for the benefits of breathwork practices, such as box breathing, which involves equal durations of inhalation, holding, exhalation, and holding. This practice can help manage stress and improve cognitive function. He also explores other techniques like Tummo and Wim Hof breathing, which involve cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath holds.

### Episodic Hypoxia

Episodic hypoxia, involving cycles of low oxygen exposure, has shown promise in improving motor and cognitive function. This technique, studied by researchers like Gordon Mitchell, could have applications in rehabilitation and performance enhancement.

## Conclusion

Dr. Jack Feldman's groundbreaking research has illuminated the complex interplay between breathing and brain function. Understanding these mechanisms opens new avenues for improving mental and physical health through targeted breathwork practices. As research continues, the potential benefits of these practices for a wide range of conditions and overall well-being become increasingly evident.
