# How Humans Select and Keep Romantic Partners in Short and Long Term

## Introduction

In this essay, we explore the insights shared by Dr. David Buss, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and a leading figure in evolutionary psychology. Dr. Buss's research focuses on the strategies humans use to select mates in both short and long-term contexts, as well as the sex differences in these strategies. This essay delves into the various aspects of mate selection, including the reasons behind infidelity, the role of deception, and the darker aspects of human mating behavior.

## Theoretical Framework for Understanding Mate Choice

Dr. Buss's work is grounded in Darwin's theory of sexual selection, which explains the evolution of characteristics due to their mating advantage rather than their survival advantage. Darwin identified two causal processes: intrasexual competition and preferential mate choice. Intrasexual competition involves members of the same sex competing for access to mates, while preferential mate choice involves members of one sex selecting mates based on certain desirable qualities.

### Universal Desires in Mate Selection

Research has shown that both men and women universally desire certain qualities in long-term mates, such as intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction, love, good health, dependability, and emotional stability. These qualities are sought after across various cultures, indicating their fundamental importance in human mate selection.

### Sex Differences in Mate Preferences

There are notable sex differences in mate preferences. Women tend to prioritize qualities associated with resource acquisition, such as good earning capacity, social status, ambition, and slightly older age. This preference is rooted in the evolutionary need for women to secure resources for themselves and their offspring. Men, on the other hand, place a higher emphasis on physical attractiveness, which serves as a cue for youth and fertility.

### Cultural Variability in Mate Preferences

While some preferences are universal, others vary significantly across cultures. For instance, the preference for virginity varies widely, with some cultures placing high importance on it and others finding it irrelevant or even undesirable. This cultural variability highlights the influence of societal norms and values on mate selection.

## Deception in Mate Selection

Both men and women engage in deception to enhance their attractiveness to potential mates. Men often exaggerate their income, height, and status, while women tend to underreport their weight and post misleading photos. Deception also extends to intentions, with men sometimes feigning long-term interest to secure short-term sexual encounters.

## Infidelity in Committed Relationships

Infidelity is a complex phenomenon with different motivations for men and women. Men often cheat for sexual variety and opportunity, while women typically cheat due to emotional or sexual dissatisfaction in their primary relationship. The dual mating strategy hypothesis suggests that women may seek good genes from one partner and resources from another, but Dr. Buss argues that the mate switching hypothesis, where women seek to trade up or secure a backup mate, is more plausible.

## The Role of Jealousy

Jealousy is an evolved emotion that serves to protect long-term investments in a mate. It is triggered by threats such as infidelity, mate poachers, and mate value discrepancies. Men and women experience jealousy differently, with men more focused on sexual infidelity and women on emotional infidelity. This difference is rooted in the evolutionary concerns of paternity certainty for men and resource investment for women.

## The Dark Triad and Mating Behavior

The dark triad—narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy—represents a set of personality traits that are associated with negative mating behaviors. Individuals high in these traits are often charming but manipulative, engaging in sexual deception, harassment, and coercion. These traits are more prevalent in men and are linked to a higher likelihood of intimate partner violence and stalking.

## Stalking and Its Motivations

Stalking is often motivated by a desire to reestablish a relationship or interfere with a partner's future mating prospects. While it is generally unsuccessful, it can sometimes work by scaring off potential new partners. Stalking is more common among men and is often driven by a perceived mate value discrepancy.

## Unconventional Relationships

Polyamory and other non-traditional relationship structures attempt to navigate the complexities of human mating psychology. These arrangements often involve negotiated boundaries to satisfy desires for sexual variety while managing jealousy. The motivations for engaging in polyamory can differ between men and women, with men often seeking sexual variety and women sometimes agreeing to retain their partner.

## Conclusion

Understanding human mate selection involves examining a complex interplay of evolutionary, psychological, and cultural factors. Dr. David Buss's research provides valuable insights into the strategies humans use to select and retain mates, the role of deception, and the darker aspects of mating behavior. By exploring these dynamics, we gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental drives that shape human relationships.
