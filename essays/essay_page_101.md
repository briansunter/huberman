# Leveraging Ultradian Cycles, Protecting Your Brain, and Examining Seed Oils

## Introduction

In this essay, we delve into the concept of ultradian rhythms, their application in daily work, and their impact on learning and neuroplasticity. We also explore how to protect the brain and examine the role of seed oils in health. This discussion is based on insights from Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

## Understanding Ultradian Rhythms

### What Are Ultradian Rhythms?

Ultradian rhythms are biological cycles shorter than 24 hours. Typically, these rhythms are about 90 minutes long and are present in both waking and sleeping states. During sleep, these cycles govern the transitions between different sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep, light sleep, and REM sleep.

### Application in Daily Work

#### Leveraging Ultradian Rhythms for Focused Work

To harness ultradian rhythms for focused work, it is essential to identify when you are most alert during the day. This peak alertness is often linked to fluctuations in the glucocorticoid system, which regulates cortisol release. Cortisol, despite its association with stress, is crucial for enhancing immune function, alertness, and focus.

#### Identifying Peak Focus Periods

To determine your peak focus periods, observe when you feel most alert after waking. For instance, if you wake up at 7 AM and notice peak alertness around 9:30 or 10 AM, this is an optimal time to start a focused work session. Typically, you can achieve one or two 90-minute focused work blocks per day, with the possibility of a third in exceptional cases.

### Scheduling and Maximizing Focus

#### Daily Focus Blocks

A typical schedule might include a 90-minute focus block starting around 9:30 or 10 AM and another in the mid to late afternoon. During these blocks, aim for about an hour of deep focus, acknowledging that it may take 10-15 minutes to fully engage.

#### Extended Focus and Recovery

For those needing to increase their daily focus, consider starting your day earlier. For example, waking up at 5:30 AM and engaging in brief high-intensity exercise can shift your cortisol pulse earlier, allowing for an additional focus block in the early morning.

### The Role of Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience, is best triggered within these ultradian cycles. The molecules that control neuroplasticity, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), fluctuate according to these cycles. Therefore, aligning your learning or skill acquisition with these periods can significantly enhance your ability to learn and retain information.

## Protecting Your Brain

### Importance of Regular Focus

Regularly engaging in focused work helps keep the brain's focus circuits "warm," making it easier to access these circuits over time. This regular engagement is crucial for maintaining and enhancing cognitive function.

### Role of Sleep and Rest

The actual rewiring of neurons occurs during deep sleep and periods of non-sleep deep rest (NSDR). Therefore, ensuring adequate sleep and incorporating NSDR into your routine can accelerate learning and improve overall brain health.

## Examining Seed Oils

### Health Implications

Seed oils have been a topic of debate regarding their health implications. While some argue that they are harmful due to their high omega-6 fatty acid content, others suggest that they can be part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation. It is essential to consider the overall balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in your diet and to prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.

## Conclusion

Understanding and leveraging ultradian rhythms can significantly enhance your ability to focus, learn, and protect your brain. By identifying your peak focus periods and aligning your work and learning activities with these cycles, you can maximize your productivity and cognitive function. Additionally, maintaining regular focus, ensuring adequate sleep, and being mindful of your diet, including the consumption of seed oils, are crucial for overall brain health.
