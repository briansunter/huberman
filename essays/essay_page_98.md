# Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health

## Introduction

Fitness is essential for cardiovascular health, strength, endurance, lifespan, and health span. Everyone desires healthy hormonal and cardiovascular function, longevity, and vitality. Fitness protocols are powerful tools for achieving these goals. However, the abundance of information available can be overwhelming. This essay synthesizes science-based tools and protocols discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, featuring insights from experts like Dr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Peter Attia, movement specialist Ido Portal, and physiotherapist Jeff Cavalier.

## Foundational Fitness Protocol

### Sunday: Long Endurance Training

The week begins with a long endurance workout, typically 60 to 75 minutes of jogging at a zone 2 cardio level. Zone 2 cardio involves moving at a pace where you can sustain a conversation but would lose that ability if you pushed harder. This can include jogging, rowing, cycling, or swimming. Occasionally, a long hike or weighted walk with a weight vest can substitute the jog. The goal is to build or maintain the capacity for long-distance movement without fatigue.

### Monday: Leg Resistance Training

Monday is dedicated to leg workouts, focusing on quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. This workout sets in motion metabolic processes that benefit the entire week. Training legs early in the week ensures that the hardest strength and hypertrophy workout is completed, providing a strong foundation for the body. The workout consists of about 10 minutes of warming up and 50 to 60 minutes of intense work, including exercises like leg extensions, hack squats, leg curls, glute ham raises, standing calf raises, and seated calf raises.

### Tuesday: Heat and Cold Contrast

Tuesday is a recovery day involving heat and cold contrast therapy. This includes sessions in a hot sauna for about 20 minutes, followed by 5 minutes in an ice bath, repeated 3 to 5 times. This protocol accelerates recovery, improves cardiovascular function, and enhances brain health. If a sauna and ice bath are unavailable, hot baths and cold showers can be used as alternatives.

### Wednesday: Torso Training

Wednesday focuses on training the torso, including the chest, shoulders, and back. This workout involves pushing and pulling exercises, such as bench presses, shoulder presses, lateral raises, bent-over rows, and chin-ups. Training the torso together on the same day provides systemic hormonal and metabolic benefits. Additionally, neck training is included to ensure overall body stability and strength.

### Thursday: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Exercise

Thursday's workout is a 35-minute cardiovascular session at 75 to 80% of maximum effort. This involves running, rowing, or cycling at a pace where breathing is hard but sustainable. The goal is to tap into multiple aspects of endurance, improving overall cardiovascular fitness.

### Friday: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

Friday is dedicated to high-intensity interval training (HIIT), involving 20 to 30-second all-out sprints followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated for 8 to 12 rounds. This can be done on an assault bike, rower, or through sprinting. The aim is to reach near-maximum heart rate, providing cardiovascular benefits and indirectly stimulating leg strength and hypertrophy.

### Saturday: Arms, Calves, and Neck Training

Saturday's workout focuses on arms, calves, and neck, with indirect torso training. This includes exercises like dumbbell curls, incline curls, chin-ups, tricep kickbacks, overhead extensions, dips, and calf raises. The goal is to ensure balanced strength and hypertrophy across all muscle groups.

## Flexibility and Recovery

Flexibility training involves static stretching, holding stretches for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeating 2 to 3 times per week. This can be done in the evening or throughout the day. Recovery is enhanced through practices like non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) and physiological sighs, which help calm the nervous system and promote rapid recovery.

## Practical Considerations

### Training with Poor Sleep

If sleep-deprived, it's often better to skip training and focus on recovery. However, non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) can sometimes restore the ability to train effectively.

### Training When Sick

It's generally advisable not to train when sick. If symptoms are mild, a reduced-intensity workout may be possible, but full recovery should be prioritized.

### Training Fasted vs. Fed

Personal preference and individual response should guide whether to train fasted or fed. Fasted training is often preferred for cardiovascular work, while resistance training may benefit from having eaten the night before.

## Conclusion

This foundational fitness protocol provides a comprehensive approach to optimizing physical health, incorporating endurance, strength, hypertrophy, speed, power, and flexibility. It emphasizes the importance of recovery and practical adjustments based on individual needs and circumstances. By following this protocol and tailoring it to specific goals, individuals can achieve balanced and sustainable fitness.
