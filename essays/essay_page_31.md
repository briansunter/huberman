# Maximizing Productivity, Physical & Mental Health with Daily Tools

## Introduction

In this essay, we will explore science-based protocols for optimizing various aspects of daily life, including sleep, mood, learning, nutrition, exercise, and creativity. These protocols are grounded in quality peer-reviewed literature and are designed to enhance productivity, physical health, and mental well-being.

## The Importance of Daily Rhythms

Every cell and organ in our body, including our brain, operates on a 24-hour cycle. This cycle is synchronized with the Earth's rotation and is regulated by genes and proteins expressed in our cells. Understanding and leveraging this daily rhythm can help optimize various aspects of life.

## Morning Routine

### Waking Up

I typically wake up around 6:30 AM, sometimes as late as 7 AM. The first thing I do is write down the time I woke up. This helps me determine my "temperature minimum," which is the time when my body temperature is lowest, usually about two hours before my average wake-up time.

### Forward Ambulation

After waking up, I engage in forward ambulation, which is a fancy term for taking a walk. This activity generates "optic flow," which reduces activity in the amygdala, a brain structure involved in anxiety and threat detection. This helps me achieve a state of alertness without anxiety.

### Sunlight Exposure

Getting sunlight in my eyes first thing in the morning is crucial for setting my circadian rhythms. This exposure helps regulate cortisol levels, which promote wakefulness and a healthy immune system. I aim for at least 10 minutes of sunlight exposure, even on cloudy days.

## Hydration and Caffeine

### Hydration

Hydration is essential for mental performance. I drink at least 16 to 32 ounces of water with a little sea salt to ensure proper ionic flow for neuron function.

### Delaying Caffeine

I delay my caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking. This helps avoid a late-afternoon crash by allowing adenosine levels to build up naturally.

## Morning Work Block

### Focused Work

I engage in a 90-minute focused work block, leveraging the brain's natural ultradian cycles. I use tools like the Freedom app to block internet distractions and low-level white noise to enhance focus.

### Eye Position and Alertness

Positioning my computer screen at eye level or slightly higher helps maintain alertness. Looking down can induce sleepiness, so I avoid it.

## Exercise

### Timing and Structure

After my morning work block, I engage in about an hour of physical exercise. The exercise regimen alternates between strength and hypertrophy work and endurance work, following a 3:2 ratio over a 10 to 12-week period.

### Benefits

Exercise supports brain health, cardiovascular health, and overall well-being. It also helps regulate hormones like cortisol, which should not be elevated for prolonged periods.

## Nutrition

### Fasting and First Meal

I fast until about noon, drinking only water, caffeine from yerba mate or guayusa tea, and Athletic Greens. Fasting increases adrenaline levels, enhancing focus and learning.

### Lunch

My lunch consists of protein, healthy fats, and low carbohydrates to maintain alertness. If I've exercised, I include some starches to replenish glycogen stores.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Ingesting at least 1,000 milligrams of EPA from fish oil or other sources supports mood and brain health. Most people do not get sufficient omega-3s from their diet alone.

## Afternoon Routine

### Afternoon Light Exposure

Getting sunlight in the afternoon helps regulate melatonin levels, making it easier to fall asleep at night. This exposure also buffers against the negative effects of bright light in the evening.

### Nonsleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

I practice a 10-minute hypnosis session using the Reveri app to achieve deep relaxation and focus. This practice enhances plasticity and learning within the brain.

## Evening Routine

### Dinner

My dinner includes starchy carbohydrates to increase serotonin levels, aiding the transition to sleep. I avoid refined sugars, focusing on complex carbohydrates.

### Preparing for Sleep

I take a hot shower or bath to accelerate the drop in body temperature, which helps me fall asleep more easily. I also keep my room cool and dark to maintain sleep quality.

### Supplements

I take magnesium threonate or glycinate, apigenin, and theanine to aid the transition to sleep. These supplements promote the release of GABA, reducing rumination and anxiety.

## Conclusion

By understanding and leveraging our body's natural rhythms, we can optimize various aspects of our daily life. From morning sunlight exposure to focused work blocks, exercise, nutrition, and evening routines, these science-based protocols can significantly enhance productivity, physical health, and mental well-being.
