# Psychedelics for Treating Mental Disorders: Insights from Dr. Matthew Johnson

## Introduction

Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and director of the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, is at the forefront of exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. In a conversation with Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Johnson delves into the science behind psychedelics, their impact on mental health, and the future of psychedelic therapies.

## Understanding Psychedelics

### Definition and Classes

Psychedelics are substances that profoundly alter one's sense of reality and self. They span various pharmacological classes, making the term "psychedelic" more cultural than strictly scientific. The classic psychedelics include LSD, psilocybin (found in over 200 species of mushrooms), DMT (found in numerous plants), and mescaline (found in cacti like peyote). These substances primarily act as agonists or partial agonists at the serotonin 2A receptor.

Other classes include NMDA antagonists like ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan, which also produce psychedelic effects. Additionally, compounds like salvinorin A (a kappa opioid agonist) and MDMA (primarily a serotonin releaser) are considered psychedelics due to their profound impact on perception and behavior.

### Mechanisms of Action

Psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin primarily target the serotonin system, particularly the 2A receptor. This interaction leads to increased glutamate transmission, which may explain the profound alterations in perception and cognition. Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, also produces psychedelic effects, often described as dissociative.

MDMA, on the other hand, increases the release of serotonin and other monoamines like dopamine. This dual action is thought to contribute to its unique therapeutic effects, particularly in treating trauma and PTSD.

## Therapeutic Potential

### Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Models

Dr. Johnson's lab conducts clinical trials to explore the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Participants undergo rigorous screening, including psychiatric and cardiovascular evaluations, before participating in the studies. The preparation phase involves building a therapeutic rapport with the guides and understanding the potential effects of the psychedelic experience.

On the day of the session, participants ingest pure psilocybin in capsule form. The dose typically ranges from 20 to 30 milligrams, depending on the study. The session itself is designed to be a meaningful experience, with participants encouraged to let go of control and fully immerse themselves in the experience.

### Mechanisms of Therapeutic Action

The therapeutic effects of psychedelics are thought to stem from their ability to alter self-representation and challenge existing models of reality. This can lead to profound insights and lasting changes in behavior and perception. For example, individuals with depression or addiction may experience a shift in how they view themselves, leading to significant improvements in their condition.

### Integration and Follow-Up

After the psychedelic experience, participants engage in integration sessions to process their experiences and discuss their implications. This phase is crucial for translating the insights gained during the session into lasting therapeutic benefits.

## Microdosing vs. Macrodosing

### Microdosing

Microdosing involves taking sub-perceptual doses of psychedelics, typically around a tenth of a standard dose. The claims include improved focus, creativity, and mood. However, current research has not provided strong evidence to support these claims. Most studies have found no significant benefits, and some have even reported slight impairments in cognitive function.

### Macrodosing

Macrodosing, or taking full psychedelic doses, has shown more promise in clinical settings. High doses of psychedelics have been associated with significant improvements in conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction. These effects are thought to result from the profound alterations in perception and self-representation that occur during the psychedelic experience.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Current Legal Status

Psychedelics are currently classified as Schedule I substances in the United States, making them illegal to possess, sell, or use. However, there is a growing movement to decriminalize and legalize these substances for therapeutic use. Some states and cities have already taken steps to decriminalize psychedelics, but federal law still prohibits their use.

### Future Directions

The future of psychedelics in medicine looks promising, with ongoing clinical trials and increasing public interest. MDMA is expected to be approved for PTSD treatment within the next few years, and psilocybin may follow for depression. The challenge will be to develop a regulatory framework that ensures safe and effective use while minimizing potential risks.

## Conclusion

Dr. Matthew Johnson's work at Johns Hopkins is paving the way for a new era of psychedelic therapies. By rigorously studying these substances in controlled clinical settings, researchers are uncovering their potential to treat a range of mental health disorders. As the legal landscape evolves, the hope is that psychedelics will become a valuable tool in the therapeutic arsenal, offering new hope to those suffering from conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction.
