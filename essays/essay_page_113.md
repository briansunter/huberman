# Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind

## Introduction

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosted Dr. Sam Harris. Dr. Harris, an author and neuroscientist, discussed his views and practices related to meditation, consciousness, and free will. This essay delves into the key points from their conversation, exploring the profound insights and practical tools shared by Dr. Harris.

## The Essence of Meditation

Dr. Huberman began by sharing his initial understanding of meditation, which he believed was about deliberately changing one's conscious experience to achieve deeper relaxation, heightened focus, and improved memory. However, Dr. Harris introduced a more profound perspective, emphasizing that the greater value of meditation lies in its ability to allow individuals to view consciousness itself. This understanding transcends merely altering conscious states and opens a portal to novel ways of thinking and being.

## Consciousness and the Self

A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the concept of the self. Dr. Harris explained that the sense of self is often an illusion, a construct that can be deconstructed through meditation. He highlighted that people typically feel like they are a subject inside their body, particularly in the head, experiencing the world from this vantage point. However, meditation can reveal that this sense of a separate self is not as it seems.

## The Mind-Body Problem and Free Will

The conversation also touched on philosophical and neuroscientific concepts such as the mind-body problem and free will. Dr. Harris discussed how valuable experiments and deep thinking have led to a better understanding of what free will is and isn't, where it might reside in the brain, and what it means to be a conscious being. He emphasized that our perception of free will is often an illusion, and understanding this can lead to greater psychological freedom.

## Perception and Time

Dr. Huberman and Dr. Harris explored various aspects of perception, including visual, auditory, and time perception. They discussed how the brain's frame rate for processing conscious experience can expand and contract depending on one's state of mind. This elasticity in time perception can be influenced by meditation, allowing individuals to experience time differently.

## Practical Tools for Meditation

Throughout the discussion, Dr. Harris shared practical tools for meditation. He emphasized the importance of understanding that meditation is not about changing the contents of consciousness but about recognizing the nature of consciousness itself. He encouraged listeners to explore the Waking Up app, which he developed to help people establish a meditation practice.

## Psychedelics and Consciousness

The conversation also ventured into the realm of psychedelics, discussing their therapeutic applications for conditions like depression and PTSD, as well as their potential to expand consciousness. Dr. Harris shared his experiences with psychedelics and how they relate to meditation. He noted that while psychedelics can dramatically alter the contents of consciousness, meditation offers a way to understand the nature of consciousness without such drastic changes.

## Social Media and Consciousness

Prompted by Dr. Harris's recent decision to close his Twitter account, the discussion explored the impact of social media on consciousness. Dr. Harris explained that his departure from Twitter was driven by the realization that it was creating unnecessary conflict and distraction in his life. He emphasized the importance of reducing noise and distractions to achieve a clearer and more focused state of mind.

## Conclusion

Dr. Sam Harris's insights into meditation, consciousness, and free will offer a profound understanding of the human mind. By viewing consciousness itself and recognizing the illusion of the self, individuals can achieve greater psychological freedom and a deeper sense of well-being. The practical tools and perspectives shared in this discussion provide valuable guidance for anyone seeking to explore the depths of their own consciousness.
