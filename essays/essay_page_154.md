# How to Shape Your Identity and Goals: Insights from Dr. Maya Shankar

## Introduction

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Maya Shankar, a cognitive scientist, shared her insights on identity, goals, motivation, and change. Dr. Shankar's impressive academic background includes undergraduate training at Yale University, a PhD from Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and a postdoctoral fellowship in cognitive science at Stanford University. She has also served as a senior adviser to the White House and founded the White House Behavioral Science Team. Currently, she hosts the podcast "A Slight Change of Plans."

## Dr. Shankar's Journey

Dr. Shankar's journey is a testament to the power of resilience and adaptability. Initially, she was a student at the Juilliard Conservatory of Music, preparing for a career as a professional concert violinist. However, a career-ending injury forced her to reframe her life plans and identity. This pivotal moment led her to explore new avenues and ultimately achieve remarkable success in cognitive science and public policy.

## Understanding Identity

### Formation of Identity

Dr. Shankar emphasized that identity is often shaped by our observations and the labels imposed by those around us. This concept, known as identity foreclosure, can limit our mindset and aspirations. She highlighted the importance of actively overcoming these biases and limitations to achieve personal growth.

### The Role of Early Experiences

Our early experiences and the societal structures we grow up in play a significant role in shaping our identity. Dr. Shankar shared her personal story of how her identity was initially anchored to being a violinist. The loss of her ability to play the violin led to a profound loss of identity, a phenomenon known as identity paralysis. This experience taught her the importance of anchoring identity to deeper values rather than specific roles or activities.

### The Through Line

Dr. Shankar discovered that her true passion lay in forming emotional connections with others, a realization that transcended her initial identity as a violinist. This underlying drive for human connection has been a consistent theme throughout her diverse career, from cognitive science to public policy and podcasting.

## The Science of Identity and Change

### Cognitive Science Insights

Dr. Shankar discussed the significant changes the brain undergoes during adolescence, a period marked by a desire for independence and self-discovery. This developmental stage often involves questioning one's identity and trying on different roles and behaviors.

### Essentialism and Growth Mindset

She also touched on the concept of essentialism, the belief that people have immutable qualities. This mindset can lead to feelings of shame and hinder personal growth. Instead, Dr. Shankar advocates for a more flexible understanding of identity, recognizing that we are dynamic beings capable of change.

## Practical Tools for Shaping Identity and Goals

### Assessing Goals and Motivation

Dr. Shankar shared practical tools for assessing and aligning goals with one's identity. She emphasized the importance of understanding the deeper motivations behind our goals and ensuring they resonate with our core values.

### The Role of Feelings

Feelings can serve as both a compass and a distraction in decision-making. Dr. Shankar highlighted the importance of discerning when to trust our feelings and when to rely on more objective measures.

### The Science of Goal Setting

Dr. Shankar provided insights into effective goal setting, including the importance of framing goals in an approach-oriented manner rather than an avoidance-oriented one. She also discussed the significance of who sets the goals and the benefits of maintaining a sense of agency and control.

## Overcoming Challenges and Sustaining Motivation

### The Middle Problem

One of the key challenges in goal pursuit is maintaining motivation, especially during the middle phase. Dr. Shankar suggested strategies such as shortening the time duration of goals and using temptation bundling to pair unpleasant tasks with enjoyable activities.

### The Peak-End Rule

She also discussed the peak-end rule, which states that our memories of experiences are influenced by the most intense moments and the end of the experience. By ensuring that the end of a challenging task is less unpleasant, we can create more positive memories and increase the likelihood of repeating the task.

## Empathy and Its Role in Personal Growth

### Types of Empathy

Dr. Shankar introduced the concept of different types of empathy: emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, and empathic concern. Understanding these distinctions can help us cultivate empathy more effectively and protect against burnout.

### Empathy as a Tool for Change

Empathy can also be a powerful tool for personal growth and change. By understanding the perspectives and motivations of others, we can bridge empathy gaps and foster more meaningful connections.

## Conclusion

Dr. Maya Shankar's insights on identity, goals, and motivation offer valuable guidance for navigating life's challenges and pursuing personal growth. By understanding the deeper motivations behind our goals, maintaining a sense of agency, and cultivating empathy, we can shape our identity and achieve our aspirations.
