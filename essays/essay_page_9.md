# Using Failures, Movement & Balance to Learn Faster

## Introduction

In this essay, we explore the mechanisms of neuroplasticity and how specific behaviors can enhance our ability to learn and adapt. Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, is a fundamental aspect of how we learn and adapt to new experiences. This essay delves into the science behind neuroplasticity, focusing on the roles of errors, movement, and balance in accelerating learning.

## The Role of Errors in Learning

### Understanding Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change in response to experience. This ability is most pronounced in young individuals but continues throughout life, albeit at a slower rate. The brain's plasticity is driven by the release of specific neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine, which mark neural circuits for change.

### The Importance of Making Errors

One of the key insights into neuroplasticity is the role of making errors. Errors signal to the brain that something is not working correctly, triggering the release of neurochemicals that promote learning. This process is crucial for both motor and cognitive learning. When we make errors, our nervous system releases epinephrine (increasing alertness) and acetylcholine (enhancing focus), which help us to correct our mistakes and improve our performance.

### Incremental Learning

Research by Eric Knudsen and others has shown that incremental learning is essential for adults. Unlike young individuals who can make large shifts in their neural maps quickly, adults benefit from smaller, incremental changes. This approach involves making small errors and gradually adjusting behavior, which signals the nervous system to make the necessary changes.

## The Role of Movement and Balance

### The Vestibular System

The vestibular system, located in the inner ear, plays a crucial role in balance and spatial orientation. It helps the brain understand the body's position relative to gravity through three main planes of movement: pitch (nodding), yaw (shaking the head side to side), and roll (tilting the head). These movements are detected by the semicircular canals in the inner ear, which send signals to the brain to help maintain balance.

### Engaging the Vestibular System for Learning

Engaging the vestibular system through novel movements can enhance neuroplasticity. Activities that challenge our balance and spatial orientation, such as gymnastics, yoga, or even certain sports, can stimulate the release of neurochemicals that promote learning. The key is to create a sense of novelty and instability, which signals the brain to adapt and learn.

### Practical Applications

To leverage the vestibular system for learning, one can engage in activities that involve different orientations relative to gravity. For example, practicing inversions in yoga, trying new sports, or even simple activities like balancing on one foot can stimulate the vestibular system and enhance learning.

## The Role of Motivation and Contingency

### High Contingency Learning

Research has shown that the importance of a task can significantly impact the rate of learning. When there is a high contingency, such as the need to find food or achieve a critical goal, the brain releases more neurochemicals that promote plasticity. This means that the more important a task is to us, the faster and more effectively we can learn it.

### Subjective Reward and Dopamine

Dopamine, a neurochemical associated with pleasure and motivation, plays a crucial role in learning. By attaching subjective reward to the process of making errors, we can enhance the release of dopamine and accelerate learning. This involves recognizing the value of making mistakes and viewing them as opportunities for growth.

## Practical Strategies for Enhancing Learning

### Managing Limbic Friction

Limbic friction refers to the struggle to control our autonomic nervous system, whether we are too alert or too tired. To optimize learning, we need to manage our level of arousal. Techniques such as the physiological sigh (inhaling twice through the nose and exhaling once through the mouth) can help calm us down, while super-oxygenation breathing (inhaling more than exhaling) can increase alertness.

### Structuring Learning Bouts

For effective learning, especially in adults, it is important to structure learning bouts in a way that maximizes neuroplasticity. Short, focused sessions of 7 to 30 minutes, where we make deliberate errors and push through frustration, can create the optimal conditions for learning. These sessions should be followed by periods of rest or engaging in different types of learning to take advantage of the heightened state of plasticity.

## Conclusion

Understanding the mechanisms of neuroplasticity and how to leverage them can significantly enhance our ability to learn and adapt. By embracing errors, engaging the vestibular system, and managing our level of arousal, we can create the optimal conditions for learning. These insights not only apply to motor learning but also to cognitive and emotional learning, providing a comprehensive approach to personal growth and development.
