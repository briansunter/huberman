# How to Use Cold & Heat Exposure to Improve Your Health

## Introduction

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosted Dr. Susanna Søberg. Dr. Søberg completed her doctoral thesis at the Center of Inflammation and Metabolism and the Center for Physical Activity Research at the University of Copenhagen. Her research focuses on how deliberate cold and heat exposure can enhance human metabolism. This essay will delve into the key points discussed during their conversation, including the physiological effects of cold and heat exposure, the benefits of these practices, and practical guidelines for incorporating them into daily life.

## The Science of Cold and Heat Exposure

### Physiological Responses to Cold Exposure

When the body is exposed to an uncomfortably cold environment, several physiological responses are triggered. The sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to an increase in heart rate and the release of catecholamines such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters play a significant role in mood and metabolism. The cold shock response, characterized by hyperventilation and gasping, is a common initial reaction. However, with repeated exposure, the body adapts, and this response diminishes.

### Brown Fat Activation

One of the most significant findings in Dr. Søberg's research is the activation of brown fat through cold exposure. Brown fat, rich in mitochondria, is responsible for thermogenesis, the process of heat production in the body. This tissue is primarily located around the clavicles, neck, and upper back. Cold exposure stimulates brown fat, leading to increased metabolism and improved insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, even mild cold exposure, such as being outside in a T-shirt or sleeping in a cooler room, can activate brown fat.

### Heat Exposure and Its Benefits

Heat exposure, such as using a sauna, also offers numerous health benefits. It can activate heat shock proteins, which help repair damaged cells and improve overall cellular function. Regular sauna use has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and improved insulin sensitivity. The combination of heat and cold exposure can further enhance these benefits by creating a hormetic stress response, which strengthens the body's resilience.

## Practical Guidelines for Cold and Heat Exposure

### Cold Exposure Protocols

Dr. Søberg's research suggests that even short durations of cold exposure can yield significant health benefits. For instance, immersing the body in cold water for 1-2 minutes, 2-3 times per week, can activate brown fat and improve metabolism. The key is to reach a state of uncomfortable cold, which triggers the cold shock response and subsequent adaptation.

### Heat Exposure Protocols

Similarly, heat exposure through sauna use can be beneficial. Spending 10-15 minutes in a sauna, 2-3 times per week, can activate heat shock proteins and improve cardiovascular health. The optimal temperature for a sauna session is around 80 degrees Celsius. Alternating between cold and heat exposure, such as taking a cold plunge followed by a sauna session, can maximize the benefits.

### The Importance of Ending on Cold

One crucial principle highlighted by Dr. Søberg is the importance of ending on cold. After a sauna session, finishing with a cold plunge forces the body to generate heat internally, thereby increasing metabolism and prolonging the benefits of the exposure. This practice also helps maintain the activation of brown fat and enhances the overall hormetic response.

## Observations and Additional Benefits

### Psychological and Subjective Benefits

In addition to the physiological benefits, many individuals report psychological improvements from regular cold and heat exposure. These include enhanced mood, reduced anxiety, and improved sleep quality. The release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin during these practices likely contributes to these positive effects.

### Adaptation and Individual Differences

Dr. Søberg's research also highlights the variability in individual responses to cold exposure. Some people adapt quickly and experience less discomfort over time, while others may take longer to acclimate. Factors such as body size, composition, and baseline metabolic rate can influence these responses. Interestingly, women tend to have more brown fat than men, which may affect their adaptation and benefits from cold exposure.

## Conclusion

Dr. Susanna Søberg's research provides compelling evidence for the health benefits of deliberate cold and heat exposure. These practices can enhance metabolism, improve insulin sensitivity, and offer numerous psychological benefits. By incorporating short, regular sessions of cold and heat exposure into daily routines, individuals can harness these powerful natural stimuli to improve their overall health and well-being. As research in this field continues to evolve, it will be exciting to uncover even more insights into the mechanisms and benefits of these ancient practices.
