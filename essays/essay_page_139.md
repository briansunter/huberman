# Eye Health, Why We Yawn & Increasing Motivation

## Introduction

In this essay, we will explore various aspects of eye health, including protocols for maintaining and improving vision, the reasons behind yawning, and strategies for increasing motivation. The insights are based on scientific research and practical tools that can be applied in everyday life.

## Eye Health

### The Importance of Viewing Distances

One of the key factors in maintaining eye health is ensuring that you view objects at varying distances throughout the day. Modern lifestyles often involve prolonged periods of looking at screens or reading materials that are close to our eyes, typically between 9 inches to 2.5 feet away. This behavior is unprecedented in human history and has led to a significant increase in myopia (nearsightedness), especially among children and young adults.

To counteract this, it is crucial to spend time each day looking at objects that are farther away. Ideally, you should aim for several hours of long-distance viewing. This can be achieved by taking walks, engaging in outdoor activities, or simply looking out of a window. The goal is to balance the time spent on close-up tasks with time spent viewing distant objects.

### The Impact of Near and Far Viewing

The structure of the eye, particularly the lens and the length of the eyeball, is influenced by how much time you spend looking at objects at different distances. Studies have shown that if you predominantly look at objects up close during development, the eyeball lengthens, causing the visual image to land in front of the retina, leading to myopia. Conversely, farsightedness occurs when the visual image is focused behind the retina due to a shortening of the eyeball.

### Behavioral Protocols for Eye Health

1. **Balancing Near and Far Viewing**: For every hour spent looking at objects up close, aim to spend at least an hour looking at objects at a distance. This can help maintain the elasticity of the lens and the overall health of the eye.

2. **Outdoor Time**: Spending at least two hours a day outdoors can significantly reduce the incidence of myopia. The natural light and the opportunity to look at distant objects contribute to better eye health.

3. **Smooth Pursuit Tasks**: Engaging in smooth pursuit tasks, where you track a moving object with your eyes, can help maintain the musculature and flexibility of the eye. These tasks can be easily found on platforms like YouTube.

4. **Near-Far Exercises**: Holding a pen or pencil at arm's length and slowly bringing it closer to your eyes until it becomes blurry, then moving it back out, can strengthen the eye muscles and improve focus.

### Nutritional Support for Eye Health

1. **Vitamin A**: Essential for the phototransduction cascade, vitamin A can be obtained from dark green leafy vegetables and liver. Most people can get sufficient vitamin A from their diet, but supplements can provide additional support if needed.

2. **Lutein and Zeaxanthin**: Found in foods like egg yolks and certain fruits, these nutrients can help with age-related macular degeneration. While the data is still emerging, some studies suggest that supplementation can be beneficial.

### Red Light Therapy

Recent research has shown that exposure to red light early in the day can offset some age-related vision decline. Viewing red light for a few minutes each week can reduce reactive oxygen species in the photoreceptors, improving visual acuity.

## Conclusion

Maintaining eye health involves a combination of behavioral practices, nutritional support, and potentially new therapies like red light exposure. By balancing near and far viewing, spending time outdoors, engaging in specific eye exercises, and ensuring adequate intake of essential nutrients, you can support and even improve your vision over time.
