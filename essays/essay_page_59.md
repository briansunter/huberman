# The Science of Mindsets for Health and Performance

## Introduction

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosted Dr. Alia Crum, a tenured professor of psychology at Stanford University and the founder and director of the Stanford Mind and Body Lab. Dr. Crum's research focuses on how mindsets—our core beliefs and assumptions—shape our physiological and biological responses to various stimuli, such as food, stress, exercise, and medication.

## The Impact of Mindsets on Health

Dr. Crum's work reveals that what we believe about the nutritional content of our food can significantly alter how that food impacts our brain and body. This principle extends to exercise, stress, and even medication. For instance, recent studies from Dr. Crum's lab demonstrate that beliefs about the side effects of treatments can profoundly affect the speed and effectiveness of those treatments. One notable study by Lauren Howe showed that educating children about the side effects of peanut allergy treatments could significantly improve their treatment outcomes and reduce their suffering from side effects.

## Defining Mindsets

Dr. Crum defines mindsets as core beliefs or assumptions about a domain that orient us to a particular set of expectations, explanations, and goals. These mindsets simplify our complex reality by constraining the number of things we need to consider, thus shaping our motivation and physiological responses. For example, mindsets about stress can be either enhancing or debilitating, influencing how we react to stressful situations.

## The Milkshake Study

One of Dr. Crum's most famous studies, conducted during her time at Yale University, involved participants consuming milkshakes under different pretenses. Participants were told that one milkshake was high-calorie and indulgent, while the other was low-calorie and sensible. In reality, both milkshakes were identical. The study measured the participants' ghrelin levels, a hormone associated with hunger. The results showed that participants who believed they were consuming the high-calorie milkshake had a significantly greater reduction in ghrelin levels, indicating that their bodies responded as if they had consumed more food. This study highlights how our beliefs about food can influence our physiological responses.

## Mindsets and Exercise

Dr. Crum also explored how mindsets affect exercise. In a study involving hotel housekeepers, participants were informed that their daily work activities met the Surgeon General's recommendations for exercise. This simple reframe led to significant health improvements, including weight loss and reduced blood pressure, despite no changes in their actual behavior. This study underscores the importance of how we perceive our activities and their benefits.

## Stress Mindsets

Dr. Crum's research on stress mindsets reveals that our beliefs about stress can significantly impact our health and performance. In a study conducted with UBS employees during the 2008 financial crisis, participants who were exposed to videos emphasizing the enhancing aspects of stress reported fewer physical symptoms and better performance at work compared to those who watched videos highlighting the debilitating effects of stress. This finding suggests that viewing stress as enhancing can lead to more adaptive responses.

## Practical Applications

To leverage the power of mindsets, Dr. Crum suggests a three-step approach:

1. **Acknowledge Stress**: Recognize and be mindful of stress when it occurs.
2. **Welcome Stress**: Understand that stress is linked to things we care about.
3. **Utilize Stress**: Use the stress response to achieve goals rather than trying to eliminate stress.

## Influencers and Nutrition

Dr. Crum's lab has also investigated the role of social media influencers in shaping our mindsets about food. Studies show that influencers often portray unhealthy foods as exciting and desirable, while healthy foods are depicted as bland and depriving. This cultural narrative can significantly impact our food choices and perceptions. Dr. Crum advocates for a more mindful portrayal of healthy foods to shift public perception.

## Future Directions

Dr. Crum is currently focused on integrating mindsets into medical treatments to enhance their effectiveness. For example, in a study with children undergoing treatment for peanut allergies, reframing the side effects as positive signals of the treatment working led to better outcomes and reduced anxiety. This approach could be applied to various medical treatments to improve patient experiences and outcomes.

## Conclusion

Dr. Alia Crum's research highlights the profound impact of mindsets on our health and performance. By understanding and consciously adopting more adaptive mindsets, we can enhance our physiological responses and overall well-being. Her work invites us to reconsider how we approach stress, food, exercise, and medical treatments, emphasizing the power of our beliefs in shaping our reality.
