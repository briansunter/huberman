# The Science of Making & Breaking Habits

## Introduction

Habits play a crucial role in organizing our behavior into more or less reflexive actions, reducing the cognitive load required for daily activities. While some habits, like brushing our teeth or exercising at a specific time, serve us well, others can undermine our health and life goals. This essay delves into the biology and psychology of habit formation and breaking, offering practical tools grounded in neuroscience.

## The Biology of Habits

### Understanding Habits

Habits are learned behaviors that become automatic over time. Unlike reflexes, which are hardwired responses like blinking, habits are acquired through experience and repetition. Up to 70% of our waking behavior is habitual, supported by neural pathways, hormones, and other biological mechanisms.

### Neuroplasticity and Learning

Learning, or neuroplasticity, involves changes in the connections between neurons. When neurons fire together, they strengthen their connections, making certain behaviors more likely to occur. This process is essential for habit formation.

## Types of Habits

### Immediate Goal-Based vs. Identity-Based Habits

- **Immediate Goal-Based Habits**: These are habits aimed at achieving specific outcomes each time they are performed, such as exercising for 60 minutes.
- **Identity-Based Habits**: These habits are linked to a larger self-concept, like becoming a "fit person" or an "athlete."

### The Role of Dopamine

Dopamine, a molecule associated with motivation and reward, plays a critical role in habit formation. Different schedules of dopamine release can predict whether a habit will stick and how quickly it will form.

## The Timeframe for Habit Formation

A study by Lally et al. (2010) found that it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a habit, depending on the individual and the habit. This variability highlights the importance of understanding one's own limbic frictionâ€”the effort required to overcome states of anxiousness or lethargy.

## Measuring Habit Strength

### Context Dependence and Limbic Friction

- **Context Dependence**: How likely you are to perform a habit regardless of the environment.
- **Limbic Friction**: The effort required to engage in a habit, influenced by your state of mind and body.

### Automaticity

The goal of habit formation is to achieve automaticity, where behaviors become reflexive and require minimal effort.

## Tools for Habit Formation

### Procedural Memory Visualization

Visualizing the specific steps required to perform a habit can significantly increase the likelihood of executing that habit. This process engages the hippocampus and neocortex, facilitating procedural memory.

### Task Bracketing

Task bracketing involves neural circuits in the basal ganglia that become active at the beginning and end of a habit. This process helps in making habits context-independent and more robust.

## A Program for Habit Formation

### Dividing the Day into Phases

1. **Phase 1 (0-8 hours after waking)**: High levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine make this phase ideal for tackling high-friction habits.
2. **Phase 2 (9-14 hours after waking)**: Lower levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, with rising serotonin, make this phase suitable for less demanding habits.
3. **Phase 3 (16-24 hours after waking)**: Focus on low light, low temperature, and relaxation to consolidate learning and habit formation.

### A 21-Day System

1. **Set 6 New Habits**: Aim to perform 4-5 of these habits each day.
2. **Two-Day Chunks**: Break the 21 days into two-day segments to make the process more manageable.
3. **Assessment Period**: After 21 days, assess which habits have become automatic and which need more work.

## Breaking Habits

### Long-Term Depression

To break a habit, you need to weaken the neural connections that support it. This involves creating a temporal mismatch between the bad habit and a new, positive behavior.

### Practical Steps

1. **Identify the Bad Habit**: Recognize when you engage in the habit.
2. **Insert a Positive Behavior**: Immediately follow the bad habit with a positive behavior to disrupt the neural sequence.

## Conclusion

Understanding the biology and psychology of habits provides valuable insights into how we can form and break them. By leveraging tools like procedural memory visualization, task bracketing, and a structured 21-day system, we can make lasting changes in our behavior. Whether you're looking to adopt new habits or break old ones, these strategies offer a science-based approach to achieving your goals.
